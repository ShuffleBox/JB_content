00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is Linux Unplugged, Episode 5, for September 10th, 2013.

00:30.000 --> 00:41.080
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, Episode 5. This is the show, probably the only show, airing

00:41.080 --> 00:46.840
on a Tuesday that won't be talking about the new internet phone 5S, because we're Linux

00:46.840 --> 00:51.080
users. My name is Chris. My name is Matt. Hey there, Matt. Welcome back, man. Episode

00:51.080 --> 00:55.440
number 5. We've crossed the month mark. And we've got an interesting show coming up because

00:55.440 --> 00:58.680
we're going to try something new. Later on in the show, we're going to do a recap of

00:58.680 --> 01:02.120
DS9. Just because I've been re-embracing DS9, I thought this would be a good spot since

01:02.120 --> 01:07.000
we have a no-format show to just talk about it. And I grabbed some Clippy Clips. So we'll

01:07.000 --> 01:12.240
be talking about that later on. But up first, we've got some follow-up to last week's show.

01:12.240 --> 01:16.160
And also today, Linus was causing a ruckus on the internet. We're going to talk about

01:16.160 --> 01:20.280
that. And then maybe we'll kind of tuck and roll into a little chat about the NSA. It's

01:20.280 --> 01:24.160
been, these NSA topics have been blowing up on our subreddit and the Linux subreddit and

01:24.160 --> 01:28.080
on discussion forums. I think it's really particularly affecting Linux users because

01:28.080 --> 01:33.120
we're a little more savvy. And then one of our favorite companies, GOG, or Good Old Games,

01:33.120 --> 01:37.480
made a proclamation about their future Linux support. And it's not very good. So we'll

01:37.480 --> 01:41.520
talk about that. Not too much. No, no. Not too happy about that. But Matt, I thought

01:41.520 --> 01:46.280
maybe just, kind of just going to spring this one on you, okay? Okay. You and I have been

01:46.280 --> 01:49.880
debating. We're doing a Friday Linux action show this week. We're going to, because we're

01:49.880 --> 01:54.420
going to give you a little time off for the up-and-coming birthday. And I'm going to enjoy

01:54.420 --> 01:58.280
myself a Sunday off. So it's kind of, you know, just nice to just change it up from

01:58.280 --> 02:02.440
time to time. And we've been kind of debating like, well, what should we do as a topic?

02:02.440 --> 02:06.000
Because really Friday and Saturday are kind of the days that are used to put an episode

02:06.000 --> 02:09.080
of Linux action show together. Because there's a lot of work that goes into it. And so yeah,

02:09.080 --> 02:12.080
we're trying to find something that's going to basically be of interest, but at the same

02:12.080 --> 02:15.760
time, not create a problem. Right. Yeah. Cause there's other shows that have to be in production.

02:15.760 --> 02:20.420
So there's not like, there's a ton of time. And so we come up with two topics, this possible

02:20.420 --> 02:26.160
topics this week. And I like them both a lot. And obviously I'm particular to one, but I

02:26.160 --> 02:29.960
got to, I got to acknowledge maybe the rest of the audience wouldn't. So I thought maybe

02:29.960 --> 02:34.480
what we could do is put it to a straw poll. Like we put it to the audience right now listening

02:34.480 --> 02:38.760
live on the show and they vote on what the topic is on Friday, on the Friday edition

02:38.760 --> 02:42.040
of the Linux action show. What do you think? Are you down for that? I like that. I think

02:42.040 --> 02:45.520
that's a great democratic way to do it. All right. So not only can people bang suggest

02:45.520 --> 02:49.420
to help vote for a title in this week's episode, but now you're going to pick the big shows

02:49.420 --> 02:54.240
topic on Friday. I just put the straw poll in the show notes. Okay. Here are your topics.

02:54.240 --> 02:57.960
So you're ready to chat room. Your choices are on a Friday edition of the Linux action

02:57.960 --> 03:02.720
show. Should it be Trek meets Linux or taking great notes on Linux? So we have two topic

03:02.720 --> 03:06.320
ideas with that. Star Trek one is sort of like Star Trek meets Linux. Here's a bunch

03:06.320 --> 03:11.040
of great Star Trek themes, Star Trek apps, Star Trek oriented things around Linux sort

03:11.040 --> 03:14.920
of in just having fun with the fact that unplugged just kind of started the Star Trek segment.

03:14.920 --> 03:18.720
So in the big show we do a bunch of Star Trek related stuff in Linux, tons of fun there

03:18.720 --> 03:24.800
or should we focus in on taking great notes on Linux? There's a couple of different options

03:24.800 --> 03:29.000
out there. Some, some really, really good open source projects that are trying to tackle

03:29.000 --> 03:32.960
this and there, you know, to be fair, there's a lot of closed source competition like Evernote

03:32.960 --> 03:37.160
and uh, and you know, even things like Google drive can be kind of used for notes. So this

03:37.160 --> 03:41.200
is one of those things where, um, I think with school kind of starting back up, that

03:41.200 --> 03:44.960
could also be a popular topic. And also for people who are using Linux in the professional

03:44.960 --> 03:49.320
space or for people who just want to get a little more organized. Um, so kind of, you

03:49.320 --> 03:54.300
know, not that we wouldn't necessarily do one or the other down the road, but this Friday,

03:54.300 --> 03:57.040
just this Friday, you guys get to pick in the chat room and then we'll check back on

03:57.040 --> 04:00.560
this as we go right now, we've got only 12 votes, so we're going to let it, we'll let

04:00.560 --> 04:04.480
it flesh out for a while and then we'll check back in towards the end of the show. Although

04:04.480 --> 04:09.160
I got to tell you that sometimes early votes are an indicator. Yeah. Yeah. The warp speed

04:09.160 --> 04:13.240
heads pulling ahead right now is 69%. I wouldn't be surprised if it doesn't, uh, if it doesn't

04:13.240 --> 04:17.720
really, if the overall percentages don't change much. It could. Yeah. It's really going to

04:17.720 --> 04:20.640
be interesting to see where that plays out and I could be totally wrong and it could

04:20.640 --> 04:23.840
go the other way. If you're listening to the audio feed or something like that and you're

04:23.840 --> 04:31.240
not in the chat room, go to straw poll dot me and it's 42 1477 and then you can vote.

04:31.240 --> 04:35.240
And a part of the notes thing too, it's kind of in that getting off the other cloud services.

04:35.240 --> 04:39.160
So that might not, that could always be a topic we touch on in the future in the future.

04:39.160 --> 04:43.840
All right, Matt. Well, uh, this week, uh, I thought we'd kind of start with a Linus sort

04:43.840 --> 04:48.960
of lighting up the internet again, like he often does. He's got a sort of a way of word

04:48.960 --> 04:53.240
with words. You might say he's like a digital fart with a lighter. Sometimes he just lets

04:53.240 --> 04:57.240
one go and he just ignites it and it just happens. Right? Yeah. Yeah. Well, I'm not

04:57.240 --> 05:00.320
sure which part is the fart and which part is the lighter, but I think you might've gotten

05:00.320 --> 05:04.560
it. And some people just like the fart and lighter joke. Some people love a good fart

05:04.560 --> 05:09.120
and lighter joke. I personally do. I think I can watch that several times a day on YouTube.

05:09.120 --> 05:15.160
But, uh, before we get to that, and this is even better, this also is lighting the world

05:15.160 --> 05:20.540
on fire because friends, Ting is mobile that makes sense. Ting is my mobile service provider

05:20.540 --> 05:25.360
and Matt's are both rocking some pretty nice Android devices on Ting. And one of the great

05:25.360 --> 05:29.600
things about Ting is you only actually end up paying for what you use. And this is pretty

05:29.600 --> 05:34.240
powerful because often a lot of us geeks have multiple devices. Well, guess what? Unlimited

05:34.240 --> 05:37.840
devices on your account with a, with all with a pooled plan. So if you've got a family plan,

05:37.840 --> 05:41.480
a business plan, if you need to test multiple devices, if you're a developer or a support

05:41.480 --> 05:45.320
specialist, you need to have several types of devices. I used to have three Blackberries

05:45.320 --> 05:49.360
back when Blackberries rang during the reign of Blackberry. I still have a Blackberry.

05:49.360 --> 05:54.360
I still have my AT&T Blackberry. Now, thankfully back then, uh, I was an employee, so my work

05:54.360 --> 05:59.040
paid for it. Uh, but they were, they were, they were probably, um, they would have been

05:59.040 --> 06:03.280
a perfect company to take advantage of this plan for a small business that Ting has is

06:03.280 --> 06:06.600
first of all, they just break out your minutes, your text message and your megabytes and they

06:06.600 --> 06:10.160
bill you at the end of the month, whatever bucket you fall into. Okay. Well, so you know,

06:10.160 --> 06:14.440
if I don't use a device, I'm six flat dollars for that line. There's no guilt there. That's

06:14.440 --> 06:18.080
less than me buying two apps in the Android marketplace this week. I don't, I mean, I

06:18.080 --> 06:21.480
don't really have a big issue with that and I think it's a really fantastic way. We could

06:21.480 --> 06:24.560
have phones on standby. If you've got somebody going out in the field, you send a phone with

06:24.560 --> 06:28.040
them. If you need to test for the application you're developing on, you know, one of the

06:28.040 --> 06:32.240
things that we do here at Jupiter broadcasting is a ton of video streaming. Well, guess what?

06:32.240 --> 06:35.680
Video streaming behaves extremely differently on different mobile devices. You wouldn't

06:35.680 --> 06:40.240
think so, but it does. HLS support is a little spotty, so it's been, it's been nice from

06:40.240 --> 06:43.480
time to time to have multiple Android devices to test on. If we were going to go onto a

06:43.480 --> 06:47.160
big mobile push, this would be a must do and Ting really makes this possible. And if you

06:47.160 --> 06:53.320
go to linux.ting.com, you're going to save $25 off your first device or $25 off your

06:53.320 --> 06:56.560
first month. If you bring your own device, they've got a spot on their website that tells

06:56.560 --> 06:59.620
you all the different devices you can bring. If you've got a sprint phone, there's a good

06:59.620 --> 07:03.520
chance you can get it ported over and they'll tell you how that works. Now also, this is

07:03.520 --> 07:07.080
really interesting, they'll also sell you some used devices. They've got the LG Optimus

07:07.080 --> 07:11.520
Black for $68, that's not a bad entry Android phone. They've got a Ting personal shopper

07:11.520 --> 07:16.440
that will find you a device that meets your requirements. They've also got the LG Marquee

07:16.440 --> 07:21.720
Refurbished which is a great little like kid's phone for $87. It still plays all the modern

07:21.720 --> 07:24.860
Android games. You know, there's a lot of options they've got, new and used. And of

07:24.860 --> 07:30.960
course new, they've got the new, they've got the LG Optimus Purple which is a great deal

07:30.960 --> 07:37.280
after your discount supplies like $230, contract free with no early termination fee, no ride

07:37.280 --> 07:43.320
along services, nothing you wouldn't expect, just your rate that you pay and any taxes

07:43.320 --> 07:47.240
they legally have to charge. Ting is a really great and very transparent company. You should

07:47.240 --> 07:50.440
check out their blog too. They talk about a lot of the stuff and sort of the thought

07:50.440 --> 07:54.960
behind a lot of what they do. It's pretty cool. So go to linux.ting.com to save $25

07:54.960 --> 08:00.840
off your first device and thanks to Ting for sponsoring Linux Unplugged. Remember, people

08:00.840 --> 08:05.960
love Ting and I'm pretty sure you're people too. So it's a good fit. That's right. It's

08:05.960 --> 08:14.360
a good fit. All right, so Linus. Are you following like the NSA revelations that have come out

08:14.360 --> 08:19.840
regarding potential back doors into crypto standards? Have you caught any of this? It's

08:19.840 --> 08:23.740
kind of one of the more later revelations. Yeah, I've been following some of it. After

08:23.740 --> 08:27.140
a while it just almost becomes depressing. It does, right? But I've been passively following

08:27.140 --> 08:30.200
just so I'm at least. Yeah, and I've been interested too to see this stuff continue

08:30.200 --> 08:33.960
to roll out even though Syria has been dominating the headlines. This NSA stuff is still getting

08:33.960 --> 08:40.680
some coverage. Well, so about four days ago with 42 upvotes in our subreddit, this one

08:40.680 --> 08:46.120
hit the subreddit. NSA foils much internet encryption and this one's actually from the

08:46.120 --> 08:49.720
New York Times too which kind of gives it an extra little stamp of credibility because

08:49.720 --> 08:57.280
a lot of times the New York Times is almost an authorized leak in some senses. So this

08:57.280 --> 09:02.920
stirred up this big concern about the NSA working with standards bodies to sort of weaken

09:02.920 --> 09:07.960
the standards so that the NSA knew how to actively attack it and then foil that encryption.

09:07.960 --> 09:13.360
So it's sort of a, it's sort of a combination approach where the NSA is getting keys from

09:13.360 --> 09:17.640
some service providers so they just have the SSL key. So that's one way they can decrypt

09:17.640 --> 09:22.920
it. And it's also a combination of weak encryption, improperly implemented encryption and then

09:22.920 --> 09:28.720
encryption where they have influenced the standard in such of how it's performed. Now

09:28.720 --> 09:35.240
there's a device in Linux which will generate random numbers that you can use to seed like

09:35.240 --> 09:38.560
something new like a generation of a new key or something like that, right? And so the

09:38.560 --> 09:43.000
concern that the community came up with was that the standard that influenced how these

09:43.000 --> 09:47.420
random number generators was affected has been implemented in Linux. And so people were

09:47.420 --> 09:52.720
kind of like banging on Linus' door, Mr. Torvalds, could you please wake up and smell

09:52.720 --> 09:59.520
the coffee, Mr. Torvalds? Please. In fact, and I kind of agree with him, Vermunda in

09:59.520 --> 10:03.920
the subreddit said, it's time to start taking RMS seriously. For decades he's been warning

10:03.920 --> 10:09.960
us that this is what will happen if we court proprietary software and services to the detriment

10:09.960 --> 10:15.060
of privacy and freedom to express ourselves in an unfettered fashion, i.e. people buying

10:15.060 --> 10:21.480
these fancy smartphones that are essentially listening devices. In fact, in a separate

10:21.480 --> 10:28.780
report that ran, some new NSA slides came out about their ability to track smartphones.

10:28.780 --> 10:33.420
And they had three slides up where they were making references to how smartphone users

10:33.420 --> 10:37.800
are zombies, particularly they're making fun of the location bug that was in iOS that was

10:37.800 --> 10:41.760
keeping your location indefinitely. And the NSA was actively exploiting that. They knew

10:41.760 --> 10:48.640
about that and they were using that. And they had on a slide, they had 1984, who knew he

10:48.640 --> 10:52.680
would be big brother. And then a picture of Steve Jobs implying that the implementation

10:52.680 --> 10:57.360
of the iPhone has ushered in big brother. However, I believe that's a bit of a misdirection

10:57.360 --> 11:00.560
because really it's the NSA who's big brother. They're just exploiting that technology to

11:00.560 --> 11:04.320
do it. And they're exploiting Android and they also have an active group that exploits

11:04.320 --> 11:13.720
Blackberry. And so all of this has just made everybody explode. Has cryptology been sabotaged?

11:13.720 --> 11:18.360
Well and here's my view of it. There's two real important things to consider. For one

11:18.360 --> 11:24.320
thing, if someone wants in to a home or into a file or into whatever it may be, badly enough,

11:24.320 --> 11:27.800
they're going to get in. I don't care what you're using, how you're doing, it does not

11:27.800 --> 11:32.240
matter and we're seeing that now. At some level, the right people will be influenced,

11:32.240 --> 11:37.600
the right set of circumstances will be laid out and things will be overcome. So that's

11:37.600 --> 11:41.200
the problem I've always had with really getting heavy into the encryption and stuff like that

11:41.200 --> 11:45.920
is that it's great if you want to keep ISPs out of your back door, if you get my drift,

11:45.920 --> 11:49.420
but as far as the government, they're always going to find a way. It's just I don't see

11:49.420 --> 11:53.400
any way around that. I mean it's a novel idea that I would love to think happens, but we're

11:53.400 --> 11:57.760
a nation here in the States that has been very vocal in that, oh please, we're more

11:57.760 --> 12:02.560
than happy to trade our security and give you our freedom. We don't need that freedom.

12:02.560 --> 12:07.080
We want our security. We want ease of use. We want sexy phones. We want a fun experience.

12:07.080 --> 12:11.360
Security, we'll talk big about it, but we won't actually take it seriously. That's

12:11.360 --> 12:16.100
my opinion and that's why RMS has never really been taken seriously by the mainstream because

12:16.100 --> 12:18.400
it's not a sexy argument. It's not attractive.

12:18.400 --> 12:20.000
Right. They almost just don't really care.

12:20.000 --> 12:25.340
Yeah. I mean they do passively, but not enough to act on it. It's like you got to stop eating

12:25.340 --> 12:28.800
junk food. Well, I can do that. Wait a minute. You mean I can't have a Big Mac? It's that

12:28.800 --> 12:34.800
kind of mindset of you don't get to do those things that were enjoyable. It's a tough call.

12:34.800 --> 12:40.160
Right. You're right. Yeah. In some ways, it is all these warnings about sugar, about unhealthy

12:40.160 --> 12:48.520
lifestyles and yet here I am sitting 10 hours a day minimum, maybe more in my seat and not

12:48.520 --> 12:55.560
getting the right exercise and often cheating on a diet because I want to. Yeah, it is sort

12:55.560 --> 13:00.920
of the same. It is hard to have that same... It's almost the same kind of weakness

13:00.920 --> 13:02.680
in a sense.

13:02.680 --> 13:08.200
My solution honestly is a very simple one in that RMS is pretty much a hard line, hard

13:08.200 --> 13:12.120
direction. It's really a tough act to follow and it's tough to follow up on, but I think

13:12.120 --> 13:18.200
we can make personal choices and personal decisions in our life to minimize our participation

13:18.200 --> 13:22.200
in that kind of police state. We're not going to eliminate it. That's not going to happen.

13:22.200 --> 13:23.200
You can minimize that.

13:23.200 --> 13:25.040
Yeah. I don't think there's any going back really.

13:25.040 --> 13:30.080
No, but you can be aware of who you're voting for. Be aware of what you're participating

13:30.080 --> 13:31.960
in. Really be aware of it.

13:31.960 --> 13:36.300
My new campaign is unplug from the surveillance grid. Go local first. Whenever you can go

13:36.300 --> 13:41.160
local first, go local, unless it's not private. But there are enough people who started banging

13:41.160 --> 13:47.040
on Linus' door and there was a petition for him to remove the RD rand from dev random,

13:47.040 --> 13:51.920
which is where this implementation was that people are concerned about. It gets on Hacker

13:51.920 --> 13:57.100
News and Linus, which I believe this comment's now been deleted by him or by somebody, responded

13:57.100 --> 14:02.340
to this petition with, where do I start a petition to raise the IQ of kernel knowledge

14:02.340 --> 14:07.860
of people? Guys, go read the drivers of charrandom.c. Then learn about cryptography. Finally, come

14:07.860 --> 14:11.960
back here and admit to the world that you were wrong. Short answer, we actually know

14:11.960 --> 14:18.120
what we are doing. You don't. Long answer, we use RD rand and one of many inputs into

14:18.120 --> 14:23.920
the random pool and we use it as a way to improve that random pool. So even if RD rand

14:23.920 --> 14:29.160
were to be backdoored by the NSA, our use of RD rand actually improves the quality of

14:29.160 --> 14:33.320
the random numbers you get from dev slash random. And the really short answer, you're

14:33.320 --> 14:34.320
ignorant.

14:34.320 --> 14:35.320
God, I love Linus.

14:35.320 --> 14:42.520
And the great thing is, it's open. It's open code. So of course, shortly after that, people

14:42.520 --> 14:47.680
went and posted what they found right where Linus told them to look. And from the couple

14:47.680 --> 14:51.520
handful that I have read of people's take on it, they're all extremely impressed. They're

14:51.520 --> 14:55.320
like, oh yeah, these guys really knew what they were doing. And what it is, is what Linus'

14:55.320 --> 15:01.240
essential argument is, is even if they have one part of an implementation that has an

15:01.240 --> 15:08.760
NSA backdoor, it's one component in a chorus of data points that are used to generate something

15:08.760 --> 15:12.320
random. So it's not really a big deal.

15:12.320 --> 15:17.380
But people are still concerned about it. And I'm curious, I thought maybe we'd go over

15:17.380 --> 15:22.840
to our mumble room where we have a fine group of paranoids and ask anybody in here, you

15:22.840 --> 15:26.520
guys, are you concerned about NSA backdoors and Linux? And now that we know that maybe

15:26.520 --> 15:30.960
it doesn't have to be a code that's been compromised, but it's could just be a standard that a good

15:30.960 --> 15:35.360
programmer is following that's been compromised. What do you think of Linus' response? And

15:35.360 --> 15:39.880
are you concerned? I open it to the room. Floor is yours.

15:39.880 --> 15:42.400
No, nobody has anything.

15:42.400 --> 15:46.560
Well, to be honest, it's kind of hard to keep track of the live stream versus the...

15:46.560 --> 15:48.040
Oh, you guys are on delay.

15:48.040 --> 15:50.080
It is, it is. There's a bit of lag.

15:50.080 --> 15:51.640
You don't hear us in here?

15:51.640 --> 15:54.640
No, you mute yourself. I don't hear anything.

15:54.640 --> 15:57.760
All right. Well, I won't do that again. I'm sorry.

15:57.760 --> 15:58.760
I hear you now.

15:58.760 --> 16:02.720
Okay. So the question is, are you concerned about NSA backdoors because these standards

16:02.720 --> 16:07.160
have been influenced in Linux? And are you current on what Linus' response to all this

16:07.160 --> 16:10.720
was and what do you think of it? Was he over the top? Was he being too hard? A lot of people

16:10.720 --> 16:16.600
have said that this is redirecting the conversation from the actual concern about the NSA having

16:16.600 --> 16:21.920
a backdoor into a standard and the conversation is now about Linus' behavior.

16:21.920 --> 16:27.800
Typically, Linus has always been very direct, hasn't he? And very open with his comments

16:27.800 --> 16:34.200
that he's made in the past. But like, I have to touch on what Matt said. If anybody needs

16:34.200 --> 16:39.080
to get your information bad enough, they will get it regardless of what your cryptography

16:39.080 --> 16:47.200
is or security measures that you're using. So in a way, I kind of agree with Linus as

16:47.200 --> 16:48.200
well.

16:48.200 --> 16:52.920
Yeah, so do I. I mean, there's a lot of fud going on about this NSA thing as far as I

16:52.920 --> 17:00.560
understand it. And Linux users, despite their expertise, are not immune to fud. So that's

17:00.560 --> 17:05.840
the thing. I mean, Linus Torvalds built the kernel literally from scratch. He knows what

17:05.840 --> 17:11.040
he's doing. I think people should trust him more rather than just say that, oh no, he's

17:11.040 --> 17:15.120
sold out to the NSA and he's this and he's that. I think we need to trust the man who

17:15.120 --> 17:16.120
built this.

17:16.120 --> 17:19.680
Yeah, it is interesting that some people have said that Linus sold out to the NSA. People

17:19.680 --> 17:25.260
even said that Linus stepped in and pushed this NSA standard in when people were pushing

17:25.260 --> 17:31.600
against it. So there has been a bit of name calling in this whole thing and accusations.

17:31.600 --> 17:37.600
But I really don't think that Linus would sell out to anybody because he's very protective

17:37.600 --> 17:45.360
of the Linux kernel itself. And like Davos said, he built it from the ground up himself,

17:45.360 --> 17:50.840
more or less. And so I really don't think he would sell it out to anybody.

17:50.840 --> 17:55.000
Yeah. Okay, I'm kind of along the same lines. Any thoughts on that? Any more thoughts on

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
that one, Matt?

17:56.000 --> 18:01.360
No, I think everybody about covered it. I mean, at the end of the day, unless his family

18:01.360 --> 18:07.320
is being held in a bunker somewhere, I don't see him budging. And if that happens, we will

18:07.320 --> 18:13.000
on that moment send in a SWAT team of Linux ninjas to rescue his family so he can get

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
back to the kernel development.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.320
We could assemble it right here on Mumble.

18:15.320 --> 18:16.320
That's right.

18:16.320 --> 18:17.320
The rescue operation right here.

18:17.320 --> 18:18.320
You bet.

18:18.320 --> 18:20.600
Even if we have to wear monkey suits to do it.

18:20.600 --> 18:21.600
Absolutely.

18:21.600 --> 18:25.640
That could be our call sign. That could be our uniform. I like it.

18:25.640 --> 18:27.080
Monkey suit one, monkey suit two.

18:27.080 --> 18:30.720
All right, Mumble Room, thanks for the thoughts. Stand by. We'll have more here in a minute.

18:30.720 --> 18:36.160
So one story I want to touch on that just sort of hurts my heart deeply. It came up,

18:36.160 --> 18:39.600
but I didn't get a chance to talk about it in the Linux Action Show. I think it did come

18:39.600 --> 18:45.420
out before, let's see, it came out on the 7th. And today is the 9th, and last was...

18:45.420 --> 18:49.800
So yeah, it came out on Saturday. So Good Old Games made a public statement about their

18:49.800 --> 18:54.380
plans to support Linux. And Good Old Games is actually a former sponsor of the Linux

18:54.380 --> 18:58.240
Action Show, so that might have influenced some of this a little bit. The fact that they

18:58.240 --> 19:04.040
sponsored a Linux show might have maybe set the wrong expectation. But at the time, the

19:04.040 --> 19:08.080
point we were trying to make was that there's a lot of great DOSBox games that work too.

19:08.080 --> 19:12.920
So people continue to push GOG, and they say, quote unquote, for the foreseeable future,

19:12.920 --> 19:18.400
they don't plan to support Linux due to fragmentation. Here's the quote. And this is the head of

19:18.400 --> 19:24.560
PR speaking from Good Old Games. He says, for every game we release, we provide a money

19:24.560 --> 19:29.200
back guarantee. If we can't get the game working on the customer's computer with the

19:29.200 --> 19:33.520
help of our support team, we return the money. He goes on to say, the architecture of Linux

19:33.520 --> 19:38.040
with many common distros, each of them updating fairly often, makes this incredibly challenging

19:38.040 --> 19:42.400
for any digital distribution company to be able to properly test the game in question,

19:42.400 --> 19:47.600
and then provide support for the release, all of which our users are accustomed to.

19:47.600 --> 19:51.920
So no plans for the foreseeable future, because there's no way the economics of Linux support

19:51.920 --> 19:56.040
makes sense for us. Good Old Games is investigating how to do it in a variety of issues beyond

19:56.040 --> 20:01.240
Linux support, so don't give up hope, but just don't expect it tomorrow either.

20:01.240 --> 20:06.040
So here's my interpretation of it, like comparing them to, and this is a bad comparison, but

20:06.040 --> 20:11.120
it gives you an idea, comparing them to Steam, for example. Steam basically is a catch-all

20:11.120 --> 20:15.720
working with, if I'm understanding correctly, a multitude of different developers each developing

20:15.720 --> 20:22.120
their own games. GOG, if I'm understanding correctly, basically is not only the distributor,

20:22.120 --> 20:27.920
but is also porting these games so that they will run on the operating systems that they

20:27.920 --> 20:31.800
support. So basically, they're in charge of supporting multiple titles, where Steam

20:31.800 --> 20:36.120
is not. Steam is basically the distribution arm. That's really all they're...

20:36.120 --> 20:39.120
Okay. I mean, fair point. You're right. Good Old Games has a lot more hands-on gaming.

20:39.120 --> 20:45.060
They're not really porting so much. They're generally packaging it up maybe into an emulated

20:45.060 --> 20:48.600
environment and making it so it's just like a double-click experience, when in the past

20:48.600 --> 20:51.680
it was like load multiple CD-ROMs. Yeah, but you're right. They're more hands-on than Steam

20:51.680 --> 20:52.680
is in some ways.

20:52.680 --> 20:56.620
Absolutely. Yeah. So Steam's got off easy in the fact that the really deep development

20:56.620 --> 21:00.880
is the developer's problem, from what I'm understanding. And so for GOG, I can see it

21:00.880 --> 21:04.720
from their perspective of that, they're a completely different business model. I mean,

21:04.720 --> 21:10.460
there's no way that they can possibly go to that level. Now, backtracking a little bit,

21:10.460 --> 21:14.800
I do think that if they felt it was worth it, they could absolutely choose to support

21:14.800 --> 21:17.460
Ubuntu or OpenSUSE or whatever.

21:17.460 --> 21:21.660
Why not Ubuntu and these dozen games? Does it have to be... Because honestly, there's

21:21.660 --> 21:25.200
probably about 30 games I want to buy from GOG.

21:25.200 --> 21:29.660
And see, I think that they would need... If I was GOG, I'd say, look, we're not ready

21:29.660 --> 21:33.440
to make that financial investment, but at the same time, we don't want to drop the ball

21:33.440 --> 21:37.780
on you guys completely. We're willing to put in the man-hours to do maybe a Kickstarter

21:37.780 --> 21:41.440
campaign or something like that, something to kick some cash around.

21:41.440 --> 21:46.220
I think what your argument is, is quite reasonable. The problem is, when I read that, and I think

21:46.220 --> 21:50.740
a lot of people, just based on the reactions I've been seeing online is, when I read that,

21:50.740 --> 21:56.540
it honestly sounds ignorant of the market realities. Because I think... Now, I guess

21:56.540 --> 21:59.780
you can't quite say Steam has proven anything just yet, but what you...

21:59.780 --> 22:04.740
Because it really hasn't. I mean, it's been awesome at the beginning, but the stats are

22:04.740 --> 22:10.660
so messy that they're really hard to interpret. And when you're the numbers guy, the CEO can

22:10.660 --> 22:14.980
be amped all to hell, and he goes to the CFO, and the CFO is going, yeah, are you nuts?

22:14.980 --> 22:15.980
It's not going to happen.

22:15.980 --> 22:21.020
It just seems like to me, a lot of these developers, like we played the clip in last week where

22:21.020 --> 22:25.220
they said they want to move away from DirectX because they need to move away from Windows.

22:25.220 --> 22:29.540
We see Steam and Valve actively trying to push an alternative viable marketplace on

22:29.540 --> 22:34.140
Linux because they're concerned about Windows. Shouldn't good old game be kind of sitting

22:34.140 --> 22:38.180
in their seat right now going, gosh, we're making old DOS games, and we're making some

22:38.180 --> 22:42.800
of these old Windows 95, 98, and now beyond that, too. They also do new games now, too.

22:42.800 --> 22:47.380
But we're making a lot of these games to work on Windows, and that is moving fastly away

22:47.380 --> 22:49.660
from their target market.

22:49.660 --> 22:53.060
I think the problem is that they look at their existing numbers, and they're probably pretty

22:53.060 --> 22:58.280
comfortable with it, and they basically say, look, Steam is very much a bleeding edge company.

22:58.280 --> 23:01.420
They're really going for the bleeding edge. They're looking five years down the road.

23:01.420 --> 23:07.700
GOG is probably looking at next month and saying, eh, you know, when it's a problem,

23:07.700 --> 23:12.540
we'll address it, but why do this when we can let other folks pave the way? If it starts

23:12.540 --> 23:15.900
looking like the tide's shifting, we'll jump on board at that point.

23:15.900 --> 23:20.500
I can't necessarily – if I was a non-Linux user, I would totally agree with them. As

23:20.500 --> 23:25.540
a Linux user, I think it sucks, but as a non-Linux user financially, I get it for their business

23:25.540 --> 23:30.940
model because they're not like other development companies. They are very much – they have

23:30.940 --> 23:33.500
something they're comfortable with, and they see no reason to change that.

23:33.500 --> 23:34.500
And they're a smaller shop.

23:34.500 --> 23:37.300
They're a smaller shop, yeah, and they're just a totally different model.

23:37.300 --> 23:40.340
I would love to see like – you know, if they ever listen to this, if they ever hear

23:40.340 --> 23:46.620
this, here's Chris' advice to you. Pick your top five, ten games, focus them on Ubuntu,

23:46.620 --> 23:51.180
but do it in a way, like Steam has, where the community can step in and make it a flawless

23:51.180 --> 23:53.540
experience on their preferred platforms.

23:53.540 --> 23:59.420
I am an Arch Linux user, and I have never had a problem with a Steam game that is actually

23:59.420 --> 24:04.220
in full release. I've had games with very early games, and I understand as an Arch user

24:04.220 --> 24:07.420
that I might run into an issue at some point because the supported platform is Ubuntu,

24:07.420 --> 24:10.940
but I'm making that choice, and I'm still willing to throw my money at Valve even if

24:10.940 --> 24:12.660
I have some issues.

24:12.660 --> 24:17.040
So – and then I guess the other upshot to this is a lot of the GOG games work fine under

24:17.040 --> 24:18.040
VirtualBox.

24:18.040 --> 24:20.980
See, that's – and this is what I'm talking about. So when they're pitching this to their

24:20.980 --> 24:24.540
financial guy, the financial guy is going, but you can do it this way already, right?

24:24.540 --> 24:29.380
Yeah. Why are we having this conversation? It becomes a numbers pitch, and so the idealism

24:29.380 --> 24:33.780
goes right out the window, and it sucks, and I wish it didn't, but financially, that's

24:33.780 --> 24:36.580
probably where they're at. They're a small shop, and they're going, this financially

24:36.580 --> 24:37.900
doesn't make a lick of sense to them.

24:37.900 --> 24:42.580
All right. I could have predicted this outcome. You guys got to get in there and shake this

24:42.580 --> 24:47.620
out. The straw poll is split down the middle. Our audience is split on every single thing

24:47.620 --> 24:48.620
we ever do.

24:48.620 --> 24:49.620
Oh my gosh.

24:49.620 --> 24:53.260
It is always split down the middle on every topic, and here it is in living proof right

24:53.260 --> 24:58.020
here. 21 votes for – no, it's 20 votes for Star Trek.

24:58.020 --> 24:59.020
Uh-huh.

24:59.020 --> 25:02.820
Forty-nine – it's like – people got to go in there and vote.

25:02.820 --> 25:06.460
Just case scenario, if for some reason we find ourselves in a position to where it is

25:06.460 --> 25:09.580
literally a split tie, you and I each cast a vote.

25:09.580 --> 25:15.180
That's true. Yeah, that's true. Well, I think the chat room can help us here. Go to

25:15.180 --> 25:21.700
strawpoll.me, 42-14-77. Get it done, people. Get it done. It is in your hands.

25:21.700 --> 25:22.700
Yes.

25:22.700 --> 25:26.780
All right. Well, I want to spend a little time on email, because that's one of the

25:26.780 --> 25:28.460
main things that the show is kind of –

25:28.460 --> 25:31.180
Oh, yeah. That's what we're going to do for the show, right?

25:31.180 --> 25:35.740
There's been so many interesting things to dig into that we've been spoiled, really.

25:35.740 --> 25:40.780
However, this week, I set aside a bunch of emails ahead of time to make sure we got some.

25:40.780 --> 25:43.260
So I'm going to start with a couple. Are you ready?

25:43.260 --> 25:44.260
I'm ready.

25:44.260 --> 25:47.740
So the first one comes in from John. He says, hi, Chris and Matt. I caught some of your

25:47.740 --> 25:51.660
conversation today on Linux Unplugged. This is last week's episode. I just want to add

25:51.660 --> 25:56.780
my opinion that I agree Linux users can be cheap, but I think that most people who use

25:56.780 --> 26:01.260
software are cheap to an extent. Most people have a real life and real money concerns,

26:01.260 --> 26:04.420
and they don't want to pay for software if they don't have to. The only difference

26:04.420 --> 26:07.700
between Linux users and everyone else is that on Linux, there's a ton of functionality

26:07.700 --> 26:11.420
that's just given. That functionality is purchased on other platforms. I suspect that

26:11.420 --> 26:14.460
the reason why the Ubuntu App Store doesn't sell software is because people don't really

26:14.460 --> 26:19.420
need it. Same for Steam. Games, by nature, are a luxury. When people have money problems,

26:19.420 --> 26:20.420
games are not purchased.

26:20.420 --> 26:25.260
Now, for my other related topic. Linux needs more proprietary software. I posted this on

26:25.260 --> 26:29.580
Reddit. It may be a badly written post that I'm sick of not having important programs

26:29.580 --> 26:34.420
on Linux. I think talking about professional-grade, commercially-supported software that businesses

26:34.420 --> 26:39.780
have confidence in deploying. For me, in my field, engineering, this includes CAD software

26:39.780 --> 26:44.220
and simulation software. I think that it's a real reason why Linux is not taking off

26:44.220 --> 26:47.700
big time. I'm sure there are companies that would be willing to switch to Linux if they

26:47.700 --> 26:51.700
had their employees' workflow not broken. And just from a technical standpoint, I think

26:51.700 --> 26:54.820
that most people will agree that Linux is superior. The problem is the workflows are

26:54.820 --> 27:00.140
broken using Linux. He mentions he refers to Jupyter Broadcasting as a dependence on

27:00.140 --> 27:04.060
using a Hackintosh for our video editing. Anyways, I wanted to suggest somewhere within

27:04.060 --> 27:08.740
your domain, we could build a list of programs and brand names that your viewers need available

27:08.740 --> 27:15.260
on Linux to have completely working workflow. I was thinking that would be an interesting

27:15.260 --> 27:16.940
Wiki thing on the subreddit.

27:16.940 --> 27:18.460
That'd be fantastic, actually.

27:18.460 --> 27:24.260
Good thoughts. I do agree that Linux distributions have a lot of built-in functionality. Over

27:24.260 --> 27:27.660
the years of using Linux, I've purchased a good handful of software. I've definitely

27:27.660 --> 27:31.740
purchased more software for the commercial platforms even though I use them a lot less.

27:31.740 --> 27:36.740
Yeah, and see, for me, I found the opposite to be true. It's definitely made me more cost

27:36.740 --> 27:40.980
conscious. I'll go to other operating systems and look at software that I would have readily

27:40.980 --> 27:46.540
available in Linux and think, oh, wow, do people pay for that? It changed my expectations.

27:46.540 --> 27:50.460
But as far as what he was talking about with AutoCAD and things like that, proprietary

27:50.460 --> 27:55.460
applications at that that are available for their existing workstation and then asking

27:55.460 --> 27:59.780
them to drop that and then go to something that may not be as good on a Linux distro,

27:59.780 --> 28:04.100
I can understand where they're coming from. I think with Jupyter Broadcasting specifically,

28:04.100 --> 28:09.620
we use the operating system experience that's best for that particular need. We use a lot

28:09.620 --> 28:15.540
of Linux. We do use some OS 10, but we mostly, by and large, are using more and more Linux

28:15.540 --> 28:20.580
than we used to. I think that it doesn't have to be an all or nothing kind of situation.

28:20.580 --> 28:25.900
I think that you can, in fact, have your dedicated setups for what works best for that particular

28:25.900 --> 28:28.920
situation, but if someone's just working in an Office document, there's no reason why

28:28.920 --> 28:33.060
they can't, and we've seen this in other countries, to why they can't look at open

28:33.060 --> 28:34.060
source alternatives.

28:34.060 --> 28:40.660
Yeah, and I'll tell you, especially for Unplugged, as I've moved more production onto all of

28:40.660 --> 28:45.500
these audio-based shows, almost the majority, except for just clipping the ends, is done

28:45.500 --> 28:51.300
on Linux now. However, for the video shows, it's still not quite there yet, and I'll tell

28:51.300 --> 28:56.340
you though, as I've moved more of the work process over to the Linux box, it's so nice

28:56.340 --> 28:59.820
where like, okay, one of the things that's really kind of nice is there's so many ubiquitous

28:59.820 --> 29:04.300
ways on Linux to mount a file system, so like, if the easiest way for me to get to one box

29:04.300 --> 29:08.080
is NFS and on the other box where maybe I'm grabbing a source file off the Hackintosh,

29:08.080 --> 29:13.340
you know, maybe I'll do it because Samba sucks on Mac OS X so badly, but you know, on Linux,

29:13.340 --> 29:17.020
no bags, not a problem, not affected, I just do an SFTP mount and boom, I pull the files,

29:17.020 --> 29:21.300
like it's nice to have like, all of this extra versatility that is useful in Linux in general

29:21.300 --> 29:27.980
also is great in a production workflow, and I feel like I've made more of a custom workflow

29:27.980 --> 29:32.500
now because of the flexibility that gives me, like, it's kind of happened at around

29:32.500 --> 29:37.720
the same time that I'm implementing that storage system in the studio, so like, I've been able

29:37.720 --> 29:42.420
to integrate NFS at a much deeper level now into the production workflow, and it makes

29:42.420 --> 29:46.260
switching between the different systems so awesome, and BitTorrent Sync is now doing

29:46.260 --> 29:50.260
a lot of the lifting behind the scenes, so if I create an asset on the Hackintosh because

29:50.260 --> 29:55.340
I need motion, you know, there's an example of an application, Motion and After Effects,

29:55.340 --> 29:59.340
there's just literally nothing else to do, Blender is not, Blender is great, but Blender

29:59.340 --> 30:03.360
is not the type of, you know, Blender doesn't create what I need it to create to do our

30:03.360 --> 30:10.020
motion intros and things like that, but I can create that motion intro on a Hackintosh,

30:10.020 --> 30:14.200
export it out onto the NFS share, Bob's your uncle, I open up on the Linux box, and now

30:14.200 --> 30:19.580
I'm slapping it down and I'm good to go, so it's getting easier to move between them,

30:19.580 --> 30:23.060
but it's definitely, there's certain things that are locked up into different operating

30:23.060 --> 30:28.020
systems, but with a common backend file system, and a common name working space for everything

30:28.020 --> 30:32.740
where everything can, you know, knows how to connect to each other, it kind of just,

30:32.740 --> 30:38.540
it really feels like, well that's not so much a Mac, that's the motion output machine, right?

30:38.540 --> 30:39.540
Exactly.

30:39.540 --> 30:43.540
It's like this, it's almost like if I'm in a shop, like you've got machines that puts

30:43.540 --> 30:46.460
airs in, you've got machines that puts air in tires, and you've got machines that take

30:46.460 --> 30:51.140
oil out, you know, you've got all these different, that's what it feels like to me, and...

30:51.140 --> 30:54.460
Well it's like a POS system, sometimes they run Linux, sometimes they run other stuff,

30:54.460 --> 30:55.700
you don't care, it's a POS system.

30:55.700 --> 30:59.140
It really is, it really is an appliance, like if I look at it right now, you know, this

30:59.140 --> 31:04.900
thing is running OS 10 7.4, it's never once been, nothing on it has, except for some of

31:04.900 --> 31:08.620
the applications, but like none of the operating systems, none of the main production software

31:08.620 --> 31:13.060
has been updated since the moment it went into production, because that is generally

31:13.060 --> 31:16.940
how it works in a business, you get a stable functioning system, and because I don't have

31:16.940 --> 31:21.060
to do security updates on Final Cut, it's not a huge issue, you get a stable workflow

31:21.060 --> 31:23.980
where everything's compatible, and all the scripts work with everything, where everything

31:23.980 --> 31:28.500
goes out, all that kind of stuff, you just, it becomes an appliance in a lot of ways.

31:28.500 --> 31:29.500
Exactly.

31:29.500 --> 31:34.220
So, I move on, but thanks John for the email, Zaytech wrote in, he said, I did not see this

31:34.220 --> 31:37.200
addressed in Linux Unplugged, so I'm just going to send it in to you guys.

31:37.200 --> 31:41.140
As for Linux users that are cheap, I would say, yeah, that's why we picked a free OS,

31:41.140 --> 31:42.140
and love it.

31:42.140 --> 31:45.420
Not much Linux users are able to completely give up Windows either, and that's where the

31:45.420 --> 31:47.660
wallet drains go.

31:47.660 --> 31:51.980
I have, however, been running Linux, and only Linux for four years, and now I've decided

31:51.980 --> 31:55.220
that the money that would have gone to some big corporations will go to small shops and

31:55.220 --> 31:58.200
give them something at a good, they give me something at a good price.

31:58.200 --> 32:03.660
These are one way that Linux users spend money, and that may not be properly accounted for.

32:03.660 --> 32:11.020
I donated to several products, and bought a new, oh, the LN Sync, which is a great Google

32:11.020 --> 32:14.300
Drive client, and I'm also addicted to purchasing the humble bundles.

32:14.300 --> 32:17.860
Also, my netbook just died, so I'm going to get a System76 machine soon.

32:17.860 --> 32:19.700
He's got to work out some shipping problems.

32:19.700 --> 32:20.900
Well, they can help you with that.

32:20.900 --> 32:23.100
Love the show, hope to chat with you on Mumble someday.

32:23.100 --> 32:24.500
Well, I wonder if he's on Mumble right now.

32:24.500 --> 32:25.500
I don't know.

32:25.500 --> 32:26.500
Yeah, that'd be awesome.

32:26.500 --> 32:27.500
That'd be a good time for it, you know.

32:27.500 --> 32:28.500
We'll see him on there.

32:28.500 --> 32:29.500
All right.

32:29.500 --> 32:33.380
We'll get to our last email, or actually, it's not our last email, our second to last

32:33.380 --> 32:34.380
or so.

32:34.380 --> 32:35.380
Hi, Matt and Chris.

32:35.380 --> 32:39.740
You were talking about a lot about self-hosted cloud storage, e.g. ownCloud and BitTorrent

32:39.740 --> 32:45.780
Sync, but you never talked about the open source tool C-File, which is at C-File, S-E-A-F-I-L-E.com.

32:45.780 --> 32:49.060
It uses a version control model similar to Git.

32:49.060 --> 32:53.740
While ownCloud sucks at syncing a lot of small files, C-File is rock solid in this area.

32:53.740 --> 32:54.740
Maybe you should have a look at it.

32:54.740 --> 32:56.540
Greetings, Marcel, from Germany.

32:56.540 --> 32:57.540
Interesting.

32:57.540 --> 33:00.460
I haven't checked out C-File yet, but that's like the second or third person who sent in

33:00.460 --> 33:03.860
an email kind of recommending it, so you might have to check into that.

33:03.860 --> 33:04.860
Yeah.

33:04.860 --> 33:07.580
I would be curious to hear people's experiences with it.

33:07.580 --> 33:11.540
I'm pretty happy though now with my current implementation.

33:11.540 --> 33:14.020
It's going to be hard to break me away from that.

33:14.020 --> 33:17.540
We also, in the subreddit, somebody sent in a service that looks pretty interesting.

33:17.540 --> 33:21.220
I don't know about the security, so I'm not going to say I vouch for it, but the concept

33:21.220 --> 33:22.560
is pretty cool.

33:22.560 --> 33:25.100
It was a BitTorrent Sync remote storage.

33:25.100 --> 33:28.620
It was submitted by Army One, or Army, I guess.

33:28.620 --> 33:29.620
It's incloudably.com.

33:29.620 --> 33:44.740
They do a whole bunch of DDOS protection and storage stuff, but one of the products they

33:44.740 --> 33:49.740
are offering now is like, you can go buy it, is a BitTorrent Sync remote hosted.

33:49.740 --> 33:54.340
They are reselling a sync dump location, and you use that as backup.

33:54.340 --> 33:58.940
And now the transfer is AES-256 encrypted, but I don't know what the storage is, where

33:58.940 --> 34:01.940
Spider Oak is pretty explicit about that.

34:01.940 --> 34:02.940
So I don't know.

34:02.940 --> 34:03.940
You can check it out.

34:03.940 --> 34:04.940
We have a link to that in the subreddit.

34:04.940 --> 34:05.940
It's worth checking out.

34:05.940 --> 34:08.300
I mean, like I said, we can't necessarily recommend it, but it's certainly worth investigating

34:08.300 --> 34:09.300
on your own accord.

34:09.300 --> 34:13.820
Now, the big question, Matt, before we get to the poll, actually, maybe we'll save the

34:13.820 --> 34:15.260
poll for the end of the DS9 stuff.

34:15.260 --> 34:16.260
I don't know.

34:16.260 --> 34:17.260
We'll see.

34:17.260 --> 34:18.260
I don't know.

34:18.260 --> 34:19.260
We'll see.

34:19.260 --> 34:20.260
If people want to go do one more vote, you guys get a chance, if anybody wouldn't mind

34:20.260 --> 34:21.260
pasting that link in the chat room.

34:21.260 --> 34:25.940
Now, the big question of the day, what is Chris going to wear on Monkey Suit Day?

34:25.940 --> 34:27.700
Oh, my goodness.

34:27.700 --> 34:28.860
So this is a great question.

34:28.860 --> 34:32.740
So for those of you that aren't aware, I have a birthday wish list that's been put out there

34:32.740 --> 34:35.620
on Amazon, and one of the items on there was, in fact-

34:35.620 --> 34:36.620
Which is at matthartley.com.

34:36.620 --> 34:37.620
Oh, yeah.

34:37.620 --> 34:38.620
It was at-

34:38.620 --> 34:39.620
That's right, matthartley.com.

34:39.620 --> 34:40.780
There's still plenty of stuff on there.

34:40.780 --> 34:44.540
I'm desperately trying to get the zone alarm stuff put together, or zone minder stuff put

34:44.540 --> 34:45.540
together.

34:45.540 --> 34:46.540
Yeah.

34:46.540 --> 34:47.540
That'd be a great segment.

34:47.540 --> 34:48.540
Oh, and I've got an idea for that.

34:48.540 --> 34:49.540
I'll get to it later.

34:49.540 --> 34:52.100
Now, getting back to the monkey suit, and I don't want to take away from that.

34:52.100 --> 34:56.180
So the monkey suit was on the list, and that was totally more for you guys than it was

34:56.180 --> 34:59.180
for me, because I'm basically just going to sit and sweat in this thing.

34:59.180 --> 35:02.360
But I put it out there, and sure enough, someone did pick that up, and that's awesome.

35:02.360 --> 35:05.200
And what we're trying to figure out now is, I'm going to be wearing this for both Halloween

35:05.200 --> 35:07.220
as well as later on in 2014.

35:07.220 --> 35:10.820
Well, so is that a good idea, though, or should you save it for the big event?

35:10.820 --> 35:16.420
Because it's kind of like seeing the bride before the wedding.

35:16.420 --> 35:17.860
I think they've been patient enough.

35:17.860 --> 35:18.860
I'm willing to do it.

35:18.860 --> 35:20.220
It's going to be fun for Halloween to do.

35:20.220 --> 35:21.220
Okay.

35:21.220 --> 35:22.220
You're right.

35:22.220 --> 35:23.220
Is the episode on Halloween?

35:23.220 --> 35:24.220
Or is it?

35:24.220 --> 35:27.420
I don't know where it falls, but I think it'd be kind of fun to do.

35:27.420 --> 35:28.420
Okay.

35:28.420 --> 35:29.420
All right.

35:29.420 --> 35:30.420
And I did throw that out there.

35:30.420 --> 35:31.420
Well, I should wear a costume if it's on Halloween.

35:31.420 --> 35:32.420
I mean, that's just-

35:32.420 --> 35:33.420
Well, a few people suggested banana.

35:33.420 --> 35:34.420
That seemed a little-

35:34.420 --> 35:35.420
Oh, man.

35:35.420 --> 35:36.420
That seemed a little phallic and strange.

35:36.420 --> 35:38.300
So I decided to maybe sidetrack off that.

35:38.300 --> 35:42.500
Maybe go for another, I don't know, not sure what a good alternative would be.

35:42.500 --> 35:43.500
So maybe we should put it to a vote.

35:43.500 --> 35:44.500
Oh, okay.

35:44.500 --> 35:45.500
All right.

35:45.500 --> 35:46.500
Well, we'll have to come up with options.

35:46.500 --> 35:50.340
We'll have to come up with options and see where everybody falls down.

35:50.340 --> 35:51.500
You know, a Tux penguin would be cool.

35:51.500 --> 35:54.700
I wonder if there's a Tux penguin.

35:54.700 --> 35:59.580
If you guys find good costumes on Amazon, link them to us in the... Okay, so we put

35:59.580 --> 36:05.060
the feedback thread in the subreddit for this show in the comments in there.

36:05.060 --> 36:06.340
If you guys find it, put it in there.

36:06.340 --> 36:08.780
Or I guess you could submit it to mattmonkeysuit.

36:08.780 --> 36:12.980
So go to reddit.com slash r slash mattmonkeysuit or mattmonkeysuit.reddit.com.

36:12.980 --> 36:14.820
Yeah.

36:14.820 --> 36:15.820
Someone made a subreddit.

36:15.820 --> 36:16.820
Yeah.

36:16.820 --> 36:17.820
So I appeared in there.

36:17.820 --> 36:18.820
It's like, all right.

36:18.820 --> 36:19.820
That's cool.

36:19.820 --> 36:20.820
Oh, wow.

36:20.820 --> 36:22.620
Well, I like that big clock they got of you up there, too.

36:22.620 --> 36:23.620
That's awesome.

36:23.620 --> 36:24.620
Okay.

36:24.620 --> 36:28.140
So I think maybe what we'll do is since we're going to get into a bunch of Star Trek stuff-

36:28.140 --> 36:29.140
Yeah.

36:29.140 --> 36:31.140
Oh, I know where you're going with this.

36:31.140 --> 36:32.140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

36:32.140 --> 36:36.060
I have a few clips I want to play to kind of warm us up.

36:36.060 --> 36:39.060
But I think maybe we should let the Linux... People who don't want to talk about Star

36:39.060 --> 36:41.540
Trek, maybe we'll just say, okay, this is where you can sign out.

36:41.540 --> 36:46.640
So I'll leave you with a couple, if you're going to leave us and not join us for the

36:46.640 --> 36:51.100
awesome DS9 chat that is about to ensue, I want to let you know that you can contact

36:51.100 --> 36:55.820
us by emailing us at linuxactionshow at jupiterbroadcasting.com or popping the contact link at the top of our

36:55.820 --> 37:00.880
site or even better, we got that subreddit over at linuxactionshow.reddit.com and we'd

37:00.880 --> 37:02.020
love to have you join us over there.

37:02.020 --> 37:10.500
The unplugged show is live at 2 PM Pacific, which is 9 PM UTC over at jblive.tv and jblive.info.

37:10.500 --> 37:11.500
That's the audio stream.

37:11.500 --> 37:14.980
We've got the mobile versions of that and don't forget to go to linux.ting.com to save

37:14.980 --> 37:16.940
yourself something.

37:16.940 --> 37:21.980
And yes, I think that's probably all the business to cover before we get into the Star Trek

37:21.980 --> 37:22.980
stuff.

37:22.980 --> 37:24.860
But I just wanted to say officially, we are now getting into the Star Trek stuff.

37:24.860 --> 37:27.720
We will unveil the poll at the end of the Star Trek stuff.

37:27.720 --> 37:30.740
So you guys still have a chance to vote on the poll though, so we're not all Star Trek

37:30.740 --> 37:31.740
stuff.

37:31.740 --> 37:32.740
Okay, Matt.

37:32.740 --> 37:33.740
All right.

37:33.740 --> 37:37.620
So last week I said, hey, you know, I've kind of been getting into DS9 and trying to find

37:37.620 --> 37:39.780
where it fits in my Star Trek lineup.

37:39.780 --> 37:45.620
I've been questioning my Voyager-ness and my DS9s lately, and after just recently rewatching

37:45.620 --> 37:50.300
a lot of TNG because they went on Blu-ray, I felt like it was perhaps the greatest Star

37:50.300 --> 37:51.300
Trek of all time.

37:51.300 --> 37:58.860
And then I thought, well, I really can't make that declaration without digging into DS9.

37:58.860 --> 38:01.660
And so I should have waited until the DS9 Blu-rays came out, but I just decided we had

38:01.660 --> 38:02.660
to go into it.

38:02.660 --> 38:09.080
Oh, by the way, just a quick mention, NextUIs is working on a Samsung Smart TV app.

38:09.080 --> 38:10.080
How cool is that?

38:10.080 --> 38:11.080
Whoa!

38:11.080 --> 38:15.040
Yeah, so people have Samsung Smart TVs, which has got to be a lot of people, I would think.

38:15.040 --> 38:20.420
We'll soon be able to watch the Jupiter broadcasting goodness on the Samsung TVs.

38:20.420 --> 38:21.420
So thanks to NextUIs.

38:21.420 --> 38:23.420
We'll give you guys a heads up when it gets that.

38:23.420 --> 38:25.900
Okay, so we decided to pick Emissary.

38:25.900 --> 38:27.740
That's DS9 season one, episode one.

38:27.740 --> 38:30.340
This is actually a two-parter, so it's actually episode one and two.

38:30.340 --> 38:33.300
So next week we'll be watching episode three, technically.

38:33.300 --> 38:36.860
I thought maybe I could just give you a little bit of trivia about this episode before we

38:36.860 --> 38:37.860
got rolling, okay?

38:37.860 --> 38:38.860
All righty.

38:38.860 --> 38:42.100
This is in tradition of one of my favorite podcasts, Mission Log, which if you guys are

38:42.100 --> 38:45.280
Star Trek fans, go listen to Mission Log podcast.

38:45.280 --> 38:46.420
So a little trivia.

38:46.420 --> 38:47.420
Did you know?

38:47.420 --> 38:48.420
Bet you didn't.

38:48.420 --> 38:51.180
The sequence of Dax and Sisko within the wormhole where they're flying through the wormhole

38:51.180 --> 38:57.660
was actually one of the last sequences filmed, and that was filmed on October 24th, 1992.

38:57.660 --> 38:59.300
This is the 20th anniversary.

38:59.300 --> 39:02.740
This year is the 20th anniversary of Deep Space Nine.

39:02.740 --> 39:03.740
By the way-

39:03.740 --> 39:04.740
Hard to believe, isn't it?

39:04.740 --> 39:05.740
Yeah, it really is.

39:05.740 --> 39:10.740
By the way, this is the only episode where in the intro, they don't show the wormhole

39:10.740 --> 39:13.220
because they didn't want to give it away in the opening credits.

39:13.220 --> 39:14.220
Right, right.

39:14.220 --> 39:19.640
So in the opening credits, it's all just stars, and then in syndication later on, and in some

39:19.640 --> 39:22.380
foreign language versions, they just went right to wormhole.

39:22.380 --> 39:26.180
But in the intro credits for this episode, there is no wormhole.

39:26.180 --> 39:31.540
So also for the scene depicting Sisko where he's idling in the wormhole with the prophets,

39:31.540 --> 39:34.620
you know that really super crazy white effect they had?

39:34.620 --> 39:38.300
The director of photography used diffusion filters and overexposed the image as to achieve

39:38.300 --> 39:45.240
the effect of the white bleeding into Sisko's skin, and the big number here, 250 special

39:45.240 --> 39:49.380
effect shots were created for this episode of Star Trek, Deep Space Nine.

39:49.380 --> 39:53.940
And one of the things that's quite interesting about Deep Space Nine is... Oh, I'm going

39:53.940 --> 39:59.100
to have to... I'll see, can I... Well, I have to mute... Sorry, Mumble Room, I have

39:59.100 --> 40:04.020
to mute you guys again because I have to play some clips, but we'll be back soon.

40:04.020 --> 40:08.780
One of the things that is pretty interesting about Deep Space Nine is it actually opens

40:08.780 --> 40:14.880
... The first lines spoken are by Picard, which means Picard opens TNG and Deep Space

40:14.880 --> 40:15.880
Nine.

40:15.880 --> 40:16.880
Resistance is futile.

40:16.880 --> 40:29.340
You will disarm your weapons and escort us to sector 001.

40:29.340 --> 40:33.420
If you attempt to intervene, we will destroy you.

40:33.420 --> 40:36.020
So, pretty epic opening just right there.

40:36.020 --> 40:40.660
That's the first line spoken in this episode, and they're Lekutis, which is one of the strongest

40:40.660 --> 40:42.540
moments in Star Trek The Next Generation.

40:42.540 --> 40:44.500
The Borg were huge during this time.

40:44.500 --> 40:45.500
Oh, yeah, it was big time.

40:45.500 --> 40:46.500
Big time stuff.

40:46.500 --> 40:47.500
So, DS, that's a strong opening.

40:47.500 --> 40:49.780
You open with the Borg, you open big, right?

40:49.780 --> 40:51.940
And it moves quick.

40:51.940 --> 40:52.940
It moves quick.

40:52.940 --> 40:58.840
What was important about that entire piece right there is that it not only established

40:58.840 --> 41:05.980
the interchange between TNG and this now new show, but it also helped in critical important

41:05.980 --> 41:09.860
character building for Cisco, his history and so on and so forth.

41:09.860 --> 41:10.860
It was a big deal.

41:10.860 --> 41:15.820
It's really, and it's an interesting way to intertwine into Trek lore a really pivotal

41:15.820 --> 41:20.380
moment with the new character to really make those universes come together.

41:20.380 --> 41:24.220
And of course, these first few moments are pivotal throughout the entire episode.

41:24.220 --> 41:26.180
They come back to it over and over again.

41:26.180 --> 41:31.780
And one of the things that honestly, at this time, I remember, and I was curious to see

41:31.780 --> 41:34.460
if it would have the same effect now.

41:34.460 --> 41:37.820
After watching this, I really didn't like the character of Cisco.

41:37.820 --> 41:41.380
And one of the things that put me off about Cisco is he seemed a lot more concerned about

41:41.380 --> 41:43.180
his wife than his whole crew.

41:43.180 --> 41:47.260
I mean, he's supposed to be the commander of this ship, of his crew, or even of his

41:47.260 --> 41:48.260
son.

41:48.260 --> 41:49.260
Jennifer?

41:49.260 --> 41:50.260
Jake!

41:50.260 --> 41:51.260
Warning.

41:51.260 --> 41:52.260
Damage to warp core.

41:52.260 --> 41:53.260
Containment failure in three minutes.

41:53.260 --> 41:58.260
I'm going to get your mom.

41:58.260 --> 42:04.260
You're going to be okay.

42:04.260 --> 42:05.260
Jennifer!

42:05.260 --> 42:06.260
Okay, Jake.

42:06.260 --> 42:11.260
We'll get your mom out, and we'll get out of here.

42:11.260 --> 42:12.260
Commander!

42:12.260 --> 42:13.260
Help me!

42:13.260 --> 42:14.260

42:20.260 --> 42:21.260

42:23.260 --> 42:24.260

42:24.260 --> 42:25.260
Jennifer, hold on.

42:25.260 --> 42:26.260
Sir!

42:26.260 --> 42:27.260
Just help me to get her free!

42:27.260 --> 42:28.260
She's gone!

42:28.260 --> 42:29.260
There's nothing we can do.

42:29.260 --> 42:34.260
We have to leave!

42:34.260 --> 42:39.260
Warning.

42:39.260 --> 42:44.260
Damage to warp core.

42:44.260 --> 42:49.260
Containment failure in two minutes.

42:49.260 --> 43:05.500
And then they abandon ship and he's this whole time as the commander of a starship he's completely

43:05.500 --> 43:09.260
worthless like they're dragging him to the ship he's he's not helping he's not giving

43:09.260 --> 43:14.360
any orders he's completely incapacitated well so here's the thing that and I and I heard

43:14.360 --> 43:17.840
other people mention similar things but they don't take into account remind me again how

43:17.840 --> 43:22.340
many other captains in the Star Trek series various series were married and had their

43:22.340 --> 43:26.500
spouses on the ship yeah yeah and I didn't Kirk didn't and so we never got to see that

43:26.500 --> 43:30.860
side of them well and actually yeah it was until this episode it had only been established

43:30.860 --> 43:34.700
the galaxy class vessels had children on them that's right and this this was the first time

43:34.700 --> 43:40.360
we'd seen a non-galaxy class now you know and also look back at Picard with TNG remember

43:40.360 --> 43:45.700
when he thought he had a son right right yeah yeah what how quickly he his whole mindset

43:45.700 --> 43:50.660
of everything just did a 180 completely changed so I mean realistically yeah my wife and I

43:50.660 --> 43:54.700
have days where we want to kill each other but you put us on a ship and if it's between

43:54.700 --> 44:00.300
my crew my and my wife it's been fun crew but you know what you know I think I see that

44:00.300 --> 44:04.180
now see at the time when I was watching this I still feel like he's a little dismissive

44:04.180 --> 44:09.000
with the kid like the kids oh yeah here you go again he just hands the kid yeah the kids

44:09.000 --> 44:13.580
alive the wife's dead he's like freaking out about the wife but I agree with you now like

44:13.580 --> 44:16.740
with the perspective on that is yeah that you could see but back then I was a kid I

44:16.740 --> 44:21.380
wasn't really married so but the other part that really kind of put me off about Cisco

44:21.380 --> 44:26.640
is he was mean to my buddy Jean-Luc I have a son that I'm raising alone captain this

44:26.640 --> 44:32.300
is not the ideal environment unfortunately as Starfleet officers we do not always have

44:32.300 --> 44:37.780
the luxury to serve in an ideal environment I realize that sir and I'm investigating the

44:37.780 --> 44:45.780
possibility of returning to earth for civilian service perhaps Starfleet command should be

44:45.780 --> 44:53.940
considering a replacement for you that's probably a good idea I look into it in the meantime

44:53.940 --> 44:58.940
however in the meantime I will do the job I've been ordered to do to the best of my

44:58.940 --> 45:09.220
ability sir oh snaps dismissed so I was like dude he's being harsh on Picard but I didn't

45:09.220 --> 45:14.620
really appreciate that from Cisco's perspective at this time he's got a boy and he's got a

45:14.620 --> 45:18.900
nice desk job the boy's got a good safe life and now he's been put out in the frontier

45:18.900 --> 45:22.340
he's been put on the front lines he's not too happy about it well he's essentially put

45:22.340 --> 45:26.700
out into the you know Siberia tundra Siberian tundra it's essentially what's happened here

45:26.700 --> 45:31.580
and you you're basically again that's what I like about DS9 is that they look at things

45:31.580 --> 45:37.020
from it's it's less I don't want to say froufrou but it's more it's deeper character stuff

45:37.020 --> 45:41.260
not as much about the the next horizon the next challenge the next exploration the next

45:41.260 --> 45:45.620
conflict the in the first in the first season especially especially the first episode it's

45:45.620 --> 45:50.740
very much about the people and the interaction and and how different events change how we

45:50.740 --> 45:55.220
look at stuff and someone who might have otherwise been a dedicated first off you know I guess

45:55.220 --> 46:00.500
he would have been what commander you know how quickly that can change when they're confronted

46:00.500 --> 46:04.640
with someone that potentially not only killed the life of the crew but also basically got

46:04.640 --> 46:08.300
off I mean really what kind of slap on the wrist of the man get yeah yeah yeah I mean

46:08.300 --> 46:13.020
I totally see it now yeah back then I was like why doesn't he like Picard I get it now

46:13.020 --> 46:17.140
and it things that kind of pick up and move real quick right you have he makes a trip

46:17.140 --> 46:21.540
down to the Bajorans in this really odd like commander it's time to go and he just all

46:21.540 --> 46:26.460
of a sudden he goes down to see this the most holiest Bajoran of all Bajorans and he goes

46:26.460 --> 46:29.860
down there and she touches his ear a little bit and then gives them a little a little

46:29.860 --> 46:34.700
bit of acid aka one of the prophet orbs and gets him kind of motivated so he takes this

46:34.700 --> 46:38.820
or back to the station this is where we meet Dax we find out that Dax is a trill all this

46:38.820 --> 46:42.700
characters are getting some pretty good setups you know you get lots of flashbacks are used

46:42.700 --> 46:48.340
to like show Dax getting surgery and so they go off to find a location of where these orbs

46:48.340 --> 46:52.660
came from and they discover a wormhole the first known stable wormhole now this is going

46:52.660 --> 46:56.340
to be the show's hook because this adds a little spice because now they've got they're

46:56.340 --> 47:00.580
on the very border of this brand new frontier and that's why they're supposed to be that's

47:00.580 --> 47:05.540
why supposedly the concept works it's a stationary station because people are coming to them

47:05.540 --> 47:09.740
and more importantly this is the you know to borrow from Star Wars this is like the

47:09.740 --> 47:17.020
cat cantina on Tatooine this is a non federated area it's like you know no Federation presence

47:17.020 --> 47:22.820
really western and it's a frontier town Odo's the sheriff right yeah and so it's and they're

47:22.820 --> 47:27.300
on the they're on the frontier so of course Cisco's got to go into this wormhole and he

47:27.300 --> 47:32.860
ends up getting trapped Dax Dax gets taken out but Cisco gets left behind for some reason

47:32.860 --> 47:36.260
and what's the crew decided to do they're strapped on the station the station's currently

47:36.260 --> 47:42.180
orbiting Bajor I love the logic so they immediately say well Cisco's not here let's move the whole

47:42.180 --> 47:46.060
station to go rescue him but the problem is and I don't understand how this works maybe

47:46.060 --> 47:51.500
the chat room does the problem was that darn station is too heavy what would it take to

47:51.500 --> 47:56.520
move this station to the mouth of the wormhole this isn't a starship major we've got six

47:56.520 --> 48:01.460
working thrusters to power us and that's it 160 million kilometer trip would take two

48:01.460 --> 48:06.620
months it has to be there tomorrow that's not possible sir that wormhole might just

48:06.620 --> 48:12.620
reshape the future of this entire quadrant the Bajorans have to stake a claim to it and

48:12.620 --> 48:15.900
I have to admit that claim would be a lot stronger if there's a Federation presence

48:15.900 --> 48:21.660
to back it up couldn't you modify the subspace field output of the deflector generators just

48:21.660 --> 48:26.060
enough to create a low-level field around the station oh Dax so we could lower the

48:26.060 --> 48:30.540
inertial mass if you can make the station lighter those six thrusters will be all the

48:30.540 --> 48:35.340
power we need this whole station could break apart like an egg if it doesn't work I love

48:35.340 --> 48:38.580
that line there this whole station could break apart like an egg it's kind of seems feels

48:38.580 --> 48:42.580
like an homage to Scotty a little bit it totally does it totally does but now if you listen

48:42.580 --> 48:46.880
carefully now you can under you they actually tell you why they're bothering to do this

48:46.880 --> 48:51.500
to rescue him yeah yeah it does actually because he's the face of the yeah he's face of the

48:51.500 --> 48:57.540
Federation they they have a report the start of a rapport basically he doesn't Kira's not

48:57.540 --> 49:01.960
liking anybody but she's liking him a little more than she was before and you know she's

49:01.960 --> 49:04.420
kind of warming up to him a little bit and then he doesn't really want it to break in

49:04.420 --> 49:08.860
a whole new guy one of the things that happens is there's kind of interaction between Cisco

49:08.860 --> 49:12.660
and Quark to get Quark to remain behind which kind of impresses Kira like oh he actually

49:12.660 --> 49:16.460
handled that pretty well oh yeah yeah totally totally only because you know this is our

49:16.460 --> 49:23.100
first real in-depth uh you know experience with Ferengi that isn't based on TNG logic

49:23.100 --> 49:26.580
where they run around grunting with whips yeah you know in TNG they wrote them in there

49:26.580 --> 49:29.800
because they wanted them to be the new Klingons before they came up with the board concept

49:29.800 --> 49:32.420
they wanted them to be the new Klingons and they realized very quickly oh these guys are

49:32.420 --> 49:38.460
laughable so but I think Quark single-handedly turns that image around and makes them into

49:38.460 --> 49:43.980
cunning conniving capitalists oh Quark is my hero yeah I mean the dude's awesome yeah

49:43.980 --> 49:48.940
and Cisco kind of has like a real slow period during the show where he ends up in the wormhole

49:48.940 --> 49:54.620
just like explaining time to aliens my species lives in one point in time and once we move

49:54.620 --> 50:00.780
beyond that point it becomes the past the future all that is still to come does not

50:00.780 --> 50:07.900
exist yet for us does not exist yet that is the nature of linear existence and if you

50:07.900 --> 50:13.780
examine it more closely you will see that you do not need to fear me it's it's it's

50:13.780 --> 50:17.780
a it's a high level strong concept but it's just a little slow it felt like it dragged

50:17.780 --> 50:23.460
things down a little bit for me I was okay with it in that it was I considered it part

50:23.460 --> 50:26.980
of that character building process you know you're calling the prophets characters and

50:26.980 --> 50:30.820
it allowed them to kind of you know it kind of intermingled a little bit so I was okay

50:30.820 --> 50:33.820
with it yeah it was a little boring and it's actually a pretty good description of what

50:33.820 --> 50:37.980
time is like like because they you know the one of the concepts is what is time in this

50:37.980 --> 50:42.060
movie and these aliens have they live in a reality where there just is no time it's everything

50:42.060 --> 50:46.660
is what it is it exists and so having to like explain you know because sometimes with my

50:46.660 --> 50:51.860
son I've he's asked me can I explain something and I have to explain it without using another

50:51.860 --> 50:55.860
word that needs to be explained and they did a pretty good job there but meanwhile the

50:55.860 --> 51:00.220
real fun is actually still back on the station there's a great O'Brien character creating

51:00.220 --> 51:04.300
scene where he fights with the station computer to get the station to actually move and this

51:04.300 --> 51:07.620
is like a thread that continues throughout the first or even second season and I love

51:07.620 --> 51:08.620
it.

51:08.620 --> 51:13.380
Partial field established instability at 12 percent.

51:13.380 --> 51:15.380
Partial field.

51:15.380 --> 51:20.060
Is station's inertial mass low enough to break orbit?

51:20.060 --> 51:21.060
Procedure is not recommended.

51:21.060 --> 51:23.980
Dammit I didn't ask for an opinion.

51:23.980 --> 51:28.140
Just tell me whether or not we can get enough thrust with only a partial field established.

51:28.140 --> 51:29.140
Affirmative.

51:29.140 --> 51:33.260
All right thank you.

51:33.260 --> 51:34.260
Initiate transit mode.

51:34.260 --> 51:35.260
Three axis stabilization.

51:35.260 --> 51:36.260
Aye sir.

51:36.260 --> 51:37.260
Engage thrusters.

51:37.260 --> 51:38.260
Warning.

51:38.260 --> 51:39.260
Field integrity declining.

51:39.260 --> 51:40.260
Instability at 21 percent.

51:40.260 --> 51:57.780
We've got to close that gap in the field or we'll tear ourselves into a million pieces.

51:57.780 --> 51:58.780
Warning.

51:58.780 --> 52:01.460
Subspace field collapse in 60 seconds.

52:01.460 --> 52:06.660
Computer transfer energy from the inertial dampers to reinforce the subspace field.

52:06.660 --> 52:07.660
Procedure is not recommended.

52:07.660 --> 52:08.660
Dammit.

52:08.660 --> 52:09.660
Transfer the energy.

52:09.660 --> 52:10.660
Unable to comply.

52:10.660 --> 52:13.660
Level one safety protocols have canceled request.

52:13.660 --> 52:14.660
Canceled?

52:14.660 --> 52:15.660
Warning.

52:15.660 --> 52:16.660
Subspace field collapse in 30 seconds.

52:16.660 --> 52:17.660
I'm going to transfer it manually.

52:17.660 --> 52:25.660
On my mark redirect the flow to the deflectors and keep the power balanced.

52:25.660 --> 52:26.660
Aye sir.

52:26.660 --> 52:27.660
Field collapse in 15 seconds.

52:27.660 --> 52:28.660
Now.

52:28.660 --> 52:29.660
Field energy now within flight tolerances.

52:29.660 --> 52:34.660
I love it.

52:34.660 --> 52:49.300
Yeah and there's also a great scene where he's trying to get the transporter to work

52:49.300 --> 52:50.780
and he ends up just kicking it.

52:50.780 --> 52:55.060
Well and that's what's awesome is that this is the series, even it's through season one

52:55.060 --> 52:57.060
that really established his character.

52:57.060 --> 52:58.060
Yeah, yeah.

52:58.060 --> 53:03.820
And there's an awkward yet appropriate goodbye between him and Picard where, and I couldn't

53:03.820 --> 53:08.940
quite understand what they were trying to tell me, O'Brien visits the bridge, spends

53:08.940 --> 53:14.740
time looking at the ready room but doesn't go in to say goodbye, then goes to the transporter

53:14.740 --> 53:19.100
but Picard stops him before he beams out to say goodbye and like Picard is being more

53:19.100 --> 53:20.240
emotional than O'Brien.

53:20.240 --> 53:22.700
Like he's trying to say like, you know, this was your favorite transporter room, blah,

53:22.700 --> 53:23.700
blah, blah.

53:23.700 --> 53:25.740
And O'Brien's like, yeah, whatever, sir.

53:25.740 --> 53:28.780
And then he gets up on the pad and gets and tells him to beam them out and meanwhile Picard's

53:28.780 --> 53:29.780
like sitting there heartbroken.

53:29.780 --> 53:35.020
I like, but I guess, you know, they were just trying to do a handoff and that is how two

53:35.020 --> 53:36.020
guys would do it.

53:36.020 --> 53:38.660
Like it would be awkward because it would be two guys, right?

53:38.660 --> 53:40.420
Well Picard's acting like a girl.

53:40.420 --> 53:45.060
I mean, no offense, but I mean, he's acting much more, you know, in that mindset of he

53:45.060 --> 53:49.460
has things he wants to express, guys of course don't want to express anything and that's

53:49.460 --> 53:50.820
kind of how we're wired.

53:50.820 --> 53:54.500
And it's interesting because they kind of come back on it later on in DS9 where every

53:54.500 --> 53:59.100
now and then you wonder if maybe O'Brien wasn't always totally happy on the Enterprise.

53:59.100 --> 54:04.060
Now there is another really strong character moment and this time it's with Kira.

54:04.060 --> 54:07.940
Their lead ship is hailing us.

54:07.940 --> 54:09.940
Gul Jassad wants an answer.

54:09.940 --> 54:12.100
Are you ready, Mr. O'Brien?

54:12.100 --> 54:13.100
Yes, sir.

54:13.100 --> 54:17.380
When they penetrate our Thorogh field, it should raise a few eyebrows over there.

54:17.380 --> 54:22.220
All right, then let's give them our answer.

54:22.220 --> 54:25.700
There are six photon torpedoes across Jassad's bow.

54:25.700 --> 54:27.500
We only have six photons, Major.

54:27.500 --> 54:28.500
I love that.

54:28.500 --> 54:31.500
We're not going to win this battle with torpedoes, Chief.

54:31.500 --> 54:32.500
Aye, sir.

54:32.500 --> 54:40.060
An urgent hail from Jassad.

54:40.060 --> 54:44.100
Looks like we got his attention.

54:44.100 --> 54:45.100
On screen.

54:45.100 --> 54:47.580
This is your answer?

54:47.580 --> 54:51.860
You don't think Starfleet took command of the space station without the ability to defend

54:51.860 --> 54:52.860
it, do you?

54:52.860 --> 54:56.060
Defend it?

54:56.060 --> 55:00.660
Your space station could not defend itself against one Cardassian warship.

55:00.660 --> 55:04.060
You're probably right, Jassad.

55:04.060 --> 55:10.620
And if you were dealing with the Starfleet officer, they'd probably admit, we have a

55:10.620 --> 55:13.860
hopeless cause here.

55:13.860 --> 55:21.140
But I am just a Bajoran who's been fighting a hopeless cause against the Cardassians all

55:21.140 --> 55:23.900
her life.

55:23.900 --> 55:29.060
So if you want a war, I'll give you one.

55:29.060 --> 55:30.060
Love that.

55:30.060 --> 55:31.060
It's so perfect.

55:31.060 --> 55:32.060
She plays it so well.

55:32.060 --> 55:33.060
The chat room picked up on something.

55:33.060 --> 55:36.220
Everybody calls her sir, and DS9 followed that a lot more closely.

55:36.220 --> 55:39.820
Like when Dax took over the Defiant later on in the series, everyone called her Captain,

55:39.820 --> 55:41.940
even though her rank was like Lieutenant Commander.

55:41.940 --> 55:43.940
They followed a lot of more naval traditions.

55:43.940 --> 55:48.700
In fact, another example of DS9 having some really smart dialogue that kind of keeps you

55:48.700 --> 55:52.620
in that world, keeps you in that reality, like they're creating a universe, is right

55:52.620 --> 55:56.200
after that line from Kira.

55:56.200 --> 56:00.480
The camera pans over to O'Brien, and he starts to talk, and before he even finishes the sentence,

56:00.480 --> 56:02.420
you know what joke he's going to make.

56:02.420 --> 56:05.940
And these types of jokes, they often bug me on Star Trek because they're essentially a

56:05.940 --> 56:09.820
joke that we make using current 20th century references.

56:09.820 --> 56:14.140
But instead, DS9 takes it as an opportunity to enrich the reality.

56:14.140 --> 56:21.900
So, you know, you know he means poker.

56:21.900 --> 56:25.520
I'm never going to play poker because you've got a good bluff face, but they don't say

56:25.520 --> 56:29.780
poker because that's a human reference for the, you know, 20, 21st century.

56:29.780 --> 56:33.780
But I think it's a truism that, you know, while the verbiage may be different, I think

56:33.780 --> 56:38.300
it dates back further, just it probably, you know, uses different language, I'm sure.

56:38.300 --> 56:44.060
It's like exactly like that turn of phrase is still used, but they use different things,

56:44.060 --> 56:48.820
like in DS9, instead of using coffee, they get Ractaginos, right, a lot of things like

56:48.820 --> 56:49.820
that.

56:49.820 --> 56:50.820
I just appreciated that.

56:50.820 --> 56:55.620
And then, of course, after the tension has been mounted and built properly, there's only

56:55.620 --> 56:57.900
one person who can come back and save the day at this point.

56:57.900 --> 57:02.320
Of course, it's the last few minutes of this episode, and that would be Captain Sisko coming

57:02.320 --> 57:03.620
back from the wormhole.

57:03.620 --> 57:07.580
And remember, at this point in the show, the Cardassians believe that it wasn't a wormhole

57:07.580 --> 57:11.840
that took away Dukat's ship, it was perhaps the station.

57:11.840 --> 57:14.700
And so that's why they're threatening to attack the station and they want to take it over

57:14.700 --> 57:15.700
again.

57:15.700 --> 57:18.620
And just as their attack on the station is reaching a climax.

57:18.620 --> 57:23.540
Signal the lead Cardassian ship that we will proceed with major.

57:23.540 --> 57:28.660
I'm picking up a huge neutrino disturbance 15 kilometers off the forward docking ring.

57:28.660 --> 57:29.660
It's the wormhole.

57:29.660 --> 57:30.660
On screen.

57:30.660 --> 57:31.660
Hail the lead ship.

57:31.660 --> 57:32.660
What did I tell you, Jasad?

57:32.660 --> 57:33.660
There's your wormhole.

57:33.660 --> 57:55.860
And he's got Dukat shipping a tractor beam, which for Cardassians is a big statement because

57:55.860 --> 57:56.860
that's a show of weakness.

57:56.860 --> 57:59.660
That's a lot like a dog being on a leash seen to other dogs.

57:59.660 --> 58:00.660
Exactly.

58:00.660 --> 58:01.660
And it diffuses the situation.

58:01.660 --> 58:02.660
He's like, Hey, I've noticed you have a few problems.

58:02.660 --> 58:06.980
Of course, he doesn't say why the hell have you moved my station, but right, which I had

58:06.980 --> 58:07.980
a problem with that.

58:07.980 --> 58:08.980
Yeah.

58:08.980 --> 58:09.980
Yeah.

58:09.980 --> 58:12.540
But then at the end of the episode, Cisco talks to Picard and makes good.

58:12.540 --> 58:15.460
Well, you've put Bajor on the map, commander.

58:15.460 --> 58:20.220
This will shortly become a leading center of commerce and of scientific exploration

58:20.220 --> 58:27.860
and for Starfleet, one of our most important posts captain regarding our conversation about

58:27.860 --> 58:32.940
someone to replace now it's yes, I am sorry I haven't had time yet to communicate that

58:32.940 --> 58:33.940
to command.

58:33.940 --> 58:35.940
I would prefer you ignore it, sir.

58:35.940 --> 58:41.580
I'm not sure that I can, are you certain that's what you want?

58:41.580 --> 58:46.540
Because we cannot afford to have a commanding officer who was, I'm certain, sir.

58:46.540 --> 58:47.540
There you go.

58:47.540 --> 58:48.540
He's certain.

58:48.540 --> 58:51.340
He was, he was energized by the experience and now he's ready for the, uh, for the challenge.

58:51.340 --> 58:55.860
And I was kind of surprised at how often Picard actually popped up through this episode.

58:55.860 --> 58:59.780
You know, I just expected a quick cameo and that would be it, but he actually had a recurring

58:59.780 --> 59:02.020
role throughout this two hour episode.

59:02.020 --> 59:03.020
True.

59:03.020 --> 59:04.020
This is true.

59:04.020 --> 59:08.300
And I think it definitely sets sets because I think all these events needed to happen

59:08.300 --> 59:10.740
for that first season to make any sense.

59:10.740 --> 59:12.460
We needed to understand his psychology.

59:12.460 --> 59:13.460
Exactly.

59:13.460 --> 59:16.260
And that's kind of why we spent a little extra time on this episode because it really is

59:16.260 --> 59:18.340
the foundation for the rest of the series.

59:18.340 --> 59:20.980
That's one of the things that's kind of interesting about DS nine, although in TNG they managed

59:20.980 --> 59:22.020
to bring it back home too.

59:22.020 --> 59:27.060
But, uh, so before we go to the mumble room and get their thoughts on all of this, give

59:27.060 --> 59:32.060
them a time to catch up on the stream, Matt, after watching this again, how did it land

59:32.060 --> 59:33.060
on you?

59:33.060 --> 59:37.580
Does it a does it hold up and B does it, where, where does it leave you?

59:37.580 --> 59:39.580
It was like your overall review.

59:39.580 --> 59:44.620
I maintain that, you know, I, of course we haven't gotten to where we really got to enjoy

59:44.620 --> 59:46.860
Quark and it's in his fullness yet.

59:46.860 --> 59:50.700
We haven't even touched on Nog or any of these other things, but I think as far as the characters

59:50.700 --> 59:56.020
that really made their, their, uh, shiny moment in this first episode, it really drives home

59:56.020 --> 01:00:01.260
for me that this was a piece of Star Trek that needed to happen without the utopian

01:00:01.260 --> 01:00:07.080
stuff, without the, you know, just explore, explore, explore more stuff that we as humans

01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:09.180
in the 21st century can relate to.

01:00:09.180 --> 01:00:14.980
I think that we, it's more relatable in our day to day struggles, in our, uh, war conflicts,

01:00:14.980 --> 01:00:15.980
all these things.

01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:19.380
I think it, it lets us know that it, Star Trek isn't just utopian.

01:00:19.380 --> 01:00:20.380
Yeah.

01:00:20.380 --> 01:00:24.580
And that, and that, um, it actually caused some internal strafe because you still had

01:00:24.580 --> 01:00:27.860
the T and G crew around a lot of the people who were there in the original Roddenberry

01:00:27.860 --> 01:00:28.860
days.

01:00:28.860 --> 01:00:29.860
Oh yeah.

01:00:29.860 --> 01:00:31.940
There was some internal strife about that if, if Gene would approve of it or not.

01:00:31.940 --> 01:00:35.620
But you know, you touched on something kind of, you know, one of the things that DS9 was

01:00:35.620 --> 01:00:39.900
really good at was taking current events and reflecting them into the future, abstracting

01:00:39.900 --> 01:00:43.580
them away so that way we could have a rational conversation without special interest getting

01:00:43.580 --> 01:00:44.900
their feelings hurt.

01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:45.900
Right.

01:00:45.900 --> 01:00:48.780
And one of the things that struck me through this, and it's not a direct parallel at all,

01:00:48.780 --> 01:00:54.860
but there is a lot of similarities between what the potential outcome could be in Syria

01:00:54.860 --> 01:00:59.220
and the state of the Bajoran people, like, and there's an oppressive regime.

01:00:59.220 --> 01:01:01.900
Um, there is a falling of that regime.

01:01:01.900 --> 01:01:06.060
There is a civil government that is established and then that civil government requests that

01:01:06.060 --> 01:01:12.020
this larger empire, AKA the federation comes in and brings in military to help them.

01:01:12.020 --> 01:01:17.620
And then a local aggressor in their backyard, AKA, you know, another Eastern, Middle Eastern

01:01:17.620 --> 01:01:18.620
country.

01:01:18.620 --> 01:01:24.260
Something like that is an aggressor in their backyard who the, the, uh, the new hired guns

01:01:24.260 --> 01:01:25.700
have to constantly keep an eye on.

01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:29.820
I mean, there's a lot of reflections in modern day politics intertwined into this first episode

01:01:29.820 --> 01:01:31.300
of DS9 too.

01:01:31.300 --> 01:01:33.180
And in my mind, that makes it hold up even stronger.

01:01:33.180 --> 01:01:34.660
Oh, I would, I would say so.

01:01:34.660 --> 01:01:39.300
And I think that entire set of circumstances, both in the past now and even in the future

01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:40.940
is a timeless thing.

01:01:40.940 --> 01:01:46.020
Um, I've seen it time and time again, you know, it seems like it's a constant cycle.

01:01:46.020 --> 01:01:49.220
And so it's interesting that even in a whole nother part of the universe or another part

01:01:49.220 --> 01:01:55.060
of the galaxy in this particular case, that something so familiar can still unravel despite

01:01:55.060 --> 01:01:58.100
the fact that they're not, you know, it doesn't involve humans.

01:01:58.100 --> 01:01:59.100
History continues to repeat itself.

01:01:59.100 --> 01:02:00.100
All right.

01:02:00.100 --> 01:02:01.100
Until humans insert themselves.

01:02:01.100 --> 01:02:03.660
I'll ask the mumble room, uh, guys in the room, I'll open the floor to you.

01:02:03.660 --> 01:02:05.460
Did anybody get a chance to watch along with us?

01:02:05.460 --> 01:02:08.860
And what were your impressions of the first episode of Deep Space Nine?

01:02:08.860 --> 01:02:11.660
How does it hold up as a Star Trek premiere?

01:02:11.660 --> 01:02:15.380
You got, think of it now at this point in time, we've seen every Star Trek premiere

01:02:15.380 --> 01:02:16.380
has been.

01:02:16.380 --> 01:02:20.420
We've seen Enterprise, TNG, Voyager, even TOS, if you've got the gray hairs to prove

01:02:20.420 --> 01:02:21.420
it.

01:02:21.420 --> 01:02:25.660
And where does DS9 fit into those other Star Trek premiers?

01:02:25.660 --> 01:02:28.820
Mumble room, I bring it to you.

01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:38.140
Well, I watched it, uh, well, I never really got into DS9 when I was on TV, uh, it never

01:02:38.140 --> 01:02:43.100
really grabbed me, but I watched the first episode this time and I really watched it

01:02:43.100 --> 01:02:45.340
and uh, yeah, I do enjoy it.

01:02:45.340 --> 01:02:51.860
It has some weaknesses, um, for instance, the, the, the, the, the moment in that Cisco

01:02:51.860 --> 01:02:57.340
was in the wormhole and was stuck there, I felt that it was going on, it was dragging

01:02:57.340 --> 01:02:58.340
along a little bit.

01:02:58.340 --> 01:03:04.020
That's at least, that's my opinion, but, uh, I did like the episode.

01:03:04.020 --> 01:03:05.380
It was a strong start.

01:03:05.380 --> 01:03:06.380
Yeah.

01:03:06.380 --> 01:03:07.700
I think it was a pretty strong start.

01:03:07.700 --> 01:03:09.780
Anybody else want to chime in before we wrap up?

01:03:09.780 --> 01:03:10.780
Yeah.

01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:11.780
Yeah.

01:03:11.780 --> 01:03:12.780
Go on.

01:03:12.780 --> 01:03:18.500
Yeah, I have to admit that the beginning of the episode, you know, it kind of showed what

01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:23.180
was going to happen, especially later on, um, in some of the later episodes with a fast

01:03:23.180 --> 01:03:28.220
pace of action, which you didn't normally see in the previous, uh, seasons and series

01:03:28.220 --> 01:03:29.220
of Star Trek.

01:03:29.220 --> 01:03:34.340
But the good thing about, um, this was a bit grittier, um, you could, you could definitely

01:03:34.340 --> 01:03:37.820
see what was going to be happening in the future.

01:03:37.820 --> 01:03:38.820
Excellent point.

01:03:38.820 --> 01:03:39.820
Excellent point.

01:03:39.820 --> 01:03:40.820
All right, guys, any last thoughts?

01:03:40.820 --> 01:03:41.820
Anybody else?

01:03:41.820 --> 01:03:46.180
Yeah, all I'd like to say about BS9 is that it has diversity to Star Trek.

01:03:46.180 --> 01:03:51.540
It says that it's not just about flying about in space and exploring new worlds or whatever.

01:03:51.540 --> 01:03:55.700
There is a universe there, there is a people there, there is a culture, there is everything.

01:03:55.700 --> 01:03:56.700
There's depth here.

01:03:56.700 --> 01:03:57.700
There's diversity here.

01:03:57.700 --> 01:03:58.700
Right.

01:03:58.700 --> 01:03:59.700
Exactly.

01:03:59.700 --> 01:04:00.700
Which you cannot ignore.

01:04:00.700 --> 01:04:01.700
Yeah.

01:04:01.700 --> 01:04:05.580
I think I would maybe argue that it is the, uh, that it is the absolute, uh, and I'm

01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:08.340
going to, I'll wrap it there cause we're running a little long, uh, but thank you, Mumble Room.

01:04:08.340 --> 01:04:12.580
I would argue that I think it is maybe the strongest premiere of any Star Trek.

01:04:12.580 --> 01:04:17.580
Uh, and it does, you know, the show like all Star Treks gets better, um, as, as it goes

01:04:17.580 --> 01:04:18.580
on.

01:04:18.580 --> 01:04:21.700
But I think, you know, if you look at TNG, there's, there's a lot, you know, you've got,

01:04:21.700 --> 01:04:24.020
you've got Deanna in a cheerleader uniform.

01:04:24.020 --> 01:04:27.780
You've got Wesley who's just derping up all over the place, right?

01:04:27.780 --> 01:04:30.860
And by the way, I got a lot of respect for how they handle Jake throughout this whole

01:04:30.860 --> 01:04:33.300
series, but specifically here, there's a strong connection.

01:04:33.300 --> 01:04:36.700
Like when Cisco gets back on the station and, you know, Jake sees him for the first time.

01:04:36.700 --> 01:04:38.700
I mean, I, that was touching to me as a dad.

01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:39.860
I thought they'd handled that really well.

01:04:39.860 --> 01:04:44.660
And instead of making Jake Wesley 2.0 or Echeb from Voyager, they handled them really well.

01:04:44.660 --> 01:04:47.380
And it's typically Star Trek really screws up kids really bad.

01:04:47.380 --> 01:04:48.380
They get it wrong a lot.

01:04:48.380 --> 01:04:49.380
And I don't feel like they did.

01:04:49.380 --> 01:04:52.380
Echeb's a great example there cause that was just, that was terrible.

01:04:52.380 --> 01:04:53.380
So, yeah.

01:04:53.380 --> 01:04:56.620
Uh, so I felt like as far as strong openings go, yeah, some of the acting was a little

01:04:56.620 --> 01:05:00.660
rough because it's their first episode, but the effects were solid, the concepts were

01:05:00.660 --> 01:05:01.660
great.

01:05:01.660 --> 01:05:05.420
Um, and the execution was powerful and it, except for it moved, moved, moved, and then

01:05:05.420 --> 01:05:06.420
wormhole.

01:05:06.420 --> 01:05:10.220
All the scenes outside the wormhole, I really liked it.

01:05:10.220 --> 01:05:13.700
As soon as we get into the wormhole, I don't know, maybe I just need to get really stoned

01:05:13.700 --> 01:05:15.180
and maybe have a few beers or something.

01:05:15.180 --> 01:05:19.260
But as I'm sitting there watching this, I'm like, come on, this is two hours.

01:05:19.260 --> 01:05:21.940
You really got to spend this much time on here, but overall, I enjoyed it.

01:05:21.940 --> 01:05:22.940
All right, Matt.

01:05:22.940 --> 01:05:26.420
So I know this hasn't been popular with everyone, so we will do another straw poll.

01:05:26.420 --> 01:05:27.860
I have linked it in the show notes right now.

01:05:27.860 --> 01:05:29.660
So we will have two straw polls this week.

01:05:29.660 --> 01:05:33.300
The one that the people in the download and stream versions can watch later, we'll have

01:05:33.300 --> 01:05:35.860
the voting poll to see if we should do this again.

01:05:35.860 --> 01:05:39.420
So in the Deep Space Nine challenge, there will be a link at the top of that for the

01:05:39.420 --> 01:05:42.860
straw poll and you go there and you vote if you want us to do this again next week.

01:05:42.860 --> 01:05:46.640
And if we get, uh, if the yeses have it, then we will do episode three of DS9.

01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:51.220
If the nopes have it, we'll drop it there and we'll just stick to other stuff.

01:05:51.220 --> 01:05:54.780
But I thought it was kind of fun and it's, I think there's benefits from time to time

01:05:54.780 --> 01:06:00.380
to taking our same community and all the, all of the people who hold similar interests

01:06:00.380 --> 01:06:05.300
and exploring other topics and, and, and going into other things that we all enjoy because

01:06:05.300 --> 01:06:09.900
it is good to get out of that bubble and it is still good to have the chat and the discussion

01:06:09.900 --> 01:06:10.900
and get people thinking.

01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:14.980
And it's, it's also just kind of a fun way to get people to get into DS9 if they haven't

01:06:14.980 --> 01:06:15.980
been there before.

01:06:15.980 --> 01:06:18.300
So it's, it's, I, but I understand it might not be popular.

01:06:18.300 --> 01:06:20.780
So if people don't like it, we don't have to do it next time.

01:06:20.780 --> 01:06:22.500
Super quick piece of advice before I let it go.

01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:26.980
If you watched it back when it aired, forget everything you ever watched, watch it commercial

01:06:26.980 --> 01:06:27.980
free on Netflix.

01:06:27.980 --> 01:06:29.980
It's a completely different experience.

01:06:29.980 --> 01:06:33.620
I really felt like I, I really felt like I watched a different show in some ways.

01:06:33.620 --> 01:06:34.620
Yeah.

01:06:34.620 --> 01:06:35.620
All right.

01:06:35.620 --> 01:06:36.620
So here we go.

01:06:36.620 --> 01:06:41.020
But before we run our final, our final tally for a Sunday's topic, Friday edition, or I'm

01:06:41.020 --> 01:06:45.980
sorry, Friday's topic, Friday edition of the Linux action show Trek meets Linux or taking

01:06:45.980 --> 01:06:48.340
great notes on Linux.

01:06:48.340 --> 01:06:51.940
And the notes have it with, I did not expect that with 43 votes, 56%.

01:06:51.940 --> 01:06:56.400
Well, I wouldn't be surprised if there's a few Star Trek app picks that work their way

01:06:56.400 --> 01:06:58.620
into the episode anyways.

01:06:58.620 --> 01:06:59.620
You know what I'm saying, Matt?

01:06:59.620 --> 01:07:00.620
I know what you're saying.

01:07:00.620 --> 01:07:01.620
Okay.

01:07:01.620 --> 01:07:02.620
All right.

01:07:02.620 --> 01:07:03.620
I can do the note thing.

01:07:03.620 --> 01:07:04.620
I got a couple of good note apps.

01:07:04.620 --> 01:07:06.340
You and I will share notes after the show.

01:07:06.340 --> 01:07:07.340
All right.

01:07:07.340 --> 01:07:08.340
Yeah.

01:07:08.340 --> 01:07:09.340
You get what I'm saying, Matt?

01:07:09.340 --> 01:07:10.340
I get what you're saying.

01:07:10.340 --> 01:07:13.340
Um, so yeah, just a little reminder, we'll be doing Friday, uh, edition of Linux action

01:07:13.340 --> 01:07:16.220
show at 10 a.m. Pacific over at jblive.tv.

01:07:16.220 --> 01:07:19.900
No show on Sunday, but it actually should be available for download hopefully around

01:07:19.900 --> 01:07:20.900
the regular lifetime.

01:07:20.900 --> 01:07:24.500
So you've got to just watch it on demand and, uh, enjoy it that way.

01:07:24.500 --> 01:07:25.500
All right.

01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:26.500
Well, uh, thanks to the mumble room.

01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:27.560
Hey guys, thanks for joining us today.

01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:28.560
You guys were awesome.

01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:31.300
I'm going to mute you here in a bit, but, uh, we'll chat some more after the show.

01:07:31.300 --> 01:07:34.980
We keep going a little bit after the show and, uh, we'll, uh, share some more thoughts

01:07:34.980 --> 01:07:40.100
and don't forget, we'd love to get more con more, uh, more topics, more, uh, concepts

01:07:40.100 --> 01:07:41.100
to kick around.

01:07:41.100 --> 01:07:43.980
You can submit a lot of those, any of those really to linuxactionshow.reddit.com.

01:07:43.980 --> 01:07:47.720
It's a great place to get things into the show because now the things, now that we've

01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:51.920
got two places to cover some of this stuff, stuff that doesn't make it into the big show

01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:52.920
might still make it into here.

01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:55.420
So stuff's got double the shot to make it into the show.

01:07:55.420 --> 01:07:57.300
Matt, you have a great week.

01:07:57.300 --> 01:07:59.140
Enjoy your ramp up to the big day.

01:07:59.140 --> 01:08:00.140
I will.

01:08:00.140 --> 01:08:01.140
I will.

01:08:01.140 --> 01:08:03.020
Thank you for tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

01:08:03.020 --> 01:08:04.380
I hope we see you back here.

01:08:04.380 --> 01:08:06.820
Don't forget to go vote in that straw poll if you liked it or didn't like it because

01:08:06.820 --> 01:08:08.640
it's going to depend on your vote.

01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:09.640
So you got to show up and vote.

01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:12.500
We'll have a link to that in the show notes, right under the deep space nine challenge,

01:08:12.500 --> 01:08:15.780
as well as links to where you can stream deep space nine online.

01:08:15.780 --> 01:08:22.340
If you have access to us servers, if you get what I'm saying with that, all right, everyone,

01:08:22.340 --> 01:08:24.580
thanks so much for tuning this week's episode of unplugged.

01:08:24.580 --> 01:08:32.060
We'll see you right back here next week.
