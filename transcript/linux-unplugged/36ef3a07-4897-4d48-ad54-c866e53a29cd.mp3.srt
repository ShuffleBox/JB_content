1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,140
I've got a big problem and I need your guys's help

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:07,720
I I've discovered there is a major hole in my life that I did not know was there until I got a couple of

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:11,560
Days of downtime. I'm sitting there on the Thanksgiving holiday week in the rover

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:15,200
I'm like, you know what? I want to do. I want to watch some TV. Maybe even I want to watch some home alone

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,720
Cozy up watch some home alone

6
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:25,240
Then I remembered that my whole rover runs off of a my fight connection and all of a sudden I went from not caring about

7
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:29,780
TV at all to I got to have a way that I can like come down to the studio

8
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:36,720
Sink media to some kind of device go back to the rover and play offline still with some streaming options if I want them

9
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,880
Right, I keep and so here's the solution

10
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,720
I don't want to use because this is what seems like the easy solution

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,080
Take an iPad with the Plex app

12
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:44,560
Yep

13
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,200
Come down here to the studio

14
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,280
sync to the Plex server to the iPad bring the iPad back to the rover and

15
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,800
Watch like Plex on the iPad offline

16
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,340
Mmm, but that's not very Linux II. No, there's got to be a way to do it

17
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:01,840
Like and I'm so I'm I'm curious what could what could be like a decent?

18
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,680
What are people's offline media solution where you have maybe like a collection of media somewhere?

19
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,680
I have a quick question for you Chris. Yeah

20
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,240
How do you have a defined way you'd like to be watching it in the rover?

21
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,240
I mean, do you have a TV? Do you know?

22
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,160
No, I don't I would for not to be on definitely not on the desktop

23
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:22,080
Are you do you have a mobile a laptop with a decent-sized screen would be okay or a tablet would be okay

24
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,960
Basically something that's decent enough to watch a TV on but it doesn't have to be that big

25
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,960
So I thought maybe I could do like an MB

26
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,040
server with maybe like a tablet app right or on a laptop or maybe like well

27
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,360
Like I said Plex on a tablet could be an Android tablet, too

28
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,160
But I just I hate Android tablets sure or our sink, you know

29
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,360
I could just our sink some files over from time to time and use VLC, right?

30
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,600
but I would really like something that has like played status and resume support for where I left off and maybe

31
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,680
transcoding support for different devices

32
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:54,280
So I don't really know what the solution is here because the ideal the ideal thing would be like, okay

33
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:58,880
It's a Friday and I'm here at the studio. I'll sync up a couple of shows and then I'll go home for the weekend

34
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,520
And I watch all my stuff and then I come back

35
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:07,140
On Monday for Kota radio and I think but I watched we take some stuff off put some stuff on

36
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,640
It would be really nice

37
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:15,120
Wimpy do you have an idea because I see my you you said I know you know what it is. Tell me when we yeah

38
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,240
okay, so

39
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:20,160
What we have here what we have in the house here is

40
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,320
a server running open media vault with

41
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:29,880
Plex installed on that so all of the media is on there

42
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:33,920
So consequently anyone in the house using any device

43
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:39,320
can watch the film when our shortwave radio is down to

44
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,200
You know stream it to your device with transcoding working and all the rest of it. So if you had a small Plex

45
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:53,400
Server or you could do it then be as well. I suppose does anybody do transcoding for devices? Yeah

46
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,600
Yeah, yeah, then you could use that as well and you you host it in

47
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:03,360
The RV and then so and then and then just sort of over time

48
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:09,960
Trickle content down to it and content add content to the server as and when you get the opportunity, you know

49
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,360
So the way that we add content to this is we buy

50
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:18,920
Blu-ray discs and I have a machine that I ripped the films off the Blu-ray into the media

51
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:24,080
I mean, yeah, that's actually pretty good. I have seen just in that same vein if you're an MB supporter

52
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,000
They have a folder sync. Yeah, and so you can transcode out you can target a specific

53
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,120
Yes, and so you might be able to do that to an external hard drive and bring it in if you hadn't it at one

54
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:36,720
There maybe too much work. I'm not sure it wouldn't have probably that probably wouldn't have the watch status

55
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,520
I wonder about that

56
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:44,120
That would go basically I would use MB to organize all the files and then use its folder sync plug-in right to manage

57
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,020
I have not tried that but Popey you said you had an idea

58
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:55,240
Yeah, I just posted a link in IRC it's a device which is a mobile wireless access point

59
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:00,400
That has a USB port and an SD card slot and it's got a battery

60
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,960
So it's designed to be a portable media server

61
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:10,400
so you just stick all your media on a USB Drive plug it into that thing and then you can go anywhere carry this thing with

62
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:17,000
You and it creates a wireless access point you connect to connect multiple devices to it and just stream media straight off it to any

63
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,400
Device. Oh, wow. Nice. So basically probably uses what DLNA to to connect to it

64
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,920
So anything that supports DLNA playback and stream off of it

65
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:29,840
I'm not sure what protocol it uses but the good news is it is flashable. So you can actually stick anything

66
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:35,320
You can put like Linux or open WRT or some other random stuff on it as well

67
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,620
You can hack it

68
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:41,640
but the fact that it's got a battery and it means you can go out and about and still carry on listening to content off of

69
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:45,520
It or like watching media off of it when the power goes out Wow

70
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,520
I mean this is so they even have a newer version. I

71
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:55,200
How can this be? I've got the old one. It's like 30. It's like 30 bucks us. That seems entirely too reasonable

72
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:59,520
Yeah, I mean, there's no there's no storage in it. So you've got to provide an SD card in there, right?

73
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,000
But you can have an SD card of TV shows and SD card of movies and who doesn't have one laying around

74
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:10,200
Interesting interesting that is actually pretty neat. I'm gonna put a link to that in the show notes. That's a pretty neat idea

75
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,720
I wonder though if

76
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:19,440
You know what to me what what I really would like is something that is kind of what wimpy was saying where I just have

77
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:26,360
A rig in the rover that's that is receiving files through maybe like sync thing or something. Yeah, that's my idea

78
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,800
You sink thing. Yeah, okay, but then here's the problem though at first of all

79
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,600
It requires connectivity in the rover all the time. And the second thing is I'm still not sinking my watch data

80
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,140
So do I do I just give up on that? I guess well, you could like deleted or something

81
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:42,800
You don't necessarily have to I don't know you could find some other way put it in a separate folder

82
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,000
Just use the file system

83
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,880
Yeah, deal with more status connection all the time. No, does it only needs connection periodically, you know in order to sync synchronize?

84
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:58,640
Yeah, it's like, you know, whenever you like pull up outside McDonald's get it to synchronize over there Wi-Fi or whatever

85
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,400
I mean you can set it up in such a way that you had to be at home

86
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,800
So it had to only sync when you were local at the studio

87
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,400
Or you could do it like when you set up a VPN connection so it could be explicit

88
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,480
So it's only sinking when you're on a connection that you think has enough bandwidth

89
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,240
Well, it feels nice though. I mean what I was kind of fantasizing the reason why the

90
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:22,680
The iPad or Android tablet running Plex is so fancy to me is because I just bring it with me one day

91
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,840
And I just hit a button it just sucks down all the new stuff

92
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:29,120
And then I walk away and it's got all the new stuff and no connection required at the rover at all

93
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,800
I have a wild idea what what if you use something like

94
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,440
ZFS or butter fs snapshots. Yeah, take snapshots of your MB installation

95
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:42,840
Oh, hold on West send that right to an external or something and connect it up and run MB from that drive and then have it

96
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:46,400
Rescan your library and then it would only show you things that you you had kept that is interesting

97
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,640
I don't know. It's overly complicated. You'd have to set it a lot of stuff. I love it though. I love it

98
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,760
I love it

99
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:56,160
I know it uses a sequel like database to store a lot of configuration and probably the watch status too

100
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:56,480
I don't know

101
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:00,400
I think I have there's a lot that appeals me to a popes old device and also to wimpy solution

102
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,400
Yes, the thing the one thing I like about

103
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:08,720
Something simple is I guess I'm trying to I'm trying to punt for as long as possible on setting up a server in the rover

104
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,560
At least I'd like to get through the end of winter

105
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:17,360
I don't know, but we'll see maybe maybe maybe a NUC and a little hard external hard drive

106
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,240
It's just I don't know. I don't know. It's a lot to set up

107
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:25,960
Yeah, it is it is and I've already I've already set up two in two other places and I have a third on digital ocean

108
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:30,080
Right now so it's like do I really want a for how much infrastructure? Do you want to be responsible?

109
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,000
Yeah, I just uh, it's getting I'm getting tired of it

110
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,720
I want something to move to a smaller house, but with more devices because it basically I don't watch media that often anymore

111
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:42,600
But right. Yeah, it was and then of course I'm thinking to myself. Where is my dang?

112
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,640
my dang purism laptop because I could just

113
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:52,560
Do that right now. I could just as a 1080p display. I could watch some 1080p on there. I

114
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,080
Got nothing

115
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:01,560
Yeah, yeah, I agree I might just do VLC I might just do VLC and an NFS mount over the net

116
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:06,840
I don't know. I could do that too. And to be honest, you know, both ambient plex have pretty good solutions here

117
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,880
So I might just watch to see what they do too, right?

118
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:14,400
I'm that MB that MB sync folder sync thing might be a nice go-between in the meantime, right?

119
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,720
Interesting to try anyway, you'll have to let us know

120
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,900
This is Linux unplugged episode 121 for December 1st

121
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,880
2015

122
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,880
You

123
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:39,840
Welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly the next talk show that it wants its portability and its horsepower

124
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,500
My name is Chris. My name is Wes. Hello Wes

125
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:46,240
That might be a little hint to something we're gonna talk about later in the show today. Oh look at you Chris

126
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,960
I know look at me teasing in fact coming up on today's episode of 121. We got a lot

127
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:56,480
We're gonna start with a little look back over some recent things that developed including from the GIMP project a topic

128
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,480
We touched on last week Fedora 24

129
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:03,560
Has got something brand new that no other distro is doing and I'm gonna put it to the virtual lug

130
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,800
Is this maybe something we should all consider setting up on our own Linux installations?

131
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:12,680
We'll talk about that and then later on in the show. It's the tiny mini itsy bitsy PC revolution

132
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:19,120
Whoa, in fact there have one right here in studio. We got it right here. It's called the Omega onion

133
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,960
Yeah, and it is a modular stackable PC, but there's a lot

134
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:28,640
You know we've also got that new Raspberry Pi micro mini thing tiny little computer that's done stuff floating could probably put Cody on

135
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,200
Um oh, and then in the end of the show I

136
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:39,120
Can't believe it Wes here. We are December 1st 2015 and Adobe has announced. They're killing flash really well

137
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,520
Not more. Yeah, it's yes

138
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:48,480
Yeah, don't believe the headlines, but I thought you know what we will tell you what's happening, and I thought why don't why?

139
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,960
Don't we just chat about what we do as Linux users to avoid using flash whenever possible

140
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:57,860
And I am on a flash anti crusade this week because it basically locked up my accession this week

141
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,040
So Chris has got an agenda to well

142
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,520
I'm gonna grind some gears to be honest with you and then towards the end

143
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,120
Maybe even in the post show if we have some time

144
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:11,440
I'm gonna ask the virtual lug what they're thankful for kind of as an homage to what we did on Sunday's

145
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,040
Linux action show that's on a stuff West yeah, that's great

146
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:20,480
I'm pretty sure what's a big show, so why don't we get started by bringing in our virtual lug time appropriate greetings mama room?

147
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,880
So guys guys

148
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,560
I don't know how many of you are gamers

149
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,280
But I talk about steam games way too much so I want to just mention something really awesome

150
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,680
When a total kickbutt open-source game has an update and it's a big update

151
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:44,280
Warsaw 2.0 released with better graphics creative commons license game assets all that goodness with a 30 to 50 percent faster performance

152
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:51,520
New heads-up display all kinds of weapon parameter tweaks, and it's that game that has that cool cell shaded effect

153
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,960
Oh, yeah, yeah, this is a cool cool open-source game

154
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:59,180
And I kind of left it off my list accidentally on Sunday

155
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:02,720
And so today they have a brand new update West a brand new update

156
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,120
And I already installed it this morning and played it a little bit. It's a lot of fun

157
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:10,440
It looks like a lot of fun. We should set something up people to play it and it's a real fun window to land game

158
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:14,040
It's really easy to get going and because it's open-source everybody can be on the same version

159
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:20,800
No awesome CD key generators required or anything like that so Warsaw 2.0 release congrats to those guys

160
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,800
I just want to give them a shout a shout out

161
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,960
Because yeah

162
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:31,240
Because we should have probably mentioned it on Sunday now something to follow up on from last week's episode 120 of Linux unplugged

163
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:38,720
We talked about GIMP hitting 20 years old quite the milestone on a years old and now can't quite drink yet

164
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:45,360
And it doesn't get a discount on rentals, but they do have some brand new features that they released

165
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,080
Just after Linux unplugged came out like they heard our show and they're like boy those dicks

166
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:55,580
Let's show let's show what let's let's show those guys those Linux unplugged bastards over Jupiter broadcasting

167
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:00,240
So they came out with a new update and they've got some good stuff in there now

168
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,880
Of course as I'm done to find the chat room points out GIMP can now drink in most

169
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:10,320
most countries yeah Rod and are you still around and did you catch anything in this GIMP update that

170
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,520
Caught your interest because I know you were kind of hard on GIMP last week

171
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:19,000
Yeah, they've actually made some announcements that they're they're gonna be using

172
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,120
GEGL

173
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:27,240
Do non-destructive editing in the future they don't have that right now, but thanks to the GEGL

174
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:32,000
They're also doing 16-bit and 32-bit projects, right so that's

175
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,600
some

176
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,440
Fundamental things that that was missing so they're I'm optimistic

177
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,800
But very cautiously optimistic we call it GEGL. I think that's more fun

178
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,440
Yeah, but

179
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,120
No

180
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:56,240
Yeah, I mean so the 32-bit thing's a big deal also huge improvements to open up PNG TIFF and PSD files

181
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:02,120
Which if you think about people that are making the migrations, that's a big deal and and one of them, huh?

182
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:06,920
The PSD thing is the PSA thing is overrated because you think they're saying that you can open up things

183
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:13,200
That's true, but there are things that you can't open regardless of the they're better supporting the format

184
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:17,680
But the majority of PSDs are gonna have features that are not going to be available

185
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:23,400
So for example, if you try to open up a CMYK PSD just breaks. Yeah. Well, yeah

186
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:27,680
Yeah, that makes sense and also some new canvas rotation tools that some people are said well, okay

187
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:32,440
We've kind of needed that for a long time. I mean at the same so there's a it's it's it's sort of what we talked about

188
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:37,600
Last week. It's really hard not to talk about the GIMP and talk about how it's not stacking up to the commercial alternatives

189
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,160
And I kind of tried to make the case last week that really what we should be

190
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,300
Stacking it up against is anything else in this class that is free, right?

191
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:50,360
Because in this it's not that free is an excuse for not high-quality

192
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:54,280
It's that free is an enablement for a certain class of humanity that cost

193
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,880
Sometimes there's a huge barrier for

194
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:03,640
Hello. Hi there. Hi there. So I mean I'm I I I wish GIMP was more competitive at the same time

195
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:09,200
I'm really glad they've steadily improved the way they have in it. Yeah, I don't follow the development that closely but

196
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:14,520
Potential it seems like there's a little bit more renewed interest, you know, they've got the new website design out

197
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:18,520
I still think looks nice. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. They're pushing forward on some features. We'll see

198
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,640
I think you know, obviously I'm continuing to watch

199
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:26,880
I'm optimistic about it mainly because of a lot of the things that was really frustrating me that they didn't have

200
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,760
They're implementing now and they're bringing in

201
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,320
CMYK support they haven't officially given like a date when it's coming

202
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,560
But they have announced that it's coming and they're bringing them plugins for that are

203
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:45,020
Trying to get like layer styles and stuff like that, but just the fact that they are actually, you know

204
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:49,100
You know telling people that they're even doing this is an improvement

205
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:51,940
They're you know, printing out press releases and stuff

206
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:57,860
they've never done before and like they've they've changed a lot of their direction, which I appreciate as

207
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:01,300
someone who wants him to be a solution, but

208
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:05,860
Based on the you know, 20 years of it not being remotely

209
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:09,940
Relevant to me as a professional. I'm

210
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,700
Cautious, but I hope I'm wrong

211
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:17,540
All right, I'm gonna be it. It's actually going to be great. I'm gonna be that guy. I

212
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:22,460
Hate that I have to be that guy, but just consider this is Chris putting on his devil's advocate pants

213
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:25,460
It says devil's advocate right on the butt there. Thank you. Thank you. I

214
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:32,300
Is is it really just a matter of too little too late and I the reason I don't mean because you know

215
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,780
Photoshop's the thing because that's obvious

216
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:40,820
I mean, I've been reading a lot of reviews about people that are now drawing on tablets like

217
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:47,620
Odyssey Westra who joins us frequently right draws on a tablet and very very good drawings

218
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:54,020
The Apple's iPad Pro just came out with their hundred dollar pencil and their thousand dollar tablet for drawing

219
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:59,540
there are a lot of apps out there now that take the touchscreen and maybe like a

220
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:04,580
Peripheral and you are now like reaching an entire different audience

221
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:09,860
And and the reason why I wonder if this is kind of a little too little too little too late kind of thing for gimp

222
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:13,100
Is the audience those types of devices are reaching is?

223
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:21,860
The casual average everyday person the exact kind of person that gimp is perfect for only not all that appealing to and so I

224
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:24,820
Look at this and I go about 20 years now and now we're at a point

225
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:29,440
Where guys like poppy are trying to replace the desktop PC with an Ubuntu phone?

226
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:32,460
I'm like are they're gonna get to 25 years and then

227
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:38,700
That that usage that that that desktop paradigm is gonna be out of date and there's gonna be even less people using it than ever

228
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,700
before I

229
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:48,380
Don't know well, it's a as a professional I'm not looking at using a tablet except for a wacom tablet

230
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:54,980
So though those are just perfectly great using on a desktop and you would use that with gimp or something to say if gimp had good

231
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,460
enough feature set

232
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,460
Yeah, I mean right now I use

233
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,220
illustrator and Krita

234
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:05,620
Right and but see you're looking at it more from a professional angle and that seems pretty legit and I don't think you could really ever

235
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:06,620
replace

236
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:11,700
Like the wacom tablet and the desktop level applications for any kind of serious work

237
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:15,380
But if you want to sketch something out you want to just doodle a little bit

238
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:18,900
This is almost too much stuff and it's too much complication

239
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:24,660
But yet the very people it's appealing to you are people that maybe are not high-end professionals. Do you want am I making sense?

240
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:31,540
Yeah, I wonder if there's a distinct categories to like in in at least in in America, you know first world countries

241
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:32,540
I think I think you're right

242
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:36,660
I think that people you know have enough means that if they want a nice drawing environment

243
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:42,620
That's easy to use and doesn't have all the crazy features. They can get a nice tablet or something like that. I wonder about maybe

244
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:49,820
The developing world, you know places where they have less access or they can't kind of expense this spend that money on a whim to get

245
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,820
Just something for drawing, you know as a hobby

246
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:55,460
Maybe maybe that's what you can have more of a place if you're drawing

247
00:17:56,060 --> 00:18:01,380
Not just like if you're creating design, right? It's more of Karita in Inkscape

248
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:06,940
Yeah, yeah, if you're if you're doing web design game, maybe it's a better tool

249
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:12,740
But yeah drawing I would push Kimpa side because I doesn't have the features that create a house, right?

250
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:16,400
I think really I still free and open source line and speaking of Albert Odyssey Westra

251
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:22,060
create I believe is what he uses to do his drawing so that and that that makes sense I was just kind of what I

252
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:26,900
Was postulating was is if the average use case is perhaps becoming more and more niche for GIMP, right?

253
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:29,420
It does kind of see it does seem that way but at the same time

254
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:34,540
One more thing. Yeah, go ahead. Yeah, right the the the the introductory like the beginner

255
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:41,780
Introduction to drawing is actually easier for a desktop because you can get a Wacom tablet for 50 bucks. Mm-hmm

256
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:44,940
So you could actually get you know, use create

257
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:52,420
I use a Wacom tablet and or even use something else and you'd be able to do a lot more for a lot less

258
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,540
To just to get it started

259
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:57,780
You know what else is kind of interesting for me from a technology standpoint

260
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,780
And I'm probably nobody else really cares about this

261
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,380
but GIMP is

262
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:09,100
Obviously a showcase of what the GTK toolkit can do right and Corita in its own way if I believe is QT

263
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:14,980
Right, so you have two completely different toolkits here that the two big toolkits being used to create two very high-end

264
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:17,980
Art applications. Where does Inkscape fall in this?

265
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:23,340
Is Inkscape GT GTK? I don't know. Yeah

266
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:28,020
It is. Yeah, okay. It's just fascinating from a couple of different angles to watch these two applications

267
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:32,820
Even though as somebody that has zero art skill that doesn't totally really ever apply to me

268
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:38,540
Funniest thing about GIMP and the GTK toolkit is

269
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:46,300
The fact that the newest version of GIMP has a 2.9 point X has like a much improved theming system

270
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:49,140
Why can't they use it?

271
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:54,820
Like they built a cool toolkit. They built a cool theming system yet GIMP is still hideous

272
00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:01,420
It's kind of weird that they build the fundamentals, but they don't have the ability to use what they build

273
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,820
Yeah, that's unfortunate. Yeah, I mean

274
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:09,220
Yeah, I guess I do agree. That is pretty it is it is there's a lot going on

275
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:14,260
You can make that customization argument with almost anything

276
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:18,740
Look at Gnome lots of theming potential there

277
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:23,700
But really there's only about four strong themes out there that really look good

278
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:29,300
Yeah, I had to fall of Gnome looks pretty good just by it by itself. All right, it's okay

279
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:35,940
Well, it's when you compare it to things like XFCE that oh, yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely

280
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,940
I mean, it's it's a good design

281
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:41,940
Even if it's not perfect, but it's a little okay

282
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:47,900
Ed way to is a weird design but yeah, the shell itself is nice. Yeah, you put arc theme on there

283
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:51,860
You're good to go. Yeah, you're good. Have you installed the arc theme? I have that's from the yeah

284
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:54,940
That's that's pretty slick. That is a seriously great theme

285
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:58,860
yeah, and then you just mix and match the icons as you feel at it and I'm telling you I

286
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:02,820
My personal opinion is I don't think there's a better looking desktop

287
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:05,860
If you match the icons you go all dark and you put the arc theme on there

288
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,860
I think it's the best looking desktop on the planet

289
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:15,260
So yeah, yeah gnomes are and why whatever is your yeah Unix point, right? I should you're right. Well, it's right here

290
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:16,060
It's on all my rigs

291
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:20,660
They've slowly over time what I what I what I found is kind of interesting is I just sort of landed on this in each

292
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:24,980
Of my gnome installations too. It's not like it's not something I don't sit down and go. Oh god. It's all the arc theme, right?

293
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:26,620
No, it just kind of happens

294
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:31,940
Anyways, I mumble room any other thoughts before we move on from the GIMP topic or create or anything else wimpy

295
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:34,460
I know there was you'd ping me at one point was there anything you wanted to add to the chat?

296
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:42,100
I know I think you've covered it just that some creatures and better tool for freehand drawing. Yeah, then gimp gimp is a photo editor

297
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:46,860
Yeah, I'm glad we made that point because I didn't want to yeah, I didn't want to walk away from that. I had something. Yeah

298
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,740
I don't think it really

299
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:54,940
replaces the tablet and everything because there are different use cases totally the

300
00:21:55,420 --> 00:22:01,020
Tablet is a console is not a console. It's a consumption advice device not a

301
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:04,900
Production, I think that's starting to change though

302
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:05,980
You know

303
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:12,220
You look at Microsoft with their surface and you look at convergence device that are coming and you got iPad pros now with keyboards and pencils

304
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:14,260
I guess

305
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:21,020
Laptops that have touchscreens and stuff. Yeah, even like I've tried hooking up a keyboard with a tablet never

306
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:23,260
It's just not the same as it really is. No, I do agree

307
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:29,900
It's not there yet totally different feel but I wonder if it's there enough enough if it's there and for some people who do want

308
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,340
To create, you know, they don't need a futz with anything

309
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:33,580
They just want a canvas and enough to work or you know

310
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:36,140
Like so my mom is a professional graphic artist, right?

311
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:40,700
And so one of the things that I know she would do is you start with a sketch and you could do that on the tablet

312
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:44,700
And then you move it into Photoshop where you get the actual work done would be how she would look at it

313
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:49,740
I start with the outline on this nice little touchy device here that lets me draw maybe at the coffee shop

314
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:54,020
You just got your tablet. Yeah, or actually I'm at the client meeting the clients talking to me

315
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:55,220
Just do it right there in the meeting

316
00:22:55,220 --> 00:23:00,420
But then they can they can you know send that out in different formats and bring it into like Adobe Sketch is a thing

317
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,420
Even on the tablets and yeah

318
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:06,940
So yeah, it's interesting just to see that particular use case getting eaten up eaten up by that

319
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:09,740
But yeah in the long term if you want to sit down and do any serious work

320
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:13,900
I mean for her I maybe that's just because she's been doing it for so long now

321
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:19,820
But she will never ever ever consider replacing her desktop with a tablet ever

322
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:25,220
So yeah, but maybe for somebody heavens. Do you want to take us out on the last note here? Mm-hmm

323
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:30,580
Yes, the one thing that I think for you know open so much software might

324
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:34,140
Be a little bit

325
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:37,980
The underdog is that the producers are creators of the software

326
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:43,380
Do not need to force their consumers to buy their product

327
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:48,900
So they might not be or have incentive to actually make it really good or at least worth money

328
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:53,220
Or another way to say that is they don't have to they don't have to chase the shiny

329
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:57,460
Yeah, even though a lot of people can get paid for doing gimp work

330
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:01,860
They don't really need to you know, sell it do a lot of PR

331
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,940
Yeah, I think that's not why that makes them

332
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:10,060
I think it's the the the amount of money that they don't get money from it and they're not trying to sell it is

333
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:15,020
Not necessarily a bad thing, but it does make their production slower

334
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:21,760
So if they had more that they did like a Indiegogo or something where they could get money and pay more developers to do more

335
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:27,300
Faster GIMP would be a much more relevant program, but because they take so long to do

336
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,700
everything

337
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:33,820
That's one of the reasons why it's just you know fall behind so much

338
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:40,340
Even in the open source field because I mean if you if you're wanting to do basic editing, you don't really go to camp

339
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:47,160
There's stuff like pinta, which is much smaller simpler much easier to use and if you're gonna do like really

340
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:50,180
Extensive drawing you don't go to get by there you go to create it

341
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:53,740
So I mean GIMP is even falling back in the open source field

342
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,340
hmm

343
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:59,580
Boy, there's more to shame. There's more to this conversation than I first thought. Yeah, definitely

344
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:03,580
I'm curious to hear what the audience thinks listening because I feel like I feel like this is one of those conversations

345
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:08,260
Or maybe somebody's listening and screaming at their car stereos are driving down the road or something. I don't know anything

346
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:13,900
Yeah, which we don't that's fine Linux action show our reddit.com episode 121 if you would I'd like to hear your thoughts

347
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:17,980
Because this is fascinating because GIMP to me is just such a great case study

348
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:23,900
Such a good one for so many different highlights and you know, maybe some of the low points of open source. Mm-hmm

349
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:30,540
Mm-hmm, you know speaking of highlights our first sponsor this week digital ocean use our promo code get ready for this right in your face

350
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:38,100
Do unplugged one word lowercase $10 credit digital ocean is a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated offering most intuitive and easy way for you

351
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:42,180
To get your own rig up on their kick-ass servers Linux freeBSD. It don't matter

352
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:45,820
They got a great infrastructure all Linux rigs powering everything

353
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:52,220
SSDs for all the disk IO KVM for the virtualizer 40 gigabit e-connections for their data centers

354
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:54,540
It's rockin go check them out

355
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:59,540
You can get started less than 55 seconds and pricing plans are only five dollars a month for 512 megabytes of RAM

356
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:02,700
20 gigabyte SSD one CPU under terabyte of

357
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:08,380
Of transfer terabyte terabyte 40 40 gigabit. I mean, that's great West

358
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:11,300
Did you ever did you ever work on any kind of projects or stuff?

359
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:18,000
Like five six seven eight years ago that where you had to get like a co-located server and like put an actual server in the rack

360
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,200
It's a pain. It is huge pain

361
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:20,460
Yeah

362
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:25,500
And the cost is is nuts and and so when I say a terabyte of transfer in these reads

363
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:30,240
I can't help but look I mean I can't help but think back to when a terabyte of transfer

364
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:36,120
at the average transfer price was a thousand dollars just for a terabyte of transfer a

365
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,760
Thousand dollars just for the transfer, right just for you can get that for five dollars

366
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:45,460
It really blows me away and then the fact that the whole thing is like exactly the kind of infrastructure

367
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:49,120
I would build if I could like just have an unlimited budget and have at it

368
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:53,720
That's what exactly I would build and then like even if I could build like what I would I would do Linux

369
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,560
I would do KVM. I would do SSDs

370
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,760
I would do crazy great data centers and connections

371
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:02,560
But the thing that I could never do which is really awesome is that interface. Oh

372
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:06,960
Oh that interface is crazy great simple intuitive extremely powerful

373
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:13,840
Somehow they managed to do it and and what's not only great about that is not only did they manage to get those three impossible

374
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:20,680
Things actually accomplished, but they did it on an interface that manages virtual machines. Okay, that's crazy. That is crazy to my face

375
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,440
That's new to the world. I think it's new to the world

376
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:28,600
So use the promo code deal and plug to get in on that s and get it for two months absolutely free and also they have

377
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:33,560
A great API to extend that all the way up into the rest of the world that really means there's a bunch of great apps

378
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:37,280
So even if you don't know how to write nothing you can go take advantage some good stuff great tutorials

379
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,800
They got fedora 24 up there now

380
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:45,240
They got of course all your favorite Ubuntu's your Debian's your CentOS's and even that core OS and last but not least

381
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:50,320
Free BSD. Oh my goodness free BSD is even up on that digital ocean now

382
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:54,160
I don't know why you'd want to use that. I just tease. I love you guys, but go check it out

383
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:57,000
Use the promo code do unplug support this show. It's one word

384
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:03,520
It's lowercase, and it gives you a $10 credit isn't that something amazing you can support your favorite Linux talk show and try out

385
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,520
Digital ocean two months for absolutely free

386
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:12,900
Digital ocean comm use the promo code do unplug in a big. Thank you to digital ocean for sponsoring Linux unplugged Linux unplugged

387
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,840
Thanks you guys

388
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:21,280
Alright, so those crazy guys who you know we got folks in here that work on their own distributions

389
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:24,560
We got folks in here from canonical. We got folks in here from Sousa

390
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,880
We got folks in here from a gross time to time

391
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,920
We got folks in here from all these different districts. You know we don't know this yeah

392
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:33,680
Thank you know you you know where we don't have reoccurring folks from

393
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,920
fedora

394
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:39,160
So I'm just gonna speak for them, and if I get something wrong. It's their fault. Yep

395
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:44,160
I'm just that I'm correct us you are an open invitation here, but I think this is kind of neat

396
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,000
I think it's a neat idea

397
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:50,600
And it's something I wanted to bounce past you and the virtual lug to see if maybe it's not something we all want to consider

398
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:54,240
Doing on our own Linux rigs so fedora 24. It's that crazy distro

399
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,240
That's coming out in the future in the year

400
00:28:56,280 --> 00:29:02,240
2000 and it's going to support Wayland and something else that I think is a really good idea especially somebody who's on a slower

401
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,240
high latency internet connection a

402
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,200
default local DNS server

403
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:15,400
they say plain DNS is just plain insecure and therefore vulnerable from various attacks like cash poisoning a

404
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:21,040
Client can never be sure that there is a no man-in-the-middle type scenario if they don't do DNSSEC validation locally

405
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:26,840
We want to have the unbound server install and running on local hosts by default on fedora systems

406
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:31,320
And also we're necessary have DNSSEC trigger installed so what?

407
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,040
The fedora project is planning to do is

408
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:39,680
include the unbound DNS server set up as a default local host res resolver and

409
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:44,600
Then it'll go out to the rest of the internet if it can't find the name for something you're looking up and

410
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:48,320
I wanted to start with us, and then I wanted to bounce it around the Mamba room

411
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:52,520
I can think of in an enterprise how this could nest maybe actually be a bad thing, but

412
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:57,920
Have you ever played with setting up local DNS on your LAN and have you ever noticed anything?

413
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:01,000
And what are your thoughts on fedora just including it by default well?

414
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:06,600
I think it's I think it's true because doesn't network manager already it uses DNS mask locally. I believe by default

415
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:10,960
You might think that I think they have those good points. Okay. I think where this is different one

416
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:16,200
They're using unbound yes who if they're specifically setting up DNSSEC support and yeah, all right

417
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:20,440
So let's break that down in two parts, so let's start with why the local DNS. Why do you think?

418
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,840
I mean, I think it's helpful

419
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:26,920
I know like network manager wants to use it for things like split horizon DNS. This is one thing

420
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:29,160
I hope fedora gets right like for me. It's important it works

421
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:35,160
that I can have a set of DNS entries that are resolved over the VPN connection and then routed over the VPN absolutely right so

422
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:40,160
If that doesn't work then that could be pain in our vice environments where you need to be referencing name servers that get updated

423
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:44,760
You know at a set pace or not not that uncommon. Yeah, no definitely not

424
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:49,640
But I think it does give you a lot of control it also lets you cache things locally which you know that's never bad

425
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:55,040
You know I was thinking about from that angle the you know back in the rover the Wi-Fi connection right high latency connection

426
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:59,680
And if I can make every time I go out to the web a little tiny bit faster

427
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:04,240
That sounds appealing to me now. Can you touch a little bit on the DNSSEC thing so DNSSEC?

428
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,840
So they're going to be they're going to unbound now, and they're going to be doing DNSSEC

429
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,760
What do you think about that?

430
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:13,200
Do you think it's maybe time for all distros to consider doing DNSSEC out of the box?

431
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,600
I don't know if I would say I think it's I think it's good that fedora is exploring this

432
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:23,280
You know it does seem like there are a lot of potential vulnerabilities with DNS setups without DNSSEC

433
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:26,920
Maybe it doesn't go far enough. I don't know further discussion there is needed

434
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:30,200
But I think fedora serves usually as a useful point where in Linux

435
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:33,560
They kind of try something at a scale fully integrated into their environment

436
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:37,040
And if it works other distros will adopt it if not you know we can kind of see it

437
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:41,600
I'm excited to try Fedora 24 and see if it works. Yeah, that is actually a good point like we don't have to do it everywhere

438
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,000
Let's let Fedora try it. I mean like in a year or six months

439
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,600
Well, I think we'll see like how well does it work, but it does I mean I've only ever heard good things about unbound

440
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:54,240
So I would imagine it works pretty well now look at BNX BNX NT in the chat room says an emphatic

441
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,280
No on DNSSEC

442
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:02,680
An emphatic no now. I don't anybody in the mumble room know why that might be because I I'm not a DNSSEC

443
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:07,600
Yeah, no neither mine about that, but he linked us here says DNSSEC is unnecessary

444
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:11,400
All secure crypto on the Internet assumes that the DNS lookup from names to IP addresses are insecure

445
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:16,200
Securing those DNS lookups therefore enables no meaningful security because all the other stuff is

446
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:21,520
Already thinks it's insecure. That's an interesting point right there actually. I like this from two standpoints

447
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:27,200
I like it obviously from the performance standpoint, and I've been experimenting with DNSSEC myself for about a month

448
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,680
Oh really yeah, and I I haven't really once I did it

449
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:35,000
I didn't I actually forgot until today when I was like oh yeah, we're gonna talk about this today

450
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:40,120
I've been using it for a month on my XPS, and I forgot I even had it. That's a good thing

451
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:46,200
Yeah, so I haven't from an end-user standpoint. I feel like it. Just gives me a little more peace of mind mm-hmm

452
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,640
Because I know that that stuff is not in here's I

453
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:56,400
Don't mean to sound like I'm repeating myself, but I do not trust any wireless carrier any of all now right

454
00:32:56,400 --> 00:33:01,200
I mean how many of them have those super cookies right and so in the rover I have I have

455
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:07,960
Right now. I have a couple of different connections and and been depending on which one strongest is the one I'll use and so I've got

456
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:14,400
A unlimited my fight advice from Ting when you know it's you pay for what you use right that I'm feeling pretty comfortable

457
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:19,040
with I really have no issues, but the one that has stronger signal where the rover is parked at is an AT&T

458
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,440
Yeah, if I hotspot and that one. I'm pretty uncomfortable with

459
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:26,800
You know they view super cookies in the past where they think they are yeah

460
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:30,920
And and they yes they are and they inject it into HTTP traffic right now

461
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:36,960
And so those kinds of things make me super uncomfortable because all of my internet is going to be

462
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:43,800
All of my internet is going through that right now, and so I start looking at it's things like DNS sec or VPN tunnels

463
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:48,240
Or you know HTTPS everywhere, and I start thinking if I could add these different layers

464
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,520
What it really does is give me peace of mind

465
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:54,280
And it I almost wonder if we won't get to a place

466
00:33:55,280 --> 00:34:01,560
Six five seven years from now where we go wow I can't believe we did so much stuff over the net unencrypted like it'll just

467
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:06,120
become a commonplace for encryption for HTTPS and DNS sec and all these kinds of things because

468
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:11,040
It's not even about the encryption. It's about the validation of the endpoint

469
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:17,180
It's about validating who you're talking to is really who you intend to be talking to and I think that's the aspect of it

470
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:21,480
That will take off over the next few years, and this is going to become obvious that what do you mean?

471
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:25,680
It's what do you mean? It's not encrypted. They're just spewing plaintext to whoever wants it. Yeah, that's crazy

472
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:30,060
Yeah, somebody could just be intercepting that how do you know you're actually talking to that person right? I think that might be

473
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:36,660
Really sort of a cultural thing and that's why I'm a big fan of let's encrypt as well is because it kind of plays into

474
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:41,460
That same thing and you know it allows some dude like me to have an own cloud server that you know has a let's encrypt

475
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:44,260
Certificate have at it that your friends with your friends use it

476
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:49,140
They won't yeah walk because there's a little red X in the corner exactly or if say I set up my own matter most yeah

477
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:55,300
Server it'd be another nice thing for that a mumble room anybody have any thoughts on setting up local DNS pros and cons and if

478
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:58,620
Anybody has done it anybody in the mumble room set up a local DNS server and using it right now

479
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:01,780
Yes, and what do you think a good bad?

480
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:03,860
I don't know

481
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:06,940
It's not a big deal anymore because it's part of my deployment configuration

482
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:10,940
So it just gets applied to all my machines, so you and you install a local DNS server on each machine

483
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:13,940
You're not just doing everything your lamb now. Why is that like roaming machines?

484
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:18,660
So it's nice to have the local DNS server when you're out on the go that kind of thing yeah, that's a good point

485
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:22,520
Yeah, that's not a big deal to run it even on the machines that are already behind another level of cache

486
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:28,020
Right and what are you using to do the local DNS DNS mask, okay?

487
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:30,020
Just because it was simple and why not unbound oh

488
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:34,640
Not unbound because I'm familiar with DNS mask yeah good reason yeah

489
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:39,120
I was thinking I was thinking DNS mask seems like the go-to, but then when fedora said well

490
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,380
We're gonna go unbound I went looked it up

491
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,800
And it looks like it's really easy to set up and get going yeah

492
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,740
I was thinking about maybe doing it looks pretty solid and I don't need the DHCP server from DNS mask

493
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:49,740
So I might consider it it seems like that depends on how flexible it is

494
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:56,100
Yeah, DNS mask has a lot of flexible settings to allow me to hit different DNS servers for different domains and that kind of stuff

495
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:58,100
I don't know if unbound is all the same functionality

496
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:02,740
We'll have to hear some report I kind of want to try it I do yeah

497
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:04,620
Because I've been deploying DNS mask as well

498
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:08,060
Yeah, that's just cuz that's what I write you how to use yeah, and that was always kind of the go-to

499
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:14,660
So vert which I want to say vendetta online, but it's a vert in the window a vert in the vert

500
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:21,700
It's a nudah very I knew that you there we go. I like it so you use it for VPN host resolving tell me about this

501
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:27,300
Yeah, basically okay, if you tie in your own name servers

502
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:31,040
You can resolve your individual VPN hosts for your token subnet

503
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:35,100
So what I actually do is I set up a DHCP server

504
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:40,900
Which links to my DHC my DNS servers by T SIG to set up okay?

505
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:48,100
Mapping for my VPN server for VPN clients and when they connect to the VPN they can either automatically resolve each other's

506
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:50,460
host naming on the VPN

507
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:54,020
Because they get the information from the DNS server care others been punched

508
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:58,020
It's it's a very easy way of doing it and and funny and funny enough

509
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:01,620
Okay, this is exactly what Tink ended up doing for me as well really

510
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:04,740
Into the VPN setup yeah

511
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:10,900
Basically once you resolve one host secure on that yeah, it will resolve hosts for all the other things so Tink is something that

512
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:13,580
my my oh

513
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:17,620
God, I just want to make sure you were saying Tink and not ting for the audience listening. Yeah

514
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:22,100
Yeah, so Tink is like a mesh vpn solution. Yeah, okay, and I was about to say the same thing

515
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:23,460
You know I like the local DNS

516
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:27,060
Yeah for that reason is that you can set up your own you can use your host file

517
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:31,060
But if you have a local DNS, it's a little cleaner. Yeah, you're figuring everything in the same spot. Yeah

518
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:33,060
Yeah, you can replicate that

519
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:35,060
Yeah, using local host file

520
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:38,900
Well, it just feels hacky. Yeah, all right and go ahead. Sorry vert. Did you want to finish?

521
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:45,780
Well, no, I was just saying okay, that's you with Tinker right it makes it a little bit easier because because you're doing over a

522
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:49,060
VPN anyway, you can now sync between each machine

523
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:51,820
Okay, right the host files we need to connect to each other

524
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:57,180
So you basically build up your own dark day if you like because only the host you're connecting to will know about all the other

525
00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:01,140
hosts that you're connecting to right right and of course DNS is

526
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:03,920
There's several different DNS options for PFSense

527
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:11,940
JB live 87 54 is pointing out that PFSense has unbound as an option for PFSense servers. So there you go

528
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:16,040
Um, you know, I know that now that we've talked about this

529
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,820
I wonder if maybe I might not

530
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:23,580
Tonight go give this a little try at the rover and see how it goes. I'll report back

531
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:28,180
Maybe well, you know what? Maybe if it goes really well, I might make a segment on the Linux action. Yeah, that sounds fun

532
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,820
I'm watching that. Yeah, that'd be interesting

533
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:35,660
So all right a mumble room any closing thoughts before we move on any other DNS experts or DNS?

534
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:42,060
Experienced want to know go in once go in twice. All right. Very good. Very good. Good talk

535
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:44,060
Thank you guys for the information and also

536
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:47,860
You know what I should do is I will include a link

537
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:53,860
Same they go down here to the segment at the bottom of the segment in the show notes where we talked about fedora 24

538
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:56,580
I will include a link to the issues with DNS sex

539
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:59,340
So if you guys heard us mention that and you're curious what those issues are

540
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:03,100
I just added that link to the show notes so you can go and go read about that s

541
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:07,060
Maybe you can poke Alan and you guys can do a follow-up. I wonder if Alan has any thoughts

542
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:09,540
I bet he does you and I are on the same page my friend

543
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:14,940
Hey, I don't know if you notice this West but we relaunched the last jacket for a kind of I think I want one

544
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:16,940
I need one. You should definitely

545
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:23,820
So it is back it is it is awesome and you can find them at teespring.com slash

546
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:29,060
Last us or if you're across the pond and you don't want to have to pay exorbitant shipping amounts

547
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:36,620
slash last EU and here's the real shenanigans you get in on that order right now because we're only running them until December 13th

548
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:38,620
It's gonna ship in time for

549
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:43,780
The holidays. Oh, yeah for your loved ones. Yeah, you know just put a lot of the best network

550
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:46,700
Put a last jacket in every every single stocking

551
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:50,300
But really we have multiple colors and you can go grab yourself a jacket

552
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:52,300
These were maybe our most

553
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:56,620
Favorited item that we sold last year. We only run them for a limited time and then they're all done

554
00:39:56,620 --> 00:40:00,180
So go to teespring.com is item last us or last

555
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:06,060
You it is a collector's item and it keeps your tummy warm and depending on how you zip it up

556
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:09,220
No, man boobs, which is really if you got man boobs. No, man, but cover your shame

557
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:12,460
Exactly no judgments. No judgments

558
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:20,140
We also we also have a link on the sidebar at Jupiter broadcasting.com teespring.com slash last us and last EU and the EU has better

559
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:25,200
Color options so you could actually be in the US in order from the EU if you want to get like some crazy colors

560
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:30,640
Yeah, they've got all the best stuff. Teespring got a good deal set up over there. Apparently they apparently over there

561
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:34,120
They know how to print and make sure it's real good. I see. Yeah, that's the thing

562
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:39,360
I want to tell you about something else. It's a thing. It's one of my favorite sponsors Linux Academy

563
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:43,480
I think this is a great fit for you guys because it's a great resource for you to go learn more about the systems

564
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:47,920
We all love what's great about Linux Academy is sort of what I think is great about Jupiter broadcasting

565
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,920
That might be one of the reasons why I think they're a great sponsor

566
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,920
They actually care about Linux and open source

567
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:58,920
Turns out when you actually care about Linux and open source and then you make content about Linux and open source you do it better

568
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:01,720
Than other people because you actually live and breathe this stuff

569
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:06,240
You actually care about this and you follow it from day to day go to Linux Academy comm slash

570
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:14,600
Unplugged Linux Academy comm slash unplugged to get our special discount and support this show. It's a really good deal Linux Academy freaking rocks

571
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:17,840
They got seven plus distributions you get to choose from they got like almost

572
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:23,100
2,000 self-paced courses with videos and high-quality contents you can downloads on the offline

573
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:30,560
Everything's backed by a nice CDN with HTML 5 players. They have instructor help available for you whenever you need it

574
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:36,580
Which is a really nice feature. They got labs. They spin up on-demand. They got the AWS courses for the Amazon stuff

575
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,080
And the reason why I mentioned that is

576
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:45,440
I kind of found myself one time having a client that all of a sudden was my responsibility and had

577
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,640
AWS infrastructure primarily around s3 at the time, right?

578
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:54,120
I did not really in that's not like Linux as we know it or anything like that

579
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:58,320
It has its own unique works definitely does it definitely does now

580
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:02,240
I've told this story before but I can't remember the exact number now because it was several years ago

581
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:06,920
But when I was just sort of playing around on this three trying to figure out how to do things before I wouldn't charge them

582
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:09,080
How to do it or even just said yeah, I know how to do that

583
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:12,600
You know, I actually want to see if I could do it. I think I racked up like a $300 bill

584
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:16,000
I need it was something around there. Yeah, it was ridiculous

585
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:21,220
So what's really cool is regardless of what you know, you're learning Ruby. You're learning nginx or learning IP tables

586
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:27,280
You're learning how to do basic development or maybe you're learning AWS. They'll spin up the lab servers for you on-demand

587
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:31,940
They have a really great interface. You can SSH right in and rock that s they have scenario based labs

588
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:36,200
Which is really nice because that gives you really good hands-on experience

589
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:40,740
You'll work in their advanced live environments while completing these scenarios from beginning to end on live servers

590
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:45,700
Isn't that nice break somebody else's stuff? They have real-time feedback, too

591
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:51,680
They have great courses for the red hat certified courseware and they have instructor help available at any time

592
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:54,940
Nice content always getting updated refreshed

593
00:42:55,540 --> 00:43:00,740
And keep track of your progress as you go along. They break things down into our lease. It is really cool

594
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:02,140
They have an availability planner

595
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:07,840
You can go into Linux Academy and say how much time you have availability and how much time you have available and they'll automatically

596
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:12,020
Generate the courseware to match your time availability. I think that's really really cool

597
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:13,780
Yeah, I mean that seems pretty unique

598
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:16,740
Dude, like so flexible even in the holidays when things get busy

599
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:22,520
You can find a way to like sort of schedule in like few hours a couple hours on Tuesday, you know

600
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:25,580
Dude, you know do while you're listening to JB content

601
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:29,980
I'm gonna listen to JB content for this hour while I have unplugged going on in the background. I'm gonna go do this

602
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:35,040
Yeah, you know what? Why not? Yeah, you can do all the time or in the shower, you know, it's a thing

603
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:41,880
It's a shower touch tablet in there open up your SSH session. You're good to go. Hey, oh, that's why you need a pencil

604
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:45,280
So the other thing I think is really great is they upgraded the server exercise

605
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:49,380
You can get your work evaluated while connected to a real server

606
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:54,340
Their courses include exercises where you log into a lab server and perform specific tasks in Linux Academy

607
00:43:54,340 --> 00:44:00,100
Automatically grades your actions so you can see how well you did graded exercises are included in all Linux Academy memberships

608
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:02,180
They have a great step technology stack

609
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:09,540
Everything you'd want built around Linux including some of the simple things like our sink or IP tables or just basic Linux commands

610
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:16,540
Like tar like seriously fundamentals all the way up the entire stack all the way up to the Red Hat stuff Android development Python Ruby

611
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:19,980
PHP nginx Apache now I always go off on the list here

612
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:25,980
But you guys know all of the big technologies out there that are popular Linux Academy probably knows even more than you do

613
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:29,500
That's why they follow this stuff. They are following the heartbeat of open-source, you know

614
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:33,380
Like they just see what people want. They're seeing what's popular and because they use it themselves

615
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:38,700
You know what? They should take that and run with it. They are following the heartbeat of open-source Linux Academy

616
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:42,100
West is just an idea guy. You got to run with it. Yep, but he's gonna give that to you

617
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:46,180
We love you. So go to Linux Academy comm slash unplugged

618
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:50,020
We ask you to go there because that supports the show lets him know you heard about it here and you can check out their

619
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,140
services

620
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:55,180
But really it gets you a phenomenal discount Linux Academy calm

621
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:58,180
Slash unplug

622
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:02,780
Okay, Wes, so you had an idea which I once once we started kicking it around

623
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:03,440
I was like

624
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:10,340
This is a great idea because there is a lot of stuff happening in this space and you know when

625
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:13,180
When you first started kicking around this idea

626
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:18,340
If I had a little more time, I was gonna go over to the Computer Chronicles website

627
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:21,240
I was gonna get a clip because you know

628
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:26,940
We used to call the computer back in the 80s what we now call PCs and laptops and desktop

629
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:32,540
They called mini and micro PCs right because they weren't mainframes. Yes, you could fit them in, you know more than

630
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:35,700
Yes, so

631
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:42,900
Now here we are on the Linux unplugged show and we're once again about to talk about micro PCs or mini PCs only now

632
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:46,740
We mean something that isn't like an Intel based high-end powerful desktop

633
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:50,460
No way the history is repeating itself on the Linux unplugged show today

634
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:56,260
and to start off the conversation we want to talk about something that's kind of been big news over the last few weeks and that's

635
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:58,260
the Pi Zero and

636
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:01,100
This video will introduce us to it

637
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:09,120
These are two computers from our childhood so the BBC microcomputer I bought one of these in 1989 for 220 pounds

638
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:11,320
This is a Commodore Amiga. I bought this in

639
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:15,900
Christmas of 1992 for 199 pounds of leases and leads

640
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:19,860
When I bought each of these machines, I had to basically just drain all the money

641
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:22,460
I had I had to drain my bank account my piggy bank and you know

642
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:25,480
All of my savings went into each of these machines at the time that I bought them

643
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:31,940
When I was a kid the high cost of computers like these was a real barrier to me learning about

644
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:35,620
computers and really what we've been trying to do with Raspberry Pi is to

645
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:40,260
Make sure that cost is never going to be a barrier to anyone who's interested in getting involved in coding

646
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:47,560
When we launched Raspberry Pi we took about a factor of five out of the out of the cost of a typical low-cost computer

647
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:53,020
But we still meet people for whom you say tell us that cost is a barrier to entry for them

648
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:58,180
So lately this year since the Raspberry Pi 2 effort wound down in February

649
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:02,220
We've been we've been asking ourselves what we could do to maybe take a little bit more cost out

650
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:05,940
And today we're launching a new product. This is Raspberry Pi Zero

651
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:12,420
This is a full-fledged Raspberry Pi. We've got a 2835 here and half it says it's the same chip

652
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:17,300
We used in Raspberry Pi 1 except up clocked a little bit. So it's about 40% faster. Got half a gig of RAM

653
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:23,900
HDMI connector SD card USB to connect mouse and mouse and keyboard nice and the same pin out

654
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:29,260
Although it's not populated the same GPIO pin out that we have on on modern Raspberry Pi's on the B

655
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:31,260
Plus the A plus and the Pi 2

656
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:36,540
I'm just going on sale today. We've made a few tens of thousands of these this is going on sale today from our distributors of

657
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:38,020
five bucks, so

658
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:40,020
Five you just can't believe that

659
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:41,740
five

660
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:43,740
US greenbacks

661
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:46,740
Unbelievable

662
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:53,700
Unbelievable West and I I just I look at this and I think holy crap. This is the future. We're living in now and

663
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:58,700
I can't I just can't even wrap my head. They've already sold out. I believe I think they yeah

664
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:04,700
Yeah from a lot of retailers. Yeah, which is just whoo. Wow, but they'll be back. So the show show. Yeah

665
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:08,380
What's the magazine about what's the chair? I'm talking about the magazine. What's everybody talking about the man?

666
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:14,660
Oh, this was awesome that basically but when they first announced they were gonna do five dollar things. They also said well the

667
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:22,780
Pi mag magazine that was it's a community magazine and it's six dollars to purchase if you purchased one

668
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:30,180
On the day or a couple days after it was the reply zero was attached directly to the magazine cover

669
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:36,740
It's over like six bucks. I got a magazine and oh my gosh you you buy the make you so in the UK when it came

670
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:37,540
out

671
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:43,500
Like every news agent sold out of the the magazine straightaway because you know

672
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:45,940
It's a free computer on the cover who wouldn't who wouldn't want that?

673
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:51,100
But if you're a subscriber to the magazine you can you can still get it

674
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:55,340
And also in the US where they're coming a little bit later in the month

675
00:48:55,380 --> 00:49:00,060
You can all wait you can get the mag pie magazine over there with the same rosebud pie on the cover

676
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:06,240
What the ghost name some people have some people have joked that you you buy a pie zero and you get a free magazine

677
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:08,860
Exactly. Yeah

678
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:14,220
Remind everyone I care of my generation that back in the day of early day computing

679
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:19,520
Okay, you used to get cassettes on the front of magazines free with them now you're getting computers

680
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,300
Yeah, and I remember when I was a big deal

681
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:21,620
Yeah

682
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:26,380
When you got a like Linux format came with a CD with a Linux distro on there or something

683
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:31,500
So yeah, the this $5 computer has a 1 gigahertz arm 11 processor

684
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:39,300
Which was 40% faster than the first Raspberry Pi 512 megabytes of RAM a micro SD card slot a mini HDMI socket for 1080p output

685
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:41,300
with 60 frames per second and

686
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:43,460
Of course, it has the 40 pin GPIO header

687
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:51,280
We love that and it has a unpopulated composite video header and it is 65 nanometers 65 meters

688
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:58,620
Millimeters, sorry by 30 millimeters by 5 millimeters and it's not even if the course there's the chip it now the chip is sort

689
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:02,260
Of been of course the chip wasn't exactly as cheap as they originally said it was going to be right

690
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:06,940
But you also have things like we have right here in the studio. We have this Omega onion

691
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:11,560
In the box Alan has one of these he's been talking about this too, you know

692
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:15,700
I hadn't heard too much about it, but that's a shame because these seem really cool. Yeah, it was a Kickstarter

693
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:21,340
I backed and how could I not back it after they had this crazy crazy crazy great Kickstarter video

694
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:26,460
So I want to talk about the Raspberry Pi zero and also this Omega onion check out their Kickstarter video

695
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:36,460
There are two worlds

696
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:42,020
The real world and the digital and then there's the cat world

697
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:46,420
Oh the lovely cat world

698
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:54,340
The problem with the two worlds is that in order to connect objects in the real world with the digital world?

699
00:50:54,620 --> 00:51:00,340
You need to be a rocket scientist or some sort of physicist from the Manhattan Project

700
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:03,460
Or one of those brains in a jar

701
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:05,900
But not anymore

702
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:07,900
meet onion

703
00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:17,420
For the past year we've been hard at work building something that's small

704
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:22,340
Affordable and really easy to use so that we can merge the two worlds together

705
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:28,460
We wanted to be like Tony Stark and be able to build whatever comes to our mind without

706
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:33,820
Learning how to build these things and that is exactly why we created this

707
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:35,260
the

708
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:37,180
onion Omega

709
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:39,180
Thanks Oliver

710
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:44,220
It's a tiny computer with built-in Wi-Fi and it runs the Linux operating system

711
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:44,380
Hey

712
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:51,300
Oh, you know that little bad boy lets you create connected devices in environments that you're already familiar with using tools such as

713
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:57,140
SSH get an NPM and it also allows you to write software in Python

714
00:51:57,140 --> 00:52:04,940
No dot J at PHP or whatever language you feel comfortable with node.js now have the power to build anything you can imagine

715
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:07,620
such as smart home devices

716
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:14,380
Security drones drone security spiders spider

717
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:20,740
That's amazing I want it or even a cat feeder

718
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:26,740
A cat feeder that realizes your cat is too fat and then makes it exercise

719
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:30,500
Nice laser or if you don't want to build from scratch

720
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:34,020
You can browse the onion app store for ready-made apps

721
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:38,100
In fact, if you want to see what you can build on the Omega right now

722
00:52:38,620 --> 00:52:42,540
Click on the live demo below and start to experience the Omega in real time

723
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:49,540
The Omega allows me to build things in languages that I'm that I already know and using things that I'm familiar with like callback functions

724
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:53,420
And I actually built this light bulb in just 10 minutes and it's remote-controlled

725
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:57,180
I really like working with the onion Omega. It was really easy to use

726
00:52:57,180 --> 00:53:02,780
I'm not a programmer or an engineer of any kind, but I went to the onion app store and I was able to build a lightbulb

727
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:07,340
It was really easy to use. I'm not a programmer or an engineer of any kind

728
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:13,740
But I went to the onion app store and I downloaded and customized an app that allows me to draw images from my Facebook newsfeed

729
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:16,220
And put them into a digital photo. She's a high school teacher

730
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:23,500
The Omega is almost ready for production

731
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:28,940
We're so close to realizing our vision of making the Internet of Things accessible to everyone

732
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:33,660
And we want you to be a part of our revolution and start inventing your own

733
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:40,620
And we want you to be a part of our revolution and start inventing connected devices that will make our world a smarter place

734
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:43,580
Right, Oliver?

735
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:48,140
What happens when we connect the real world with the digital

736
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:51,820
Awesomeness

737
00:53:51,820 --> 00:53:55,180
There you go, Wes. Are you ready to take part in the revolution? Do you want to unbox the onion?

738
00:53:55,260 --> 00:54:00,300
Yes, I do. Have at it there. Okay, so it comes in a very small box. It's very smooth

739
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:04,860
It's a nice premium cardboard. The in the hand experience for the box is quite nice. I do agree

740
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:08,940
Yeah, and uh, it's got like a puzzle piece. It does it kind of comes apart

741
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:13,340
Yeah, because yeah, it has a actually very much a puzzle piece top. It's literally a puzzle piece, isn't it?

742
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:19,500
It's kind of hard to get open and then three individual boxes. So there's the expansion dock right here. Yeah, very nice

743
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:24,700
Oh, look at that. Yeah, so it comes and then here's the actual uh, here's the omega box. So that's the omega

744
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:25,740
Yep, yep

745
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:30,060
And so I got the mini dock and the expansion dock and that's where you can plug in different stuff

746
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:35,020
so I guess we can here I will uh, I will turn on the uh, the webcam a

747
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:40,540
A limited uh limited exclusive treat on the unplugged show here. I'm going to pull the omega out of the box right now

748
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:44,960
Look at how cheese. It's even smaller than it looks in their kickstarter video. It's unbelievable

749
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:47,900
It's smaller than the palm of my hand

750
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:50,860
Wow, look at that. Look at tiny that is

751
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:53,100
That is ridiculous

752
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:56,380
That is ridiculous. And there's the expansion. Oh my gosh

753
00:54:56,380 --> 00:55:02,220
Gosh, this is a tiny tiny linux computer. Wow, wes. Oh, these docs are cool too. Look at this thing here

754
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:05,740
I'll take that doc. Here you go. So this is the bigger. So there's two docs

755
00:55:05,740 --> 00:55:10,860
There's a mini dock and then there's the big boy expansion dock and that's this one here. This is the big boy mini expansion

756
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:14,380
And uh, yeah, so you plug in

757
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:16,860
the omega

758
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:19,100
To the top of the expansion dock right here

759
00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:24,380
So it plugs into the top of the dock right here and now it has all of the functionality that the dock has

760
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:26,380
Dang, yeah

761
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:30,140
Which which in this case is a usb port and then another set of expansions which seem perfect

762
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:34,060
If you're prototyping and you want to you want to use those things, but you're not ready to solder on headers, you know

763
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:38,940
Isn't that something so you just snap it together? Wow alan was talking about this on the tech snap pre-show

764
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:41,580
Uh, wow, there's micro hdmi

765
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:42,780
Huh?

766
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:43,580
Yeah

767
00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:47,980
So that's pretty much so there's your usb port for your input and there's your hdmi out right there

768
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:50,300
And it has wi-fi on it

769
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:55,820
Man, you could just duct tape that behind your tv and really go put mbi on this and my problems are solved

770
00:55:57,580 --> 00:55:59,580
So that really seems to flirt with the uh

771
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:05,100
You know flirt with the border before we kind of had the arduino on one end of the spectrum and the raspberry pi on the other

772
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:08,780
And you have the full linux experience or you have you're writing it in c++ yourself

773
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:13,680
And this is like well, you can if you're familiar with linux, but you maybe you're not an expert in microcontrollers

774
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:17,820
You can just deploy it right here and you're here one way you go. No kidding

775
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:20,940
And ver you've had it you you've had a chance to play with it. What do you think?

776
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:27,340
Yeah, it's a really sweet

777
00:56:27,980 --> 00:56:33,500
Tiny little pc it is and it is so easy to set up because basically when you power it on

778
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:38,540
Although be careful because the power switch is very fragile on the docks. Anyway, yeah when you power it on

779
00:56:38,540 --> 00:56:41,100
Okay, it becomes its own self access point

780
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:46,700
It does so basically you just scan the wi-fi network find the you know

781
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:50,780
So omega whatever is uh access point as ssd

782
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:52,620
Join it

783
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:53,820
Go to the web

784
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:58,220
Configure it set your passwords your ssh set your network set your other wi-fi networks

785
00:56:58,700 --> 00:57:05,980
And it will basically uh, just reboot if you're right into a proper pc on your network. It's fantastic. That is really awesome. It's running open

786
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,220
Wrt

787
00:57:08,220 --> 00:57:10,780
Okay. Okay. Isn't that something isn't that something?

788
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:15,340
Uh, I I think it's sort of astonishing because it's I have the specs in the in the show notes

789
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:20,140
I just find it astonishing that it's it's getting to the point now where you know, I just backed some project on freaking kickstarter

790
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:24,700
I believe alan said he was making uh, he was setting up instructions for freebsd as well on this game, right?

791
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:27,180
Which is awesome. Yep. So yeah, it ships with open wrt

792
00:57:27,260 --> 00:57:31,260
It has a 400 megahertz processor 64 megabytes of ddr2 ram

793
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:34,860
16 megabyte of flash got 802 11 pgn on it

794
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:37,420
Has 184 gpio. Yeah, it's

795
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:42,780
I love isn't interesting how they list node.js as a supported. Well, that's important. Yeah. Yeah

796
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:47,980
Uh wimpy, I kind of wanted to pick your brain because I know you've hinted before on some pre and post shows that

797
00:57:48,380 --> 00:57:51,580
And I haven't gotten got I have quite not yet gotten the complete picture

798
00:57:51,580 --> 00:57:56,940
But the raspberry pi is starting to play a more and more important role for the ubuntu mate distro, isn't it?

799
00:57:58,620 --> 00:58:01,360
It's our most popular platform

800
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:08,700
Wow, you mean you mean other than x86 or including x86 it's more popular than

801
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:13,040
An x64 bit 32 bit x86 holy shit

802
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:17,920
That's crazy. Wow. Oh my world has just been rocked. Are you kidding me?

803
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:20,640
No, it's downloaded about

804
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:24,480
1200 times a day the image for the party. That's awesome

805
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:26,560
Wow

806
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:29,920
That's serious. That is that is so what are your thoughts on that?

807
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:37,520
Well, it means that in the last two releases of ubuntu mate. I've done the work for the pi version

808
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:43,520
In the last month of the release right but for this release it's got even

809
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:49,760
You know, it's being treated equally all the way through the development stage now

810
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:53,760
I I feel like I need to take a minute

811
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:56,480
Like I wasn't ready for that level of a bomb to be dropped

812
00:58:56,480 --> 00:59:01,600
I don't know why I didn't know that because I kind of feel like I should have known that but I did to me is

813
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:07,840
Shocking to me actually, I've actually I've actually been paying attention to a lot of communities around raspberry pi and you know

814
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:10,160
reddit or google plus in various different places and

815
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:13,780
The majority of times people asked what to put on the pie

816
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:19,120
No, raspbian is no longer even mentioned and went to the bunta mate is always the first choice

817
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:21,480
I mean it makes it makes it does makes I mean it's way more

818
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:25,760
Pleasant to use and the defaults and it looks pretty with me. That's a that's a big deal though

819
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:30,520
I mean congratulations because that's a big deal and so when you look at these types of devices

820
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:35,960
Are you starting to say? All right, this these aren't just sort of toys. These are going to become

821
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:40,880
Possibly the next open PC now

822
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:43,760
Hold on before I I don't want to make sure I'm framing this right

823
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:50,700
but when I look at tablets and phones I get a little sad because they look locked down and glued together and I

824
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:55,900
I remember a time when I was in high school and I scraped together parts for

825
00:59:55,980 --> 01:00:01,140
Months and months and months and built my first PC. I wouldn't picked out my own case and it was

826
01:00:01,860 --> 01:00:05,560
It was it was a life moment for me and you learned a lot

827
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:11,340
Ton of stuff and I read I read I mean it was really my first geek project that I really researched and all that kind

828
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:13,100
Of stuff and now I look at this

829
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:18,820
Onion Omega here and I'm sitting here like Legos building a PC and I think geez I could give this to my kid and he

830
01:00:18,820 --> 01:00:23,260
Could play Minecraft on this and maybe not this one, but the Raspberry Pi zero

831
01:00:23,260 --> 01:00:26,420
I mean I I this is maybe getting to the point now where

832
01:00:28,180 --> 01:00:35,740
It is actually going to be something that has some serious long-term legs as a serious desktop contender and one more thing wimpy before

833
01:00:35,740 --> 01:00:37,740
I toss it back to you is I

834
01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:40,040
in the late 90s

835
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:47,220
had a conversation with a guy named Scott really great guy and his job his day job was to run an IBM mainframe and

836
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:48,860
he

837
01:00:48,860 --> 01:00:50,700
looked down at

838
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:52,700
desktop PCs as toys

839
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:58,300
That couldn't do real work that didn't weren't powerful enough and he called he called the desktops

840
01:00:58,300 --> 01:01:05,260
Oh, you mean those Mattel inside PCs those Mattel inside because they were toys right and you know and I look at the Omega

841
01:01:05,260 --> 01:01:07,180
And I go this is a cute Lego toy

842
01:01:07,180 --> 01:01:12,980
But actually maybe I'm looking at it from Scott's perspective and when you when wimpy says he's getting over a thousand downloads a day

843
01:01:12,980 --> 01:01:17,620
I'm wondering are you looking at this and are these mini PCs these Raspberry Pis and these

844
01:01:18,060 --> 01:01:23,260
Omegas and and bagel bone and all whatever are you looking at this and going this might actually be something that

845
01:01:23,660 --> 01:01:26,620
Gets wider adoption use than the traditional PC one day. I

846
01:01:27,580 --> 01:01:34,580
Think so certainly if you look outside of the developed nations. I think this is going to be the print the arm based

847
01:01:34,580 --> 01:01:42,500
Devices are going to be the principal computing platform. And if you're not doing stuff on arm, you'll be irrelevant

848
01:01:43,220 --> 01:01:45,700
Wow bad time to own Intel stock

849
01:01:46,420 --> 01:01:51,620
Yep. No, I think that will that will be relevant. It'll be a different market and different use case

850
01:01:51,620 --> 01:01:58,180
but I think that we're we've not seen the extent to which arm is going to be relevant for

851
01:01:58,700 --> 01:02:02,520
For Linux adoption and in particular Linux as a learning platform

852
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:08,320
Kids and kitty you kind of point out. I mean this these kind of machines get the basic work done

853
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:14,840
And well that kind of solves a lot of people's problems. Don't isn't it doesn't it? Yeah, I was just thinking, you know

854
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:21,520
What do 90% of what you do on a computer consist of web browsing email?

855
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:26,360
Editing a text file that kind of thing maybe watching a YouTube video

856
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
The pie can handle all that

857
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:34,640
Yeah, and so and it's not even see I think what I used to brussel at is I used to feel like we were talking down

858
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:36,640
and I kind of

859
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:38,560
hmm, I

860
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:40,560
wonder if I still do feel that way so

861
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:48,680
Something that that Carl said a few times during our visit at system 76 is one of the things that they're basic

862
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:53,720
Market research keeps and market research being you know being in a business for ten years selling PCs

863
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:59,480
One of the things that they have really learned maybe even the hard way is you can always err on the side of giving people

864
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:04,960
More powerful computers like there's there's never going to be a day where people don't need more powerful systems

865
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:10,000
And so I guess I kind of had that Scott like view where I looked at this and go well these these these

866
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,160
Little toy computers will never be powerful enough

867
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:17,440
But that is sort of looking at it in a in a perspective where there isn't

868
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:20,440
Lots of different things that you can do

869
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:26,720
It's a perspective where there isn't lots of different cloud options when you need to spin up like a droplet to do something really powerful

870
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:29,800
Or throw it on Google engine or whatever the hell as you're I don't care

871
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:33,960
There's a lot of different options there when you need really really really high-end compute

872
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:39,720
And there's a lot of options when you when you need really really a local something local really high-end

873
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:41,080
You can still have a desktop

874
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:47,120
But there are so many so many use cases where I've worked with people where their primary job is checking email

875
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:50,720
You know we're doing doing things on their corporate applications

876
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:55,600
Which are sometimes web applications sometimes not and they do all of these things that are really sort of

877
01:03:57,360 --> 01:04:01,000
Low-end tasks, and it's not to be I'm not trying to be rude

878
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:08,280
I just like that's just all they use these particular quote-unquote tools for and so why what what what does it take then?

879
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:16,120
What does it take to make it from the hobbyist project to actually something that consumers could actually start start buying like why don't we have?

880
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:22,720
Why don't we have a Best Buy that has more ARM laptops and desktops on the shelves then they do x86 machines?

881
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:27,280
Why isn't Lenovo selling a an ARM an ARM laptop?

882
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:32,760
Why is an HP and Dell selling an ARM laptop that we're all buying and and and before we go there?

883
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:37,620
I also I want I'll have you answer that first quest, but before we go there you found this again

884
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:43,540
This is a perfect example of where the Raspberry Pi is really cool, but this is a straight-up hobbyist project

885
01:04:43,540 --> 01:04:47,040
I like it, and so I'm gonna point out to the audience so they can read more about it

886
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:50,760
But it's it's a great you it's great example of where the Raspberry Pi is being used today

887
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:54,120
And it's it's this is not even an uncanny valley issue

888
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:57,560
This is way far removed from what consumers want anyways

889
01:04:57,560 --> 01:05:03,600
This is you can make it you can take a Raspberry Pi and a Wi-Fi dongle and basically turn it into like a remote

890
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:10,800
Airplay receiver or audio receiver, so you can use a couple of projects that reversed Apple's airplay

891
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:12,080
right

892
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:17,400
Protocol and actually stream to this instead of having to go get like a really expensive device if you have iOS devices in the house

893
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:20,880
And you want to stream audio you can do with this Raspberry Pi. Yep. It's pretty cool

894
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:25,440
I I think that it's because a lot of people don't know that it's an option

895
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:27,300
But if you show them that hey

896
01:05:27,300 --> 01:05:34,120
There's this 35 another $50 option that you can utilize instead of spending a thousand dollars on a workstation

897
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:40,920
I think people would go for it if they knew what it was actually capable of I

898
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:44,680
Don't agree. Do you agree? I don't it's a smart. It's a smart business

899
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:49,620
Here's why because this is what I'm this is what I'm saying is this what I'm asking you is

900
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:52,440
And Wes I'll let you have the first answer, and then we'll throw it to the moment room

901
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:59,080
Why why is nobody picking up on this? Why is Leno? So Lenovo today can take a

902
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:06,600
Intel spec motherboard an Intel CPU they can build a PC from parts that they assemble themselves in the housing

903
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:12,960
And then they ship why can't they take something like that Raspberry Pi or something just like it and build their own version?

904
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:18,520
Put it in a case with a great keyboard and ship it. Why is that not happening?

905
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:22,140
I'm not sure that they I mean I think you could do it

906
01:06:22,140 --> 01:06:25,280
But I don't know if they see the opportunity in terms of operating systems

907
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:29,400
I mean, I think that Android isn't there as a desktop operating system

908
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:31,120
Maybe if they had partnerships with like I mean

909
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:36,300
I think what we see is Chrome OS Android isn't there or is it that Google creeps people out well

910
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:41,060
Maybe both and I think like you know for the main people who are using desktop. They're comfortable with Windows

911
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:43,780
You know a little newer one

912
01:06:43,780 --> 01:06:49,120
Maybe they can now that like Raspberry Pi 2 will run Windows Windows 10 right so there may be an avenue there

913
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:54,000
But but I wonder if they don't see like something they can rebuild well hmm. What was that run?

914
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:58,280
It's an incredibly stripped-down Windows 10. It's not really Windows 10. That's a good point

915
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:03,080
Wimpy you think there's like that one piece really that's holding it up

916
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:06,600
well, not that's holding up, but I think that

917
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:11,200
For example that the things that I run into most with the question and answers

918
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:15,900
For up into Marte on the Pi 2 is can I run flash on it?

919
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:19,680
Which you can't right because there are no flash binaries for ARM Linux

920
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:22,560
Can I run wine on it?

921
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:27,820
No, or yeah, yes, you could kind of compile it in a certain way, and it runs really badly

922
01:07:28,620 --> 01:07:34,480
And you get those sorts of questions and people aren't aware that it is just because it runs Linux doesn't mean it runs

923
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:37,580
Everything that you're used to running on you know

924
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:44,400
Intel so don't call it a Linux. I mean right we're so used to Wintel Google got away with that by calling them Chromebooks

925
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:49,440
Yeah, exactly well and and and to some extent also

926
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:53,480
You know rolling their own version of flash to bridge bridge one of those yeah that too

927
01:07:53,480 --> 01:08:01,800
Yeah, but you know if you're Lenovo or Dell you've been selling to a traditional audience of x86 users

928
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:07,700
Who will be expecting to use the same or similar software and when some of it's not available there?

929
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:12,480
Maybe that's some that's a tough call, but you know so they're they're selling

930
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:17,860
Chromebooks and some of those in the Far East are ARM based now

931
01:08:17,860 --> 01:08:24,780
Yes, that's pointing out that the things that are not available are the evil proprietary things. Yeah, I know so

932
01:08:24,780 --> 01:08:30,420
Pretty so that's all as well. Yeah, well, and we were just discussing. You know this average

933
01:08:31,180 --> 01:08:35,660
Just basic work type task type work where the computer is a tool

934
01:08:35,660 --> 01:08:41,220
They might not care as much as much about some of these things in fact in a work environment

935
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:45,620
Not having flash is a security advantage and a work productivity advantage

936
01:08:45,620 --> 01:08:47,620
Right like legitimately

937
01:08:47,780 --> 01:08:53,380
So I I guess I still I don't I don't feel like we have fully answered that question

938
01:08:54,300 --> 01:08:55,380
I

939
01:08:55,380 --> 01:08:58,340
Don't know what it is exactly I think

940
01:09:00,260 --> 01:09:02,780
The problem is that we look at it different

941
01:09:03,700 --> 01:09:08,020
we present it actually the wrong way because we presented as the

942
01:09:09,260 --> 01:09:11,260
replacement for a PC right

943
01:09:11,260 --> 01:09:16,140
Whereas we shouldn't be telling people that because it's well

944
01:09:16,140 --> 01:09:20,500
It's not capable of everything you can do on your desktop like it is not

945
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:24,780
GIMP is not a replacement for photoshop. It is a separate line of tool that is available

946
01:09:25,580 --> 01:09:30,020
Yes, but what you should show people is like

947
01:09:30,020 --> 01:09:36,140
this is a cool thing that you could use to browse Facebook with right or put up in your kitchen and

948
01:09:36,140 --> 01:09:42,140
Look at recipes with and all you need is a you know some screen and something to you know

949
01:09:42,140 --> 01:09:48,140
a keyboard and a mouse and you have a your tiny computer in your kitchen, right and then you can

950
01:09:48,540 --> 01:09:51,580
Show them that look this what you've considered

951
01:09:52,380 --> 01:09:57,660
To be just a recipe looking at device is also capable of those other things

952
01:09:58,380 --> 01:10:01,980
Instead of showing them that this is a computer

953
01:10:01,980 --> 01:10:08,780
That this is a computer that's not capable of all the other things that you are right using your computer

954
01:10:08,780 --> 01:10:14,940
That's that's actually pretty good insight because that's why the smartphone has been so successful is because it was in as far as it

955
01:10:14,940 --> 01:10:18,060
Was replacing the dumb phone which was a not a high bar

956
01:10:18,060 --> 01:10:24,620
And so you could like Apple could launch their overpriced iPhone that didn't even have copy paste support for like two OS's

957
01:10:24,900 --> 01:10:29,740
Because the bar wasn't that high and when you come in and you say I'm replacing the PC

958
01:10:29,740 --> 01:10:35,980
Well, guess what pretty high frickin bar pretty high for that makes sense. Have you seen what PC can do PC do what?

959
01:10:36,060 --> 01:10:38,060
Yeah, right exactly

960
01:10:38,220 --> 01:10:40,220
Damn it Wes screw you

961
01:10:40,940 --> 01:10:45,260
That is the worst advertising campaign ever, but it worked son of a gun

962
01:10:45,340 --> 01:10:49,740
All right vert you want to talk about the future making everything a little bit smarter. Go ahead

963
01:10:52,540 --> 01:10:58,220
Yeah, well basically with this kind of dropping computing and more specifically sophisticated computing

964
01:10:58,220 --> 01:11:02,940
It means these little devices like the pie zero or the Omega

965
01:11:03,660 --> 01:11:11,180
Can now be turned into a general purpose kind of smart sensor or smart device that can be plugged into anything

966
01:11:11,180 --> 01:11:14,780
Basically, you know displays well like this article

967
01:11:15,980 --> 01:11:18,500
This article that Wes found before the show is you know

968
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:22,300
You take a simple speaker and now all of a sudden this is a quote-unquote

969
01:11:22,300 --> 01:11:26,260
I mean if I was in the industry a smart speaker because it can receive Bluetooth or

970
01:11:26,260 --> 01:11:32,180
Airplay or DLNA audio pulse also multicast as well or MPD

971
01:11:32,180 --> 01:11:35,700
Yeah, in fact, this is actually using pulse to send from your Linux box. I mean

972
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:43,660
A classic example is that it causes now I actually have a pie acting as a alarm clock

973
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:46,700
for my partially sighted father

974
01:11:47,060 --> 01:11:52,740
Because he can't necessarily see the display all the time and so he wants to be able to hear it

975
01:11:52,740 --> 01:11:58,760
So it's a talking clock and we can now it's a talking clock tech to the Internet it can now read things like emails and how

976
01:11:58,760 --> 01:12:02,300
Do other things that it wouldn't be able to do that sounds great or horrible?

977
01:12:04,220 --> 01:12:06,220
Yeah, good point wimpy I

978
01:12:07,060 --> 01:12:09,060
also have noticed

979
01:12:09,420 --> 01:12:13,740
Especially when it comes to a demographic that I am intimately familiar with my children

980
01:12:13,780 --> 01:12:20,780
There is some essential use cases that the pie is totally capable of like things like YouTube or Minecraft

981
01:12:20,780 --> 01:12:24,180
And that is pretty a poor by a huge core audience. Wouldn't you think?

982
01:12:25,180 --> 01:12:30,740
Yes one it can do and one it can kind of do so when I've been going along to the pie jams

983
01:12:31,540 --> 01:12:33,300
I've been

984
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:38,460
Taking an Ubuntu mate set up and getting makers and other you know

985
01:12:38,460 --> 01:12:42,020
Visitors to come and have a look and have a play and give me their feedback

986
01:12:42,020 --> 01:12:44,420
And it's interesting that when the kids go on it

987
01:12:44,420 --> 01:12:49,460
They basically want two things they want to be able to play Minecraft and they want to watch YouTube and if it doesn't do that

988
01:12:49,460 --> 01:12:54,580
It's irrelevant. That's that's the end of a discussion and it has to be able to play Minecraft without

989
01:12:55,340 --> 01:13:00,460
Quote-unquote leg right and leg is frame drops. I guess I don't know exactly what leg is

990
01:13:00,460 --> 01:13:04,460
But so there is there is a Minecraft version for the pie

991
01:13:04,460 --> 01:13:09,940
It's the Minecraft pie edition, which is a bit like the pocket edition of Minecraft

992
01:13:09,940 --> 01:13:16,300
Ah, but it comes with Python bindings so you can you know, you can program it and what have you?

993
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:18,780
and YouTube

994
01:13:18,780 --> 01:13:24,060
At the moment, we don't have the fully accelerated graphics driver for the for the chip

995
01:13:24,060 --> 01:13:26,060
That's on the Broadcom sock in the pie

996
01:13:26,740 --> 01:13:27,860
so

997
01:13:27,860 --> 01:13:31,020
That's all software at the moment and that's a bit poor

998
01:13:31,020 --> 01:13:36,340
But I've embedded a utility in Ubuntu mate where you can suck down

999
01:13:36,340 --> 01:13:44,020
You can visit YouTube within Firefox and pull the cut and paste the URL and then it will stream the URL into the IMX

1000
01:13:44,020 --> 01:13:46,020
Player which is the hardware

1001
01:13:46,020 --> 01:13:51,980
Assisted player so you get the full hardware assisted full screen playback streaming from YouTube ever

1002
01:13:52,020 --> 01:13:55,140
So actually you're kind of getting into my next segment

1003
01:13:55,820 --> 01:14:02,220
Our next segment is is really some clever tricks to avoid having to use flash all together partly because arm

1004
01:14:02,220 --> 01:14:04,780
But also because of Adobe's announcement this week

1005
01:14:04,780 --> 01:14:09,580
So pause right there wouldn't be and let's pick that back up because that's actually a perfect segue to our next segment

1006
01:14:09,580 --> 01:14:11,580
So I'll mention the perfect telco

1007
01:14:11,580 --> 01:14:16,780
Friends it actually exists because their business model is different ting is mobile that makes sense

1008
01:14:16,820 --> 01:14:19,820
Ting is an MV no of a couple of different networks

1009
01:14:19,820 --> 01:14:23,420
So instead of like getting all involved in like digging the trenches

1010
01:14:24,020 --> 01:14:30,540
Installing the towers running the fiber fighting the local city council to make sure they can actually run a tower right there

1011
01:14:30,540 --> 01:14:32,540
Which is an unbelievable fight?

1012
01:14:32,660 --> 01:14:36,660
Contracting with the designers to design the tower and all and it's interesting as a contractor

1013
01:14:36,660 --> 01:14:39,940
I've worked at each stage of the process for the and watch telco

1014
01:14:39,940 --> 01:14:42,180
It's interesting when a telco comes into an area

1015
01:14:42,740 --> 01:14:45,940
It's both an amazing investment for the local businesses

1016
01:14:46,340 --> 01:14:49,700
And it is it is just a nightmare for the telco

1017
01:14:49,700 --> 01:14:53,980
So it's an incredible investment for the local businesses when a telco wants to put a tower in

1018
01:14:54,220 --> 01:14:58,340
Because they're gonna have to trench and run fiber to that location and a lot of times

1019
01:14:58,340 --> 01:15:01,940
They'll resell that fiber to all of the other local businesses in that area

1020
01:15:01,940 --> 01:15:08,020
But can you imagine the administrative overhead just to manage that but at the same time like there's all of the local rules like you know

1021
01:15:08,020 --> 01:15:10,300
Like oh for here. It's the PUD

1022
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:14,820
It's our it's our public utilities that they have to like get approval from where the poles can be at all this kind of stuff

1023
01:15:14,820 --> 01:15:21,020
Then they have to take it to an architecture firm to design the tower the tower then gets approved by the local city which then

1024
01:15:21,020 --> 01:15:25,380
Goes off to the state to get approved and then and it's all paying right in checks the whole way

1025
01:15:25,380 --> 01:15:27,760
Right sounds like a lot of work right in checks, right?

1026
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:30,820
So what Ting has done is they right on top of all of that?

1027
01:15:30,820 --> 01:15:33,220
So that's why they're able to invest in the customer

1028
01:15:33,220 --> 01:15:38,820
So the other guys have done the work there and now they need somebody to come along and actually get some customers on it

1029
01:15:38,820 --> 01:15:43,100
That's where Ting comes in. So it's six dollars a month for the line flat rate right there

1030
01:15:43,100 --> 01:15:45,820
And then it's just your usage on top of that. No contract

1031
01:15:46,300 --> 01:15:51,400
Nor the termination fee and because Ting isn't out there digging ditches. They're able to have

1032
01:15:52,140 --> 01:15:57,140
Fanatical customer service they're able to have a great website and they're able to charge

1033
01:15:57,460 --> 01:16:02,060
Incredibly low rates and if you're just a like a little bit savvy with how you use things you can get by with

1034
01:16:02,060 --> 01:16:07,180
Unbelievable rates, so I've got three phones that I pay every single month for on Ting

1035
01:16:07,220 --> 01:16:13,900
The bill is like around 40 bucks a month 40 bucks a month for three phones smartphones. It's ridiculous

1036
01:16:13,900 --> 01:16:17,520
It's actually it makes sense and there's no contract. There's no early termination fee

1037
01:16:17,540 --> 01:16:22,260
They have a GSM and CDMA network you can take advantage of so if you know what that means

1038
01:16:22,340 --> 01:16:26,180
then you're probably clever enough to figure out which one's better in your area and

1039
01:16:26,660 --> 01:16:31,100
just go with that one and it also probably means you've got a device that's compatible with Ting and

1040
01:16:31,100 --> 01:16:35,780
Ting has a brand new app you can get on the Android marketplace the Android Play Store

1041
01:16:36,180 --> 01:16:40,920
To check to see if it's compatible with Ting to get all of the information. They made it easier than ever

1042
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:45,980
They have the new brand new Ting compatibility checker. Whoo. Guess what? I didn't see this earlier

1043
01:16:46,460 --> 01:16:51,240
Kyra is here to tell us all about it too. Let's go check a phone to see if it's compatible with Ting

1044
01:16:51,260 --> 01:16:54,720
This is the app you'll need. All right. I'm Kyra and this is the Ting download

1045
01:16:54,720 --> 01:16:56,720
The

1046
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:05,800
Ting compatibility checker app for Android. Well checks your phone's compatibility with Ting. It doesn't do anything else

1047
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:08,280
Yeah, it's beautifully simple if we do say so ourselves

1048
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:14,800
It's also a very small download. It's intended to be used once and uninstalled at less than 1.5 megabytes

1049
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:18,840
You won't have to worry about deleting other apps to make space for this one. Smart. Here's how it works

1050
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:26,440
Install the app and open it up. Cha-cha-cha. Tap to check your phone. The app pulls your phone's unique serial number

1051
01:17:26,440 --> 01:17:29,920
It's IMEI and runs it against the database of phones that'll work

1052
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:34,200
It only takes a second. Once the process finishes, you'll find out right away

1053
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:35,920
If your phone is compatible

1054
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:42,480
You'll also get info on which network services it will support. As you'd expect the app is free and you can grab it from the Google

1055
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:48,520
Play Store. The Ting compatibility checker is Android only. iPhone currently doesn't allow apps to pull specific phone info

1056
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:54,680
Huh, but you can always use the web-based compatibility checker at ting.com slash check on your desktop or mobile browser. All right

1057
01:17:54,680 --> 01:17:56,040
It's almost as simple

1058
01:17:56,040 --> 01:17:58,040
Thanks for watching and we'll see you next time

1059
01:17:58,440 --> 01:18:03,840
Wow, did it just get easier than ever to switch to Ting? I think it did. Look at them. That's thinking

1060
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:07,680
Well, and did I hear that they have their SIM cards on Amazon now?

1061
01:18:07,680 --> 01:18:10,760
They do Amazon Prime at that and you just pop them in a device check them out

1062
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:16,800
So all you got to do is go to linux.ting.com to support this show and get yourself a discount. Go check them out

1063
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:20,360
linux.ting.com and now it's easier than ever to bring an Android device

1064
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:22,760
Interesting iPhone not

1065
01:18:23,320 --> 01:18:25,320
Letting you get access to that information

1066
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:27,560
Hmm. I wonder which one protects your privacy

1067
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:33,080
Anyways linux.ting.com go get yourself a great device and then would you tweet me and tell me about how much you're saving

1068
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:38,920
Cuz you're gonna want to tell somebody and share it with your bro. Chris will always listen. Just contact him 24-7

1069
01:18:38,920 --> 01:18:44,120
He doesn't mind especially when he's doing shit. Just call me directly. All right, so let's talk about Adobe Killing Flash

1070
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:46,120
Well the name

1071
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:53,360
Not really killing flash, but you know if you got yourself Creative Cloud heads up. They're gonna rename your application

1072
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:57,960
So watch out everybody big change is coming down the pipe a new name a new name

1073
01:18:58,620 --> 01:19:02,520
Really excited about that and they're gonna make an emphasis on HTML 5

1074
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,720
9 binary output. How about that everybody?

1075
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:10,680
You're really really excited now, aren't you? Are you are you amped up? If you're not amped up enough

1076
01:19:10,680 --> 01:19:16,720
Well, there's this French guy and this French guy. He's got a really really really shallow depth of field and he wants to tell you

1077
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:19,200
All about it. Hello. My name is Michael shares

1078
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:24,840
I'm a creative cloud evangelist based in Paris and a longtime interactive designer with the growth of HTML 5

1079
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:31,240
Demand for animation formats that leverage web technologies has grown and the flash pro team has responded

1080
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:38,880
Adding first-class support for exporting animations to HTML 5 in order to clearly define the role of this application as the premier

1081
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:46,640
Animation tool for the web and beyond. I'm very excited to announce that flash professional is being renamed to adobe animate CC

1082
01:19:47,060 --> 01:19:49,060
Adobe animate CC and

1083
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:54,640
Adobe animate CC will be you know, can I just stop here? Did you notice how he says the word Adobe?

1084
01:19:54,640 --> 01:20:00,080
I want to play that back just for a second and Adobe animate CC adobe adobe

1085
01:20:00,440 --> 01:20:06,120
The only reason I mentioned that is last week you and I were trying to come up with how you say hat in French

1086
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:10,280
Yes, and we got so much shit for how we tried to say hat in French

1087
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:16,160
Well, how about an Adobe employee in France? They can't even pronounce the company. He works for you guys

1088
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:22,280
You give me crap all the time. Well, what's up? This guy works for Adobe doesn't work there anymore. Not after that

1089
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:25,320
I'm just saying like they're giving me a hard time because I can't say hat in French

1090
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:28,560
Meanwhile, this dude works for Adobe and he calls it adobe, right?

1091
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:34,960
But it's fine because he's French now Chris who speaks English isn't allowed to mispronounce anything, but this guy that's fine

1092
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:37,240
He's French. We don't care. He's French Chris

1093
01:20:37,240 --> 01:20:40,440
It's not a big deal because he's French and he's in Paris and there was a terrorist attack

1094
01:20:40,440 --> 01:20:43,440
So don't give him a hard time because he calls it adobe. There's not a big deal

1095
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:48,760
What are you talking about nouns that flash professional is being renamed to adobe animate CC?

1096
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:51,720
Okay, now you can't on here. Can you add a beam?

1097
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:56,640
And adobe animate CC will be available in early 2016

1098
01:20:56,640 --> 01:21:04,160
We are not just changing the name. We are adding significant new features for professional animators. Let me show you what we are working on

1099
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:09,640
You will be able to browse and license millions of illustrations photos and vector graphics

1100
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:14,360
Adobe stock is directly integrated within the tool thanks to the power of creative sync

1101
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:21,560
Same for creative cloud libraries. You can access colors vector shapes and brushes directly within animate CC and all right

1102
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:22,240
So there you go

1103
01:21:22,240 --> 01:21:28,320
so this is they're gonna call it animate and they're gonna have animate CC for the application to use and the

1104
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:30,840
Idea is adobe is gonna de-emphasize

1105
01:21:31,480 --> 01:21:32,520
de-emphasize

1106
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:36,280
FLV and that kind of stuff and sort of re-emphasize

1107
01:21:36,760 --> 01:21:42,240
HTML 5 output but using Adobe tools to make that said HTML 5 output

1108
01:21:42,240 --> 01:21:44,200
I don't know what to think about this

1109
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:51,280
So what I thought is let's just figure out how to stop using the flash plug-in all together and that's Chris's solution

1110
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:55,360
So you really want to kill Adobe flash? I'm sorry adobe flash. This is how we do it

1111
01:21:55,480 --> 01:21:56,720
This is how we do it

1112
01:21:56,720 --> 01:22:01,520
And so I wanted to give my couple of tips and I want to see maybe what you do to avoid using flash and we'll

1113
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:06,600
Toss it the bumble room. So I mentioned these on Sunday show but my two top tips to avoid using flash

1114
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:14,280
First of all, don't install it second of all use live streamer to watch things that are in flash or if you want to watch

1115
01:22:14,280 --> 01:22:18,880
The JB live stream grab the RTMP or RTSP and throw that to MPV

1116
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:25,320
That helps Alan get paid. Well and well you with live streamer. Well, I don't think we'll do the JB live stream

1117
01:22:25,320 --> 01:22:31,720
Okay, so live streamer will do like twitch and you stream you could watch the we do have a broadcast on you stream

1118
01:22:31,720 --> 01:22:34,100
Not you stream TV or whatever you stream calm

1119
01:22:34,100 --> 01:22:39,720
whatever the URL is slash channel slash Jupiter broadcasting and you could pipe that into live streamer and

1120
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:45,400
Pipe that you could you could pull that into live streamer and it will it will work

1121
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:50,120
But the the built-in embedded one on the jblive.tv page doesn't work with live streamer

1122
01:22:50,120 --> 01:22:53,240
But RTMP on RTSP work beautifully and MPV

1123
01:22:53,320 --> 01:22:57,760
So you just you know in the command line you type MPV and then you paste that link and it starts streaming

1124
01:22:58,280 --> 01:23:03,000
FFmpeg will record from those or HLS right as well right to a file HLS as well

1125
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:05,400
and then then of course

1126
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:08,080
Something that I use all the time is

1127
01:23:08,760 --> 01:23:14,160
Minitube and YouTube DL which is a great way to pull video files off of YouTube without having to use flash

1128
01:23:14,160 --> 01:23:21,440
And then my go-to solution is instead of having flash installed system-wide if I have to have to have to use flash

1129
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:27,720
I use chrome and chrome comes with flash built-in and I just keep it there in their little sandbox

1130
01:23:27,720 --> 01:23:34,400
And that's where it stays and if a website requires flash like YouTube management tools, then I just use Chrome

1131
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:37,600
What are you what? How do you avoid using flash when you need to you know?

1132
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:42,080
I have to echo up pretty much everything you said I was just talking with my parents and they were kind of freaked out

1133
01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:44,880
Firefox is warning them about the vulnerabilities in flash and you know

1134
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:49,280
They don't quite know what that means and I found myself just saying well if you haven't flash problems

1135
01:23:49,280 --> 01:23:53,200
You should probably just use Chrome and I haven't said that before but that's that's where we're at

1136
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:56,660
I think is just you just use Chrome you use that for that page and you're done

1137
01:23:57,040 --> 01:24:00,140
Wendy you have a trick for getting HTML 5 playback on YouTube

1138
01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:07,480
Yeah, this is not so much about what you as a user can do but what you as a you know a content

1139
01:24:07,480 --> 01:24:15,840
Publisher can do so what if you embed YouTube clips in a website or social media and all the rest of it

1140
01:24:16,200 --> 01:24:18,720
If you add the HTML 5

1141
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:25,720
Option to the embed URL it forces the clip to use the HTML 5 playback

1142
01:24:26,280 --> 01:24:28,280
Rather than flash by default. Oh

1143
01:24:29,240 --> 01:24:35,800
That is great to know I will also I went through all my sites and you know added that to everything after the last round

1144
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:41,240
Of you know flash vulnerabilities when nobody can access flash for about a week smart. I added that

1145
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:42,760
That's beautiful

1146
01:24:42,760 --> 01:24:49,820
Some older versions of flash or or players that haven't been updated will save temporary files that if you want to watch the video

1147
01:24:49,820 --> 01:24:54,440
But you don't want to use the flash interface it will download it to temp the temp folder, but it will delete them

1148
01:24:54,440 --> 01:24:59,720
Hmm, but it still has that file handle open. So the proc file system will show that to you

1149
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:01,840
So you can then you can copy it right out of it

1150
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:06,200
So you still have to have flash installed for that. Yeah, but if you want to kind of archive clips off some websites

1151
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:07,960
That maybe live streamer doesn't work. That's a nice trick

1152
01:25:07,960 --> 01:25:12,320
You can do it doesn't some don't work for that. But damn I am so do that's a nice way to pretty much

1153
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:14,440
I'll have to find a link for that. Okay. Okay

1154
01:25:14,440 --> 01:25:14,960
Yeah

1155
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:19,580
There's actually a lot of stuff you can do with YouTube DL that are a lot more than people think they can

1156
01:25:19,960 --> 01:25:24,880
The name of it implies just YouTube sure there's about 200 different things that work. It's amazing

1157
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:30,480
Yeah, so I don't even use live streamer because most of stuff I use YouTube DL works. So if you want to watch it

1158
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:36,480
Twitch.tv stream you just use YouTube DL with mpv or technically just use mpv and it works

1159
01:25:36,920 --> 01:25:41,600
Now when you say technically use mpv are you talking? Are you doing like how simple is it mpv?

1160
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:44,640
And then it's just a twitch URL in there. What are you doing? Yeah, it's mpv

1161
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:53,160
Really all you need is YouTube DL installed and then mpv detects YouTube DL and then parses it through perfectly fine

1162
01:25:53,160 --> 01:25:55,440
You don't have to do it. Oh snaps. I am doing that

1163
01:25:55,440 --> 01:25:57,520
I want to say I don't think it's in a lot of repos yet

1164
01:25:57,520 --> 01:26:03,040
And I was just asking wimpy about this in IRC as well, but it I see a release note from mpv saying that they support

1165
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:07,760
The hardware decoding on Raspberry Pi 2. I haven't ever tried I think it might be in the arch arm repos

1166
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:11,620
Maybe mumble room was more but that would be pretty pretty neat combination right there

1167
01:26:12,360 --> 01:26:13,860
normally when there's

1168
01:26:13,860 --> 01:26:18,640
Pi compatibility for video playback you you can't just rebuild the source

1169
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:23,920
Package from the Intel versions because you actually need to explicitly link it to

1170
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:26,280
the OMX

1171
01:26:26,280 --> 01:26:31,840
Libraries for example. Yeah, so it usually requires a little bit of messing about with haven't looked at it yet

1172
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:37,800
I was aware, but I haven't tried it. If you're talking about YouTube, there's a couple of utilities. There's also mini tube

1173
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:44,400
which is a desktop client for Linux for browsing YouTube, which doesn't require flash and

1174
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:52,280
There's another one called YouTube viewer and YouTube viewer is you know a desktop client for YouTube and behind the scenes

1175
01:26:52,280 --> 01:26:56,160
it pulls everything down and streams it either via

1176
01:26:56,920 --> 01:26:58,360
mpv or

1177
01:26:58,360 --> 01:27:02,400
Mplayer or something like that so it's got different back ends it can use to actually

1178
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:08,400
View YouTube on the desktop, so that's another way to dodge flash right good a point good point

1179
01:27:08,900 --> 01:27:10,380
Okay, now

1180
01:27:10,380 --> 01:27:14,320
Kits and Kitty is pointing out the elephant in the room that I didn't realize until just now

1181
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:16,920
but

1182
01:27:16,920 --> 01:27:23,420
There is a large use case for flash when it comes to porn Kitson, and you're mentioning that

1183
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:26,360
There is certain workarounds for that too, right?

1184
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:28,360
Yes

1185
01:27:28,360 --> 01:27:30,360
Apparently I have heard of that

1186
01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:37,100
DL works great on red tube. I mean I didn't actually think about it beforehand, but that's a little so

1187
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:40,400
Google's new service you're talking about

1188
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:48,480
I mean it certainly is it is the young there is an uncomfortable truth and the that uncomfortable truth is

1189
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:52,880
Linux makes for a fantastic porn platform you can quote me on that

1190
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:56,120
But the reason is is on Windows you are

1191
01:27:56,560 --> 01:28:03,440
legitimately constantly exposed to all kinds of different phishing attacks and scams and and malware that gets to drive by downloaded

1192
01:28:03,480 --> 01:28:08,600
That is really not a problem on Linux or any internet browsers will click on anything

1193
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:15,520
so and if you know if somebody should probably maybe there already is should make a live CD around this premise to be honest with you because

1194
01:28:16,040 --> 01:28:18,040
It comes with a sexy background

1195
01:28:18,040 --> 01:28:23,320
It is a showcase it is a showcase desktop environment because you can get all the codecs on there

1196
01:28:23,320 --> 01:28:28,360
You can get flash, and you don't have any of the vulnerabilities. I'm just saying someone should make the porn too

1197
01:28:31,160 --> 01:28:35,120
Someone should make one of those ads this one cool trick makes your porn browsing experience better

1198
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:41,840
Yeah, you know you can sell some Linux on BuzzFeed just me or am I the only person that has noticed that?

1199
01:28:42,080 --> 01:28:46,320
Sex online is just as dangerous as sex in real life. Yeah

1200
01:28:48,120 --> 01:28:53,080
More so I think actually yeah one one trip trick for that is if you use a browser

1201
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:56,600
User agent changer because a lot of porn sites want to support mobile

1202
01:28:56,600 --> 01:29:00,800
Oh, and they have to then a lot of times use HTML 5 or oh interesting

1203
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:05,160
So if you if you pretend you're like an Android device, or I usually get a link to some kind of MP4

1204
01:29:05,160 --> 01:29:09,440
That's great for all kinds of sites. Yeah, I just did some I'll be I'll put I'll get this to you

1205
01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:14,800
So you put it in the show notes, but I found the supported sites list from YouTube DL. Oh, yeah, it's massive

1206
01:29:15,160 --> 01:29:19,180
No, I linked it. I linked it in yeah, I linked it in Sunday's Linux action show

1207
01:29:20,360 --> 01:29:22,360
There's a quite a few

1208
01:29:22,760 --> 01:29:24,280
adult oriented

1209
01:29:24,280 --> 01:29:25,480
Mm-hmm

1210
01:29:25,480 --> 01:29:29,720
Solution I noticed that way only one I'm interested in is adult swim of course of course right

1211
01:29:29,720 --> 01:29:36,080
That's the only thought you care about and you know I just I guess I guess if we're being completely genuinely honest

1212
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:38,000
That is a that is a legitimate use case for flash

1213
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,360
Yeah, and it is something that keeps people using it

1214
01:29:40,360 --> 01:29:43,120
I guess which I hadn't considered until we started talking about this

1215
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:46,500
But it's the elf in the room and there are solutions for that as well

1216
01:29:46,500 --> 01:29:48,920
Well, I think they are that industry is kind of you know

1217
01:29:48,920 --> 01:29:54,160
They kind of pioneered that they had a lot of video content to deliver and flash at that time was the only thing that could

1218
01:29:54,160 --> 01:29:59,600
Do it your tip about mobile is a good one though because I've read a couple of different articles on how high?

1219
01:30:00,440 --> 01:30:04,880
What a high percentage mobile traffic is for those types of sites. Yes, it's your board on the butt

1220
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:12,080
I mean wow wow wow not me uh-huh yeah, no that's fine. That's no I guess zombies don't run Linux

1221
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:16,880
So there you go there is plenty of ways flash can be dead today

1222
01:30:16,880 --> 01:30:21,760
If you just take action friends, and we all all of us can make a difference

1223
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:25,800
You can't go vote and make a difference just ask Adam ruins everything good show by the way

1224
01:30:26,200 --> 01:30:28,840
But you can make a difference by not running flash

1225
01:30:28,840 --> 01:30:33,840
you could also make a difference by going to Linux action show dot reddit comm and submitting stories topic ideas or

1226
01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:41,240
Open source projects you think we should know about also feedback for episode 121 over at Linux action show dot reddit comm

1227
01:30:41,240 --> 01:30:45,120
We've also got a live stream. I don't know if you knew about that over at JB live TV

1228
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:50,400
We do this show on Tuesdays probably only a couple of more this year like three Wow yeah

1229
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:53,280
You better catch them be here live. Yeah, we've also got that mumble room

1230
01:30:53,280 --> 01:30:56,920
We love hanging out with our mumble room getting their live insights. We really mean it

1231
01:30:56,920 --> 01:30:59,640
It's our virtual lug and you can take part of that and share your thoughts

1232
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:04,800
Just head over JB live TV go to Jupiter broadcasting comm slash calendar get a convert to your local time zone

1233
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:11,240
That's Jupiter broadcasting comm slash calendar. Don't forget about that contact page while you're on our website and go check out previous episodes

1234
01:31:11,360 --> 01:31:16,760
We got a whole bunch avoid the family over the holidays. That's my personal recommendation hang out. You know talk about Linux

1235
01:31:16,760 --> 01:31:21,960
That's way more fun. There you go. Hi everybody. Thanks so much to this week's episode of Linux unplugged. See you right back here next week

1236
01:31:46,760 --> 01:31:48,760
Oh

1237
01:32:05,880 --> 01:32:09,880
There we go we went there, but it was I think I just felt like you know what all of a sudden

1238
01:32:09,880 --> 01:32:13,720
We should probably be honest. This is a genuine use case flash, so we did it. Yep. We happened

1239
01:32:13,720 --> 01:32:17,480
We had to go there, so I wanted to take a couple of minutes here in the post show and

1240
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:23,200
Just sort of invite the mumble room to jump in on open source projects. They're thankful for but let's do it

1241
01:32:23,400 --> 01:32:26,200
Let's do it like we're still doing in the show so that we wouldn't all talk over each other

1242
01:32:26,200 --> 01:32:29,920
So take me first in the chat room and with mum and then we'll go for there

1243
01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:34,120
But I wanted to just I know this is probably gonna come up, but there was so many projects

1244
01:32:34,120 --> 01:32:36,000
I could have been thankful for

1245
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:42,640
Wes I I realized tink might be on your list. Yes, it definitely is so I wanted to play with that more

1246
01:32:42,640 --> 01:32:45,360
I think I definitely want to play is there any others that are on top of your mind for your list

1247
01:32:46,240 --> 01:32:52,360
Mmm. That's a good question. You think about it. I'll think about it alright, so vert you can go ahead and oh actually nope

1248
01:32:52,360 --> 01:32:56,100
Sorry wimpy was first wimpy go ahead. You have your project. You're thankful for

1249
01:32:56,840 --> 01:33:03,700
Open SSH good one very good. I can't imagine life without it seriously versatile seriously

1250
01:33:03,800 --> 01:33:10,380
Yeah, it is maybe one of the most useful open source projects for all of us like use just broad spectrum great one

1251
01:33:10,880 --> 01:33:12,400
great vert

1252
01:33:12,400 --> 01:33:14,400
Do you want to mention own cloud?

1253
01:33:16,480 --> 01:33:18,840
Yeah, I mean that's really kind of changed my

1254
01:33:19,480 --> 01:33:24,040
Entire workflow now because I never really bought into the whole Google cloud services

1255
01:33:24,720 --> 01:33:30,360
and so when own cloud came along I started sinking calendars and appointments and everything else between me and my family and

1256
01:33:31,480 --> 01:33:36,840
Yeah, it's just been a really great store in that sense, and I'm just glad for now good point all right

1257
01:33:36,840 --> 01:33:39,560
Don't forget JB titles calm. Let's pick our title

1258
01:33:39,560 --> 01:33:43,560
us hey citizen you're a sort of our resident Jack

1259
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:46,840
Showcase so I'm curious to hear what you're thankful for

1260
01:33:47,560 --> 01:33:54,040
Well yeah, definitely thankful for Jack the audio connection kit that helps you more

1261
01:33:54,920 --> 01:33:58,160
Necessary for doing any professional audio on Linux mm-hmm

1262
01:33:58,200 --> 01:34:04,240
Yeah, and it's something that is probably gonna be I'm gonna have to learn more about it in 2016 expect some

1263
01:34:04,240 --> 01:34:10,160
I've been putting it off, but you know you hear hey citizen there, and I have some co-workers who are playing with it

1264
01:34:10,160 --> 01:34:15,160
It just it seems like a ton of fun. Yeah, that's like yeah, and also Lily pond tell me about that

1265
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:17,760
Yeah, Lily pond is

1266
01:34:18,280 --> 01:34:21,880
Another great app. I'm very thankful for it musical notation

1267
01:34:22,520 --> 01:34:24,520
It's kind of like the law tech of

1268
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:27,400
music

1269
01:34:27,400 --> 01:34:30,080
Okay, Lily pond. I will google that um

1270
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:36,920
Kitson oh my god the most obvious one that I use for every single show all our hosts use it

1271
01:34:36,920 --> 01:34:38,920
And I didn't think of it kits and go ahead

1272
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:41,440
Markdown yeah

1273
01:34:41,960 --> 01:34:43,200
Yeah

1274
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:46,880
Seriously markdown. You know what here's why markdown is great at the end of the day

1275
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:50,680
I can just be fleet free flow like you know mr. Creative genius

1276
01:34:50,680 --> 01:34:51,480
Just writing like a madman

1277
01:34:51,480 --> 01:34:56,200
And I don't have to worry about like links like this is a big deal because I can just put I'll just put something in

1278
01:34:56,200 --> 01:35:01,360
A bracket, and then I'll just do you know open parentheses closed parentheses, and I'll just keep typing and then 20 minutes later

1279
01:35:01,360 --> 01:35:05,620
I'll go back and get the URL and then I can cite so I know the references in my head

1280
01:35:05,620 --> 01:35:09,660
But I just don't have the URL handy so I can keep writing and just quickly bang out stuff

1281
01:35:09,720 --> 01:35:14,880
You know format it a markdown and then put it out in consistent perfect HTML every single time

1282
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:19,360
And there's tons of services that will just render that to what you want so many

1283
01:35:19,360 --> 01:35:26,640
I mean oh man markdown is a is really is really a good one, so yeah, so I like to go ahead

1284
01:35:26,640 --> 01:35:28,640
Sorry, yeah, I like the interoperability

1285
01:35:29,400 --> 01:35:33,520
between markdown and all the applications that are out there for it and

1286
01:35:34,480 --> 01:35:40,480
That's actually what switched me over from using org mode because with org mode. It was just emacs. Oh

1287
01:35:41,720 --> 01:35:47,400
Man rotten corpse you have virtual box. That's a good one to sit so cushy. I think I said

1288
01:35:47,400 --> 01:35:49,160
encryption

1289
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:51,160
Encryption software, that's a good one

1290
01:35:51,680 --> 01:35:56,480
So yeah, I think we should all thank the people who writes

1291
01:35:58,240 --> 01:36:02,960
Encryption software that yeah makes it possible to for us to communicate

1292
01:36:03,320 --> 01:36:06,640
Yeah, safely and big picture. It's a big deal and

1293
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:13,120
Yeah, and also the people who who come up with the ciphers and other

1294
01:36:13,120 --> 01:36:17,120
Like grip the graphic primitives and make them

1295
01:36:18,120 --> 01:36:22,840
Public to my domain and right and share with everybody and yeah, that's a great point

1296
01:36:22,840 --> 01:36:27,000
I I'll give will we should probably wrap up with these because this list could go on all day

1297
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:30,240
But I got to get a last one to poppy because ffmpeg is close to my heart

1298
01:36:31,480 --> 01:36:37,160
Yeah, I chose ffmpeg, but really I want to thank for grease bella the guy who started ffmpeg

1299
01:36:37,160 --> 01:36:40,360
Yeah, and also cue emu because both of them. Yeah

1300
01:36:40,360 --> 01:36:42,360
Because both of them. Yeah

1301
01:36:42,600 --> 01:36:46,320
Amazing. Yes of software and from you know from okay

1302
01:36:46,320 --> 01:36:53,320
They've got loads of contributions, but from one guy to start those two projects guys genius. Yeah, I agree. That's a good one

1303
01:36:53,680 --> 01:36:58,120
Alright, so I'm gonna finish that. I'm trying to finish this beer. So if anybody else drinking with me today

1304
01:36:58,120 --> 01:37:00,120
Well West is anybody else have a beer

1305
01:37:00,360 --> 01:37:02,360
Got to finish this tea

1306
01:37:03,040 --> 01:37:09,080
I too am drinking tea. I'm drinking bulletproof coffee. Okay. All right. All right. All right

1307
01:37:09,080 --> 01:37:13,100
We got a bulletproof coffee drinker in there so now all of a sudden Chris isn't the only crazy guy

1308
01:37:13,100 --> 01:37:18,320
We'll take that now. I'm not crazy. Are you are you putting MCT oil in that thing? What do you got going on over there? I?

1309
01:37:19,240 --> 01:37:26,160
Just got the coconut oil. Yeah. Yeah sure yeah, okay, but see here's the thing you can get you can get MCT oil

1310
01:37:26,160 --> 01:37:31,520
Which is an extract down of coconut oil which doesn't have any coconut flavor you still get all the benefits of coconut

1311
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:35,040
Oh nice without the coconut flavor, so if you don't want to coconut up your coffee

1312
01:37:35,640 --> 01:37:37,640
You putting butter in there

1313
01:37:37,640 --> 01:37:42,160
Um, yeah a little bit. Yeah a little bit of butter. Yeah. Yeah, that is any you doing

1314
01:37:42,160 --> 01:37:46,880
Are you doing like a like a like are you doing that for breakfast? You doing like a fasting thing? What's going on over there?

1315
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:53,160
No, I just I use it to keep me going it does doesn't it for a long time before having to have lunch

1316
01:37:53,160 --> 01:37:56,960
Yeah, not only does it not only does it help you keep going in between meals?

1317
01:37:57,160 --> 01:38:04,000
But also, you know sometimes at least for me when the caffeine wears off especially coffee because it's like 120 milligrams of caffeine

1318
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
I go into like

1319
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:12,440
Starvation mode where I got to eat and I don't care what it takes or what it is or how long it's been in there

1320
01:38:12,440 --> 01:38:14,440
I got it. Isn't that weird? Yeah

1321
01:38:14,480 --> 01:38:19,400
Do you get like that sensation where your body just like really really really yeah, it's food

1322
01:38:19,400 --> 01:38:22,120
Yeah, and you when you do that how to describe it. It's really weird

1323
01:38:23,640 --> 01:38:28,440
When you do the bulletproof coffee you do not get that it is a more gradual ramp down

1324
01:38:29,120 --> 01:38:31,920
Yeah, why does this sound like a recipe for diarrhea?

1325
01:38:31,920 --> 01:38:38,120
Uh, well if caffeine makes you poo if coffee makes you poo then it will happen. Yeah

1326
01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:44,440
Gotta love the coffee poo, but I'm telling you what though this I don't I don't I don't do the official like bulletproof coffee

1327
01:38:44,440 --> 01:38:50,360
I just go get really good coffee and an immersion blender and I put MCT coconut oil in there and a little bit of butter and

1328
01:38:52,080 --> 01:38:53,440
You know

1329
01:38:53,440 --> 01:38:55,880
It I haven't done in a while, but it's when it's cold out
