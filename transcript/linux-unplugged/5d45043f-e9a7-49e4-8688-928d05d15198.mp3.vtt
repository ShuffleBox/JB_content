WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.080
Who says you can't have fun in your terminal? Wes found SSHtron. Multiplayer Tron in your

00:06.080 --> 00:13.320
terminal. That's awesome. You just SSH to SSHtron.ZackLotta.com. We'll have a link in

00:13.320 --> 00:14.320
the show notes.

00:14.320 --> 00:15.320
Oh yeah.

00:15.320 --> 00:19.480
And you can play Multiplayer Tron in your terminal window. I love it, Wes. Good find.

00:19.480 --> 00:21.040
SSHtron for the win. That's it right there.

00:21.040 --> 00:23.400
You didn't even know it was missing from your life, but it was.

00:23.400 --> 00:24.400
Show's over. We're done.

00:24.400 --> 00:28.920
Yeah, we're just going to be busy playing this, so entertain yourselves.

00:28.920 --> 00:46.360
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 231 for January 9th, 2018.

00:46.360 --> 00:51.320
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's ready to kill the Gen 2 challenge

00:51.320 --> 00:52.320
in its face.

00:52.320 --> 00:53.320
My name is Chris.

00:53.320 --> 00:54.320
My name is Wes.

00:54.320 --> 00:58.320
This should be it right here. This should be the final Gen 2 challenge episode, but

00:58.320 --> 01:03.160
we'll have to wait and see, because first we have to get through a packed show. Yes,

01:03.160 --> 01:08.780
my friends, 2018 is starting off with a bang. We'll give you a snapshot on where Linux is

01:08.780 --> 01:13.880
specifically with Meltdown and Spectre. Then we'll get into a couple of new releases that

01:13.880 --> 01:22.000
might be some of the best open source software you're not using. It's great. Then, I say

01:22.000 --> 01:31.740
the perfect Linux workstation is Ni. The absolute perfect desktop to run Linux is Ni, and it's

01:31.740 --> 01:37.680
well under $1,000. We'll talk about that. Plus, our friends over at elementary have

01:37.680 --> 01:44.080
a new app, looking pretty good. Then the register says buckle up. It's going to be the year

01:44.080 --> 01:49.120
of Gnome, and it's going to be the year of Ubuntu. They got a couple of notes on how

01:49.120 --> 01:54.480
it's going to just be a blowout year. We'll talk about that whole Lenovo firmware bug

01:54.480 --> 01:58.360
that cropped up while we were off the air. We'll touch on that. Then, Telegram's got

01:58.360 --> 02:09.220
a cryptocurrency. Then, Wes, it's back. Linspire returns. Our old friend. The old Linspire.

02:09.220 --> 02:15.520
Remember Lindos, then Linspire? Remember Xandros? Yeah. They've only been merged together and

02:15.520 --> 02:24.440
relaunched. Linspire 7.0 launched this week, and I paid the $80 license fee to download

02:24.440 --> 02:25.440
it-

02:25.440 --> 02:26.440
You got your hands on it.

02:26.440 --> 02:27.440
... and give it a shot.

02:27.440 --> 02:28.440
Look at you.

02:28.440 --> 02:31.480
I bought it so you don't have to, because you can't just download Linspire. No, no.

02:31.480 --> 02:38.320
You have to buy a $79 license, which includes an install media, which works out to be $94,

02:38.320 --> 02:39.320
all told.

02:39.320 --> 02:40.640
The things you do for the audience.

02:40.640 --> 02:48.440
I'll give you my take on the new Linspire. I went into it with a bit of a bias, like

02:48.440 --> 02:57.400
$95, $95, and then I started to use it. It might be the best XFCE desktop I've ever used.

02:57.400 --> 02:59.560
Hey, boy. Wow.

02:59.560 --> 03:04.800
I don't know. It's early days, but it blew me away. If I could get it installed and running,

03:04.800 --> 03:10.600
it'd really impress me. We'll tell you more about that. Then, towards the end of the show,

03:10.600 --> 03:19.800
at least, my God, I hope, Wes, it is the final chapter of the Gen 2 Challenge.

03:19.800 --> 03:25.040
Well, yeah, we're switching everything over to Linspire. Gen 2 was 2017, so, Wes.

03:25.040 --> 03:32.680
The most hated segment of all time. But you know what? Damned if we didn't actually get

03:32.680 --> 03:39.000
a little morsel out of this segment. Wes and I were talking about it before the show, and

03:39.000 --> 03:44.000
we genuinely walked away with a lesson. What the hell is Gen 2 for? What good is Gen 2

03:44.000 --> 03:51.280
for? What's its place in 2018 in Linux? I think we figured it out, and I think it's

03:51.280 --> 03:56.240
extremely important. In fact, I think it's sort of as important as Linux itself is. We'll

03:56.240 --> 03:59.240
talk about that, and we'll hopefully wrap up the Gen 2 Challenge.

03:59.240 --> 04:03.800
But before we go even a moment further, we've got to say hola to our virtual log. Time-appropriate

04:03.800 --> 04:11.400
greetings, Mumble Room. Hello. Hello. Happy New Year's, everybody. Take a moment from

04:11.400 --> 04:18.500
playing SSH Tron, and let's update everybody on Meltdown and Spectre. You and Beard touched

04:18.500 --> 04:23.320
on this last week, because it was sort of like this awkward, there's something coming.

04:23.320 --> 04:29.200
The pre-release, yeah. Really, it wasn't supposed to be announced until today. Today was the

04:29.200 --> 04:33.280
day the embargo was supposed to be lifted, and today was actually the day we were supposed

04:33.280 --> 04:38.480
to learn about Meltdown and Spectre. In a different universe. Yeah. So we have some

04:38.480 --> 04:44.040
great coverage coming out of JB. I'll just say that right now. Later today, the Ask Noah

04:44.040 --> 04:50.640
program is doing a special on Meltdown and Spectre, and Noah is bringing on Brandon Johnson

04:50.640 --> 04:54.960
from Red Hat to talk about their work with it, which I think is going to be an extremely

04:54.960 --> 05:00.800
interesting insight. And then later in the week, Wes and I are doing a hell of a roundup

05:00.800 --> 05:05.080
on Meltdown and Spectre. There's still a big part of the story that hasn't been told. We're

05:05.080 --> 05:09.080
going to have a complete timeline, a concise timeline of how everything went down. Lots

05:09.080 --> 05:14.320
of interesting tidbits there. So there's more coverage to come. So with that said, just

05:14.320 --> 05:20.640
a quick state of the union for Linux as we record this episode. In brief, Meltdown is

05:20.640 --> 05:25.340
a CPU vulnerability. It works by using modern processors out of order execution to read

05:25.340 --> 05:31.400
arbitrary kernel memory location, which could include personal data like passwords, SSL

05:31.400 --> 05:36.680
key information. And then there's Spectre, a second issue. Spectre breaks down the barriers

05:36.680 --> 05:40.680
between different applications. So you could theoretically use it to trick applications

05:40.680 --> 05:46.840
into accessing arbitrary programs, not kernel, but arbitrary program memory locations. Spectre

05:46.840 --> 05:51.640
is harder to exploit than Meltdown, but it's also harder to mitigate. It's more of like

05:51.640 --> 05:55.520
a design issue. So it's going to be something we'll be hearing more about through 2018.

05:55.520 --> 06:01.440
There's probably going to be more patches coming upstream from Linux. So it's probably

06:01.440 --> 06:05.800
just the beginning of this story. As far as Meltdown is concerned, this is where we have

06:05.800 --> 06:11.160
some of the most traction with patches. Work is continuing though. The latest updates of

06:11.160 --> 06:17.520
the upstream stable Linux kernel 4.14.2 have current patches. Some people may experience

06:17.520 --> 06:22.560
boot problems with this release, however, so don't jump to get it. 4.14.13 will be out

06:22.560 --> 06:30.160
in just a few days. And patches have also been added to the old 4.4 and 4.9 stable kernel

06:30.160 --> 06:31.160
trees.

06:31.160 --> 06:35.880
Yeah, I've seen a lot of questions expressed about those backports though. So if security

06:35.880 --> 06:39.200
is really your concern, it'll probably be best to have the most recent kernel available.

06:39.200 --> 06:44.260
Yeah. And Greg Cage has sort of been advising that and 4.14 and 4.15 are getting those.

06:44.260 --> 06:52.560
There's still a lot of things that are happening. And it's obvious that the kernel team had

06:52.560 --> 06:56.920
more time to prep for Meltdown than they did Spectre. It's a totally different story. There's

06:56.920 --> 07:03.240
really no official like blessed Greg KH Linus Spectre patches at this point. There's different

07:03.240 --> 07:11.480
distributions that have solutions, but there's nothing that's been blessed by upstream yet.

07:11.480 --> 07:12.800
It's really all still shaken out.

07:12.800 --> 07:18.440
Yeah, yeah. I've been seeing Red Hat issue kernel updates for the two series Linux kernel.

07:18.440 --> 07:19.440
Oh boy.

07:19.440 --> 07:25.440
Yeah. Canonical has been updating people on the status of their patches for Ubuntu, same

07:25.440 --> 07:31.880
with other distributions. And there's been reports of performance impacts on certain

07:31.880 --> 07:36.920
workloads, specifically cloud workloads that have a lot of say disk and network IO.

07:36.920 --> 07:39.440
And where security is particularly important.

07:39.440 --> 07:45.360
And that's sort of going to be the big story. Don't you think bashful long term?

07:45.360 --> 07:52.280
Absolutely. There's some people that are reporting up to 40% CPU spikes. And there's a ton of

07:52.280 --> 07:56.520
stuff where when they have auto scaling set on for something like Amazon or whatever,

07:56.520 --> 08:01.160
and then also their bills are just bouncing way up because what used to be an adequate

08:01.160 --> 08:05.580
workload for what they had deployed is now auto scaling up and they're getting hammered

08:05.580 --> 08:06.580
with the bills.

08:06.580 --> 08:13.920
Yeah, yeah. And we, I think we'll probably talk more about this on TechSnap and get deeper

08:13.920 --> 08:17.160
into that or on Coder Radio maybe too. I was thinking about it, but this is going to really

08:17.160 --> 08:20.840
impact the Jupyter broadcasting development audience.

08:20.840 --> 08:25.360
And you know, really, it's no fun for anyone, especially when you when you go into something

08:25.360 --> 08:30.120
like cloud computing. So that way you can budget like a certain set cost. And then all

08:30.120 --> 08:36.280
of a sudden, like you got to have a bar. Yeah. So we'll get more into that later. But I also

08:36.280 --> 08:41.040
wanted to say if you've been speculating, I know this affects all kinds of different

08:41.040 --> 08:46.320
processors. What about GPUs? The answer is, yeah, yeah. Nvidia graphics drivers have been

08:46.320 --> 08:52.400
updated to address vulnerabilities. In the show notes, we have linked a Ubuntu security

08:52.400 --> 09:00.360
notice that covers 1710, 1704, 1604 and 1404. And it's the same thing. Jan Horn discovered

09:00.360 --> 09:03.540
that microprocessors utilizing speculative execution and branch prediction may allow

09:03.540 --> 09:09.280
unauthorized memory reads via side channel attacks. And guess what? Nvidia's GPUs take

09:09.280 --> 09:13.000
advantage of that little trick as well. So you got to get fast. I mean, yeah, yeah. You

09:13.000 --> 09:19.400
got to get Nvidia driver 384.111 to get that fix on Ubuntu. Good to know. Yeah. So there

09:19.400 --> 09:25.760
is oh, and then also there's news today or yesterday that but it's been updated today

09:25.760 --> 09:33.280
that Microsoft has halted the meltdown inspector patches for Windows 10 after AMD machines

09:33.280 --> 09:34.840
were reported as unbootable.

09:34.840 --> 09:40.120
Yeah, it seems like there's a lot of difficult patches. And as always, it's a, you know,

09:40.120 --> 09:43.460
patching is sometimes it's true. Sometimes it's like, okay, two packages got upgraded.

09:43.460 --> 09:46.660
But especially when it's your kernel, you got to be careful.

09:46.660 --> 09:50.040
It's interesting that Microsoft can really turn the dial on this one. So they can just

09:50.040 --> 09:53.840
go, all right, well, we're going to continue pushing patches, but not for machines with

09:53.840 --> 09:59.600
AMD processors. Like they can get really granular on what client machines receive updates. They

09:59.600 --> 10:01.760
have a very tight control.

10:01.760 --> 10:03.800
Yeah, cloud connectivity, Chris.

10:03.800 --> 10:08.560
Oh, oh, oh. So yeah, not a good day for our Windows users either. Ask Noah, if you're

10:08.560 --> 10:14.080
on the live stream comes on right after Linux unplugged. Now, we're doing like a Linux blowout

10:14.080 --> 10:15.080
afternoon.

10:15.080 --> 10:18.400
It's perfect. You just sit down in the afternoon, hang out with us for a couple of hours and

10:18.400 --> 10:19.400
have a great time.

10:19.400 --> 10:22.880
That crazy guy's working on integrating mumble with the phone call system too. So you can

10:22.880 --> 10:27.880
hang on. Yeah, join the virtual lug during the show. And then you just hang tight. And

10:27.880 --> 10:32.280
you can participate in Ask Noah right with your same mumble setup. And so yeah, he'll

10:32.280 --> 10:38.040
be taking calls and be discussing Spectre and Meltdown with his guests. So that'll be

10:38.040 --> 10:39.040
coming up more.

10:39.040 --> 10:44.640
I think go over to TechSnap.Systems and subscribe to our feed there because I have a suspicion

10:44.640 --> 10:51.080
that this is a story that is just beginning and there's going to be a waning period where

10:51.080 --> 10:55.880
people sort of get tired of it. But what we're going to do with, I would suspect, what we

10:55.880 --> 10:59.720
always do with TechSnap is we continue to monitor story and find interesting nuggets

10:59.720 --> 11:03.520
that maybe aren't getting reported on very much and just continue to follow it for a

11:03.520 --> 11:04.520
while.

11:04.520 --> 11:06.240
Three, six, nine months, pieces of this are going to be popping up.

11:06.240 --> 11:10.160
Yeah, exactly. So we'll probably, long term, you'll probably see a lot of coverage there.

11:10.160 --> 11:15.040
Now, anybody in the mumble room want to talk about this big story before we move on? Oh,

11:15.040 --> 11:18.880
Batchful, you said you had some crashes at work. I didn't see that.

11:18.880 --> 11:24.240
Yeah, a couple of the guys are doing some testing for our internal stuff. And there's

11:24.240 --> 11:29.760
like a reg file that you actually have to import. And they've now said, don't do it

11:29.760 --> 11:34.240
because we started getting a bunch of systems dropping out due to that. So now we're waiting.

11:34.240 --> 11:38.800
We had to go and pull it back out. And now it's just a wait and see thing.

11:38.800 --> 11:45.080
Yeah. Yeah, I have a sense that, you know, and it's unfortunate there's not only the

11:45.080 --> 11:49.520
performance issues, but there's apparently some stability issues and other side effects.

11:49.520 --> 11:57.160
And at the same time, you know that there has been developers and other people that

11:57.160 --> 12:02.320
have just been working their butts off to get this stuff out in time, especially when

12:02.320 --> 12:07.000
it was disclosed earlier than it should have been. So you got to take them up and say thank

12:07.000 --> 12:11.760
you to these people, these unnamed faceless people who were working over the holidays,

12:11.760 --> 12:16.040
working through Christmas and New Year's to try to get this stuff together. And it might

12:16.040 --> 12:18.680
not be perfect yet. But my God, where would we be without them?

12:18.680 --> 12:21.320
Right. It's definitely a scramble. And there are people doing the scrambling.

12:21.320 --> 12:25.400
Yeah. So you got to in one moment, you got to go, okay, thank you, guys. Appreciate the

12:25.400 --> 12:26.800
hard work you're doing out there.

12:26.800 --> 12:30.480
It really just it just sucks. We did CPUs wrong.

12:30.480 --> 12:31.480
Everything is ruined.

12:31.480 --> 12:32.960
We all have to pay.

12:32.960 --> 12:36.360
It's all bad. We're actually it's funny. We're gonna get back to that in a moment. We're

12:36.360 --> 12:40.400
gonna go back to the good old days before processors were broken. But before we go there,

12:40.400 --> 12:44.280
I want to give a shout out to two open source projects that I bet you're not using that

12:44.280 --> 12:50.000
you really should be. And I'm guilty of this myself. So I may be projecting. But first

12:50.000 --> 12:57.720
project that had an update since last episode is Shotcut, a really good video editor on

12:57.720 --> 13:01.160
Linux. It's I don't understand why we don't talk about it. It has one of the features

13:01.160 --> 13:08.280
that Rekai and I like the most in Final Cut 10, which is it renders preview stills and

13:08.280 --> 13:12.760
waveforms in line with your media. So it's all together and it makes it easy to skim

13:12.760 --> 13:19.080
and preview. Yeah. And it's got good performance. And they just added a feature that I am particularly

13:19.080 --> 13:26.480
interested in. It's an audio spectrum visualization filter, which we use for a lot of our audio

13:26.480 --> 13:31.280
only shows. And we use a series of Python scripts and whatnot. But this may be a way

13:31.280 --> 13:36.760
to do one offs in a new and interesting way. So Shotcut just had a new update just a couple

13:36.760 --> 13:42.920
of days ago. It's released 18.01. And it just it's I think maybe the best open source video

13:42.920 --> 13:47.840
editor you're not using. And it doesn't have as much hype as some of the other ones. But

13:47.840 --> 13:56.160
it's just been so steadily awesome. So Shotcut, shotcut.org for that. And then I know you're

13:56.160 --> 14:02.360
not using this one because y'all keep talking about Evernote replacements and killers. And

14:02.360 --> 14:08.120
the reality is, we've had an Evernote killer for for ages now. It's even been an app pick

14:08.120 --> 14:12.120
on the Linux action show. Oh, yeah, I remember that. And it just got even better. So just

14:12.120 --> 14:18.920
a couple of days ago, an interesting naming scheme again, 18.01.1 of qownotes has been

14:18.920 --> 14:24.320
replaced. Now this is a plain text notepad with markdown support and own cloud slash

14:24.320 --> 14:29.540
next cloud syncing integration. And one of the things they've recently added that I'm

14:29.540 --> 14:35.240
all on board with, and it's it is a full featured really well done application. Don't let the

14:35.240 --> 14:40.120
queue throw you off. If you're like a gnome desktop or a unity user or whatever. It is

14:40.120 --> 14:46.640
it is great. It is a well designed cute application. But one of the things that they've added recently

14:46.640 --> 14:50.860
that I really appreciate is they've you've always been able to kind of create like to

14:50.860 --> 14:55.240
do lists and whatnot. But now you've actually got the ability to check items off in your

14:55.240 --> 14:59.280
notes. So you can create a list of these are the things I've got to do today. And then

14:59.280 --> 15:02.200
when you're done, you can go in there and check them off. That's awesome. It's a simple

15:02.200 --> 15:06.120
thing, but it makes such a difference for my note taking application. I use the share

15:06.120 --> 15:09.720
of this for like, about to hit the road and I need to do a checklist of all the stuff

15:09.720 --> 15:13.980
I got to bring all the equipment we got to bring to go do like a live show. So useful.

15:13.980 --> 15:17.440
And the fact that you can then sync on the back end with different open source solutions.

15:17.440 --> 15:21.720
You can do small little like note windows that just take up tiny bits of space. Or you

15:21.720 --> 15:25.480
can do like a full featured thing that allows you browse your tags and your your different

15:25.480 --> 15:30.320
categories and has multi column live preview of the markdown like you can go all out or

15:30.320 --> 15:33.720
you can just have it be this tiny little window on your desktop. It's one of my favorite cute

15:33.720 --> 15:37.600
applications for Linux. It's a it is better than an Evernote replacement because it's

15:37.600 --> 15:42.700
using markdown. It uses next cloud. And I don't know I don't know why we don't talk

15:42.700 --> 15:45.960
about it more. So I just thought since they had a new release, they just pumped out a

15:45.960 --> 15:49.600
new version that now lets you check things off. It's time to install that just right

15:49.600 --> 15:53.600
now because that's half of what I would do. Right? Yeah, that's a that's a great app pick.

15:53.600 --> 15:59.040
I've been looking for a placement for Zim Wiki for a long time. Yeah, I think this is

15:59.040 --> 16:02.600
it. Yeah, this looks terrific. Yeah, I've even been wondering if we couldn't use this

16:02.600 --> 16:09.120
for production of our shows instead of using slack and Google Docs or whatever else. Seems

16:09.120 --> 16:15.200
like this is just got a lot of potential. So I think 2018 may be the year of QO notes

16:15.200 --> 16:18.920
for me. I have to give some love to my next cloud instance first. Plus, there's a new

16:18.920 --> 16:24.360
version of next cloud that's just around the corner. So I may let that land first and then

16:24.360 --> 16:28.840
do this. But I feel like it's fair. I feel like it's happening. Apparently, you can also

16:28.840 --> 16:36.120
import from Evernote to QO notes. Oh, yeah. Yeah. So stop talking about Evernote alternatives,

16:36.120 --> 16:41.600
because QO notes has been here for a while. And they got the new update 1801 dot one,

16:41.600 --> 16:49.480
which just came out. And I love it. I think there's tools like that, that we like we don't

16:49.480 --> 16:55.720
really fully like wrap our head around yet that are that make Linux competitive desktop.

16:55.720 --> 17:00.600
But you got to have great hardware, too. Yeah, oh, yeah. It's not just about like getting

17:00.600 --> 17:05.560
a great LTS release or getting a great rolling release and getting your favorite desktop.

17:05.560 --> 17:12.240
You also need to run it on the best hardware possible. And we've all we've all seen different

17:12.240 --> 17:16.120
different different solutions for like the ultimate Linux workstation ones you build

17:16.120 --> 17:21.000
yourself. Dell just recently updated the XPS 13, which looks like a killer laptop. I thought

17:21.000 --> 17:24.080
you're supposed to use a Raspberry Pi. And that was that was the end of the story. Is

17:24.080 --> 17:28.480
that not you're telling me that we can do more? Oh, well, well, there's a machine on

17:28.480 --> 17:34.520
the horizon that wimpy and I have been talking about to each other offline for ages now.

17:34.520 --> 17:41.760
And we finally with CES in full swing, have details on what I think is going to be 2018

17:41.760 --> 17:49.080
perfect Linux desktop. And it's a NUC. It's the Intel Hades Canyon NUC with the dedicated

17:49.080 --> 17:55.360
quote unquote, Radeon graphics that comes on the Intel CPU. Oh, and then you combine

17:55.360 --> 18:01.960
that with Thunderbolt three ports, super fast disk, the latest Intel processors. Wimpy,

18:01.960 --> 18:05.840
what do you think? This has got to be the desktop of the year, right?

18:05.840 --> 18:12.920
I'm really hoping so. And I'm going to find out by buying one the day they say I'm very

18:12.920 --> 18:18.720
tempted to. It's a weird situation to be in. So we talked about this a little bit on user

18:18.720 --> 18:24.000
error, Episode 40. I've been following I've been tracking the the rumors about this device

18:24.000 --> 18:32.000
for some months now. I have its predecessor. So this is I have the Skull Canyon NUC. And

18:32.000 --> 18:37.280
I'm in a weird position where I've been so happy with the Skull Canyon NUC. I've been

18:37.280 --> 18:43.980
pining for its replacement almost since I got it because I was like, if this is so good,

18:43.980 --> 18:48.720
what's the next one going to be like? And here it is. We've now seen it announced CES

18:48.720 --> 18:50.080
2018.

18:50.080 --> 18:52.080
And are you satisfied?

18:52.080 --> 18:56.880
Yes, I mean, there is there is nothing about this specification of this device that I'm

18:56.880 --> 19:03.040
unhappy about. I'm really looking forward to getting one. Yeah, yeah. I don't find it

19:03.040 --> 19:08.320
wanting if I was going to be really nitpicky. The only thing I would say is I can't upgrade

19:08.320 --> 19:14.800
it to 64 gigs of RAM, I can only go to 32. Which is what I have in the current NUC. But

19:14.800 --> 19:19.520
then the flip side of that is when I get this one, I will just be able to pop my old one

19:19.520 --> 19:30.460
open, remove the two M2 SSDs, remove the RAM, plug them into the new one, plug my Razer

19:30.460 --> 19:34.960
core into one of the Thunderbolt ports and power it on and I'm back in business on a

19:34.960 --> 19:39.280
whole new hardware platform. Yeah, that's you know, almost instantly.

19:39.280 --> 19:45.280
Yeah. The one other thing I would have asked for is two is because it has one Thunderbolt

19:45.280 --> 19:51.680
three bus, two Thunderbolt three buses, like maybe four USB-C type would have been amazing.

19:51.680 --> 19:56.960
I do like this. Yeah, that's true. And if I put my storage over Ethernet instead of

19:56.960 --> 20:01.560
over Thunderbolt, then that's probably fine. There's six display options on this right

20:01.560 --> 20:06.880
because it's two Thunderbolt three, there's two mini DVI, sorry mini DisplayPort and there's

20:06.880 --> 20:16.880
two HDMI. The HDMI are both HDMI 2.0A with HDCP 2.2. I mean, it's absolutely spec'd to

20:16.880 --> 20:22.480
the max. Oh, there is a third USB-C port on the front of it. So there is technically three

20:22.480 --> 20:25.880
USB-C ports. It's just one Thunderbolt three bus.

20:25.880 --> 20:33.280
There's also internal headers for USB ports. Really? Yeah, it's totally tripped. I really

20:33.280 --> 20:38.840
love it. It's a bit fatter than the one that I have. But then again, the skull on the new

20:38.840 --> 20:45.960
one is illuminated with red and blue LEDs. So you know, you can't really go wrong. Yeah,

20:45.960 --> 20:52.600
yeah, it's it's still smaller than a Mac Mini. I think the thing I want to see is power V

20:52.600 --> 20:59.640
USB-C. Yeah, that's just too much of a machine for that, though. I think it takes this machine

20:59.640 --> 21:09.840
draws 6.32 amps. With similar capacities that do it? Yeah, maybe. Maybe. I don't know. 6

21:09.840 --> 21:14.240
amps is... Maybe for the lower power model, the 65 watt model, you might be able to power

21:14.240 --> 21:19.640
over USB-C. But the larger one that's 100 watt, I don't think you can do over USB-C.

21:19.640 --> 21:24.800
Yeah, I can't imagine. Certainly my USB-C charger is all capped at like 65 watts, I

21:24.800 --> 21:30.940
think. I'm just reading. I'm reading the specs. It's 120 watt adapter, 19 volts at 16.32 amps

21:30.940 --> 21:38.120
is what the specs are for it. Man, I really like this thing. So the and so not only is

21:38.120 --> 21:43.400
it tiny, but it's quiet too, right? Yours is pretty quiet, Wimpy. Yeah, my my NUC is

21:43.400 --> 21:49.560
quiet. Obviously, my 1080 Ti in a Razer Core is a little bit louder. Yeah, but thankfully

21:49.560 --> 21:56.620
through the magic of directional microphones, you can't hear it. But you have the ability

21:56.620 --> 22:02.240
to dynamically switch between the external GPU in the Razer Core and the internal Intel

22:02.240 --> 22:08.040
GPU, correct? Yes. In fact, up until two days ago, that's how I was running things. So when

22:08.040 --> 22:14.920
we spoke about this a few weeks ago, I had one of my monitors exclusively powered by

22:14.920 --> 22:25.880
the IGP in the NUC and the other monitor exclusively powered by the 1080 Ti in the Razer Core.

22:25.880 --> 22:31.440
And the acceleration was on one monitor with the 1080 Ti. And I could, it's a seamless

22:31.440 --> 22:36.640
X session. There's a little bit of magic in the way you need to set this up. But I can

22:36.640 --> 22:41.560
drag windows between the two monitors and you can watch the 3D performance drop off

22:41.560 --> 22:49.120
as you drag it from the Nvidia accelerated screen to the Intel accelerated screen. But

22:49.120 --> 22:55.520
over the weekend, I've actually changed my setup. So I now have display ports out of

22:55.520 --> 23:01.920
the back of the 1080 Ti to both monitors. So I'm not using the internal IGP at all now.

23:01.920 --> 23:08.380
I'm driving both monitors just off the 1080 Ti. And I've actually had the happy coincidence

23:08.380 --> 23:14.120
of a performance boost through doing that, which I can't explain. Do you think there's

23:14.120 --> 23:19.000
going to be an advantage to this dedicated bastardization of an Intel processor with

23:19.000 --> 23:25.840
an AMD GPU? I mean, that's sort of the big story about this NUC. Yeah, I mean, it's certainly

23:25.840 --> 23:32.240
got a lot of people scratching their heads and excited in that you've got an Intel CPU

23:32.240 --> 23:40.080
package with an AMD graphics skew on the side. A skew that it could be possible to use entirely

23:40.080 --> 23:47.640
free graphics drivers. Yeah, absolutely. So you referred to it as Radeon graphics, but

23:47.640 --> 23:55.080
specifically the branding here is this is RX Vega mobile graphics. And I don't know

23:55.080 --> 24:04.200
much about how the consoles are manufactured, the PS4 and the Xbox 1S and 1X, but they obviously

24:04.200 --> 24:11.460
have a combination of Intel CPU and Radeon graphics as well. So I wonder if this is an

24:11.460 --> 24:17.360
evolution of that package. And maybe this is maybe the smallest games console that's

24:17.360 --> 24:21.720
yet to hit the market. No kidding. Maybe future games consoles are going to be built around

24:21.720 --> 24:27.060
similar architectures. Well, have you seen that they're pitching it, the 999 US greenback

24:27.060 --> 24:35.560
version as a VR ready machine? Yeah, yeah, I have. Nobody cares about VR. No, of course

24:35.560 --> 24:40.280
not. Yeah, there is. So the other thing about the NUC that I really, really appreciate besides

24:40.280 --> 24:48.720
its size and its low noise profile, is that they've really built the storage ideally.

24:48.720 --> 24:54.220
So the core platform is set up so that the M.2 slots, and there's two of them, I believe,

24:54.220 --> 24:58.840
and the Thunderbolt controller, by the way, are hooked up directly to PCIe lanes right

24:58.840 --> 25:04.440
off the PCH. So you have super high bandwidth hungry things like disk or Thunderbolt peripherals

25:04.440 --> 25:11.400
that get dedicated PCIe lanes right to the CPU, which means your disk is sitting right

25:11.400 --> 25:16.320
next to the CPU. It's got a fast track lane to the CPU. And so you combine the latest

25:16.320 --> 25:23.960
Intel CPUs with storage that's wired directly to the CPU, and it makes for a very fast combination.

25:23.960 --> 25:30.920
Yeah. And right now, in fact, on the model that I have the the M.2 SATA ports are both

25:30.920 --> 25:38.280
MVME and they've both got their own dedicated lanes. So the disk performance is excellent.

25:38.280 --> 25:44.200
What I'm really excited about in this model is I've currently got one USB Thunderbolt

25:44.200 --> 25:55.160
port, and I have the 1080Ti connected to that. But I also have a HDMI capture card that I

25:55.160 --> 26:00.560
can connect over Thunderbolt 3 and mimic a third screen through this capture device,

26:00.560 --> 26:05.440
but I can't have both running at the same time. So I'm now kind of excited by this one

26:05.440 --> 26:10.280
because I could have both of those things connected up.

26:10.280 --> 26:12.240
I think this is going to be like I say...

26:12.240 --> 26:13.240
And another one at the front.

26:13.240 --> 26:20.000
I think this might be, you know, I find the XPS 13 extremely appealing. Maybe Dell can

26:20.000 --> 26:24.200
convince me otherwise. I've invited Barton George from Dell on the show next week if

26:24.200 --> 26:30.040
it works for him to talk about the new Dell hardware. But, you know, with the price of

26:30.040 --> 26:32.320
Bitcoin dropping, I'm going to be more selective.

26:32.320 --> 26:33.320
You have to watch.

26:33.320 --> 26:36.960
2018 is going to be more selective. And if I can only buy one machine, I think it's this

26:36.960 --> 26:37.960
one.

26:37.960 --> 26:45.840
I actually had one of those new XPS 13s in my shopping basket on Sunday evening, and

26:45.840 --> 26:51.840
the additional accessories I wanted. And I was sitting there hovering over the buy button,

26:51.840 --> 26:59.800
thinking to myself, this will make my fourth XPS 13. Do I need a fourth XPS? And I eventually

26:59.800 --> 27:04.440
decided to bail on the purchase and decided that I didn't need a fourth one of these just

27:04.440 --> 27:10.320
yet. And I'm kind of glad I did because then the next day this device gets announced. And

27:10.320 --> 27:14.520
I think it's going to come on the market in March, which is ahead of the projections that

27:14.520 --> 27:21.800
I'd seen rumored of around June. So yeah, I'm going to hang on to my money and get one

27:21.800 --> 27:22.800
of these in March.

27:22.800 --> 27:28.040
I've been trying to convince Wes of this for about a year is I'm becoming a big fan of

27:28.040 --> 27:35.600
the powerful central desktop that is permanently attached to my large NAS storage. So I can

27:35.600 --> 27:41.880
run services like AmbientPlex directly on my quote unquote workstation. And then on

27:41.880 --> 27:50.280
the edge, my edge devices can be phones, can be low end, you know, 2012 laptops that don't

27:50.280 --> 27:55.520
need to be all that powerful because I can either remote in using X2GO to my machine

27:55.520 --> 28:02.000
and then have my full power available. Or really what I have done is I've set up a series

28:02.000 --> 28:06.880
of queue jobs where I have different folders in Dropbox. And when I drop files in there,

28:06.880 --> 28:13.760
they sync to my powerful workstation and kick off different jobs for me. And so my theory

28:13.760 --> 28:19.960
is invest in a central desktop like a NUC that could be attached to local NAS storage.

28:19.960 --> 28:23.620
I mean, this thing's going to have dual gigabit networking. I could just dedicate one of those

28:23.620 --> 28:28.760
to an iSCSI or NFS purpose and then the other one connected to the rest of the networking.

28:28.760 --> 28:33.120
Then you could hook up external GPUs when I need to game and when I quote unquote need

28:33.120 --> 28:39.200
to game. And if I don't, I could just use the baked in AMD GPU, which is going to be

28:39.200 --> 28:45.040
great, which will support free sync, could have an entirely free open source driver stack.

28:45.040 --> 28:48.880
And it's going to be the ideal machine to be running during the Wayland transition,

28:48.880 --> 28:49.880
I suspect.

28:49.880 --> 28:54.360
Yeah. And it's just refreshing, especially when you've run a bunch of random machines

28:54.360 --> 28:59.400
with different manufacturers doing the motherboard and doing all these internals. As Wimpy said,

28:59.400 --> 29:03.560
it does just feel tricked out and it feels like a proper computer that you can be proud

29:03.560 --> 29:04.560
of.

29:04.560 --> 29:10.220
The other thing that I am taking some comfort in, and I bet you agree, Wimpy, is this appears

29:10.220 --> 29:15.360
to be a product that Intel is going to continue to invest in because the NUC now has been

29:15.360 --> 29:21.200
around for ages and they've been steadily improving it. So it's something where you

29:21.200 --> 29:26.540
could buy the Skull Canyon NUC last year and you essentially had full confidence that there

29:26.540 --> 29:32.000
was going to be another NUC for you to upgrade to. And that's also kind of nice because when

29:32.000 --> 29:36.880
you're buying some of these machines, sometimes the different OEMs will start up a product

29:36.880 --> 29:42.600
line and they'll have it going for a year or two and then their upstream ODM changes

29:42.600 --> 29:47.240
things up and they have to cancel that product line and launch an entirely new product line.

29:47.240 --> 29:51.160
And there's no congruency there. There's no, you know, continuance, continuancy there.

29:51.160 --> 29:57.000
Yeah. Now, while I appreciate that this new Hades Canyon NUC is not cheap by any means,

29:57.000 --> 30:04.000
I think the 65 watt model is going to, is rumored to be $799 and the 100 watt model

30:04.000 --> 30:12.400
is rumored to be $999. But what I'm able, and that comes without disks or SSDs, it comes

30:12.400 --> 30:20.680
without RAM and it comes without an operating system. But those three parts are interchangeable

30:20.680 --> 30:27.680
for me. So I'm going to take the RAM and the SSDs out of my old model and plug them into

30:27.680 --> 30:29.880
this one. I don't have to buy those this time around.

30:29.880 --> 30:30.880
And your eGPU as well.

30:30.880 --> 30:36.440
And I'm going to plug my eGPU in and I'm off to the races. So I actually anticipate the

30:36.440 --> 30:42.020
upgrade is going to be the time it takes me to unscrew one, remove the parts, plug them

30:42.020 --> 30:44.040
into the other and put the lids back on.

30:44.040 --> 30:48.380
That's what I'm talking about. That's what I'm talking about. And as a work station,

30:48.380 --> 30:53.440
as a work station where you work and you want it to be reliable and you want to have minimal

30:53.440 --> 30:59.920
fuss, that is, even if it only works for two models, even if you can only pull this off

30:59.920 --> 31:04.340
from the Skull Canyon to the Hades Skull Canyon or whatever, the Hades, even if it

31:04.340 --> 31:11.680
only happens once, that is so worth it. That kind of smooth, keep going about your day,

31:11.680 --> 31:17.360
kind of, it's going to take you the time to reassemble and disassemble. That is so valuable.

31:17.360 --> 31:22.520
That's what I'm talking about. The same thing here is we bought early on when the NUCs were

31:22.520 --> 31:24.320
brand new and they were those cute little squares.

31:24.320 --> 31:25.760
Yeah, I've had a couple of those too.

31:25.760 --> 31:26.760
Yeah, it was the same.

31:26.760 --> 31:27.760
I have some of those.

31:27.760 --> 31:31.080
Yeah, it was the same thing as we were able to move the parts between them and that brought

31:31.080 --> 31:37.240
a certain glue and duct tapeness to them. We could just stick them wherever we needed

31:37.240 --> 31:41.620
them. They weren't always even the best machine for the job, but because they were so flexible

31:41.620 --> 31:46.540
and so easy to move parts in, you could just stick them wherever you needed them. It is

31:46.540 --> 31:51.440
supremely useful. So yeah, this will probably be the generation I buy in. I kind of wish

31:51.440 --> 31:56.640
I got this Skull Canyon. It just didn't really work out, but I think this will be the year

31:56.640 --> 32:01.120
hopefully. Maybe we'll have reviews. I'm sure you'll have a review, if nothing else, on

32:01.120 --> 32:03.560
the Fantastic Ubuntu podcast when it returns.

32:03.560 --> 32:05.680
Well, that's still undecided.

32:05.680 --> 32:08.120
Of course, of course. Yes, of course it is.

32:08.120 --> 32:13.600
Christmas break. We are very much pre-curry at this point.

32:13.600 --> 32:14.600
Has curry been scheduled?

32:14.600 --> 32:18.560
No, no, we haven't scheduled curry yet.

32:18.560 --> 32:19.560
Oh, okay.

32:19.560 --> 32:24.800
No, we are in full Christmas New Year break, not even talking about it to one another at

32:24.800 --> 32:25.800
the moment.

32:25.800 --> 32:26.800
Amazing. I can't even fathom.

32:26.800 --> 32:27.800
What a world.

32:27.800 --> 32:28.800
I can't even fathom.

32:28.800 --> 32:29.800
What a world.

32:29.800 --> 32:34.240
Yeah, it's some sort of utopia. Speaking of utopia, why not switch over to a mobile utopia?

32:34.240 --> 32:39.520
Go to ting, linux.ting.com. It's a smarter way to do mobile because you only pay for

32:39.520 --> 32:44.400
what you freaking use. I know. They just take your minutes, your messages, and your megabytes,

32:44.400 --> 32:47.800
and they put them all together, and they're like, okay, guess what, homes? Six dollars

32:47.800 --> 32:53.080
for the line. Then your usage. That's it. That's it.

32:53.080 --> 32:57.760
What about like weird fees? Do I have to like sign a five-year deal to get that sweet price?

32:57.760 --> 33:01.960
No contracts. In fact, you could try it for a month, and you could say, screw you, I'm

33:01.960 --> 33:05.360
out of here, and there's no termination fee. In fact, if you want to turn it on and turn

33:05.360 --> 33:11.240
it off, you could do that. I have two myfis from Ting, one that I leave on all the time,

33:11.240 --> 33:16.320
and then one that I only leave on when I'm traveling because it's CDMA, and I'm like,

33:16.320 --> 33:21.520
eh, you know, but it's great for when I'm traveling. I just go to linux.ting.com, I

33:21.520 --> 33:26.760
log into my ass, I turn it on. It's so straightforward. Six dollars a month for the device means that

33:26.760 --> 33:32.200
if you need a go-to line for a monitoring device, for something in your IT bag, it's

33:32.200 --> 33:36.800
easy. But if you want to use it as your full service, you feel like you're hacking the

33:36.800 --> 33:40.680
system, you know? You feel like you're hacking the system because you can download your audio

33:40.680 --> 33:45.280
books and your podcasts, and you can pin your music on Wi-Fi, and then if you don't take

33:45.280 --> 33:51.960
calls while you're driving, I mean, for me, when I'm commuting just between work and home,

33:51.960 --> 33:55.800
I'm like some sort of new-age, non-cell using guy. You wouldn't even think I had a cellphone.

33:55.800 --> 33:59.720
I don't talk to anybody on the phone when I'm driving. That's crazy. And don't even

33:59.720 --> 34:04.720
text me. I'm using the, I'm using iOS 11. You know what I turned on? You know what they

34:04.720 --> 34:05.720
got in that thing?

34:05.720 --> 34:07.280
What do they got? What do they got?

34:07.280 --> 34:13.800
They got this, they got this system where it automatically using the accelerometer and

34:13.800 --> 34:19.660
the Wi-Fi chipset, when it notices that you're blasting past Wi-Fi access points like a maniac,

34:19.660 --> 34:26.040
the phone goes, oh, you're driving. You're driving. Let me turn on do not disturb mode.

34:26.040 --> 34:27.040
Wasn't that nice?

34:27.040 --> 34:30.640
So people, when they text me, they get a message back going, homeboy's driving. Do you really

34:30.640 --> 34:33.480
need to interrupt him? Is it that important? You what? You got nothing else to do right

34:33.480 --> 34:34.480
now? What's your big deal?

34:34.480 --> 34:35.480
Yeah, why are you so bored?

34:35.480 --> 34:36.480
You're so important?

34:36.480 --> 34:37.480
Get your life on.

34:37.480 --> 34:39.500
So they get like this thing that comes back, tells them to shut the hell up so they don't

34:39.500 --> 34:40.500
bother me.

34:40.500 --> 34:41.500
So you're happy already right there.

34:41.500 --> 34:44.960
And I don't, I don't have to deal with nothing. I just listen to my podcasts.

34:44.960 --> 34:45.960
Drive it along.

34:45.960 --> 34:50.360
You're never spending a dime on cellular because you just pay for what you use. Six dollars

34:50.360 --> 34:54.840
for the line, you pay for what you use. Go to linux.ting.com and I got a suggestion.

34:54.840 --> 34:57.080
You need a phone? Do you need a phone?

34:57.080 --> 34:58.080
Yeah. Oh, who doesn't?

34:58.080 --> 34:59.080
What do you got?

34:59.080 --> 35:00.080
Me?

35:00.080 --> 35:01.080
Do you have the Pixel?

35:01.080 --> 35:02.080
I do have the Pixel.

35:02.080 --> 35:03.080
But you don't really need a phone.

35:03.080 --> 35:04.960
But I mean, maybe, maybe I need a phone.

35:04.960 --> 35:06.600
You will. What about like a backup phone?

35:06.600 --> 35:07.600
Well, when you drop that thing.

35:07.600 --> 35:09.960
Or when I, yeah, when I smashed this to tiny little bits.

35:09.960 --> 35:14.440
So everybody knows that some of the best Android experiences are the Motorola devices. Check

35:14.440 --> 35:19.940
this out. Motorola G5s Plus. Two hundred and fifty dollars when you go to linux.ting.com.

35:19.940 --> 35:25.580
No contract. It's new. It's a multi-network CDMA and GSM. So you can just pick whatever

35:25.580 --> 35:30.040
works best in your area. And you can even deactivate and reactivate. It's got 32 gigs

35:30.040 --> 35:34.320
of storage. Goes up to 128 gigs with S, with an external SD.

35:34.320 --> 35:35.320
Oh, I love that.

35:35.320 --> 35:36.320
MicroSD.

35:36.320 --> 35:40.640
I know. More phones need to have MicroSD. Also has turbocharging so you can charge,

35:40.640 --> 35:43.320
you can get six hours of battery in 15 minutes.

35:43.320 --> 35:44.320
Nice.

35:44.320 --> 35:50.240
And it has a super high resolution. It's a 5.5 inch screen. But it's a 400, 401 PPI

35:50.240 --> 35:51.240
density.

35:51.240 --> 35:52.240
Oh, that's good. Yeah.

35:52.240 --> 35:58.360
Yeah. And it's got a fingerprint unlock. All metal design. Android 7.1 with Android 8 update

35:58.360 --> 35:59.360
coming soon.

35:59.360 --> 36:03.880
It sounds like flagship features without a flagship price, Chris.

36:03.880 --> 36:06.060
Two hundred and fifty, two hundred and fifty four dollars. You completely own it outright.

36:06.060 --> 36:11.160
No contract. No agreements. Nothing. Two hundred and fifty four dollars. You completely own

36:11.160 --> 36:16.160
this phone. You get a great Android experience. 8.0 is coming down the pipeline. Fingerprint

36:16.160 --> 36:20.720
reader. 401 PPI screen. And you pay for what you use.

36:20.720 --> 36:26.120
It's obvious. Linux.ting.com. Go there. Get $25 off the device. Or if you want to bring

36:26.120 --> 36:29.160
one, if you've got something that's compatible, check their BYOD page. They'll give you service

36:29.160 --> 36:36.400
credit. Linux.ting.com. And thank you to Ting for sponsoring this here unplugged program.

36:36.400 --> 36:42.680
So Cassidy James over at elementary OS wrote up a post on the medium blog that elementary,

36:42.680 --> 36:46.460
I think that's how it works. I don't, I don't get medium, but my, my, my vague understanding

36:46.460 --> 36:53.480
is, is you can have a medium blog and elementary has a medium blog. And over there, Cassidy

36:53.480 --> 36:59.240
wrote about a new tool that's coming to elementary desktop users. And I thought, who better to

36:59.240 --> 37:06.280
pick the brain of than regular friend of the show, Mr. Mr. Dan the rabbit. Yeah. So Mr.

37:06.280 --> 37:12.840
Daniel Fore joins us and from the elementary project with I, what I perceived to be has

37:12.840 --> 37:17.200
to be the only scoop on this, right? Nobody better to go to than, well, except for maybe

37:17.200 --> 37:21.920
Cassidy since he wrote the post. Well, we got Dan. So Dan, what can you tell us about

37:21.920 --> 37:25.840
a, what may be a renamed to something that may be named code soon?

37:25.840 --> 37:33.400
Okay. So I guess the big, the big thing about it is it's not really necessarily a new thing.

37:33.400 --> 37:41.880
It's a new old thing. So we've been working, um, we released our scratch text editor in

37:41.880 --> 37:46.600
like 2011, right? Like when we did a Luna way back in the day and hacking on this thing

37:46.600 --> 37:53.000
for ages kind of came to a point with it where we sat down and kind of thought about, okay,

37:53.000 --> 37:56.640
what's the point of this app? Like, what is it supposed to do? Is it for notes? Is it

37:56.640 --> 38:01.880
for hacking on code? Is it, you know, what, what's, what do we do with this app? And we

38:01.880 --> 38:07.920
finally decided, you know, this is an app that we use every day for programming. And

38:07.920 --> 38:12.280
so we're going to rebrand it. We're going to change all the defaults and we're going

38:12.280 --> 38:16.440
to make it a great code editor and not just a generic text editor.

38:16.440 --> 38:22.480
I think this is, this is great. It looks good too. Now I have so many questions that come

38:22.480 --> 38:28.960
to mind when I hear this. So first of all, do you, okay, uh, boy, I don't want to forget

38:28.960 --> 38:31.320
them. So I'm going to tell you what they both are. Number one, do you think people are going

38:31.320 --> 38:38.440
to use this over say Adam or visual studio code or sublime text or insert whatever builder

38:38.440 --> 38:46.720
or, and, and known builder? Yeah, that's that. Yeah. And, um, uh, do you foresee that a large,

38:46.720 --> 38:50.600
do you, do you perceive, I guess I should say that a large portion of the elementary

38:50.600 --> 38:56.400
os user base are developers or do you, are they more end users? This seems like, um,

38:56.400 --> 38:59.920
I don't know. This is, I love it. I think it's, I think it looks great. I think it's

38:59.920 --> 39:05.400
a great idea, but I also wonder if it's a little bit of, of, um, of, um, a result of,

39:05.400 --> 39:12.480
of an echo chamber or a bubble. Um, I mean, well, to answer the first question, uh, definitely

39:12.480 --> 39:18.160
at least, um, we use it all the time and we hear about people who use it cause they're,

39:18.160 --> 39:22.640
they're filing issue reports and tweeting at us and stuff like that. Um, so we know

39:22.640 --> 39:26.840
that there's a good amount of people that prefer having a native app to a, um, like

39:26.840 --> 39:31.400
a cross platform or electronic. Yeah. Yeah. I would be one of those people. Yeah. Yeah.

39:31.400 --> 39:37.120
Just for performance and integration features. Um, I mean, there's, there's niceties in code

39:37.120 --> 39:43.600
that you get like, uh, so in the latest version of terminal, we have style schemes now. And

39:43.600 --> 39:47.960
if you use the terminal plugin in code and you change your style scheme in the terminal

39:47.960 --> 39:53.040
app, the terminal plugin and code will match the new style. Cool. There's a lot of little

39:53.040 --> 39:56.640
niceties like that where it's the apps are integrated with each other and they feel

39:56.640 --> 40:01.760
native. So there's, there's come some compelling reasons to use code instead of using a different

40:01.760 --> 40:08.120
a text editor app like Adam. Yeah. But, uh, and your second question was, I'm sorry, what

40:08.120 --> 40:09.120
was it?

40:09.120 --> 40:13.520
I mean, do you see a large portion of your user base, um, wanting something like this?

40:13.520 --> 40:16.480
Do you see a lot of developers on elementary or is it mostly just you guys that are the

40:16.480 --> 40:24.240
developers on elementary? Well, we're definitely, um, we're working with a new, uh, large third

40:24.240 --> 40:32.960
party ecosystem of developers. Uh, we just crossed 70 apps in an app center. So a huge

40:32.960 --> 40:38.120
part of our focus on our mission lately has been making sure that we have a really great

40:38.120 --> 40:43.400
developer story for them and including great developer tools out of the box, I think is

40:43.400 --> 40:48.000
part of that story. Right. Of course you, you want to make it easier for people to make

40:48.000 --> 40:52.960
applications for elementary desktop users, even if it's not a huge portion of the user

40:52.960 --> 40:56.000
base people that are, there's going to be some people that are using the desktop to

40:56.000 --> 41:00.640
create applications for users. That makes a lot of sense. I think it looks great. So,

41:00.640 --> 41:04.560
um, all right. Can people get their hands on it right now? Or is this is like the final

41:04.560 --> 41:09.160
like quote unquote code version when it's completely become code. Is that going to be

41:09.160 --> 41:15.440
something that isn't a future release? Well, you can go pull a get master. It's open source

41:15.440 --> 41:23.800
up at a github.com forward slash elementary forward slash code. That's super easy, right?

41:23.800 --> 41:29.760
But, um, we will, we are doing the, the stable release of code will come with our Juno update,

41:29.760 --> 41:37.240
which is the next release of elementary OS. Hmm. So Juno is going to be based on 1804.

41:37.240 --> 41:44.000
That's correct. Oh man. You know, you know, I want to ask you like how long until after

41:44.000 --> 41:50.000
1804, but I know you don't have an answer for me, but just to set expectations, do you

41:50.000 --> 41:55.760
want to, do you want to like, like, um, set any kind of expectations, how long Juno may

41:55.760 --> 42:00.320
be until we actually are downloading it and installing it on our systems? Well, I can

42:00.320 --> 42:07.120
tell you that we're testing a 1804 daily builds right now and that we've been, um, building

42:07.120 --> 42:13.920
all of our apps on 1710 before that in preparation. So we have a lot of major migration work and

42:13.920 --> 42:21.800
regression testing already done. Um, uh, so we're really hoping to get as close as possible

42:21.800 --> 42:26.680
to that 1804 release date, uh, maybe give a little padding so that we're not overlapping

42:26.680 --> 42:32.180
with their press releases. But, um, we're, we're really going to try as hard as possible

42:32.180 --> 42:37.520
to get it out right away. You know, it's interesting. It's awesome Daniel. Yeah. Go you. Yeah, it

42:37.520 --> 42:43.800
is really good. Thanks. And I, I think, um, I've, I've been looking at elementary OS in

42:43.800 --> 42:51.320
a different perspective as Ubuntu is getting better for some reason. Like I, I, I look

42:51.320 --> 42:57.120
at 1804 based on gnome and I think this is going to be, this is going to be the development

42:57.120 --> 43:02.400
workstation to compete with. 1804 is going to be canonicals second crack at shipping

43:02.400 --> 43:08.880
a gnome desktop. And I'll say that 1710 is essentially the beta test for 1804. And so

43:08.880 --> 43:14.040
they, they're, they're trying out a lot of stuff in 1710 and what you're going to get

43:14.040 --> 43:20.260
with 1804 is the best of what worked on top of that. Ubuntu is enjoying, um, quite a bit

43:20.260 --> 43:26.040
of brand recognition at the moment, quite a bit of industry support. And from all indications,

43:26.040 --> 43:30.980
snaps seem to be also increasing in industry support. So these, these things are all coming

43:30.980 --> 43:35.540
together I think. And plus then you combine things like the new XPS 13 and this NUC that's

43:35.540 --> 43:40.040
coming along, it's going to just be an undoubtedly great solid Linux workstation. Uh, it, to

43:40.040 --> 43:47.900
me it seems like 1804 is going to be uniquely competitive in its, um, draw to developers

43:47.900 --> 43:53.320
and the Sputnik type users that Dell seems success with their sales. But at the same

43:53.320 --> 44:01.000
time elementary OS seems very poised to sort of take advantage of some of the same momentum.

44:01.000 --> 44:08.820
And um, it could come down to your desktop has less rough edges than the gnome experience

44:08.820 --> 44:13.480
and that's enough to sway a certain percentage of people. It could come down to the native

44:13.480 --> 44:18.060
applications are more appealing to a certain set of users than having everything as an

44:18.060 --> 44:25.700
electron on your Ubuntu desktop. Um, and so I, I am, I am really, I am really interested

44:25.700 --> 44:31.400
in the Juno release because it's going to be released in such a competitive year for

44:31.400 --> 44:35.800
Linux desktops because we're not even talking about like the work that Fedora is doing.

44:35.800 --> 44:41.600
And so it's just going to be a fascinating, fascinating release to watch. And, um, I,

44:41.600 --> 44:45.240
I am, I think I, at least I hope, I think you guys are going to be better positioned

44:45.240 --> 44:50.360
the closer you are to the 1804 release, the better positions you are to be considered

44:50.360 --> 44:55.840
a, you know, an alternative. Um, and uh, code and, and, and, and things like that I think

44:55.840 --> 44:59.960
are a really good step in that direction. I, I'll tell you what, if you, when things

44:59.960 --> 45:03.360
get closer, if you want to, if you want a very particular beta tester, let me know.

45:03.360 --> 45:06.600
I'd be happy to kick the tires a bit to give you some feedback because I'm really excited

45:06.600 --> 45:10.800
about the release. Definitely, definitely. And I'd love to talk to you more about it

45:10.800 --> 45:15.080
on the show too, as we come up with more announcements of what we're going to be working on and we're

45:15.080 --> 45:21.280
doing. Um, we recently kind of switched, uh, Loki over into maintenance mode and we had

45:21.280 --> 45:27.000
been doing these, uh, monthly updates posts for lucky. Right. So I like that going forward,

45:27.000 --> 45:32.240
um, we're going to be trying to make at least monthly posts about all the new features that

45:32.240 --> 45:37.640
are coming into Juneau as they land. I, I think if you are, and not you, I mean just

45:37.640 --> 45:42.480
like the proverbial, like people out there that are, that are releasing distributions,

45:42.480 --> 45:48.760
if um, you didn't watch what happened with 1710 and did rocks blog posts that communicated

45:48.760 --> 45:54.000
where they were going with 1710 and how, how dramatically that impacted the perception and

45:54.000 --> 45:59.160
reception to Ubuntu 1710, then you're asleep at the wheel. If you are, if you are running

45:59.160 --> 46:04.520
any distribution out there and didn't learn a lesson from how that communication made

46:04.520 --> 46:12.500
a huge difference, then I, I, you're, you probably ought to just give up because that's,

46:12.500 --> 46:17.040
I know it's difficult because it takes a ton of effort to make a great blog post like that.

46:17.040 --> 46:22.240
It takes somebody who actually knows what's going on. You got to get screenshots. It is,

46:22.240 --> 46:28.280
it is more effort than we'd like to admit it is, but the rewards are so high and um,

46:28.280 --> 46:32.060
you guys are getting there with, with these, I, I've been in, I've been, I didn't expect

46:32.060 --> 46:36.120
it throughout the Loki release. I did not, I didn't expect the updates on what's going

46:36.120 --> 46:39.440
on and every time they've, they've landed on the blog, I've been like, that's great.

46:39.440 --> 46:43.160
That gives us something to talk about. It makes the, it makes the distribution, um,

46:43.160 --> 46:47.880
a relevant topic for the week. Yeah. You get an idea of what their focus is. It's like,

46:47.880 --> 46:52.960
you can observe something over a longer period of time and get a better idea. Yes. Yeah.

46:52.960 --> 46:56.320
So good on you. Glad to hear it. Sounds like you guys learned some of those lessons watching

46:56.320 --> 47:02.640
the 1710 release too. And uh, boy, I just, I feel bad for the distributions that haven't

47:02.640 --> 47:06.360
figured that out yet. Um, well good, Dan, keep us posted. I'm looking forward to hearing

47:06.360 --> 47:11.120
that. Now the register has a story where they make the case that, um, it's going to be the

47:11.120 --> 47:18.320
year of gnome and that when you add in flat pack and snaps, it could be a new revolution

47:18.320 --> 47:22.980
for the Linux desktop. Um, that's right. It only took our first episode in 2018 for us

47:22.980 --> 47:29.440
to call it as the year of the Linux desktop. Thank you, register. Um, so I guess we should

47:29.440 --> 47:35.800
mention since our last episode, uh, where I was on it in, in, in 2017, there was a bug

47:35.800 --> 47:41.800
rise. We got off the air that became public that, um, 1710 was causing some issues on

47:41.800 --> 47:49.120
some Lenovo laptops and it was, uh, apparently it was the Intel SBI driver, which allows

47:49.120 --> 47:55.140
for bios firmware updates, which is I guess not primetime ready. And uh, so that's still

47:55.140 --> 48:01.320
kind of going on as, as we talk about this. So 1710 has, has been a great release except

48:01.320 --> 48:06.640
for that whole laptop thing. Um, I haven't followed it closely. Wimpy, is there any,

48:06.640 --> 48:10.940
do you have any anecdotes or any additional information or state status of where it's

48:10.940 --> 48:16.000
at right now before I move on from it? Uh, yeah, I tell you what, I'll paste something

48:16.000 --> 48:22.060
in the discourse, uh, discord just quickly. Yeah. All right. Uh, that's, that's the link

48:22.060 --> 48:28.920
to the ISO testing for the re spin of the 1710 ISOs for Ubuntu and all the flavors.

48:28.920 --> 48:36.420
So that testing is happening now and the release is scheduled for Thursday, the 11th of January.

48:36.420 --> 48:44.760
And um, boy, so 1710 has been unavailable that entire time. Uh, it has for main Ubuntu.

48:44.760 --> 48:50.920
Yeah. Um, so, but the, the thing is, is that everyone thinks that this is an Ubuntu problem

48:50.920 --> 48:55.780
and it wasn't the case. Other distributions have had this problem. It's just at scale

48:55.780 --> 49:01.840
more people experience it with Ubuntu. It's an Intel SBI driver issue, right? So it's,

49:01.840 --> 49:07.160
it's really anything, anybody that turns on it. So the, the, the it's Ubuntu's fault narrative

49:07.160 --> 49:12.080
has been well, canonical are the ones that decided to turn that feature on because it's,

49:12.080 --> 49:17.320
it's actually turned off by default upstream.

49:17.320 --> 49:22.320
Lots of things are turned off upstream that are turned on. Yeah. Boy, isn't that true?

49:22.320 --> 49:29.300
Yeah. Yeah. Um, so, um, it sounds like 1710 will be again, like I said, it's in some ways

49:29.300 --> 49:33.760
it's like you do this now to figure out what not to do for 1804, right? So it's like you

49:33.760 --> 49:39.080
catch this now before it's in the LTS. Same with, um, uh, the wifi crack pass, uh, issue

49:39.080 --> 49:47.880
and a meltdown inspector, like 1804 is going to ship with a crack patched and, uh, this

49:47.880 --> 49:54.760
issue figured out and, um, uh, the meltdown inspector patches, right? So that's, it really,

49:54.760 --> 50:01.240
there really is a logic to the, to the process. Um, but the register proposes that, uh, canonical

50:01.240 --> 50:08.280
dropping unity was the biggest single story in Linux for 2017. And they think that Ubuntu

50:08.280 --> 50:12.960
without unity will continue to be a big story for the foreseeable future. Um, because with

50:12.960 --> 50:18.800
Ubuntu using gnome shell, remember this isn't Chris saying this, this is the register with

50:18.800 --> 50:24.240
the Ubuntu using gnome shell, almost all the major distributions out there now ship primarily

50:24.240 --> 50:33.680
with gnome making gnome shell, the defacto standard Linux desktop, which, um, if I, if

50:33.680 --> 50:37.440
you were going to, if I were going to rewrite that, I might say making GTK more like the

50:37.440 --> 50:42.520
defacto toolkit. But yeah, you're probably right. I've, I've got opinions about that

50:42.520 --> 50:50.000
article and I'm just going to, I'm just going to start by saying these are not colored by

50:50.000 --> 50:59.480
my involvement in the Marte project at all. This is me talking as a Linux desktop enthusiast

50:59.480 --> 51:06.880
that has an appreciation for Linux desktops across the board. And if you look at the big

51:06.880 --> 51:14.160
applications that people are using on the Linux desktop, Firefox and Thunderbird and

51:14.160 --> 51:22.940
LibreOffice and Google Chrome and Skype and Slack and Spotify, just to name a few, none

51:22.940 --> 51:31.360
of those are GTK three applications. None of those are gnome applications. So I, I don't,

51:31.360 --> 51:39.680
I don't necessarily agree this is going to drive developers to creating gnome applications.

51:39.680 --> 51:48.360
That's a fair point. I do think it gives the Linux desktop a more consistent target, which

51:48.360 --> 51:55.880
is built around gnome and GTK three technologies, which lots of other desktops sit on top of.

51:55.880 --> 52:03.160
Daniel from elementary, for example, me representing Marte here, currently budgie, but eventually

52:03.160 --> 52:10.120
cute. Cinnamon is another one, you know, so it does give a common toolkit target, but

52:10.120 --> 52:14.940
I really don't think that developers who want to target the Linux desktop are suddenly going

52:14.940 --> 52:19.580
to want to learn the complexities of GTK three at all.

52:19.580 --> 52:22.320
Gnome builder is not enough to make a, make that happen.

52:22.320 --> 52:27.200
Personally, I don't think so. I think that if developers are going to come to Linux,

52:27.200 --> 52:31.320
you just look at the big applications. Now you've got Adobe with brackets, you've got

52:31.320 --> 52:39.760
Atom, Microsoft Visual Studio Code, Microsoft Skype. These are all electron applications.

52:39.760 --> 52:44.120
Spotify's Chromium embedded frameworks, which is a similar framework tool. I think if we're

52:44.120 --> 52:48.840
going to see the large software vendors bring their software to Linux, it's going to be

52:48.840 --> 52:54.580
through a more portable cross platform framework like electron, right? Yeah, these moves may

52:54.580 --> 52:59.000
have helped several years ago, but electron is still the easiest path forward, right?

52:59.000 --> 53:02.760
The most maintainable, but it does have to count for something. I mean, if you have the

53:02.760 --> 53:10.680
ubiquity of GTK and gnome, and then you bring in flat and snap packs, it Oh, yeah, I mean,

53:10.680 --> 53:15.880
the story there is there is a common target now in a way that we've never had with Linux.

53:15.880 --> 53:21.640
Yes, definite, definitely snap and flat pack, give you a way to target the Linux desktop

53:21.640 --> 53:28.400
in terms of easing your package and packaging and software delivery in a way that third

53:28.400 --> 53:35.080
party developers who are not in the Linux, you know, bubble. So have had before what

53:35.080 --> 53:41.280
about what about the horrible irony? And this is my personal opinion that our friends over

53:41.280 --> 53:49.320
in plasma land may have better solutions. Here I am. I'm not using gnome three, because

53:49.320 --> 53:53.800
I find it to be laggy and crashy, which I do not have that problem on my on my machine

53:53.800 --> 53:59.240
at home. I'm running the plasma desktop. What about all the KDE fans out there? Because

53:59.240 --> 54:06.000
this is this sucks. This sucks for them. If no every major does no, no, for the same

54:06.000 --> 54:13.440
reason. You have the open source enthusiasts who will be developing gnome applications

54:13.440 --> 54:20.120
or KDE applications and working on KDE or working on gnome or similar and related technologies.

54:20.120 --> 54:24.900
And then you have projects because not even Firefox, although Firefox looks like it may

54:24.900 --> 54:29.800
integrate with GTK three, it's not a GTK three application, it only takes hints from GTK

54:29.800 --> 54:34.120
three, as to how to style and theme and the same is true for LibreOffice. And the same

54:34.120 --> 54:38.720
is true for Google Chrome and Chromium. Those are probably the biggest applications people

54:38.720 --> 54:42.760
are using on the desktop right now. And the same is also true for all of the electron

54:42.760 --> 54:50.480
applications. It was only on November the 27th last year, the GTK three support landed

54:50.480 --> 54:57.400
in electron upstream. And even today with electron, I think it's 1.8 point something

54:57.400 --> 55:03.120
beta three, that's still linked against GTK two. So they're not releasing, you know, new

55:03.120 --> 55:07.080
versions of electron that are linked and built against GTK three.

55:07.080 --> 55:11.720
But now they have the green light, they have the go ahead to say here is the next target

55:11.720 --> 55:15.840
for us to rebase on. Part of that is nobody wanted to pull the trigger because they didn't

55:15.840 --> 55:21.600
know what to rebase on. But now if you have Fedora and SUSE and CentOS and Red Hat Enterprise

55:21.600 --> 55:27.720
Linux and Ubuntu all shipping gnome desktop, plus then some of the most popular derivatives

55:27.720 --> 55:36.040
Ubuntu mate, elementary OS solace, they're all using GTK desktops. The foregone conclusion

55:36.040 --> 55:41.720
is well, that's our new target now gnome 320 or later is our new target. And I mean, give

55:41.720 --> 55:47.280
a time I give it give it in 2019. It may be a foregone conclusion that you just target

55:47.280 --> 55:49.480
gnome 320 or something.

55:49.480 --> 55:57.200
I think elementary are the exception to the rule here in that they've actually got a growing

55:57.200 --> 56:06.560
community of application developers targeting specifically their toolkit, their design language,

56:06.560 --> 56:12.560
and their desktop environment. And I don't add the keyword here is growing, you know,

56:12.560 --> 56:16.640
because it's clearly growing because every time Daniel comes on and talks about the number

56:16.640 --> 56:22.840
of apps has gone up by 10. Right. And we also know that isn't an untruth because we can

56:22.840 --> 56:28.240
see it. But I don't think that this is true for those other desktops and their application

56:28.240 --> 56:35.280
ecosystem. But I'm not saying that the Linux desktop is in a state of decline. I think

56:35.280 --> 56:39.280
it could be in a very healthy place. But I think a lot of the applications that we're

56:39.280 --> 56:45.400
going to be using aren't going to be native to the desktop environment that we're currently

56:45.400 --> 56:46.400
running.

56:46.400 --> 56:52.200
I do agree. Yeah. And I think it's just a market reality. It's where it's the same.

56:52.200 --> 56:56.420
It's not actually it's not a Linux. It's not unique to Linux. It is something that Mac

56:56.420 --> 57:02.520
users are also going through and Windows users. Slack is a electron app on Windows is just

57:02.520 --> 57:07.240
as much as it is on the Mac and just as much it is on a Linux desktop. It's not something

57:07.240 --> 57:11.480
it's unique to us. It's a it's a bigger story. It's a bigger market dynamic that's going

57:11.480 --> 57:15.580
on than Linux. And so I think I think you're just absolutely right because of those forces

57:15.580 --> 57:16.580
at play.

57:16.580 --> 57:20.280
But I'd love to hear what Daniel has to say because I know he has opinions about this

57:20.280 --> 57:29.400
too long enough. Oh, boy, do I have opinions. Now, you know, one of the big problems I think

57:29.400 --> 57:35.160
is actually coming from a design perspective instead of a toolkit perspective, because

57:35.160 --> 57:42.080
even GTK apps that are built for GNOME don't necessarily work on other desktop environments.

57:42.080 --> 57:46.680
For example, GNOME games require some system settings that are part of GNOME in order to

57:46.680 --> 57:52.800
configure where the library gets stored. Or a GNOME builder shows two maximize icons on

57:52.800 --> 57:56.800
elementary OS because it expects that in GNOME there is no maximize icon.

57:56.800 --> 58:04.920
Yeah. Oh, that's brutal. It's so basic. It's so it's so 90s. It's so basic. It's actually

58:04.920 --> 58:05.920
pathetic.

58:05.920 --> 58:10.680
But I can't call this a GNOME problem because we have the same problem the other way. You

58:10.680 --> 58:14.720
know, people who are writing apps for elementary OS are expecting to use our style sheet because

58:14.720 --> 58:19.000
we have special features that they take advantage of, style classes, things like that. So when

58:19.000 --> 58:24.760
you use our apps on GNOME or even on Mate, like they're really broken. And the guys in

58:24.760 --> 58:30.280
Pop OS have been doing a lot of work in their style sheet to try to maintain compatibility

58:30.280 --> 58:33.640
with apps that have been targeted and built for elementary OS.

58:33.640 --> 58:40.760
Sure. Yeah. Now, it to me seems like this is the downside. The downside is probably

58:40.760 --> 58:47.400
too harsh. This is the side effect. This is the action reaction when you try to create

58:47.400 --> 58:53.360
a platform. So GNOME builder is meant for the GNOME platform, right? GNOME software

58:53.360 --> 58:59.440
is meant for the GNOME platform, GNOME games. All of that is meant for the GNOME desktop

58:59.440 --> 59:04.080
platform. And we all remember when the GNOME folks were talking about building even GNOME

59:04.080 --> 59:09.520
OS. Remember when GNOME OS was going to be a thing? Like they're not building these things

59:09.520 --> 59:15.720
for people running Mate or Pantheon. They're building these things for people that are

59:15.720 --> 59:23.200
running a modern version of the GNOME platform. And if you're building a platform, just like

59:23.200 --> 59:27.720
you guys are building a platform, isn't that just how it goes?

59:27.720 --> 59:34.720
Yeah. I don't think any amount of toolkit or packaging work is ever going to solve this

59:34.720 --> 59:39.440
problem. The only thing that you can do to solve it as a design and development team

59:39.440 --> 59:44.080
is decide that you're going to forgo any form of desktop integration. You're going to forgo

59:44.080 --> 59:48.820
rules in human interface guidelines. You're going to forgo special platform features and

59:48.820 --> 59:49.820
special design features.

59:49.820 --> 59:50.820
And then you get new Skype.

59:50.820 --> 59:56.040
Right. You're going to build something that's either completely non-native everywhere or

59:56.040 --> 01:00:00.280
people are going to have a bad time on different platforms.

01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:05.960
You're completely correct. All right. Well, we got to move on, but great point. And we

01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:09.080
can pick it up in the post-show if we have more, but let's talk about where you can get

01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:12.880

01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:56.040
because this is one of my personal goals for 2018. And I say I'm not a resolutions guy,

01:00:56.040 --> 01:01:01.080
but if there's something about just starting fresh, I'm taking advantage of monitoring

01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:06.080
and alerting, collecting metrics, monitoring performance, and receiving alerts so I can

01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:11.080
optimize the Jupyter broadcasting backend. And it's just built in, no additional cost.

01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:15.860
DigitalOcean.com, go spin up my favorite machine. They got machines as cheap as $5 a month,

01:01:15.860 --> 01:01:20.960
so like our $10 credit is going to get you two months for free. DOUNPLUGGED. But my favorite

01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:24.200
system is $0.03 an hour. $0.03 an hour.

01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:26.520
It sounds insane, right? But it's a beast.

01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:30.160
Two gigs of RAM, two virtual CPUs, 40 gigabytes of SSD, and three terabytes of transfer.

01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:31.720
You can do whatever you want on that.

01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:32.720
Oh, boom.

01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:38.320
DigitalOcean.com, use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED. Also, quick plug for a community documentation,

01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:45.040
how to use ProxySQL as a load balancer for MySQL on Ubuntu 16.04. And I'm going to add

01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:50.240
an addendum. Consider also private networking, DigitalOcean's private networking feature

01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:56.440
with ProxySQL. You're welcome. I just saved you some money. I just made things way faster.

01:01:56.440 --> 01:02:00.440
I just made your whole thing look like a boss-level enterprise product. You're welcome.

01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:04.080
Yeah, right. They just help you and they push you into doing the right things. You designed

01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:05.080
it the right way. You have the right tools.

01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:10.960
ProxySQL, with their private networking, that's like money in the bank. DigitalOcean.com,

go create an account and then use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED. Big thank you to DigitalOcean

01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:16.920
for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:23.120
All right. So I want to talk about, briefly, Telegram's cryptocurrency plans, mostly because

01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:24.120
Wait, say that again.

01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:25.120
Yeah.

01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:26.120
What?

01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:27.120
Yeah.

01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:28.120
Yeah.

01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:32.200
The Telegram Open Network. It's going to be a third-generation blockchain network. Yeah.

01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:34.160
Not a first-gen, not a second-gen, Wes.

01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:35.160
Third-gen.

01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:36.160
Third-gen.

01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:37.760
Who sets these? Who gets to decide that?

01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:40.800
Everybody. Did you know that Kodak today announced that they're-

01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:41.800
Yes.

01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:42.800
Did you see that?

01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:43.800
Mm-hmm.

01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:48.760
This is getting crazy. You just put cryptocurrency or blockchain in your product name and your

01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:54.080
stock goes up 44%. Kodak is announcing a crypto coin. So yeah, the Telegram Open Network

01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:57.560
is coming at your face soon, Linux users. I know a bunch of you are a bunch of Telegram

01:02:57.560 --> 01:03:01.200
users. It's going to be a third-generation blockchain network building on the work of

01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:05.400
previous cryptocurrencies to provide something groundbreaking. They got a white paper, which

01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:07.320
is step one when you have a cryptocurrency.

01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:08.320
Oh, absolutely.

01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:14.100
You got to have a white paper. 132-page white paper that came out on Monday. They're going

01:03:14.100 --> 01:03:18.240
to kickstart a new cryptocurrency that will rapidly scale to meet the needs of its users.

01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:22.520
The wallet could launch as soon as the fourth quarter of this year, with the Telegram Open

01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:30.160
Network open to the rest of the users in 2019. It's a proof-of-stake model, which is similar

01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:37.480
to Bitcoin's proof-of-work model. My God. I bet you will see at least another 20 of

01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:44.680
these this year, because the technology is open source. If you've got a large user base,

01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:49.360
if Jupiter Broadcasting had the listener base of NPR, why not launch the Jupiter coin?

01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:50.360
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:55.080
You download a week's worth of episodes, and you get a coin. Then you can trade amongst

01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:59.320
each other. Of course, then you have an exchange where you can convert it to other cryptocurrencies

01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:04.680
or maybe even legal tender. There's a little bit of a skiff, a little percentage right

01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:16.000
off the top, the Telegram takes or the JB coin takes. How long until a Linux distribution?

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:21.360
If this was, it's just like, where does it stop? Where does it end? You're going to have

01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:28.560
distros that have cryptocurrencies. They're going to have 200 million grams in circulation.

01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:32.560
Four percent will be held by the development team. Fifty-two percent will be held by Telegram

01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:37.080
to avoid speculative trading. And the final 44 percent will be distributed in private

01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:40.760
and in public in sales.

01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:43.960
So will you be part of those sales, Chris? Are you going to be buying up? Are you going

01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:44.960
to be investing?

01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:49.200
It's the same thing. Like, if you're going to get in on a cryptocurrency, I mean, you

01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:53.960
got to figure, like, this is probably going to be a semi-successful cryptocurrency. It's

01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:57.700
probably going to be a way for bot makers to make money. It's probably going to come

01:04:57.700 --> 01:05:02.400
up and down. You could probably speculate and day trade with it. The Telegram coin.

01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:05.880
With the Telegram bot that you also wrote to buy and sell Telegram.

01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:07.000
My goodness.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:08.840
So I have a question.

01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:09.840
Yeah.

01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:11.960
Telegram's a Russian company, right?

01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:15.560
Yeah. Well, this is how they're going to break away from the control of the Putin government.

01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:20.520
Well, hasn't Russia, like, banned a lot of cryptocurrency stuff recently?

01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:25.800
No, no, no. No, not quite. What they're doing is they're going to start regulating it, which

01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:28.760
is really the stamp of approval for businesses to start using it.

01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:33.080
Well, I thought they were blocking a lot of cryptocurrency exchanges, though.

01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:38.580
That is kind of that there is a valuation period happening. But the end result. So this

01:05:38.580 --> 01:05:42.520
has happened in other countries, too. What happens is you get a headline like Bitcoin

01:05:42.520 --> 01:05:47.120
being blocked in China, Bitcoin being blocked in India, Bitcoin being blocked in Russia.

01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:52.060
What that translates to is the government's financial components are doing a review of

01:05:52.060 --> 01:05:56.720
how they can integrate cryptocurrencies into their fee structure. And then once they figure

01:05:56.720 --> 01:06:01.240
out how they can regulate and tax it, they turn it back on. And now all of a sudden businesses

01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:04.560
have been given a predictable model. They know how the government's going to react to

01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:09.520
their cryptocurrency revenues and they they go for it. So I actually think this is a result

01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:14.240
of the recent evaluation of the Russian government. This is sort of like this is the end result

01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:15.680
of those recent headlines.

01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:16.680
I see.

01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:22.400
Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. It is a crazy time we live in.

01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:26.320
See, now I just now we now we need Jupiter coin. How do we let's get started on that.

01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:34.360
I know. I know. I know. Or Ubuntu coin or Budgie coin or Solus coin. You know, ask Noah

01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:40.680
could have the ask Noah coin. Every time you call in, you get a coin. Oh, man. Noah probably

01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:43.720
doesn't want me to tell the story, but I'm going to tell it anyways, just just to tease

01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:47.920
the Ask Noah show that's coming up next. So Noah was cleaning out the kids room, you know,

01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:53.640
his parents every now and then just got to go into a big purge. And like two years ago

01:06:53.640 --> 01:06:58.360
and his kids are young, especially two years ago, right? He gave his kids as like stocking

01:06:58.360 --> 01:07:03.960
stuffers paper Bitcoins like like a not a whole Bitcoin, but like a fraction of a Bitcoin.

01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:09.800
Yes, which were worth like twenty five dollars at the time. And so the wife and him were

01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:12.640
looking at all the different stuff that they gone through and they found like these these

01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:17.360
two or three Bitcoin paper receipts. And so Noah does a little check on him and each one's

01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:21.320
now like worth two hundred and fifty dollars or something like that. And he's like good

01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:24.840
work, kid. He's like, this is my life, man. I just got like Bitcoin like just hanging

01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:28.900
out all over. I got loose change in Bitcoin at that bastard. But it was a pretty funny

01:07:28.900 --> 01:07:33.880
story of, you know, you just get in on something early enough. So, you know, set some set some

01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:38.240
Bitcoin aside. Or what you should do is if you've got Litecoin, set some Litecoin aside

01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:44.360
and plan to buy Telegram coin with your Litecoin. There you go. That'll probably do it. That'll

01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:50.960
probably do it. All right. Well, I feel like we should get into Linspire because I want

01:07:50.960 --> 01:07:53.960
to finish up the Gentoo challenge and I don't want to run out of time. You guys remember

01:07:53.960 --> 01:07:58.840
Linspire, right? Remember? Do you remember Linspire? I do. You might also you might remember

01:07:58.840 --> 01:08:04.960
Lindos. Yep. Lindos, which was a common covered topic early on in the Linux action show was

01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:11.140
a commercial distribution which changed hands a few times. It started out when it became

01:08:11.140 --> 01:08:17.000
Linspire as based on Debian. And the idea was to give a familiar desktop to Windows

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:20.720
users. It was even kind of promised to make it easy to run some Windows applications.

01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:24.800
Then later on in Linspire's history, it was rebased on Ubuntu and it continued to try

01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:31.040
to be like a user friendly distribution. But eventually it was sort of a commercial failure

01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:38.680
and it was purchased by another distribution called Xandros and then discontinued back

01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:44.240
in 2008. So this is how far back we're going. Now I was a particularly heavy Xandros user

01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:51.600
for a small period of time because Xandros was a Debian based distribution with out of

01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:57.560
the box like during your setup active directory support. Oh wow. And full complete integration

01:08:57.560 --> 01:09:03.520
with crossover office. So it associated exe's and autoruns.inf's and everything with crossover.

01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:10.720
So you could actually take the office 2003 or whatever it was back then, the office XP

01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:16.440
installation CD. You could put it in the CD-ROM drive of your Linux box and insert it and

01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:21.120
the autorun installer would come up as if you would just put it in a Windows box and

01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:26.560
walk you through the complete installation of Microsoft Office which be involved in a

01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:32.440
shop that needed to be able to open up XLS files and use Outlook with Exchange. That

01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:37.880
was a huge feature for me. So I was a big Xandros user. And in 2008 it was kind of a

01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:44.920
bummer to see that Xandros decided that Linspire just needed to end. Fast forward to the end

01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:52.880
of 2017 though and a company known as PC slash Open Systems LLC announced that they had purchased

01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:59.140
Linspire and its community edition Freespire and would resume development of these two

01:09:59.140 --> 01:10:09.200
Ubuntu based distributions. Now, just in the last week, Linspire 7.0 and Freespire 3.0

01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:16.240
were released. Now, Linspire is being sold as a commercial product which PC slash Open

01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:23.640
Systems is hoping to bundle with hardware or you can buy it. Now Freespire can be downloaded

01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:28.920
today free of charge. Freespire is like a respin without all of the proprietary components

01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:36.520
of Linspire. So what are those proprietary components? What do you get if you spend $7.99?

01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:43.720
$9.99 USD? What do you get? If you spend what actually works out to be $94 when all is said

01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:49.280
and done because they're going to ship you media and charge you for $10 or so for shipping.

01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:56.720
So what do you get for $95 when you download Linspire? I had to know. Like this distribution

01:10:56.720 --> 01:10:58.720
that's been around since the beginning of my podcast.

01:10:58.720 --> 01:10:59.720
It's a burning question.

01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:04.720
Like what do you get for $95 of an Ubuntu respin? So I decided to pay it so you don't

01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:11.440
have to and I've been loading it during this show. In fact, the installation is complete.

01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:15.360
I'm going to do a restart right now so we can kick the tires.

01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:16.960
Right here live. Anything could happen.

01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:20.040
I got to tell you, I played around with it for about an hour before the show too. So

01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:23.100
these are early impressions, but I played around with it for an hour before the show

01:11:23.100 --> 01:11:32.000
and I really went into it expecting it to be complete and total shit and was... Well

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:37.400
first of all, if I'm giving you my complete and honest impression, I thought I was using

01:11:37.400 --> 01:11:39.320
the Plasma desktop at first.

01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:40.320
Really?

01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:47.720
It uses LightDM for the login manager. It's based on Ubuntu 16.04 and when it booted up,

01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:58.320
I thought it was like a Plasma 5 desktop that's been reworked to remind you of the KDE 4 days.

01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:04.240
But not in a bad way, but in a tasteful way. And it wasn't until I opened up the terminal

01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:08.740
and looked at all the running processes that I realized that was the next thing I did.

01:12:08.740 --> 01:12:13.760
That I realized I was actually on XFCE and that I was using Thunar and it wasn't the

01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:20.040
Plasma desktop at all. So here it is right here. This is a LightDM login and I've already

01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:25.040
set up my user account here so I'll log in. And there's, out of the box, a couple of things

01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:31.960
that you don't get on FreeSpire. Number one is Chrome. So Chrome is the default browser

01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:34.680
out of the gate. Let me clear off. So I'm running it right now under virtualization

01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:38.040
because I didn't want to put it on my physical hardware. But I mean, I know it's a little

01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:42.240
hard to see it all, but tell me if that doesn't look like a KDE Plasma desktop right there.

01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:44.040
Oh yeah, I can definitely see what you're talking about.

01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:49.840
Yeah. So it threw me for a loop just a little bit. I was surprised, but then quickly impressed.

01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:54.580
It's got a nice menu launcher. It's got a couple of things pre-bundled in that I like

01:12:54.580 --> 01:12:59.500
quite a bit. It's still shipping Pigeon. It's got VLC as the default media player. Skype

01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:03.040
is pre-installed. We're going to come back to the Click and Run store here in just a

01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:08.640
moment. There's a couple other things I was surprised by. Bleach Bit is installed by default.

01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:09.640
Really?

01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:10.640
That drive wiping software.

01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:11.640
Yeah.

01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:18.040
Yeah. Unet Booton is installed by default. And VirtualBox, as well as all of the LM sensor

01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:25.480
stuff, is installed. And gdebi, my preferred package installer on Ubuntu desktops, is installed

01:13:25.480 --> 01:13:30.640
by default. I actually think that's pretty great. Also, a very simple firewall configuration

01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:35.880
is installed by default. I guess the best way to describe the theme is it's very Plasma,

01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:36.880
don't you think?

01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:37.880
Yeah, it is very Plasma.

01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:42.160
It's also kind of using like the Mac OS, old Mac OS X icons.

01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:45.600
It's not bad. I mean, I wouldn't call it beautiful, but it's not offensive.

01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:51.920
And it's fast, right? It's very, very fast. And out of the box, Samba and NMBD resolutions

01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:56.880
working. So let's talk about Click and Run. This is interesting. This is really interesting.

01:13:56.880 --> 01:14:03.600
It's well, do you remember the big thing about Click and Run back in the day was it was the

01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:07.080
first Linux app store.

01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:12.060
And it was even the first Linux app store that supported payments. That was the huge

01:14:12.060 --> 01:14:19.400
thing about Click and Run. And I was really curious to see if it had held up, if it was

01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:21.800
still populated, if they had current applications.

01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:24.400
Yeah, has it just wandered off into the weeds?

01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:27.080
And what is Linspire without Click and Run?

01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:31.840
Right. Yeah, that's the, that's how much of this is it Linspire in name only, or is it

01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:34.840
really a continuation of this noble lineage?

01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:40.740
Right. So I wanted to find out and that was, well,

01:14:40.740 --> 01:14:43.600
I was surprised by what I discovered, but it actually kind of makes sense. I'll tell

01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:48.000
you about it here in just a second. But first, let me mention Linux Academy, linuxacademy.com

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:52.960
slash unplugged. Go there and sign up and get a free seven day trial. It's a platform

01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:58.680
to learn more about Linux, a full featured training library with everything you need

01:14:58.680 --> 01:15:04.800
to know to learn, everything you need to know, everything you need to learn new skills or

01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:08.300
advance your career if you're ready to kind of move forward.

01:15:08.300 --> 01:15:15.000
I think probably my favorite feature about Linux Academy would be the learning paths

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:21.960
because you get content that has been specifically engineered by their instructors for specific

01:15:21.960 --> 01:15:28.800
career tracks. And then as you go along this track, they'll spin up like virtual cloud

01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:34.160
servers for you at SSHN and use these things really in production. They've got hands on

01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:40.000
scenario based labs to give you experience on real servers. They have practice exams

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:44.740
and quizzes to help you prepare for certifications so that way you can really take this stuff

01:15:44.740 --> 01:15:49.560
and apply it. And if you ever get stuck, they've got human beings that can help you, real instructors

01:15:49.560 --> 01:15:54.760
that are standing by, full time people on Linux Academy staff to help you. That's something

01:15:54.760 --> 01:16:01.560
that all of these other training sites that have Linux as a feature can't match.

01:16:01.560 --> 01:16:06.440
Now if you go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged, you can sign up for a free seven day trial

01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:12.080
so you can get a taste of what their content is, how the platform works. And the big thing

01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:17.000
that I figured out within the first 24 hours of signing up for Linux Academy was things

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:21.880
that were nebulous as like, God, one day I'd like to figure out how to even try to learn

01:16:21.880 --> 01:16:28.480
this thing. Things that were like categorized as that in my brain went to, oh, if I go to

01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:32.880
Linux Academy and spend four hours or six hours, I can understand how this entire thing

01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:38.680
works now. That is such a huge shift. And it's so empowering because even when you don't

01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:41.840
have a specific thing you need to learn, you can go there and you can say, well, I got

01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:42.840
two hours.

01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:45.480
Right. Sometimes that's the hardest thing. You have to learn how to learn. They've done

01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:50.020
a huge amount of that upfront work for you. You can just sit down and concentrate on actually

01:16:50.020 --> 01:16:51.020
learning.

01:16:51.020 --> 01:16:54.800
And then they give you a bunch of great study tools and lesson audio and personal notebooks

01:16:54.800 --> 01:17:00.480
that you can use offline. And they have iOS and Android apps to learn on the go. It's

01:17:00.480 --> 01:17:05.200
a great combo. Linux Academy dot com slash unplugged. Big thank you Linux Academy for

01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:11.820
sponsoring the unplugged program. Linux Academy dot com slash unplugged. All right, Mr. West,

01:17:11.820 --> 01:17:17.040
before we get back to the freaking Linspire debacle that I went down, the rabbit hole

01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:22.520
of Linspire, how is the Gen 2 challenge going over there?

01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:23.920
It's going quite well.

01:17:23.920 --> 01:17:26.520
Do you think we're getting near a graphical environment?

01:17:26.520 --> 01:17:27.520
Oh, yeah.

01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:28.520
Really?

01:17:28.520 --> 01:17:29.520
Yes.

01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:30.520
We've got Wayland built. We've got Sway built.

01:17:30.520 --> 01:17:31.520
Yep.

01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:35.840
You've got now we don't have a completely functional boot system or we do have a booting

01:17:35.840 --> 01:17:36.840
system. I can't remember.

01:17:36.840 --> 01:17:40.760
Yeah, it will boot. Actually, we're rebooting right now.

01:17:40.760 --> 01:17:47.260
All right. Okay. Well, so before we get there, before we wrap up the Gen 2 challenge completely,

01:17:47.260 --> 01:17:51.920
let me just finish off my thoughts on Linspire here. So when I launched the Click and Run

01:17:51.920 --> 01:18:01.360
store, I was greeted with Gnome software. The Click and Run store, yeah, the defining

01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:10.600
feature of Linspire has been replaced with Gnome software. Now, you know, I got to say,

01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:15.400
it kind of makes sense. It kind of does make sense. If you were going to relaunch Linspire

01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:20.760
today, you would probably do this. And if you look at the applications that they've

01:18:20.760 --> 01:18:29.680
featured here, hot damn, MailSpring, Hairy, Brave, Wavebox, Atom, VLC and LXD right here

01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:33.400
on Spotify as the featured application.

01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:38.240
Hang on a minute. Those are just the featured applications in the Ubuntu software center.

01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:39.760
They haven't featured those at all.

01:18:39.760 --> 01:18:42.680
No, no, no. Oh, yeah. No, and I don't mean to imply that.

01:18:42.680 --> 01:18:45.480
Can I tell you who produces that list of featured applications?

01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:49.880
But wouldn't you? I mean, I guess this is the benefit of being based on Ubuntu. But

01:18:49.880 --> 01:18:54.480
if you're going to, this to me, this to me seems like the obvious way. If you're going

01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:58.040
to launch Linspire today, why bother with a Click and Run store? Why wouldn't you just

01:18:58.040 --> 01:18:59.040
ship this?

01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:02.780
But okay, now tell us, Wimpy, who does?

01:19:02.780 --> 01:19:03.780
Me and Popey.

01:19:03.780 --> 01:19:07.400
Well, good job, sir.

01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:08.400
Excellent work.

01:19:08.400 --> 01:19:13.080
So how do you feel then about them sort of featuring your work? That's better than I

01:19:13.080 --> 01:19:14.420
expected.

01:19:14.420 --> 01:19:19.520
That's absolutely fine, right? They're rebasing on Ubuntu. They're taking advantage of lots

01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:26.240
of the underlying technologies. That's absolutely fine. But if you open GNOME software on any

01:19:26.240 --> 01:19:29.800
of the Ubuntu derivatives, that's what you see today.

01:19:29.800 --> 01:19:34.760
I think I, you know, I was expecting, I was expecting the old Click and Run. I was expecting

01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:39.720
like the purchasing infrastructure they had set up. And when I launched it, I went, oh,

01:19:39.720 --> 01:19:40.720
yeah.

01:19:40.720 --> 01:19:42.640
You expected it to be out of place or out of touch.

01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:46.200
Well, I was disappointed. But then I was like, actually, that's exactly what they should

01:19:46.200 --> 01:19:47.200
be doing.

01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:48.200
Yes.

01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:52.200
Well, good picks, by the way. Good picks, Wimpy, by the way. I think that's Open Arena

01:19:52.200 --> 01:19:57.480
is also down here in recommended games, Frozen Bubble, Neverball, good stuff.

01:19:57.480 --> 01:20:07.440
So it is, in a way, a shadow of its former self. It is not, I haven't got a chance to

01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:13.120
try out the wine integration that they supposedly brought in from like their Xandros heritage,

01:20:13.120 --> 01:20:19.200
which does sound actually kind of interesting. In a way, it is a shadow of its former self.

01:20:19.200 --> 01:20:29.840
It is an Ubuntu respin. But then at the same time, it does offer something unique. When

01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:37.600
I bought this for $80, $95, all said and done, I sent them an email and I said, hey, I'd

01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:43.520
like to just have an ISO instead. Can I get an ISO today? And an actual person who speaks

01:20:43.520 --> 01:20:50.240
English responded to me and gave me, here's a 64-bit link, here's a 32-bit link, have

01:20:50.240 --> 01:20:51.240
at it.

01:20:51.240 --> 01:20:52.240
Wow.

01:20:52.240 --> 01:20:56.800
So their support aspect of it is legitimate. It is something that they're actually living

01:20:56.800 --> 01:21:02.080
up to. There are people responding because I sent an email to the support channel. They're

01:21:02.080 --> 01:21:09.040
also making some interesting package choices. This is a very nice implementation of XFCE.

01:21:09.040 --> 01:21:14.120
I don't think it would hold up on a high DPI setup. But on a standard DPI setup, this is

01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:20.840
got to be one of the cleanest, simplest, most modern implementations I've ever seen of XFCE.

01:21:20.840 --> 01:21:27.320
It does seem like a desktop that, especially, I could just take someone who had used a computer

01:21:27.320 --> 01:21:31.880
before and plop them down there and they would probably get along just fine. They're doing

01:21:31.880 --> 01:21:36.360
a bunch of other things that I think are kind of interesting. So by default, they are turning

01:21:36.360 --> 01:21:41.840
on pre-linking. And they're pre-linking a bunch of libraries to try to improve performance.

01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:42.840
I don't know if-

01:21:42.840 --> 01:21:43.840
That's the default Ubuntu feature.

01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:49.520
Oh, OK. I was just going to say, I don't know if Ubuntu- OK. There you go. And they also

01:21:49.520 --> 01:21:56.480
have Samba and NNBD pre-running and setup out of the gate. They've got Clam Anovirus

01:21:56.480 --> 01:21:57.480
and Fresh Clam.

01:21:57.480 --> 01:22:00.960
Which we can't do in official Ubuntu flavors because you're not allowed to ship with any

01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:01.960
running services.

01:22:01.960 --> 01:22:06.960
Right. And they've got Clam and Fresh Clam running in the background. So you've got essentially

01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:12.200
out-of-the-box Anovirus. Again, Windows users seem to care about that more so than-

01:22:12.200 --> 01:22:16.800
It is like a tricycle for Windows users coming over to the Linux world.

01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:23.040
There's also a process and a user called Whoopsie. Is this- What is Whoopsie?

01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:24.040
That's WhoopsieDaisy.

01:22:24.040 --> 01:22:25.720
Is that a bug reporter?

01:22:25.720 --> 01:22:29.880
Yeah, it's the bug reporter for kernel traps, yeah.

01:22:29.880 --> 01:22:37.920
My current boss wrote WhoopsieDaisy.

01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:44.200
My years on Arch have colored my perception of things like this, but I understand why

01:22:44.200 --> 01:22:52.200
they're there. Also, there's a few other default tweaks, default applications have been changed.

01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:59.280
Obviously Chrome's in here. Skype's installed out of the box. Gdebi, Bleachbit. So it is

01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:09.600
a, in a lot of ways, it is a better out-of-the-box Windows replacement than Stock Ubuntu. If

01:23:09.600 --> 01:23:13.280
you expect your computer to work like a Windows system.

01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:19.640
Is it not Zubuntu with a few applications pre-installed that you can't redistribute

01:23:19.640 --> 01:23:20.640
legally?

01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:26.440
Yes. That is exactly 100% what it is. With Chrome, Codecs, and other things that, yeah.

01:23:26.440 --> 01:23:32.960
But I don't, I think it would be naive to say there isn't a market for that. That stuff,

01:23:32.960 --> 01:23:33.960
that stuff you're not allowed to distribute?

01:23:33.960 --> 01:23:38.360
I'm not suggesting there's not a market for it, no. I'm just, I'm just saying you could

01:23:38.360 --> 01:23:42.560
do the same thing with Zubuntu because you could install Zubuntu, open the software center

01:23:42.560 --> 01:23:44.880
and install all of those applications that are-

01:23:44.880 --> 01:23:47.880
Right, yeah. Right, but there's something about it being, I think there's something

01:23:47.880 --> 01:23:51.040
about the idea of it being a pre-packaged solution. So when you think about the way

01:23:51.040 --> 01:23:57.680
you get Linspire, you don't even get an ISO. You go spend $95 and what you get is a thank

01:23:57.680 --> 01:24:00.280
you email saying that your package is on its way.

01:24:00.280 --> 01:24:04.400
It's really a story about like trying to understand the perspectives and goals of the people who

01:24:04.400 --> 01:24:05.560
are behind it.

01:24:05.560 --> 01:24:10.440
Yeah, and it's not, it's not my goal. That's not my perspective. But yeah, what you're

01:24:10.440 --> 01:24:16.920
basically getting is you're getting Chrome, you're getting Thunderbird with Exchange and

01:24:16.920 --> 01:24:23.640
Google Sync plug-ins installed. You're getting VLC, Clam AV, you're getting.NET Core support,

01:24:23.640 --> 01:24:29.040
XFS, I don't realize, I don't know why they outlined that. Intrusion detection, Bleach

01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:34.000
Bit, these are the other things, and ICE SSB are the main things that they say are included

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:40.360
with Linspire over traditional Linux, aka Ubuntu. And you also get 12 months of email

01:24:40.360 --> 01:24:44.420
and phone support with that.

01:24:44.420 --> 01:24:48.080
And that's what your money is really buying, right? It's that support.

01:24:48.080 --> 01:24:51.840
I suppose, or maybe the ability to distribute some of that software. And then it's based

01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:54.720
on LTS, so it's supported until 2025.

01:24:54.720 --> 01:24:55.720
Is it?

01:24:55.720 --> 01:25:00.520
That's what they say, you know, yeah.

01:25:00.520 --> 01:25:03.560
How are they doing that?

01:25:03.560 --> 01:25:08.840
Also, apparently, if you're a business, they'll spin you custom ISOs and do non-site setup.

01:25:08.840 --> 01:25:13.040
Yep, yep. And they have a cloud version as well that you can buy, which is actually cheaper

01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:14.040
than the desktop version.

01:25:14.040 --> 01:25:15.040
The cloud version?

01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:16.040
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

01:25:16.040 --> 01:25:19.040
This is based on 16.04?

01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:21.520
Yes, sir, yeah.

01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:26.160
So how are they doing support until 2025?

01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:29.640
Well, how long is 16.04 supported?

01:25:29.640 --> 01:25:30.640
Five years.

01:25:30.640 --> 01:25:31.640
Hmm.

01:25:31.640 --> 01:25:32.640
Hmm, indeed.

01:25:32.640 --> 01:25:42.560
I mean, it does say until 2025. It says Freespire is supported until 2021, and Linspire is supported

01:25:42.560 --> 01:25:44.360
until 2025.

01:25:44.360 --> 01:25:48.000
Okay. Good luck with that then.

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:49.000
Yeah.

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.400
2022 is going to be real tough.

01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:56.360
It's an interesting, it's obvious play towards a completely different market than anybody

01:25:56.360 --> 01:26:01.640
that would be listening to this show or me. And that's kind of why I wanted to try it,

01:26:01.640 --> 01:26:05.320
is when something like this comes along, when Linspire comes along again, and it's like,

01:26:05.320 --> 01:26:08.480
what makes it worth $95?

01:26:08.480 --> 01:26:12.440
I'd also be interested to meet someone who had found, you know, like, oh, I'd heard my

01:26:12.440 --> 01:26:16.400
grandson had told me I really needed to get that Linux, and they ended up finding this.

01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:22.100
I wonder if it's not more about the story that you're able to tell a potential OEM partner.

01:26:22.100 --> 01:26:25.760
This is Linspire. It has a, you know, you go into the heritage, you go into the fact

01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:29.780
that it's got wine sort of baked in, which is an aspect I admittedly did not get into

01:26:29.780 --> 01:26:34.960
in this review, which is just barely a review. It's more of like a first look. And, you know,

01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:40.440
you see you have the story of a Linspire heritage, Windows support. We ship it with Chrome. We

01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:46.000
ship it with the Nvidia binaries. We ship it with Thunderbird that has exchange support.

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:51.980
It's a story that you could tell an OEM that maybe is more appealing than a free-loving

01:26:51.980 --> 01:26:56.280
all GPL software distro. I don't know.

01:26:56.280 --> 01:26:58.560
Or at least something they can understand a little bit more, right?

01:26:58.560 --> 01:27:02.720
But we'll see where it goes. So we're checking in at the beginning of 2018. They just had

01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:06.600
their new version 7.0 Linspire release. We'll see where it goes for the rest of 2018, I

01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:07.600
suppose.

01:27:07.600 --> 01:27:13.160
And remember, one of the only benefits when it comes to having a non-free software included

01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:17.080
is they can actually bundle it in a box in a store and sell it.

01:27:17.080 --> 01:27:21.120
Yeah, or on a machine, which I think is what they plan to do.

01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:24.240
So what do you think? Replacing the studio machines? We're going all Linspire?

01:27:24.240 --> 01:27:25.240
Yeah, 100%.

01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:26.240
Yeah.

01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:27.240
You've been talking it up all day.

01:27:27.240 --> 01:27:29.200
It's supported until 2025, so it's obvious.

01:27:29.200 --> 01:27:33.600
Yeah, install once and then, I mean, will there even be JB by then? Who knows?

01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:35.080
Finally. Finally.

01:27:35.080 --> 01:27:39.000
Actually laughing out loud.

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:45.760
I give them credit for responding to my support email requests and actually giving some thought

01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:50.080
to some applications to bundle with it. We'll see where they go. I'd be curious.

01:27:50.080 --> 01:28:01.680
All right, Mr. West. Are you ready, sir? Are you ready, Mr. West?

01:28:01.680 --> 01:28:06.200
Perhaps the worst idea happened when I went to New York. I noticed you guys didn't do

01:28:06.200 --> 01:28:10.760
a Gen 2 Challenge check-in last week. I see how that is. I see you save it for me when

01:28:10.760 --> 01:28:13.160
I'm around, because we could have wrapped this up last week.

01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:17.760
You've been so fascinated by the whole affair. I didn't want to deprive you.

01:28:17.760 --> 01:28:18.760
So how's it going?

01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:19.760
Sort of like a homecoming.

01:28:19.760 --> 01:28:22.840
So you checked in last, during the show, you were rebooting.

01:28:22.840 --> 01:28:26.560
We are live in Sway on Wayland.

01:28:26.560 --> 01:28:28.600
You've gotten to graphical mode.

01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:32.520
Do we have a sky cam? Let's see here. We do have a sky cam. We only see this. Holy crap!

01:28:32.520 --> 01:28:36.280
It doesn't look like much. It hasn't been super configured yet, but look at there it

01:28:36.280 --> 01:28:41.040
is. There we can almost see it. There it is. That is totally boring and a total-

01:28:41.040 --> 01:28:42.920
It may be the most boring thing I've ever seen.

01:28:42.920 --> 01:28:45.000
That is really boring, but so this is Sway.

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:46.480
Yeah, on Wayland.

01:28:46.480 --> 01:28:47.520
Not bad.

01:28:47.520 --> 01:28:48.800
No X anywhere.

01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:51.360
Not bad. No anti-aliasing either.

01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:53.440
No, no anti-aliasing. Why would you want that?

01:28:53.440 --> 01:29:02.440
That is a full Gen 2 system boot up right there with Sway. You did it. You did it. Wow!

01:29:02.440 --> 01:29:05.440
Up your shaft.

01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:10.280
Good job, Wes. I don't know if it was worth it. So what was that? Five episodes? It took

01:29:10.280 --> 01:29:12.040
five weeks of building software?

01:29:12.040 --> 01:29:13.040
On and off anyway.

01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:14.040
That's not bad really.

01:29:14.040 --> 01:29:15.040
In a virtual machine.

01:29:15.040 --> 01:29:18.240
So you probably, if you would have given it a good solid three and a half hours, you could

01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:22.320
have gotten- Oh yeah, definitely. Plus a lot of that was trying to do the show and read

01:29:22.320 --> 01:29:25.520
through the handbook, which had been years since I'd read through. So there was some

01:29:25.520 --> 01:29:29.760
of that. Now I think, yeah, give me an hour and a half and a fast machine and we'll be

01:29:29.760 --> 01:29:30.760
done.

01:29:30.760 --> 01:29:37.280
We've had a lot of fun with Gen 2 over the Gen 2 challenge, but Wes and I were discussing

01:29:37.280 --> 01:29:42.080
this, and we realized we actually did walk away with a bit of a lesson from this whole

01:29:42.080 --> 01:29:46.920
thing. Because sort of the ongoing joke was, what good is Gen 2 for? What's the point of

01:29:46.920 --> 01:29:51.920
Gen 2? Even now in 2018, do you really need these optimizations that you might be able

01:29:51.920 --> 01:29:58.160
to get when you build your own software? What's the damn point of Gen 2? And sort of perfectly,

01:29:58.160 --> 01:30:06.320
on January 6, a great post, a science project really, make the 486 great again. Running

01:30:06.320 --> 01:30:14.120
modern Linux on an ancient 486 PC. This PC, which was released in 1989, which, fun fact,

01:30:14.120 --> 01:30:15.120
before the Meltdown problem.

01:30:15.120 --> 01:30:16.120
Right.

01:30:16.120 --> 01:30:21.920
It was a specular of execution. And this is about as far back as you can go and still

01:30:21.920 --> 01:30:29.800
have actual genuine kernel support. But just because the Linux kernel supports the 486

01:30:29.800 --> 01:30:35.640
processor doesn't mean that any distribution out there and its packages do. And there was

01:30:35.640 --> 01:30:39.720
only one system that supported it.

01:30:39.720 --> 01:30:41.920
When you're in a situation like this, where do you turn, right?

01:30:41.920 --> 01:30:42.920
It's only one.

01:30:42.920 --> 01:30:43.920
There's only one.

01:30:43.920 --> 01:30:49.120
Yeah. And Gen 2 was perfect because the issue with modern Linux distributions like Debian

01:30:49.120 --> 01:30:54.800
or Ubuntu or Arch is that they distribute binary packages, which we all think is great.

01:30:54.800 --> 01:31:00.440
But when you need something like a 486, while it's theoretically supported by the modern

01:31:00.440 --> 01:31:05.160
Linux kernel, the distribution packages do not support it. Debian dropped support for

01:31:05.160 --> 01:31:15.520
586 32-bit CPUs in 2016. The oldest supported x86 CPU by Debian is the 686, which was released

01:31:15.520 --> 01:31:18.520
in 95, which is when speculative execution started coming along.

01:31:18.520 --> 01:31:20.080
So you don't want that.

01:31:20.080 --> 01:31:26.480
No. But the thing about Gen 2 is you can freaking build the packages yourself. And you can install

01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:34.920
Linux on this crazy, esoteric edge case that most people would never even think of. And

01:31:34.920 --> 01:31:40.640
if you think about it, that's the beautiful thing about Linux itself. It's this general

01:31:40.640 --> 01:31:45.200
purpose technology platform that brings life to devices and enables technology in ways

01:31:45.200 --> 01:31:46.640
we never even considered before.

01:31:46.640 --> 01:31:53.280
Right. I'm sure a lot of people are asking, why? Why would you do this? But that's irrelevant

01:31:53.280 --> 01:31:57.480
because, like you say, it is this general purpose. And a lot of interesting things happen

01:31:57.480 --> 01:32:01.500
when you don't really ask why and you just are open to exploration.

01:32:01.500 --> 01:32:03.680
Nothing else could do this.

01:32:03.680 --> 01:32:08.080
I mean, some BSDs, but in the Linux landscape.

01:32:08.080 --> 01:32:12.520
Nothing useful could do this. Nothing that you would want to actually use and could connect

01:32:12.520 --> 01:32:19.000
out to the internet and clone a Git repo and install Python 3.63 could do this. It has

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:24.240
to be Linux. And Gen 2 is one of the few Linuxes that actually could make it possible.

01:32:24.240 --> 01:32:28.200
Right. You don't have to be a giant corporation who has manpower to build your own distribution

01:32:28.200 --> 01:32:32.640
or custom compile everything. You have a framework that's been developed over years to make it

01:32:32.640 --> 01:32:34.080
easy for you to do it.

01:32:34.080 --> 01:32:39.160
What's great is it takes about 11 minutes for boot up.

01:32:39.160 --> 01:32:42.060
And then just have a cup of tea. You'll come back. It'll be up.

01:32:42.060 --> 01:32:46.700
They hooked up a Sound Blaster 16 and took a couple of minutes for the music playback

01:32:46.700 --> 01:32:54.240
to start working. It also took a couple of minutes for SSH to connect in and took about

01:32:54.240 --> 01:32:59.720
only three minutes to clone a Git repo. And shutdown took about five and a half minutes

01:32:59.720 --> 01:33:02.320
to shut down.

01:33:02.320 --> 01:33:04.240
That's incredible.

01:33:04.240 --> 01:33:10.120
The whole post goes through how they got Linux 4.14.8 running on this.

01:33:10.120 --> 01:33:12.400
Like a brand's making new kernel too.

01:33:12.400 --> 01:33:13.400
Yeah.

01:33:13.400 --> 01:33:14.400
Like that, right?

01:33:14.400 --> 01:33:17.760
Yeah. It's just really remarkable. It really is so cool. They used an old version of damn

01:33:17.760 --> 01:33:23.000
small Linux as well to try to mess around. And this, you know, it's sort of the perfect

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:30.200
conclusion to the Gen 2 challenge because it does show you what is Gen 2 good for. And

01:33:30.200 --> 01:33:33.520
it's good for people that are doing things you've never even thought of.

01:33:33.520 --> 01:33:38.040
Yeah, absolutely. I still think it's a fun playground. I'm going to leave this here for

01:33:38.040 --> 01:33:41.960
a while, at least just to play with Sway and maybe some other things. Also just Emerge

01:33:41.960 --> 01:33:46.720
is great. It's really fun to get to spend a little time, especially, you know, like

01:33:46.720 --> 01:33:50.900
I love Linux. I play with Linux, but I also get all of my work done on Linux. And so this

01:33:50.900 --> 01:33:55.600
was a nice reminder that like the internals are fun. Configuring a kernel is fun. Really

01:33:55.600 --> 01:33:56.600
getting to know your system.

01:33:56.600 --> 01:33:57.600
Yes.

01:33:57.600 --> 01:34:02.200
And I think if I was doing a bunch of Linux development, it might be a system that I would

01:34:02.200 --> 01:34:06.400
really like to be able to just customize play and have access to all these tweakable sources

01:34:06.400 --> 01:34:07.400
right there.

01:34:07.400 --> 01:34:12.640
Beard chimes in with the fact that Slackware can still do high 586. Damn it Beard. Go check

01:34:12.640 --> 01:34:17.320
out Beard at rec.net. I hear that son of a bitch is streaming more than ever. Mr. AtWestPain

01:34:17.320 --> 01:34:21.960
right there on the Twitter and check him out on the new rebooted TechSnap as well as me.

01:34:21.960 --> 01:34:30.120
I'm at Chris LAS. Get more wimpy at the Ubuntu podcast and join our subreddit at linuxunplugged.reddit.com.

01:34:30.120 --> 01:34:35.640
This year's show is live on Tuesdays over jblive.tv followed now by the Ask Noah program.

01:34:35.640 --> 01:34:41.300
So it's a whole afternoon slash evening slash insert local time of Linux. If you join our

01:34:41.300 --> 01:34:46.160
virtual lug, you can also take advantage of that in the Ask Noah program. So geez, it's

01:34:46.160 --> 01:34:50.240
never been better to join us over jblive.tv for quite the live experience. Thanks for

01:34:50.240 --> 01:34:52.240
being here. We'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

01:35:20.240 --> 01:35:34.000
Oh, thank you, virtual lug. You guys are great. Now we just got to pick a title. And

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:40.000
I think we're done. I think we're done. It was a fun show. It was a fun show. I enjoyed

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:46.280
the hell out of that. Yeah. I enjoyed the hell out of it. So are you still going to

01:35:46.280 --> 01:35:51.080
get the install media for linspire in the mail? Okay, good. That's almost a trophy.

01:35:51.080 --> 01:35:55.920
I'm gonna follow up when it comes in. Most expensive USB stick ever. It's probably the

01:35:55.920 --> 01:36:00.360
bare minimum. It's like just four gigs. That could be a title. Most expensive USB stick

01:36:00.360 --> 01:36:04.560
ever. Most expensive Linux distro ever. Yes, that's someone that's there. There is the

01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:09.200
show title right there. What about most expensive Linux distro ever? Because it really is I

01:36:09.200 --> 01:36:15.280
don't know of a more expensive you can't where else can you spend $95 a distro? What's Oracle

01:36:15.280 --> 01:36:20.980
charging these days? $5 more and you can get Windows 10. Wow. You know, but most expensive

01:36:20.980 --> 01:36:29.160
Linux distro ever is very long. Is there a tighter way to say that? That'll do. That'll

01:36:29.160 --> 01:36:34.300
do. Yeah, most expensive Linux. I almost feel like it's got to be long. I don't know. Long

01:36:34.300 --> 01:36:40.160
and complicated. Break in the bank. Yeah, green light for Linux. Yeah, just do Linux

01:36:40.160 --> 01:36:43.820
and a bunch of dollar signs. So hey, beer, what do I do? Do I do? Is there a scene for

01:36:43.820 --> 01:36:48.240
ask Noah? Like, what do I do when it's asked Noah time? You turn off the stream and Noah

01:36:48.240 --> 01:36:54.240
picks it up. Oh, that's right. What? Oh, hey, buddy. Bang suggest working discord. Oh, there

01:36:54.240 --> 01:37:01.140
we go. So hold on. You telling me between between West Noah and beard. You I guess last

01:37:01.140 --> 01:37:04.360
week was kind of crazy. There we go. Martin. That's true. I forgot about that. That was

01:37:04.360 --> 01:37:08.380
crazy. All right. I understand. I thought we would have had this shit fixed by now.

01:37:08.380 --> 01:37:12.640
It's cool. Well, you were gone. So we didn't have only there was some sort of like remote

01:37:12.640 --> 01:37:19.040
login system on the OBS system that Noah was integrated with where he could just connect

01:37:19.040 --> 01:37:26.620
in both you goofballs multiple times. Just give me permission. Just give me permission

01:37:26.620 --> 01:37:29.680
and I'll make it happen. I'm a goof. What do you mean? How do you not have permission?

01:37:29.680 --> 01:37:34.640
I installed your remote like verbal permission like screw with your broadcasting machine.

01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:38.080
Good to be good. Actually. I mean, could you just solve problems gonna happen? And he's

01:37:38.080 --> 01:37:41.520
gonna blame you anyway. So that's all right. So we so we do have to so I should probably

01:37:41.520 --> 01:37:44.120
like we should probably interrupt the stream soon. So that way there's time for YouTube

01:37:44.120 --> 01:37:50.080
to reset. Hey, so if people want to hang out in mumble for ask Noah, where should they

01:37:50.080 --> 01:37:51.080
go?

01:37:51.080 --> 01:37:57.720
Like not the best week of that because I have a guest. But oh, right, right. If you guys

01:37:57.720 --> 01:38:01.160
if you guys hang out in there and and either he's he comes in late because I know he's

01:38:01.160 --> 01:38:05.600
on a call with a customer right now if he comes in late or if we wrap up I'll jump back

01:38:05.600 --> 01:38:10.320
in mumble. So what is that? Does that mean stay here or does that mean you're gonna be

01:38:10.320 --> 01:38:13.560
are you gonna be sending a feed into the mumble room? Can they hear the show or do they got

01:38:13.560 --> 01:38:20.320
to still go? God damn it, Noah. Yes. Hey, listen, we send a feed to tune in. We send

01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:25.080
a no show. I know we said I know live.tv. We can't keep your radio.com. There's like

01:38:25.080 --> 01:38:46.280
a billion ways. I know escape the show. Yeah. All right. All right. Good enough, Noah.
