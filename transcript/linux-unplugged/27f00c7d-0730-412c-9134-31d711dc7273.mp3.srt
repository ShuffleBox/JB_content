00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is Linux Unplugged Episode 30 for March 4th, 2014.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:41,700
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that knows this call is being monitored.

3
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:42,900
My name is Chris.

4
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:43,900
My name is Matt.

5
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:44,900
Hey there, Matt.

6
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,240
We've got a great show coming up this week.

7
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,800
So last week, in episode 29, we talked about ourselves a lot.

8
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:57,080
We talked about the new How To Linux show, and oh my gosh, we got like 40 to 50 emails

9
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,920
just on that topic alone.

10
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,560
It's blowing my mind, and everybody has a great idea.

11
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:05,720
So many really good ones, but I just thought like we couldn't go through that again because

12
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:10,960
this week, I want to help somebody troubleshoot some battery life problems with their laptop.

13
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,840
They've been running Arch for a long time.

14
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,520
They switched to OpenSUSE, and all of a sudden, way better battery life, and they're trying

15
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,800
to figure out why that might be, so we'll kick that topic around with our mumble room,

16
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,560
and I know you've got some battery tips that you might be able to pass along, and later

17
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,640
in the show, we're going to chat with some of the developers from the Talks Project.

18
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,920
Now Talks is a new up-and-coming open source project to essentially replace Skype, to have

19
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,040
a secure peer-to-peer Skype replacement, and there's a lot of secure messaging programs

20
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,920
that are coming online in 2014, obviously as a reaction to the leaks from Edward Snowden,

21
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:47,080
and I think it's going to be really fascinating to watch these as they develop, and particularly

22
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:51,680
because of my focus on the desktop, I've been drawn to ones that are starting with a desktop

23
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,680
application.

24
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,240
A lot of the ones you're seeing kind of come out of the response to Edward Snowden are

25
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,120
mobile applications, which is fine, I want to see a mobile app too, but I'd also really

26
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:05,120
like to have a desktop component, and Talks is starting there, so we're going to talk

27
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:10,360
with them in a little bit, and ask some questions that our audience has submitted in, and then

28
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,520
we've got some mail sack we're going to get to towards the end of the show too, so big

29
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,320
show today, Matt, big show.

30
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,600
It might be a really kind of tight show, depending on how long, it could be like a big show in

31
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:22,760
terms of what we talk about, but a shorter show in terms of length, you never know.

32
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,120
I shouldn't say that though, it probably would curse us.

33
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,980
So let's start with a topic that I wanted to bounce around.

34
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:35,760
This is a problem that Gagero wrote in about, he says OpenSUSE has better battery life than

35
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,800
Arch on the same rig, can you guys help me figure this out?

36
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,600
And he starts out with, you know, he says, hey guys, I'm in love with my Arch Linux install,

37
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,840
well actually it was Integros, have you made the switch with you guys during the Arch challenge?

38
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,740
But I recently gave OpenSUSE a spin, and while it has some things I really like, I'm ready

39
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,640
to switch back to my Arch install.

40
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:57,200
However, I'm finding it very difficult for one reason, battery life.

41
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,540
Even with similar power management rules, running KD on both distros, the battery life

42
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:04,560
on OpenSUSE has been insanely better.

43
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,480
The trade seems to be that OpenSUSE is a lot slower.

44
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,120
I can't figure out what the actual difference really is though, I've been digging in the

45
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:17,480
Arch Wiki for suggestions, but with school in full swing, I've been unable to find time

46
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:21,680
to figure out a solution, and I've grown very comfortable with not having to hunt for outlets

47
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,640
everywhere I go.

48
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,640
As I've said, aside from auto-dimming the screen and auto-suspend settings, I can't

49
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,760
really figure out where OpenSUSE is getting the dramatically better battery life, but

50
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:38,240
Arch has proven to make my lap be very power-thirsty over multiple installations, even with an

51
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,000
Arch proper installation.

52
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Your loyal JBViewer, Don Gerro.

53
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,240
Well, so my experience between the two distributions is it seems like OpenSUSE definitely has some

54
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,960
moderate configuration stuff done for you.

55
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:53,440
I wouldn't go so far as to say they did laptop mode tools or something like that, but they

56
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,200
definitely have something going on.

57
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,740
On the Arch side of the fence, laptop mode tools will do you no good because it's a completely

58
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:02,240
different kind of setup, and out of the box, it's not designed to give you any power savings,

59
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,000
it's designed to just run.

60
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,400
If you go to the Arch Wiki and go to the power savings portion of it, all the tips you need

61
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:15,320
for a laptop are in there, and if you enable every single thing, including down from UDev

62
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:19,400
all the way up to the kernel modules and whatnot, and actually look at all those different things,

63
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:25,120
enable them, write back mode, the whole package, you will indeed see significant improvement.

64
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,840
This concept of battery life being different between distros is interesting to me, because

65
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:37,040
aside from driver versions and kernel versions, it seems like things should be pretty normalized,

66
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,680
and I've always found the newer kernels recently have provided better battery life.

67
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:46,220
Early three kernels had power regressions, but I've always noticed that when I've upgraded

68
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:52,600
my kernel to the latest kernel, I've usually seen an improvement in some component that

69
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,440
results in some better battery life, like maybe it's better support for the Intel graphics,

70
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,680
or maybe it's a better Wi-Fi driver and that results in less broadcast usage, or whatever

71
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,760
it is, it always seems like the newer kernel has always been what solves it.

72
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:08,560
I've never really specifically tested this thing, you know, like put Ubuntu on a machine,

73
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,560
put SUSE on a machine, and then put Arch on a machine and timed the difference.

74
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:16,440
So, basically, my experiences are based on, if I install PowerTop and I run it on a default

75
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:20,160
Arch installation, you're going to be, and you go over to tunables, it's just bad up

76
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,160
and down.

77
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,160
That's just what you're going to see.

78
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,680
Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.

79
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,600
What you want to see is lots of good, and if you want to do that, that's why I would

80
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:31,480
actually recommend the power savings section for that, because now on OpenSUSE, I recall

81
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,400
there was some bad, some good.

82
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,560
Now I noticed there was more good enabled in PowerTop than there was.

83
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,520
Oh yeah, PowerTop's a great tool, maybe you should run PowerTop on both installations,

84
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:44,840
so you guys have any ideas on what he could check to see why OpenSUSE is getting such

85
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,240
better battery life than Arch?

86
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:51,720
Yes, try CPU power, because I noticed CPU power behaves pretty good with system D.

87
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,080
Yeah, you think maybe there's like a moderator set?

88
00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:01,760
I'm pretty sure, because I know in the kernel, Arch has performance mode enabled by default

89
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,760
too.

90
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,760
That's right.

91
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,760
Oh, interesting.

92
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:12,240
Yeah, so if you modify the on-demand driver for CPU power, whatever it's called, it'll

93
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,800
be pretty good after that.

94
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,680
Yeah, CPU freq's another thing to check to see if maybe…

95
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,280
Actually, CPU freq is not so good, so I think that's been depreciated.

96
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,920
Well, isn't CPU freq not just a tool to read what your current frequency is?

97
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:29,200
Because I'm wondering if maybe there is more aggressive frequency scaling maybe under OpenSUSE.

98
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,200
Probably.

99
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:34,840
Yeah, there's a number, I've never really driven too deep into OpenSUSE specifically,

100
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,800
but I do know that they have some stuff enabled by default.

101
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,640
I'd like to play with this some more, I think.

102
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,960
I think I would like to try this out.

103
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,260
I think this would be an interesting, this almost could be an interesting roundup.

104
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:45,560
Is there the ultimate battery saving distro?

105
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:52,600
Because you know, on Sunday I'm going to review this C720 Chromebook here, and I can't

106
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,600
even…

107
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,320
Oh, you will not want to do it without using the power saving portion.

108
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,320
No, I can't.

109
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,320
Oh, you know what's crazy?

110
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,320
It'd be painful to use otherwise.

111
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:04,520
No, it's not, I mean, so I think I could get maybe another hour, I don't know, I

112
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,520
should try it to be honest.

113
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,840
I will try it before the review.

114
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,800
Yeah, I mean on my netbook I can squeeze like an hour and a half to two hours difference.

115
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,800
Really?

116
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,440
Oh yeah, I mean it's a big deal, but you got to go through every single thing on that

117
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,440
power saving area.

118
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,080
Okay, so CPU freq was renamed to CPU power.

119
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:23,440
So I'm getting like, I don't know, I'm going to time it for the actual review right

120
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,960
now, but I think I'm getting like seven hours of battery life with the C720 running

121
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:28,960
arch.

122
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,680
So I'm going to, I'll install, I'll go through that arch wiki that you mentioned

123
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,320
and I'll dig through that and see if I had to do some of those tweaks if I can even bring

124
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:40,840
that up a little more and then I'll time it, I'll try to get like some use case

125
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:44,280
timing done in time for last on Sunday.

126
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:49,160
But I find this whole concept, maybe once I get this review done, maybe I should load

127
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:52,520
OpenSUSE on there and see if there's a big difference.

128
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,040
And if there is, then I might try it with other distros too.

129
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:59,840
TLP is also cool, as someone in the chat room actually just mentioned just now.

130
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,840
That's definitely good.

131
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:04,360
I'm really, really careful with it because it's one of those things to where you can

132
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,840
just end up breaking something and then you have to like go back and figure out what you

133
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,840
broke.

134
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:13,240
I also like the idea of checking like IO top and using IO top to see what's hitting your

135
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:18,320
disc because it could be possible like by default, maybe the KDE, maybe some search

136
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:23,560
indexer like the KDE search indexer is, I'm sorry, the plasma desktop search indexer is

137
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:27,560
set to a more moderate aggressive level or who knows, right?

138
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,280
I mean, I'm just throwing things out there.

139
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,960
So IO top would reveal that if something was hitting your disc a lot.

140
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,960
True.

141
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,960
That's very true.

142
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,640
If you have battery experiences and you want to send them in, please do.

143
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:42,520
But include, if you're using an SSD, your generation of processor and your GPU and relevant

144
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:46,200
like screen size info and things like that so that way we can take that into consideration

145
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,140
when we're talking about this stuff.

146
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:54,000
So we talked something, really, I mean 99.9% of our feedback was about the how-to show.

147
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,520
It was so many ideas that it's kind of blowing my mind and it's freaking me out a little

148
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:03,880
bit because there's a lot of ideas that completely are in contradiction of what the next email

149
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,880
says.

150
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,240
And so it's gotten me a little worried that so many people are kind of disagreeing with

151
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,480
each other without realizing it like, well, I get an idea where somebody will say, take

152
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:15,760
a topic and really spend some time with it and make three or four episodes out of that

153
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,760
single topic.

154
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:21,040
And then the next email will say, only one episode.

155
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,640
Make it as long as you need to get to one topic.

156
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,640
Don't stretch it out.

157
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,640
I won't watch it if you do that.

158
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:30,040
Like all this different, or one that my favorite, which would be awesome if we had a staff of

159
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:36,800
40, my favorite suggestion was do an intro video that sets up the problem.

160
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:42,120
Like here on How To Linux Today, we're going to show you how to do X and then kind of talk

161
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,120
about a little bit.

162
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,120
Then that stops.

163
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:49,160
We're going to do a five minute video and then have like 20 or 30 sub videos that then

164
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,920
the person would click on that would be how to do it in Ubuntu, how to do it in Arch,

165
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,180
how to do it in OpenSUSE, how to do it in CentOS, how to do it in Debian, how to do

166
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:58,160
it in et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

167
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,640
And I could see how that could be really handy for the Linux community.

168
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:05,200
But yeah, it has a lot of, can you imagine from the production standpoint, from a production

169
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,200
that it'd be a nightmare.

170
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,480
But not, I mean, it's like, it's one of those things where it's like from an archival point

171
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,060
of view, it's awesome.

172
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:13,120
From a show point of view, it'd be a nightmare.

173
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,120
Yeah, yeah.

174
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:20,280
So what I, you know, I think what I can tell you is it would be really interesting to see

175
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:24,160
if maybe the community could come in and a few people suggested this.

176
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,960
Maybe the community could come in and provide the documentation for the distro they love

177
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,360
that we didn't cover.

178
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:34,700
And so that starts to, that's got my wheels turning on how we could build an interactive

179
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:39,820
community website that would provide a written documentation version of what we talked about.

180
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:43,440
We would have one official probably that would match the show, and then maybe we could have

181
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,020
multiple versions for different distributions that the community could tribute.

182
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:51,280
And maybe we'd have to have like three or four or five or six or seven originally hand

183
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:54,360
selected contributors at first to make sure it was good, and then kind of grow it from

184
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,360
there.

185
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,420
But it's something, you know, it's a lot of feedback we're taking in.

186
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:04,400
I'm going to try to send out the official like, hey, we'd like you to be our producer

187
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:08,880
email this week, so we're going to have that finally done, I hope.

188
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,720
And we, between that and the new studio, we've got a lot on our plate right now, but I feel

189
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,020
like we're, there's a lot of people out there that want this.

190
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:20,920
But the other topic we talked about last week besides that, that did get one response, is

191
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:24,440
the one here from Alex, and that was about Outlook's inertia, and we talked a little

192
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,520
bit about the exchange problem that Linux switchers face.

193
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,680
He says, thank you for the wonderful shows, I got to start it with Jupyter Broadcasting

194
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:35,360
back in the stoked days, recently came back after finding BSD now and then TechSnap and

195
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,560
last and unplugged and go to radio, et cetera, et cetera.

196
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:43,080
He said, listening to Linux Unplugged 29, there was a comment made about needing exchange

197
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:47,240
or MAPI compatibility, or essentially Outlook.

198
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:51,960
As someone who has been trying to migrate the small business he supports over to Linux,

199
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:57,320
the big issue I see is that open source groupware packages, both server and client side, really

200
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:01,520
do not measure up to the standard that is exchange and Outlook.

201
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:06,400
For all of its wards, Microsoft has gotten groupware mostly right, when you have requirements

202
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:11,880
that mail be hosted internally, and unique groupware and mobile sync, the choice, currently,

203
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,880
is exchange.

204
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:18,600
Zimbra keeps getting passed around like a hot potato, I have used most of my two free

205
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:25,640
months of DigitalOcean trying out Zimbra with OpenLDAP, I've got it working, and others

206
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:29,480
don't seem to be, but others don't seem to enjoy all the functionality yet, any suggestions

207
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,480
would be appreciated.

208
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:40,000
Alex, oh man, so, you know, what do you like, do you have like a calendar contact sync system

209
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
you use?

210
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Are you using like Google, Matt?

211
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
What are you using?

212
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,600
Well, right now I use a little bit of Google, that's pretty much where I've fallen into

213
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,960
at this point.

214
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:53,080
For one of my gigs, I have to live in a Microsoft space, and so we use Exchange, and anyone

215
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:57,520
that tells me it's flawless has not spent much time with Exchange, in my opinion.

216
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,520
It's painful.

217
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:04,280
That being said, it is less painful than a lot of the open source groupware solutions,

218
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,440
as was pointed out, and so I agree with that, I mean, that's actually accurate.

219
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,840
But none of them are really that good.

220
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:14,360
Google honestly, while it's missing some functionality that I would like to see, I'd say it's probably

221
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,820
the least annoying.

222
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:19,200
They're all annoying, but I'd say it's the least annoying experience that I've ever dealt

223
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,200
with.

224
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:23,000
The nice thing about Google is you don't have to deal with the back end if you don't want

225
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
to.

226
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Right, yeah.

227
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,880
I mean, I don't want you to understand that your stuff's open to whatever, but it is anyway,

228
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,880
so yeah.

229
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,880
Yeah, gosh, that's the part.

230
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:36,960
I mean, I'm not a huge fan of that part, to be honest, but I think, you know, I like Zimbra.

231
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:46,240
I just think what the problem is is Exchange, you sort of create a workflow around Outlook

232
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,640
and Exchange, and when you move to one of these other options like Zimbra or any of

233
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:56,560
the other ones that are out there, it's a different workflow, and if you started on

234
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,520
that, it would be fine.

235
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:02,640
But because you've trained, you know, those mental pathways in your brain are laid down

236
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:08,880
for the way that it's sort of like why I sometimes have a little bit easier time using Gnome

237
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:15,520
is because honestly, I learned a lot of things the Gnome way, and so it's just way in my

238
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:20,680
mind like that's just the way the neural pathways are is like the electrons fire faster down

239
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,600
those paths, and it's the same thing for Outlook.

240
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:27,360
If you've learned how the whole Outlook calendar system works, and I know people out there

241
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:32,320
like depend on the rich text formatting of Outlook and all this kind of junk that Outlook

242
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:38,320
does, but to them, it's an essential part of the job, and sometimes these replacements

243
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,560
do it differently.

244
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:43,880
Sometimes they don't offer something at all, so a lot of times people say they don't size

245
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:44,880
up.

246
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,440
In reality, it's just different workflow, I think.

247
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,520
Yeah, I'd say workflow, and muscle memory in general, I think, is a real tough one to

248
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:55,360
get past, regardless of what your skill set may happen to be.

249
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,840
I mean, muscle memory kind of rules the day.

250
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,840
Colab is a great choice.

251
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:03,720
Chatham is right now talking about Colab, and you can find them at colab.org.

252
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:07,640
It's a free software initiative building a unified communications and collaboration system

253
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:12,280
that you can install on your own server, and it offers a lot of the functionality that

254
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:17,880
we talk about a lot that Zimbra also offers, and Colab's on my short list of like the three

255
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:22,060
that I'm going to be considering installing for Jupyter Broadcasting this year.

256
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,060
This is one of the goals.

257
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:29,640
I don't know if I'm going to get to it, because right now, this is one of those things where

258
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:34,780
Google's doing a good enough job, and I don't feel super pressured to replace them, even

259
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:39,700
though I know there's a privacy problem there, and a lot of other issues there as well, tracking

260
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:44,800
and all that kind of stuff, but because it's my work email, it's not like I have some sort

261
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:50,280
of dirty exchange with some bankster in there or something like that that I don't want to

262
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,280
get caught, right?

263
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:54,480
I mean, it's not like... It's my work email, and most of the email that's in there gets

264
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,640
read on there anyways eventually.

265
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,640
This is true.

266
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,640
This is very true.

267
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,840
So I'm not super compelled to do it, but I am looking into my options, and Zimbra and

268
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:07,280
Colab are on my short list, so I actually really thank Alex for sending that in to us

269
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:11,160
just so I can get his thoughts on it, because to tell you the truth, I'd probably roll it

270
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:15,080
out on a DigitalOcean VPS too, which means I should probably stop right here and thank

271
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:18,120
DigitalOcean this week for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

272
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,600
DigitalOcean is a sponsor of the Linux Unplugged program, and as you've heard, a lot of our

273
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,960
audience is finding really awesome ways to try out DigitalOcean.

274
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,960
Now you're not familiar with DigitalOcean?

275
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,640
Well, I'll tell you right now.

276
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:31,940
DigitalOcean is simple cloud hosting dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way

277
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,800
to spin up your own cloud server.

278
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,760
You get root access to this bad mamma jamma, and users can create a cloud server in 55

279
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,760
seconds.

280
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:42,800
I bet Alex was in the 40s somewhere, although he didn't say in his email.

281
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,600
Pricing plans start around $5 per month.

282
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:52,520
That gets you 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD, yes, an SSD makes a difference on a VPS,

283
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:56,320
trust me, one CPU, and a terabyte of transfer.

284
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:01,120
A terabyte of transfer, like if you're using this for email or like Yassi search or a pastebin

285
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,680
repository or a BitTorrent sync server, a terabyte of transfer is going to get you a

286
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,800
really far, a long ways.

287
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:11,600
Also DigitalOcean has data center locations in New York, San Francisco, Amsterdam, and

288
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,600
now Singapore.

289
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:17,000
They have a simple intuitive interface, but if you want more power, you want to automate

290
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,600
some stuff, you can also implement your own set of scripts and things like that using

291
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,260
their straightforward API.

292
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:28,760
For example, you might want to utilize their API to automate image backups of your VPS

293
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:32,520
systems, and they have a system to let you do that, but here's the best part.

294
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:37,360
You can get a $10 credit to try out, they have a $5 rig, that's the one I told you about,

295
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,040
$5 rig, you try out their $10 credit, you're going to be able to use it for two months

296
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:43,440
for free if you use the promo code LINUXUNPLUGGEDMARCH.

297
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,900
Brand new month, DigitalOcean is back, because you guys have been loving them.

298
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:51,580
We've gotten a lot of people to try it out, and you can go over there right now, use the

299
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:55,880
promo code LINUXUNPLUGGEDMARCH, you get one of these bad mama jamas for two months, you

300
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:02,240
get tier one bandwidth, connected to those SSD hard drives, and backed by KVM virtualization.

301
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,640
It's a really good system.

302
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,800
They also have hourly pricing if you just need to test out your app.

303
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:12,080
They also have images that are set up and ready to go with Lampstacks or Docker.

304
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:17,680
They support Arch, Fedora, Ubuntu, all of the stuff, CentOS, all of it.

305
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:21,760
They have two-factor authentication, backups and snapshots, all that good stuff.

306
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:27,360
So go over to DigitalOcean.com, use the promo code LINUXUNPLUGGEDMARCH to get $10 credits,

307
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,480
you can try it out for two months, and I think you'll see, I've been talking about them for

308
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:35,400
a while now, and also a big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring Linux Unplugged for the month

309
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,640
of March.

310
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,640
You guys are awesome.

311
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,640
Love it.

312
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,800
All right, Matt.

313
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:44,120
So I want to welcome two developers from the TOX Project onto the show.

314
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:48,760
Joining us on Mumble right now, we have STQ and I run Gentoo.

315
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:53,440
So I know TOX started up as sort of a discussion thread, and I'm told, I think it started on

316
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,840
4chan, and now here we are, we're what, seven, eight months down the road, it's become a

317
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,520
very active project.

318
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:04,400
So where is it at from where it started versus where it's at today?

319
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:12,480
Well, TOX started as, well, I actually, I had this idea, this very basic idea, and then,

320
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:24,040
well, I was on a thread on G, that was speaking about how Skype is, well, privacy issues with

321
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,040
Skype.

322
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:31,640
So, well, I had just, well, I just decided, okay, hey, let's, I was actually a bit maybe

323
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:40,440
drunk at the moment or something, and I said, okay, let's make a Skype replacement.

324
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:43,080
So that's how it started.

325
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:49,240
And then, well, I was very impressed by the positive response from everyone.

326
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:57,760
So I said, okay, let's start writing code, let's start planning stuff, and that's how

327
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,320
TOX started.

328
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:02,920
So it started kind of as a crazy idea that maybe after you thought about it for a little

329
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,100
bit realized, this could be a good idea.

330
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:09,440
Have you worked on this kind of stuff before or something like this before?

331
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:20,000
Well, I played around with some BitTorrent DHT, I did a couple of scripts to, I once

332
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:29,840
made a script to find out which, to try to track everything on the BitTorrent DHT.

333
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:38,560
But well, there were some little bandwidth issues, well, I would have needed a big server

334
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:47,380
and something, so the idea kind of died, but that gave me a bit of experience on how peer-to-peer

335
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:52,720
software works and everything, so that's, that's how I...

336
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,720
Yeah.

337
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:57,660
Well, can you tell me a little bit about, and I guess it's actually pronounced salt,

338
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:03,120
but the networking and cryptography library that TOX is sitting on primarily, is this

339
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,320
the big piece of functionality here?

340
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:08,040
How does, what does this component play?

341
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,520
What role does that play?

342
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:18,720
Well, that's the, it's, I seriously, I like that crypto, I love that crypto library.

343
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,120
It's very simple to use and everything, and it's very secure.

344
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,920
I don't think TOX would have worked without it.

345
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:37,760
It's since, well, TOX, when TOX started, we didn't know what crypto library would use.

346
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,760
Right.

347
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,920
That seems like a huge choice to make, right?

348
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:47,360
Yeah, but then someone suggested it in a thread, and then I looked at it, and I just saw, this

349
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,360
is perfect.

350
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:53,960
It's simple to use, it's fast, it's very secure.

351
00:21:53,960 --> 00:22:02,840
It protects against all types of timing attacks, et cetera, so that's, so we picked that, and

352
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:11,320
I started reading a lot, okay, so how do I implement this correctly in TOX without screwing

353
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,320
up things?

354
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:16,400
Well, that was my question, because I've heard that, I think also the Telegram Messenger

355
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:21,160
program uses the salt library, but I guess they maybe, I don't know the details, but

356
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,520
I guess they've implemented it incorrectly.

357
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:28,360
Have you looked at that situation and tried to kind of balance what they did wrong and

358
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,760
adjust accordingly for TOX?

359
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:38,960
Well, Telegram, they don't use the salt library, they use their custom crypto implementation.

360
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:43,900
If they would have used the salt library, their crypto would have been fine, nobody

361
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:46,200
would be complaining about it.

362
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,680
Right, gotcha.

363
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:52,160
So something that seemed kind of like a big deal, you guys got accepted, the TOX project

364
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:55,760
got accepted into the Google Summer of Code, but you know a lot of people have asked, is

365
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,500
that going to influence the project in any way?

366
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,120
What about their independence?

367
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:04,000
What are your thoughts on the Summer of Code and what it means for that aspect of the project?

368
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I'll go ahead and answer this.

369
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Sure.

370
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,860
Well, I think with Google Summer of Code, we're really going to be able to finish a

371
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:17,000
lot of things that we wouldn't have the time to do that, due to our prior commitments we

372
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,480
would never be able to do.

373
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:23,520
We would be able to have people who have different skill sets in areas we might not have, it

374
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,000
would be able to help out that way.

375
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,200
Okay, so, and you know, what about this criticism that people have said, oh well, this is a

376
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,400
bad sign, this is about influence, what do you think of that?

377
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:39,480
Has there been communications from Google about suggestions or anything like that?

378
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:45,200
No, they don't do anything like that, they just purely foster the development of open

379
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:51,280
source projects, no secret influences, no link to this secret library, nothing like

380
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,280
that.

381
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:59,120
No insert go to fail line here, that's good, that's good considering that, you know, there's

382
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,800
a lot of hopes riding on a secure messenger and I got to tell you guys, this is a pretty

383
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,080
contested space right now.

384
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:11,060
So I think people are looking for a lot of things to pull out to kind of criticize on.

385
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:16,040
And to that end, I think, and I didn't, I don't really know if there is something to

386
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:19,900
be worried about here, but a lot of people have criticized that they started as a threat

387
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:24,480
on 4chan and have you guys dealt with growing pains as a result of that?

388
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:31,800
Well, we didn't start like that, but as we developed, we got people with skill sets from

389
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:36,040
Reddit and all these areas and sort of nurtured.

390
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,920
That's exactly, I mean, so when I, I mean, not to interrupt, I'm sorry, but when I, when

391
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:42,240
I, so I've seen this question, it was sent into our show a few times and to me, it just

392
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,480
seems like these are locations that technical people hang out.

393
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:52,040
True, so 4chan specifically, that little area is a lot of trolling.

394
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:59,000
I think it was pure luck that the people who we have now, that all the skill matched up

395
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
just perfectly.

396
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Yeah, yeah.

397
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Well, I, and I, and I know, I know it's something that's on people's radar and it maybe seems

398
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,560
like one of those things down the road.

399
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:11,920
It probably, it, it probably won't be as big of a factor, but what are any other growing

400
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:15,440
pains you guys are seeing as the project is becoming more aware, people are becoming

401
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,560
more aware of it?

402
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,560
Not really.

403
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:28,880
Well, there's always a bit of issues, but we do, we, we've dealt with them and it's

404
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,880
good.

405
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,360
Well, okay.

406
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,280
So that's the big picture stuff.

407
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:37,600
I want to talk a little bit about maybe features and stuff that talks is hoping to support

408
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,060
down the road.

409
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:45,120
What are your plans for three, there's three major things I've seen requests from the audience.

410
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,600
Uh, conference call setups.

411
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:50,080
Do you guys have any plans to do things like group calls and things like that down the

412
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,080
road?

413
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,080
Yes.

414
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,480
Okay, good.

415
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,040
What about multiple presence?

416
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:59,760
As in I can be logged in on a, on multiple computers and the message goes to all locations

417
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:05,280
or maybe I'm on my, I'm on my Android phone and I'm also on my laptop and I want my messages

418
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,760
and calls to go to both locations.

419
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:09,960
Is that possible with the security model you're using now?

420
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:13,960
You know, we haven't worked out something like that just yet.

421
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:19,360
We're still working on a lot of our group chats, how we can do audio and video, how

422
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:24,520
we can do things like that, but when the time comes, I know we'll be able to reach that

423
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,520
area.

424
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:33,000
Yeah, it's a, it's possible, but, uh, it's a later after, after we've done the TCP stuff,

425
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,960
after we've done the, the group chats and the work and, uh,

426
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,000
So is that how you're focusing right now?

427
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,440
It seems like the talks clients that I've tried are all text chat based to get that

428
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:46,720
working and then as the plan to then to get the next set of functionality working and

429
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,720
then the next.

430
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,720
Yeah.

431
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:54,840
It's a, it's how, uh, well, I think it's the best way to develop software to, uh, do make

432
00:26:54,840 --> 00:27:01,160
a feature, test it correctly, add another, add another, and, uh, that's, uh,

433
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:05,720
So what's on your immediate list and then what's on your sort of, after I get this next

434
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:09,360
immediate problem solved, after I get this thing that's bugging me fixed, I really want

435
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,840
to start working on.

436
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,440
So what are those two things?

437
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:18,580
Well, we have first the, the thing that I want to finish first, well, that I'm working

438
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:28,880
on right now is, uh, the TCP, uh, TCP stuff so that, uh, I want to add a TCP relay functionality

439
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:38,460
to talks, uh, node so that, uh, people that are behind bad knots and, uh, can, uh, can

440
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:44,200
also use stocks currently talks only works people with that can, uh, hole punch through

441
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,200
their knots.

442
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,200
Okay.

443
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,200
But that's not everyone.

444
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,200
Yeah.

445
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:53,400
Some people are behind enterprise knots, some symmetric knots that are weird and on and

446
00:27:53,400 --> 00:28:02,280
block certain, uh, like, yeah, they only have a maximum number of UDP connections that can,

447
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:09,280
well, that can be a problem because, well, talks needs to connect to a bunch of people

448
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,280
for discovery.

449
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,280
Yeah.

450
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,280
Yeah.

451
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,280
So, okay.

452
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:18,280
I look at this and I think if talks was really successful, I, if, if you could truly create

453
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:25,040
a Skype replacement that was secure, you would have a system that would be used by, by journalists,

454
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:29,520
by dissidents, by the paranoid and by cheaters.

455
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:36,040
And, uh, it would be this, these groups of people would fundamentally rely on this technology

456
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:39,920
to be absolutely iron clad solid.

457
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:44,720
Have you considered code audits and, and maybe you add a certain like quote unquote official

458
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:49,320
release point saying we're going to audit the code, have a third party look at the code?

459
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:55,480
Well, yes, of course, but we want to wait till a lot of our major features are done.

460
00:28:55,480 --> 00:29:00,360
And talking about what you mentioned earlier, we're designing talks to be something that

461
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:05,080
everyone can use someone talking, someone somewhere.

462
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:08,980
I have no idea what I'm saying right now, but long story short, we want to design something

463
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:13,800
that's so fast, so easy, so smooth that people would use it instead of Skype.

464
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:20,120
I mean, we're not going to truly accomplish our goal unless everyone's using this, unless

465
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:24,320
there's nothing that can be spied on, nothing that can be new.

466
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:29,920
Security isn't a selling point for end users, but we want to give it to everyone.

467
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,560
That's an interesting way to put it.

468
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:35,760
I mean, it's definitely, it's definitely for some, but yeah, you're right.

469
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,680
For the general user, it's not really, it's not really a big deal.

470
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:42,360
Uh, you know, the only really other question I had sent in from the audience that was kind

471
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:46,640
of kicking around is, uh, how do you guys plan to make money and are you going to take

472
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,640
donations?

473
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:55,600
No, we might take donations and so Gentoo's been talking about it a bit, but right now

474
00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:00,660
all of our expenses, our build systems, everything comes out of my own pocket and I haven't really

475
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:01,760
been taking anything in.

476
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:05,360
Well, you're a good man, SDQ.

477
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:11,200
So have you considered like a donation system or like a Kickstarter system or something

478
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,200
like that?

479
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,520
Um, can you repeat the question?

480
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,520
I couldn't hear you.

481
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,520
Are you thinking about, are you guys?

482
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:20,120
Cause the reason I'm asking is we had a few people send in like longplay wrote in and

483
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:23,960
asked if, uh, you guys would, he wants to send you money, but he couldn't find a way

484
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,960
to donate.

485
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,880
Are you considering doing a donation model?

486
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:38,000
We might put a donation button on the website because the reason I didn't want donations

487
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:46,360
to, well us accepting donations at the beginning is, well, what if, uh, we just started and

488
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:50,920
then everything fails and well, people are going to be angry and everything.

489
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:54,320
But well, we've, uh, we've gone a long way from there.

490
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,440
So we might, uh, that's good.

491
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,440
It's good.

492
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,440
Yeah.

493
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,440
Yeah.

494
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,020
You want to make sure you got something that, uh, you can, you can show for before you ask

495
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:03,160
people to start taking money.

496
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:06,720
Well, also I'll open it up to the mumble room and see if there's any questions that the

497
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,720
group has.

498
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:10,560
Um, and you guys, if you do just ping me in the chat room with any questions you have

499
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:14,560
for the folks and we'll, we'll get through those and the chat room, I'm also checking

500
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:19,320
your questions as, as we go, but, uh, guys, I want to thank you for coming on Linux Unplugged.

501
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:22,680
As this project I'm going to be watching, you know, I'm, I'm still really interested

502
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,360
in picking the mobile messenger of the future.

503
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:30,560
And right now the Jupiter Broadcasting Network really kind of uses Skype a lot for our shows

504
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:35,260
because at the end of the day, it seems to be the, the sort of the best combination of

505
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:40,480
deployment and ease of use and actual video and audio quality simultaneously.

506
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,620
I'm really excited about the talks project.

507
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:47,120
We talked about it a little bit this last Sunday on the Linux Action Show and I demoed

508
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,120
a couple of different apps you can use for it.

509
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:54,460
It's early days right now, uh, but, uh, I, I, I want to encourage you guys to keep going

510
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:57,520
at it, keep working at it because this is a space that people are going to be more and

511
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:00,080
more interested over the, uh, the next couple of years.

512
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:05,360
Crossroads asks, uh, how does this compare to other chat programs, e.g. BT Chat or Tor

513
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,360
Chat?

514
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,360
And actually that's a great question.

515
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,520
Have you guys seen the announcement of Tor Chat and what are your thoughts on that versus

516
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,520
talks?

517
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:24,080
Well, Tor Chat is, uh, they're going more on the anonymous, uh, well, they want to make

518
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:29,640
an anonymous chat, but, uh, talks is, uh, isn't anonymous.

519
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:35,960
You connect directly to the people you're speaking to because, uh, we want performance

520
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:44,480
because, well, streaming, uh, high resolution video through Tor is, well, doesn't really

521
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,480
work well.

522
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,480
That's true, right?

523
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,480
Yeah.

524
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,480
That's a great point.

525
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,480
Yeah.

526
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,480
I hadn't thought about the video aspect of it.

527
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,480
And to reiterate further.

528
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,480
Yeah.

529
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,480
Go ahead.

530
00:32:53,480 --> 00:33:01,480
I mean, we're trying to design something that everyone can use, not just the paranoid.

531
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:05,600
Well, and, and to that end, is that why, I mean, I'm seeing a lot of, a lot of different

532
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,600
talks clients.

533
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,280
There's not like one official talks client.

534
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:13,080
I guess it would be conceivable that you could have chat programs like Pidgin out there and

535
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:16,640
others that support talks and Tor Chat at the same time.

536
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,640
Right?

537
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,640
Yeah.

538
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:22,280
Pidgin for a, there's a talks plugin in development already.

539
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:28,160
So it, uh, it already supports, uh, talks, but very good.

540
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,480
That's very interesting you guys.

541
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:32,960
And, uh, I'm glad you're working on this to tell you the truth because, uh, one of my

542
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:38,880
predictions for, uh, the, the, uh, the Linux action show for 2014 was that there'd be an

543
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,600
explosion in secure messaging.

544
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:44,480
So you guys are right now confirming my prediction.

545
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,560
So that's awesome for me.

546
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,560
Most definitely.

547
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,560
Yeah.

548
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,560
I know, right?

549
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:53,280
Uh, so you guys, I know, I know you guys probably are not big fans of giving out timelines,

550
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:57,680
but do you have a general big picture timeline or roadmap of when features will roll out

551
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,920
or be available?

552
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:05,480
I can tell you the, well, the order at which we're going to roll them out, but timelines

553
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,440
are a bit, uh, I'll take that.

554
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,600
I'll take order of that.

555
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,080
You want to roll things out for sure.

556
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:14,480
Well, first of all, we're going to roll out the TCP relays.

557
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:20,160
Then after that, we're going to work, uh, on, uh, fixing our group chats and making

558
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:23,680
audio video work in group chats.

559
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:29,200
And well, that's the two main, that should take a while because they're, they're two

560
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:35,160
very big, uh, features that they're going to need lots of testing and everything.

561
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:42,000
And after that, we're going to concentrate on, well, whatever, uh, well, maybe optimizing

562
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:51,440
code or, uh, trying to implement other features like offline messaging and like how someone

563
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:59,560
who wants to be logged in at two computers that might, uh, might work on that.

564
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:03,600
It depends on, well, what we feel people want the most.

565
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,600
What they're asking for.

566
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,600
Yeah.

567
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,600
Well, let me ask you this.

568
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,320
What if somebody, Daredevilin's making a great question, making a great point in our chat

569
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,320
room.

570
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,840
What if, what if you, uh, were, uh, you wake up one day, you go to slash dot or tech meme

571
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:20,400
or Reddit or whatever, and you see a top headline, new secure messenger launched available

572
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,080
on Android, iOS, and the desktop, um, it's, it's awesome.

573
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,080
It's rock solid.

574
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:28,440
And you dig through it and when you see they're charging, they're charging for the app and

575
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:32,300
then you'd read through the details and you realize, holy crap, they're using talks.

576
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:36,640
How do you feel about people creating clients or potentially business models on top of a

577
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,760
system that you're building today?

578
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:47,760
Well, the core is licensed under the GPL v3, so they can't take the code and not give the

579
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,960
source back.

580
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:54,400
So well, if someone does take it and improves their source and if they make money, I don't

581
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:58,040
care if they, because they're improving the software.

582
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:00,120
So Daredevilin, I didn't realize you're in here.

583
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,120
Go ahead.

584
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:03,120
And did you have more you wanted to add to that?

585
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,120
Daredevilin?

586
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,120
No.

587
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,120
Sorry.

588
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,120
I'm here.

589
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,120
Can you hear me?

590
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,120
Yeah.

591
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,120
Yeah.

592
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:16,400
So what happened is, uh, the reason I got this question is because, uh, I was wondering

593
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:21,720
more, uh, I know it's GPL and people are contributing back, but there's kind of business models

594
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:26,920
that could involve, for example, a company making their own nodes in a way that, um,

595
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:29,280
will allow them to mimic users.

596
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:33,600
And I mean, depends of course on the intrinsic of the project, but then goes to something

597
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:38,160
that is something a little bit deviated from original tax plans.

598
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:41,400
And it goes like uses stock source code.

599
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:46,240
It uses all like, uh, like, uh, bitcoins, litecoin, that kind of thing.

600
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,240
Yeah.

601
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,800
It's kind of, sorta.

602
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:56,280
So it will be with some differences that will make more, uh, a company driven perspective

603
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:01,040
and not actually providing the users direct access.

604
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:06,680
So what are the measures in place for you to incentivize people to just come to your

605
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:12,160
project instead of just working, doing something crazy that goes completely out of town?

606
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:18,960
Well, if, if a company does something like that, well, and users actually use the software

607
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,580
from that company, that means they're doing something good.

608
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:23,840
So that's a win for you.

609
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:31,640
Well, we can always take the code out and put it in our, in our project.

610
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:36,920
And so, uh, Josh, go ahead.

611
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,920
That's a good point.

612
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,920
It's like, okay.

613
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:39,920
Oh, okay.

614
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:40,920
I mean, that's an interesting way to think about it.

615
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:46,920
Like openBSD makes SSH and they give it away for people to do whatever they want with.

616
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:47,920
Right.

617
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,920
Great point.

618
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,160
I mean, that's, that's an interesting way to kind of frame that.

619
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:53,920
Uh, Josh, you had a kind of a question more about funding, right?

620
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,760
Yes, I did.

621
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:02,080
Um, so you guys talked about maybe monetizing or accepting donations in the future.

622
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:07,100
So what is your opinion on allowing, you know, people to back certain features with something

623
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:11,620
like Bounty Source, uh, and allow you guys to get paid to like implement certain features

624
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:16,440
like group chats and maybe help speed the process along or provide some sort of monetary

625
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:20,620
incentive?

626
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:25,560
You know, I think something like that really hurts people's trust if something doesn't

627
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:30,920
meet a timeline, if something looks good, looks like it's easy to do, but it doesn't

628
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:34,880
come up and it ends up taking a lot longer than it should or something.

629
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,240
People will get disappointed.

630
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:44,820
Well, the main issue is that implementing something is a relatively easy implementing

631
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:49,080
something that's bug free and works perfectly.

632
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:51,200
That's a, that's hard.

633
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,840
So well, that's a, that's an interesting point.

634
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:55,840
Yeah.

635
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,200
You don't, yeah, I, it is.

636
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:01,640
So it's something to consider, I think, because it's really fascinating to really, it truly

637
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:06,600
tells you what, what people's priorities are when they assign a dollar value to it in a

638
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:11,600
way that is so much more tangible than, than emails and, and bug requests and all these

639
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:14,580
things when people are actually willing to put money down for something, then you really

640
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:17,840
know it's, it's literally of a value to them.

641
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:21,320
Uh, so I, but I do understand you don't want to overset expectations and you guys seem

642
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,880
to be, you know, uh, walking that line pretty closely.

643
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:27,180
Uh, I'm going to take a quick break right here and when we get back, I want to talk

644
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:32,240
a little bit about maybe your thoughts on the future of, uh, mobile for talks, but first

645
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:35,520
speaking of mobile, I want to thank Ting for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

646
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:41,280
Go to linux.ting.com, yes, linux.ting.com, that's how awesome Ting is.

647
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,380
Now what is Ting?

648
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:46,800
It's mobile that makes sense, my friend, my mobile service provider, and of course Matt's

649
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,680
mobile service provider.

650
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,720
You bet.

651
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:54,920
And Ting has no contracts, no early terminations, and by the way, you only pay for what you

652
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:55,920
use.

653
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:59,760
It's a flat rate every single month, and then just your usage on top of that.

654
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,540
Every Ting plan includes hotspot and tethering, so you just go on Android, you just check

655
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:04,620
that box.

656
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:08,760
Every device you buy, you own it, so you're not anitizing that cost over like two years

657
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:12,240
where you're still paying into something that's not nearly worth that, plus they have a super

658
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:18,000
awesome dashboard that supports web standards that is, while simple to use, extremely powerful

659
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,640
unless you set up a whole bunch of stuff you want for your phone, and they have no hold

660
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,640
customer support.

661
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:26,400
But what I really like about Ting is they're actually good people.

662
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,680
They're a good company, they're good people, and they care about their customers.

663
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,040
I'll give you an example over on their blog.

664
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:38,500
They just posted yesterday six simple steps to save money on your smartphone mobile data,

665
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:42,320
and they go through some of the big apps that a lot of smartphone users use, and a lot of

666
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:46,920
the settings that already exist in those most popular apps like YouTube and Google Maps

667
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:53,760
and Chrome and Facebook and Spotify and Gmail, they have all these different settings you

668
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:58,600
can go through to actually conserve bandwidth, to save a little bit of money, and they've

669
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,440
done posts like this in the past, too.

670
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:03,120
They talk about Opera Max, for example.

671
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:08,560
They've done posts like this on the minutes spectrum, and this was, Ting is, because the

672
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:14,260
way Ting is structured with their flat rates and the pay for your usage, they really have

673
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:18,520
a system that allows them to super serve the customer and not try to nickel and dime you

674
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:21,680
like every other carrier does, and even the carriers that pretend like they're trying

675
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,920
to make a big difference, they're actually still nickel and diming you.

676
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:29,140
So go over to linux.ting.com, that'll save $25 off your first Ting device.

677
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:32,500
If you already have a device that's compatible with the Sprint network, well then bring that

678
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:35,920
with you, and then Ting will take $25 off your bill.

679
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,480
They'll give you a $25 credit.

680
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:41,640
By the way, they've got an early termination relief program, too, and that's awesome, because

681
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:45,560
if you have a contract and you know that they're screwing you, you know you want to get out

682
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:50,980
of that contract, you're sick of the BS, all you have to do is grab your Ting device, port

683
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:56,280
your number, and then you submit an ETF claim over to Ting, and they'll pay you up to $75

684
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,280
per line that you had to get canceled.

685
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:00,200
And then once you get in there, the savings is crazy.

686
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,160
In fact, check out their new savings calculator.

687
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,960
They've updated it recently.

688
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:07,440
If you have Verizon or T-Mobile or AT&T, you can plug that in there.

689
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,880
It'll go get your bill information for you.

690
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:12,720
If you don't, you can just plug in your data like you normally would, tell them how many

691
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,900
cell phones you got, and then they'll tell you how much you would save.

692
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:19,080
It's crazy when you see it, because Ting just recently dropped their data rates, too.

693
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:24,640
So go over to linux.ting.com to get started, and a big thank you to Ting for sponsoring

694
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,640
Linux Unplugged.

695
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:28,360
All right, guys, so how about it?

696
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:32,560
Any plans for mobile support, a Talks mobile client down the road?

697
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,560
Yes.

698
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:34,560
Well, of course.

699
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:35,560
Yes.

700
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:36,560
Yes.

701
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:37,560
Yes.

702
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:40,760
I mean, you can't get adopted without support.

703
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:41,760
Right.

704
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,760
You need to run everywhere.

705
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:43,760
Yeah.

706
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,760
That's like a must-have.

707
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:49,360
So are you going to build that app yourself?

708
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:52,280
No, we already have people building the apps.

709
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:58,280
We have TCP relays that need to still be added, but that'll help with a lot of mobile connections.

710
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:05,040
We have apps already done, and there's a Cydia app, and there's an Android app already.

711
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:10,320
Android doesn't work yet, and the Cydia app needs a special repo, but this is all being

712
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:12,240
done already.

713
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,080
We'd love to see that on Ubuntu Touch.

714
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:15,080
I bet.

715
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:18,440
That would be a really good app, though, right, to have at launch?

716
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:19,440
Yeah.

717
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:22,560
And they'd probably get a lot of exposure, too.

718
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:32,920
Yeah, I know some people within Canonical are very keen on selling Ubuntu Touch on the

719
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:37,960
fact that it's possible for people to very easily create these kind of secure apps, and

720
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:47,400
we're not somewhat tainted with the three-letter acronym companies poking our users.

721
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,400
Yes.

722
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,000
I know, Derek Devlin, you had a comment about freelance developers.

723
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,400
I wanted to let you get that in.

724
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,400
Go ahead.

725
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:54,400
Yeah.

726
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:59,280
The reason I was talking about freelance developers is even though you guys don't want to compromise

727
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:07,120
or commit yourselves to a timeline, I guess it will be a way that you allow people to

728
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:13,960
just come around and say, I want to do this just as my freelance gig.

729
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:19,400
If someone wants to take the risk of the time and things, do you want those people to be

730
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,040
directly associated with the project?

731
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:27,520
Do they need to contribute the patches on their own, in their own branch, and then involve

732
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:28,780
later?

733
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:33,640
The reason I'm asking this is because, actually, I'm pretty fascinated by your project.

734
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:38,520
I've actually gone to two universities, and there's quite a lot of papers.

735
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:43,200
I will be interested, but there's business models on top of this.

736
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:47,400
That's why I had these questions to you.

737
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:55,100
If you want to contribute, just come to our IRC channel and tell us.

738
00:44:55,100 --> 00:45:02,240
The only problem with contributing a lot of code, for example, the core is that, well,

739
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:07,280
the core stuff is very touchy.

740
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:16,160
It has to be, well, there has to be no security bugs or else, well, some blogger is going

741
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:17,720
to destroy us.

742
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:18,720
Yeah.

743
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:19,720
Yeah.

744
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:21,720
That's the way that happens.

745
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:22,720
Yeah.

746
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:29,080
But I feel you didn't answer my question, sorry, is that, so a developer that I want,

747
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:33,120
I have a client, that client wants me to implement something.

748
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:35,080
I'm going to be paid for this.

749
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:36,640
So where do I go?

750
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:43,820
Do I go directly to try submit these patches and these new feature with you, or do I do

751
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:49,200
it for the client on my own branch and then invite them to go meet you once the feature

752
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:52,240
is done?

753
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:58,680
You come and see us first to see if we have plans to implement a feature like that very

754
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:05,720
soon so we know there's no duplicate work and then, well, you just work on your feature

755
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:10,200
or you, well, you do whatever you want and we'll adjust.

756
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,200
Okay.

757
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:13,200
All right.

758
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:18,440
And Crash, you wanted to make a point on the sort of cross-platform adoption we're seeing

759
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:19,440
already, right?

760
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:24,800
Yeah, well, I mean, just talking to the guys in the IRC, in the Jupyter Broadcasting IRC

761
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:28,960
before, there was a guy in there saying there's, you know, that they're wanting it to run on

762
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:33,960
every platform, like I said, FreeDOS and OS2 and Plan 9 and stuff, but I also noticed that

763
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:42,240
they said it's GPL and the Free Software Foundation actually wanted to pick them up and make them

764
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:46,320
like a Free Software Foundation project and they said no because they didn't want to sign

765
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:53,280
the FSFCLA purely for the fact that then they could have an iOS client as well, which I

766
00:46:53,280 --> 00:47:00,880
thought was a very smart move because the CLA, it's a good thing in many ways, but just

767
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:07,160
doing that so that they can even have a client for iOS, which it just makes it more ubiquitous

768
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:09,240
so that everyone can use TOX.

769
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:10,240
Yeah.

770
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:11,240
That's interesting.

771
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:12,240
I thank you.

772
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:13,240
Thanks for sharing that.

773
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:16,560
Also, go ahead, STQ, you wanted to respond?

774
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,400
Sorry, I was just testing.

775
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,640
I couldn't see my microphone icon, so I was just making sure.

776
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:24,840
So Crash, you've been following the project since the beginning.

777
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:27,800
Did you have any questions you wanted to ask the guys?

778
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:31,360
Well, not particularly.

779
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:38,040
I was actually quite interested in what their opinions are of WebRTC as far as the video

780
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:42,120
part because I thought that might be, I mean, that's more of an idea thing that they want,

781
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:48,280
but if they built a little in one of the clients, maybe it's a little WebKit engine or something

782
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:55,440
that can connect to WebRTC, but I don't know if that's P2P or not, so they might not work

783
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:59,800
with the goals of the project, but it would be an interesting way to do something.

784
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:03,760
That actually kind of dovetails to a question I was going to ask.

785
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:07,680
What are your thoughts at this point, maybe this is probably best for I run Gentoo, on

786
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,720
the actual implementation of video support?

787
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:17,000
Are you looking at things like WebRTC, are you looking at codecs yet and how it's going

788
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:22,240
to work, resolutions and all these kinds of things, or are you not at that spot yet?

789
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:30,240
Well, video already works in the core, it's basic, but it works.

790
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:38,120
Currently it uses VP8, VP9 isn't quite ready, but switching from VP8 to VP9, it's a two-line

791
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:46,840
change in the code, so it's not really an issue.

792
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:52,800
First before developing audio video more, we need to get it into clients, because right

793
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:56,320
now no client really supports it.

794
00:48:56,320 --> 00:49:01,880
We have our test client that supports it, but that's not enough, you want to get some

795
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:10,560
real testing for it, and once we have some real testing, we can start maybe adding more

796
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:12,240
stuff to the video.

797
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:23,720
Right now it's very basic, you set the resolution, then there's no congestion control.

798
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:29,500
The fact that it's going to be using VP9 down the road and I actually get to set the resolution

799
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:36,400
already puts it a notch above Skype, my friend, so that's already a good thing.

800
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:40,720
I know you had a question sort of maybe about the fundamental separation between the core

801
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:45,560
project and the clients, and maybe that would sort of get around some of these licensing

802
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:46,560
problems?

803
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:51,600
Yeah, so there is this problem with the CLA for our Free Software Foundation, but the

804
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:55,600
way I understand the Free Software Foundation CLA actually ensures that even if the Free

805
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:59,800
Software Foundation for some reason goes to bankruptcy or fails, a company that takes

806
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:05,580
over cannot transform the free software, the proprietary software, which at this moment

807
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:09,680
is something that, I mean, I'm not saying that you guys are going to get bought out,

808
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:16,640
but it's possible, and the project will just buy from there or go to a different direction.

809
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:21,480
I see that if the reason is the iOS client, couldn't just the iOS client be completely

810
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:27,840
separate from the main project and be something that is just kind of, it can be developed

811
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:30,760
by the same people, just not under the same umbrella?

812
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:36,040
No, unfortunately everything has to go through our core library to essentially communicate.

813
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:43,880
Well, our core library is GPL v3, meaning the clients would have to be compatible.

814
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:47,960
We've been working on making sure we have the copyright for all of our code so we can

815
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:54,720
selectively assign a dual license for an OSI compatible license so we can allow support

816
00:50:54,720 --> 00:51:01,120
on iOS while still ensuring every client, every library is 100% open source.

817
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:06,360
Aren't you just recreating a CLA though, if you want to keep the copyright under your

818
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:09,840
umbrella and everything needing to be through you?

819
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:10,840
Basically.

820
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:11,840
Alright.

821
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:12,840
Okay.

822
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:20,360
Okay, and one last obligatory question before we wrap up, you guys, how far along is the

823
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:25,000
Firefox OS version of the Talks Messenger?

824
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,600
That's HTML and JavaScript based, right?

825
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:31,920
Yeah, actually, what about a web chat, is that possible, is that something you guys

826
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:32,920
are considering?

827
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:40,120
Well, I mean, on Chrome OS you can use native client, on web apps you can use native client,

828
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:45,240
I don't know how you communicate with a C library in Firefox.

829
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:50,840
Guys, I appreciate the fact, this is really the reason why Talks has moved to the top

830
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:55,200
of my list right now, is just good desktop support and that promise of replacing Skype

831
00:51:55,200 --> 00:52:00,040
because as somebody, you know, in the podcasting space, a lot of podcasters are very dependent

832
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:06,320
on this system and it has a lot of limitations and we're not their focus and, you know, you

833
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:13,160
joke about it, but really just the ability to set the video resolution right now is not

834
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:17,040
even an option under Skype and if you think about some of the major multi-million dollar

835
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:21,200
networks out there, TWIT, that are relying on Skype to do video production and you can't

836
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:26,240
even set the video resolution and that's aside from all of the massive security problems

837
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:31,720
that Skype now has, thank you Microsoft, and also just the, you know, it's a compromised

838
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:37,000
piece of software, people DDOS, Skype Nix for joy all the time and it's completely just

839
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:41,640
messed up, so I'm watching Talks with a lot of interest you guys, so thank you very much

840
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:44,160
for coming on the show today and chatting with us.

841
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:50,080
Before we run, I wanted to just get a question out there and it was, I got it in from Scott,

842
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:55,200
he said, hey guys, I wanted to express a growing concern I have held for the past decade with

843
00:52:55,200 --> 00:53:00,120
open source software and the recent activity things going on in the Linux community right

844
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:01,120
now.

845
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:06,240
Examples are Firefox putting ads in, Steam bringing DRM games to Linux, Nvidia proprietary

846
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:09,480
drivers exploding in popularity, etc.

847
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:14,240
Linux is always touted as being a free and open system, but are we moving into an era

848
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:15,840
when less and less is free?

849
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:18,600
When I talk about free, I mean as in freedom.

850
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:23,560
The reason I bring this up is because you are very positive of Steam coming to Linux.

851
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:29,160
He says, in many Linux groups, however, I think some of the sentiment is opposite.

852
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:32,840
I'm good with paying money for legitimate software, but will the future hold me paying

853
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:35,400
for software that is not open source?

854
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:39,480
Do you think as Linux gets more popular and more big players come into the arena, that

855
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:42,920
the whole open source notion is kind of just a nice dream?

856
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:44,240
Love to hear what you think.

857
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:49,600
Scott, anybody in the Mumba room have strong thoughts on this?

858
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:52,480
I do.

859
00:53:52,480 --> 00:54:00,360
In my opinion anyway, as long as the core components of Linux remain free, so as long

860
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:06,320
as the kernel and all the intrinsic parts of Linux remain free, that's all that matters.

861
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:10,640
It's fine if you want to put proprietary software like games on Linux, but as long as the core

862
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:12,440
components stay free, it's fine.

863
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:13,440
What do you think Riley?

864
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:19,480
Yes, this is why there's still things like Trisco Linux and official Free Software Foundation

865
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:20,480
districts.

866
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:26,600
So if you're not concerned about it, just use that and leave everybody else alone.

867
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:27,600
Wow.

868
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:31,400
Get off my lawn is essentially what Riley is saying.

869
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:36,480
I think what Scott is kind of saying here is he's worried about the groupthink syndrome

870
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:45,520
where we all kind of just, as a group, decide that sort of allowing this encroaching intrusions

871
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:47,000
on freedom is okay.

872
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,920
And so, well, it's just our video driver.

873
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:50,600
Well, I really need good Wi-Fi.

874
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:53,840
Okay, well this video game cost them a lot of money to make.

875
00:54:53,840 --> 00:55:00,280
And we keep rationalizing it and every single time we rationalize it to some sort of group

876
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:05,960
consensus and we all just kind of collectively give up on that particular thing instead of

877
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:12,720
holding the hardware vendors to actually making an open source GPU driver and things like

878
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:13,720
that.

879
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:16,640
So I actually think what Scott's bringing up is something that we all have to just stay

880
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:17,980
vigilant on.

881
00:55:17,980 --> 00:55:22,400
And I don't think it means that we stop playing Steam games, but at the same time, I look

882
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:27,040
at it from like a business standpoint and I say, okay, well core infrastructure components

883
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:32,280
for sustainability, for long-term predictability, and for transparency, those just have to be

884
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:33,560
open source.

885
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:38,120
All other things aside, freedom aside, just if I'm going, if my business is going to rely

886
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:42,800
on this technology, I need to be able to know where the hell that technology is going and

887
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:47,380
if the person making that technology disappears or gets burnt out, at least I can fork it

888
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:49,200
and keep it running myself.

889
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:54,400
That's why people who have their entire server infrastructure or desktop system dependent

890
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:58,520
on Apple, man, that would make me stay up at night because you never know what Apple's

891
00:55:58,520 --> 00:55:59,520
going to do next.

892
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:00,700
Are they going to kill the Mac Mini?

893
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:02,540
Are they going to drop the Ethernet port?

894
00:56:02,540 --> 00:56:05,160
Are they going to release iOS for the desktop?

895
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:06,160
It would drive me crazy.

896
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:07,160
Are they going to make a trash can?

897
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:12,160
Yeah, I mean, are they going to drop all PCI Express expandability and internal storage?

898
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,720
You just never know.

899
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:17,840
Whereas with open technology, you at least have the mailing list, you have the roadmap

900
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:20,080
and you have that almighty fork.

901
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:24,680
And I think for core infrastructure technology, and that's, you know, you could argue with

902
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:28,400
the GPU driver and that's one of the reasons I've been eyeballing Ultra Pro because I kind

903
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:33,000
of like the idea of getting an Iris GPU just to make one more component less dependent

904
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,880
on some upstream vendor.

905
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:42,320
But I think it is appropriate and I believe it is rational, even with all of that considered,

906
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:49,760
to make exceptions and where certain practical matters come in, like in some cases video

907
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:55,080
editing or in some cases video games, you know, I think commercial can be accepted.

908
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:57,480
I mean, Matt, this is probably something you've struggled with for a long time.

909
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:58,480
Where do you fall down?

910
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:01,640
You know, I think at the end of the day, it comes down to the point you were making about

911
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:02,840
core components and that sort of thing.

912
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:06,200
I think as long as it stays out of the kitchen as far as getting really deep into stuff,

913
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:09,120
I don't think this is really such an issue because for years there's always been the

914
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:13,240
concern of this becoming a major, major catastrophe and oh my God, it's the end of Linux as we

915
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:15,640
know it because of this and that and the other thing.

916
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:20,320
As long as we have distributions that are able to maintain those core components pure,

917
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:23,360
you know, if one distro wants to go south or something, that's their business.

918
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:26,040
I don't see this being a big problem, I guess is what I'm trying to say.

919
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:27,040
I really don't.

920
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:29,800
Yeah, and it's kind of, it's come and gone over the years.

921
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:32,120
Like in some ways it's actually gotten better.

922
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:37,500
Like there's a lot, these days a lot of systems actually have a lot less binary blobs powering

923
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:38,500
that hardware.

924
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:39,500
True.

925
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:46,320
I mean there's still a few, you know, but there was a time when I got a Red Hat, jeez,

926
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:50,920
I mean it was, I think it was back before Fedora core was even a thing.

927
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:57,120
So I want to say like Red Hat 6 and I had a binary driver for the Adaptek or some sort

928
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:58,120
of SCSI controller.

929
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:03,120
I had a binary driver for the network card because it was a special network card to communicate

930
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:07,120
with an IBM system 390 mainframe, right?

931
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:11,160
And then it ran on top of it a proprietary management software to monitor and manage

932
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:14,000
it, which has now been completely replaced with things like Puppet.

933
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:21,320
And so in some ways, while we have Steam and we have Nvidia binary drivers, in other ways

934
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:25,360
we are actually working with a lot more free software.

935
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:30,040
And as the technology landscape moves forward and there's less entrenched interest in these

936
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:35,000
certain areas, like there used to be a big market around creating server SCSI adapters

937
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:41,080
and you wouldn't even use the adapter that came with the box on the motherboard, you'd

938
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:45,160
never use that, you'd always use an external adapter and you'd have to have the driver

939
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:48,280
and you'd have to build the module for that version of your kernel, you couldn't update

940
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:52,520
your kernel and you were really stuck and that's not even a problem anymore.

941
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:56,900
Now those guys work directly with Upstream and those drivers ship with the kernel and

942
00:58:56,900 --> 00:59:00,680
they're open source and it's just, you don't even have to worry about it, the drives just

943
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:05,540
show up now to your system and you know, you kids, you don't even appreciate what old farts

944
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:06,760
used to have to deal with.

945
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:09,960
So in a lot of ways, Scott, I actually think it's gotten a lot better too.

946
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:14,740
I think we are always looking at the individual trees, but if you were to fly up like Superman

947
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:18,520
above that forest, you'd see that a lot of it actually isn't that bad.

948
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:19,520
That's my take on it.

949
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:23,840
All right, Matt, well so we're going to wrap up here on Linux Unplugged.

950
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:27,800
Thank you big time to the Tox developers for joining us today, it was very fascinating chat

951
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:31,320
and good to get their perspective on some of the things and kind of get an idea where

952
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:32,320
they're going.

953
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:36,000
Look, on Sunday on the Linux Action Show, I'm going to review that Chromebook, that

954
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:42,240
Acer C720 and I'm going to try to answer the question, can a Chromebook running Linux,

955
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:45,920
not Chrome OS, but actual full-fledged Linux, can you get decent battery life, what's the

956
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:50,020
performance like and is it actually something that's worth spending money on or should you

957
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:52,480
just stick with Chrome OS or maybe get a tablet, something like that.

958
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:54,120
We'll try to answer those questions on Sunday.

959
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:57,400
If you've got any questions, feel free to send them in, we can start a thread over at

960
00:59:57,400 --> 01:00:02,440
linuxactionshow.reddit.com, you can post them there and we'll try to get to those questions

961
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:04,000
in Sunday's Linux Action Show.

962
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,520
All right, Matt, we'll have a great week, okay?

963
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:07,520
You too.

964
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:10,520
I'll see you on Sunday and thank you everyone for tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

965
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:14,000
If we don't see you on Sunday for the Linux Action Show, I hope we'll see you right back

966
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,000
here next Tuesday.

967
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Bye-bye.
