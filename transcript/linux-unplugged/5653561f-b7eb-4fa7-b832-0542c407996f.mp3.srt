1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,120
Before we get into the show, I'm glad Wimpy's here because I bet he's noticed this

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:09,560
Wimpy have you have you noticed that there is like a trend online now

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:14,420
To just do like a screencast of Linux distros and and put some music to it like

4
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,760
Have you noticed some of my posts?

5
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:25,000
Here's like here's like here is exhibit a Ubuntu Mate 1604 here is exhibit B

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,140
It was also very dramatic. Yeah, I like this one and then of course here is C right here. Here's a good one

7
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,280
Yeah

8
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,800
And of course you know you can put like elementary in there you can put solos in there

9
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:43,520
You'll see all kinds of stuff come up like this is like a thing now. You've missed you've missed my favorite genre

10
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,520
Oh, what's that? She's the this is the voice

11
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,280
Synthesized reading. Oh, I have seen some of these

12
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,600
Source site. Yeah, so you get these screen caps with a

13
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,060
Yeah, it's yeah there and it's bad too. It's usually not so good

14
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:03,540
Is there an audience for this shit? Is this something I should be doing here? Cuz I know okay

15
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:09,180
Your audience is the people that show up in forums and that's all they've seen. Yeah, I guess

16
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:18,680
The ones with music and stuff there is an audience for that and that's if you're wanting to

17
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,680
demo something

18
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:27,340
To an international audience, you know where you don't need to say anything where what you're doing is obvious and

19
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,320
You know, why would you put a video up that has no sound at all?

20
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,800
So I kind of can see

21
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:40,360
An edge case for that, but they are growing in popularity and they have got sort of limited value

22
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:47,760
This is Linux Unplugged episode 127 for January 12th, 2016

23
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:04,140
Welcome to Linux Unplugged your weekly Linux podcast that's got a chicken in the slow cooker for dinner tonight

24
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:08,200
My name is Chris. My name is Wes. Hey there Wes. Guess what?

25
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,680
We have a fun show on episode 127

26
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:16,200
Oh a couple of topics that we've been fortunate enough to follow here on the unplugged show got some interesting updates this week

27
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:21,960
So that's where we're gonna start then we're gonna get into feedback about butter FS as a home file system versus ZFS

28
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,760
Oh, that's kind of nerdy

29
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:30,400
Interview with the guys behind scale. There was a about a 10-minute interview. We ran in the Linux action show this Sunday. Well a

30
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:35,200
Interesting part of that got left out got cut out from the interview so that we would fit in the show and we're gonna play

31
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:41,200
That part it's about what's new at scale and what's big and different about scale in 2016. We'll play that and then

32
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,040
Wes brace yourself

33
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,640
for remix OS

34
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,200
remix OS for the PC launch today, January 12th, 2016

35
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,960
Are you excited? I am excited now. I don't know if I'm excited. We should try it and see we're gonna try it and see

36
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:00,820
In fact, we're gonna try it and see we're gonna get a demo of it from them at the floor of CES

37
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:05,800
I got more curious than excited. Yeah, I guess that's curious is the way to put it. And you know what Wes?

38
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:10,380
I got a run right here on the machine. Oh, no way running right here on my machine in a virtual machine

39
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:14,460
Well, that doesn't we'll do a little walk through right now. I know and then at the end of the show

40
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:20,600
You ever get stuck being tech support and Fred with friends family. How do you get out of that?

41
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:25,160
Or is it our duty? Is it our duty? We're gonna do a little debate deep questions here

42
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,400
I know I know and you know how you know why we can do these deep probing

43
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:34,360
Questions Wes. I think I do because we have that awesome mumble room time appropriate greetings virtual log

44
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:44,040
Alright, so guess what we're gonna do a little topic updates before we get into that whole show and I love the name

45
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,000
I mean, this is why I think one of the reasons we're doing in the show

46
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,140
It's called snap craft snap craft 1.0 is a boon to snappy creator tool officially released

47
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,240
It's canonical. It's got a tool out there now, and I don't know if anybody in the mumble room

48
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:59,580
Might know any more about this than I do, but it's a new tool to generate

49
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:04,360
I would assume custom snappy Ubuntu Linux images. It's pretty cool snap craft 1.0

50
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,820
They're already talking about plans for a new version which is gonna support 1604 because the current one is based on

51
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,920
1504 nice yeah

52
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,880
And I think this is a great way to just let people go out there and make their own snappy based images

53
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:20,000
I was wondering how exactly that custom tailoring was gonna work from like a hey

54
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,920
I have an idea right and I want to use snappy to do it like let's say Ryan was sitting around here

55
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:28,440
You know he's talking about doing the Minecraft project, and this is like you know down the road sure

56
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,440
And you just want to go with Ubuntu snappy I

57
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,360
Was kind of wondering what was that process like I think this kind of makes sense tools

58
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,200
Do you need and I like the name snap craft? Yeah, that's fun

59
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,980
You have any any insights or opinions poppy you want to share with the crowd?

60
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,560
Yeah, it's kind of moved on pretty quickly

61
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,880
I I don't work directly on snap craft or snapping myself, but I work with people who do of course and

62
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:57,080
It's so it's it's a tool really for to overcome the problem that you know we've said we're gonna have a different

63
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:01,440
packaging system in the personal desktop right and

64
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,800
Part of the problem there is people say well

65
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,600
I've got all these applications, and I I want them to be available to users

66
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,480
But I don't want to have to learn a whole new packaging system

67
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,320
It's hard enough to create RPMs and devs and whatever else

68
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:19,000
I don't have to learn something else and that's where snap graph was born you create a single yaml file

69
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,520
That defines the configuration run snap craft and boom out out pops a snappy package

70
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:29,200
And you chuck it in the store, and you're done that sounds very easy to use yeah, that's great

71
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,200
Hard to get simpler than yaml really yeah, yeah

72
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,440
I wonder if you're gonna see I wonder if you're gonna see just

73
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,480
This will just be like the obvious choice since there's something here to do now like there's just the same make these there

74
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,480
I focus on robot operating system tools is kind of interesting

75
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,200
Just like that term

76
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:53,600
Yeah, you know operating systems for robots. Oh, man snappy will be the end of us all so I want to just give a mention

77
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,880
We are we do have a beverage that West brought in look at this

78
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,800
This is the vertex IPA that we're drinking on the show today with a BA score of 81

79
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:07,720
That's not that's not super great for bear advocate. No. It's not no. It's not super great. What do you think though?

80
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:12,080
It's got a 76 IBU. It's all right. Yeah, I was hoping for more honestly yeah

81
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:17,000
Yeah, so you kind of you're agreeing with the yeah, I think so. I mean it's not bad. It's a fine beer all right

82
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Well, let's crack. We'll crack up on our second one

83
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:24,800
And we'll be drinking this throughout the show if you at home want to pause and grab yourself an IPA you get to play along

84
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,340
With our home version of the game also a virtual lug you're welcome to crack one open

85
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:36,120
So did you see the news that KD plasma 5.6 has a new feature and that feature is

86
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,720
support for the unity launcher according to a

87
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,240
A developer on this is over on softpedia

88
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,320
Grinding an article over on softpedia from a from a developer

89
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,320
They're citing the new KD 5

90
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:55,880
5.6 release will focus on being more user-friendly by removing any functionality that you the user think stands in your way to accomplish your daily tasks

91
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:02,560
Like maybe removing activities there will be a lot of new features and updated applications in KD plasma 5.6 as well

92
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,860
Let's start with the new unity

93
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:13,420
Launcher support as it would appear that KD plasma 5.6 will borrow the unity API from canonicals Ubuntu Linux operating system

94
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:18,980
To implement support for app notifications in the task manager for example

95
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:22,240
Chromium web browser without a slip display download progress

96
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:25,060
Telegram yeah, yeah

97
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:31,460
but KD devs are planning to extend the functionality to a major of other majority of other applications to like dolphin and

98
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:36,740
And other task manager and Thunderbird and whatnot I look forward to better media controls

99
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:39,540
I mean, I think we've all enjoyed that for yeah, it's meant and go

100
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:45,180
What is going on here exactly what's going on what's going? I mean, I love it

101
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:50,020
I'm not I'm not disappointed in any sense of them of the word, but oh, why why why are we doing this?

102
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:52,380
It seems like a change. Yeah style

103
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:58,620
Interaction for the I just does anybody in the mobile room have any theories on why all of a sudden the plot of the KD

104
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:02,420
Plat KD plasma desktop all of a sudden has an interest this far into the project

105
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,700
Am I missing something?

106
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:11,380
Well, isn't it just functionality? They don't already have they don't have the little progress bar on the icon all the

107
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:16,340
Labels in the corner, and so they need to do it, so they're going with this right a sane API

108
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:21,140
I can borrow it in the same way that you know we use components out of KDE on Ubuntu

109
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:24,420
They now imagine if we just did this on a broader scale, okay?

110
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,700
Just stop and imagine for a second

111
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:30,740
You know what jumped out at me though, and I don't really know what this means, and I don't know if anybody has any insights

112
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:37,980
It's gonna focus on being more user-friendly by removing any functionality that you the user think stands in your way to accomplish your daily

113
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,540
Tasks what the heck does that mean?

114
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:42,900
Sounds like they're gonna go gnome 3 on this business. I'm sure that's not that so

115
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:50,020
It's kind of confusing when you read that it was a little removing activities. They're gonna go gnome 3 up on this business

116
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:56,940
Yeah, that's what I was thinking although. I'm curious about it. I'm really curious about it, so we'll see I was you know I was

117
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:01,260
Reading the blog post of some Linux switchers recently and they landed on plasma desktop and loved it

118
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:09,700
So it appeals it a story to hear and I I really like that they're going with the unity API notification API because

119
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,980
Well a crap ton of stuff already uses that

120
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:19,740
So I I have gone on the record in the past and talked about butter fs and my issues with it

121
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:23,900
And you know I I think I kind of you know it's interesting

122
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:30,020
You know apparently to according to the Linux action show subreddit. I am just a strong hater of butter fs

123
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:32,020
I'm a basher of butter fs

124
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,940
Under the subreddit you paid a lot of things

125
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:38,500
It's just mostly my name hard to be hard to be around you

126
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,100
No do go on

127
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:49,740
Oh, hey, it's Danica Patrick. Enjoy this episode and use code Linux all right, so here is here's the question

128
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:55,100
In episode 399 you talked about ZFS as being more designed for the enterprise

129
00:09:55,300 --> 00:10:00,380
While butter fs is more suited for home use, but you never really said why you think that could you explain?

130
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:02,600
Why you think this thanks love the show?

131
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:06,820
Butter fs and so I wanted to give my background with butter fs so I had it on five rigs

132
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,740
I got it still running on two of those rigs

133
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:13,940
Servers laptops desktops your names it I've tried it on a bunch of different rigs for the most part

134
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:20,460
I didn't have a really great time however butter fs. I think for a for a little bit of a

135
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:27,380
Little bit simpler a little bit easier to understand doesn't have some of the same memory requirements as the fs has which is a big

136
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:29,260
one for the home desktop and

137
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:34,340
I think butter fs is a little more like you can work on mounted file systems in a way

138
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,440
You can't work on them with set fs

139
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:42,740
but the other thing about ZFS and you know even even huge advocates like Alan will admit this it truly is a

140
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:50,020
file system designed from the enterprise standpoint from the very beginning and that includes the budget of an enterprise so in a lot of

141
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:52,140
Times the the best-case scenario is well

142
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:55,140
You should do that with two or four drives at a time two or four drives at a time

143
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:58,420
I can't afford to do two or four drives at a time all the time right so

144
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:01,500
Butter fs if you were working on a tighter budget you have less RAM

145
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,860
very flexible

146
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:07,740
Yeah, maybe you don't drive. Maybe you want copy-on-write. Maybe you don't want copy-on-write

147
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:12,300
There's just there's a lot of things like with butter fs that it's gonna come built into your Linux distribution

148
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,820
It's gonna be right out of the box

149
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:17,360
It's gonna be a little bit easier to set up because you're gonna have built-in tools to use it

150
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,060
Because they're gonna be built into the installer

151
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:22,840
It doesn't require quite the amount of memory that ZFS does if you really want to push it

152
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,980
So there's a lot of things about butter fs

153
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:30,740
I think that are better for home users just because it's that sort of starting spot for butter fs

154
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:37,060
Where ZFS especially in 1604 there's gonna be no graphical front-end hookups to it as far as we know at this point

155
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:39,780
It's all command-line to set it up. It's just not really

156
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:45,060
Feasible for home users. I think for my next home box. I'll build I think I might do ZFS

157
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:50,780
Yeah, and if you were you know if you're a confident administrator if you want to take the time to you know really invest

158
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,420
It's great for that and you know it performs very well

159
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,020
It's a wonderful file system

160
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,060
Mm-hmm, but I think you're right

161
00:11:56,060 --> 00:12:01,460
I think what you talked about too with like it works very well and butter fs works very well kind of in the cloud environments

162
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:07,020
For service that you're gonna spin up. You just want you know you want root snapshots, etc. Yeah, yeah

163
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:11,700
Wimpy, how long until Ubuntu Mate edition that lets me use ZFS from the install menu?

164
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,780
That's a very good question

165
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:21,580
There's a couple of file systems. I'd like to see added to Ubiquiti and you never know I've made a few

166
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:29,060
contributions to Ubiquiti in the last year or so and I might make some more I'd like to see f2fs in there as well

167
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:31,740
Mm-hmm, I do I do picture myself

168
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:36,920
I don't know if you listen to tech talk today, but we covered the the new Skylake

169
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:41,220
NUCs that I haven't been announced yet, but they were Intel is talking about it CES

170
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:46,020
There's Skylake. They've got Thunderbolt 3. They've got PCI Express 3 Oh

171
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:50,100
So the you know the PCI the PCI hard drives are gonna just be crazy fast awesome

172
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:53,020
and you know you could get a couple of those things in there and

173
00:12:54,260 --> 00:13:00,900
Maybe an external drive array over Thunderbolt 3 using ZFS that could be I mean that could be a really nice Linux rig

174
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:04,220
I'm definitely excited for the Ubuntu ZFS

175
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,020
I use a

176
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:10,620
LXC for a lot of development stuff and use ZFS for snapshots on the back end and right now you have to install the PPA

177
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,620
And you know if it's more integrated

178
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:18,960
Yeah, so I think that's sort of my thought anybody else have thoughts on using ZFS for your home or day-to-day rig as you know

179
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,960
Just maybe single hard drive even

180
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:26,640
It's a great choice if you want integrity I used to do this all the time the problem is I wanted to be able to

181
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,640
Defrag my disk and so I had to go back to butter FS

182
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,660
Yeah, yeah, that was really the main thing that pushed you back

183
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,880
Yeah, just getting performance out of it as it pushed me back really even though. I did have a lot of RAM

184
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,200
Just having it fragment itself over time was kind of a problem

185
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:45,120
And I mean I could reformat you know every six months or something kind of alleviate the problem

186
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:50,000
But I felt like butter FS was just worth it because I was keeping good backups anyway

187
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,500
I wasn't too worried about my data being silently corrupted. That's not gonna happen

188
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:57,960
It's gonna be very loud when it gets corrupted, and so if it did I would just revert to a backup right

189
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:02,560
I never even had that happen butter FS has been rock-solid at least tells you you know pretty right

190
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,880
You guys it's pretty obvious and butter FS is going to correct your data if it does

191
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:11,800
And I just haven't had that issue so as long as you're keeping good backups. I don't see the problem. Yeah, yeah, okay, so mr.

192
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:17,480
Kitty you think it's kind of telling that before butter if s even got a chance ZFS is already arriving for Linux

193
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,420
Yeah, I thought it was really weird especially you know BF

194
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,200
Btrfs being native

195
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,120
to Linux whereas

196
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:32,560
ZFS is something that takes a lot of work to have to pour it over and all this and that and it is rather telling

197
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,240
That's something that was

198
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,240
worked on for years

199
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:42,040
Is not as ready as something that they had to pour it over and all that well

200
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,760
You know ZFS has been worked on for years, too. Yeah

201
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:53,680
It's not like Btrfs didn't get get a chance it had its opportunity. Yeah, I agree

202
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:59,060
I think the market. I think the market is speaking right now saying you know what we watched it for a while and now

203
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:03,400
Now we know that our customers want something they can trust and the brand

204
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:08,200
ZFS is just stronger than brand butter fs and that's why you know

205
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,640
canonicals willing to shiv it into a

206
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:15,440
LTS using DKMS to make it possible for you because they cussed the customer demand

207
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,820
They're so strong that that all of a sudden is deemed LTS worthy

208
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:26,160
Because they need it in a long-term supported distro that people are shipping on their servers because that's where the customer demand is and I think

209
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,360
That right there demonstrates how much demand there must be seen if they're willing to do that

210
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:35,200
I also think the enterprise requirements are so you know so serious like that data really matters in some

211
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,760
environments and like

212
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:40,720
BSD now they interviewed Joss Pate's pixel from IX systems

213
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,960
Yeah, and he said like you know open ZFS has been around for like 10 years and even now

214
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:50,600
It's still an immature file system, so yeah, that's the case for ZFS right it makes sense that that would that's that is

215
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:55,160
That is absolutely how enterprises think yeah, of course they cover this a lot on BSD now

216
00:15:55,160 --> 00:16:01,600
Yeah, they yeah that interview with Josh is great because Josh is out in the field supporting a lot of different people's I

217
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,360
Jokingly called him the pool boy, but he's out there supporting a lot of people's

218
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,120
CFS pools in production

219
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:10,720
And he's just you know he's just seen a huge aggregate of data and so he's a I mean

220
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,760
He's a in real world expert on it, and so he was over to IX systems

221
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,920
And they let us talk to him and so yeah, that was a great episode

222
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,640
That was just last week's episode of BSD now to go check that out

223
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:26,040
Hmm. Yeah, all right the downtime is expensive data recovery is expensive and RAM and dis are cheap

224
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:30,720
That's how the enterprise looks at ZFS, and that's why I really when I say it's an enterprise grade file system

225
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,300
It's even meant from an enterprise budget, but our FS

226
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:40,460
I think still has long-term potential, but I just think its potential is it's not gonna be these huge data sets

227
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:45,460
And I think for some of us who are willing to do the administrative overhead or understand you know

228
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:51,160
Philosophically what's great about file systems like CFS that are constantly doing checks on me and things like that we might choose to go

229
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,660
CFS over butter fs even though it offers some of the same features

230
00:16:54,460 --> 00:17:01,300
So what will be what will be interesting to see is now that now the ZFS is sort of making gains in the Linux world

231
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,940
It'll be interesting to see if

232
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,500
B3FS just loses

233
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,900
appeal at all or

234
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:16,460
If it will be a slow burner and five ten years from now it will emerge as an alternative

235
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:20,300
Yeah, it seems to me like because it because it's almost like the precious off now

236
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:28,740
Yeah, I almost wonder if it won't be like you format your root or your home partitions or var or user you format

237
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:33,460
Those in butter fs and your slash data or storage partitions are in ZFS

238
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:38,500
because I wonder if one of the things that wouldn't push butter fs forward just for like the OS base OS is

239
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:43,540
Maybe some sort of software deployment that uses butter fs sub volumes to deploy software

240
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:46,500
Sort of like the Mac OS uses sparse volumes

241
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:50,780
HFS sparse volumes to deploy software we've talked to Lenart about that

242
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:55,140
And he says that's in that's entirely possible that you know we would mount a butter fs

243
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:58,860
Volume and you would do a copy from the file systems

244
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,480
You'd have the entire file system structure

245
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,060
And it would be make a lot of sense that you would have butter fs

246
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:06,600
Do you wouldn't have to have butter fs on your current file system to be able to mount a butter fs file system?

247
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:12,740
But I could really see it I could see a you know integrating with snapshots and all that just makes Linux administration easy

248
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,580
And it's just it's built right into the kernel

249
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:19,140
And I could just see it over the next few years becoming used for that and then you just run it like that for a decade

250
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,640
And it's gonna be a pretty tried and dreaming

251
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:25,700
That's that's really how extended got its start, and then it you know it's a tried-and-true vial system now

252
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,980
So you don't think it's too early to call better fs

253
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:34,660
Dead on arrival yet. No I don't think so

254
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:37,140
I don't know you don't know not for a lot of work cases

255
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:40,940
I think there might be some workloads where the brand is too tarnished for at least a while

256
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:43,140
Yeah, I don't think it's I don't think in the next two three

257
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:49,000
I don't know I just kind of unfortunate because zfs had so much more money poured into it than butter fs

258
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,020
Did to start off with yeah?

259
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:50,500
Yeah

260
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:55,540
Like they had it under development for five years at Sun before it was released and they were pouring money in via developers at least

261
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:59,760
Three at a time yeah, whereas butter fs had Chris Mason for what a couple years on its own

262
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:03,360
Yeah, people sending in patches is a totally different paradigm

263
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,500
It's still only like four or five people. It's not the same community

264
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:10,820
And we've also got B cache fs

265
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:17,300
which has grown up out of the B cache initiative and they've now turned that into a

266
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:22,020
Full file system, so that's going to be another copy-on-write file system

267
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:27,600
So it'll be interesting to see how that develops over the coming years and whether you know

268
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:33,800
Is it b3 fs could it be cache fs is it going to be z fs, but you know those desktop type?

269
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,560
scenarios you're looking at where you're doing

270
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,160
snapshots of your system by means of

271
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:44,780
backup for restore for continuity of running your machine I think

272
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:51,260
The jury's still out on that one. I think there's several contenders to open that space mm-hmm. Yeah, I agree

273
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:55,520
Yeah, boy is the and you know what at the end of the day?

274
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,280
We just have to remember we're in better shape than the Mac right. That's all that matters

275
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:06,880
Sorry I couldn't help myself and cfs is better than hfs plus come on. I know I know you see I didn't

276
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:14,080
Okay, so I want to talk about scale because there's some big changes that have happened plus

277
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:19,400
We have some interview stuff that I think it's pretty neat that we didn't get a chance to talk about before so let's take a moment

278
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:24,360
And tell you about how I'm gonna stay connected while I'm going down to scale and that's ting go to Linux dot ting

279
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,840
Dot-com to support this show and get our discount ting is great

280
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,520
It's no contract and you only pay for what you use

281
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,600
Just your minutes your messages in your megabytes

282
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:37,560
And they have a great dashboard to manage all of it that makes it really easy as a really easy and obvious as heck

283
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:44,960
Where you're at Linux dot ting comm you'll get a $25 discount off your first device or West whoa little insider tip

284
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,440
They have GSM and CDMA no way I thought that was impossible

285
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,120
So if you got a phone compatible with one of their networks

286
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:56,440
You can bring it over and get $25 of service credit just saying and they have great devices unlocked you own them outright

287
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:03,360
Or you can bring your own and manage it all with either the ting dashboard the ting mobile app or tings awesome radical customer

288
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:07,600
Support no contracts. No early termination fees. I said no contracts

289
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,520
Yeah, if you stuck in a duopoly contract because you know they're even they're thinking about dropping those things

290
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:17,680
They have an ETF relief program if you want a company that thinks that your internet should just be a dumb pipe go check out

291
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:22,020
Ting go check out ting they they believe in the dumb pipe they want

292
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:25,560
They want you to take their dumb pipe and put it in your device

293
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:31,280
That's what they want you embrace tings pipe go to look at refuse ting could you no no they got a dumb pipe and they

294
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:37,520
Want you to take it go to Linux dot com check out their store browse around see what they've got and also if you've been

295
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:41,200
Thinking about it experiment with their savings calculator that thing is a lot of fun

296
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:46,440
It's nicely designed it is and you know you can actually plug it into your existing account if you want and then go get that

297
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:50,960
Business and also did you see the news that ting got a great rating from Consumer Reports?

298
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:55,560
It's pretty great Linux dot ting comm rate as an understatement there five things

299
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:59,360
You didn't know Google now could do they have a great blog too. They got a ting tip

300
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:04,320
You know that Google now it does all kinds of things look at that. This is really nice. They put all that together

301
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,320
I'm not gonna spoil it for you

302
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:12,360
Also, did you know that Siri can beatbox? Did you know that no? I didn't yeah, let's try it right now. You're ready, okay?

303
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:16,360
This is live every okay. Let's give it a shot. Hey Siri beatbox. Here's

304
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:24,280
One I've been practicing boots and cats and boots and cats and boots and cats and boots and cats and boots

305
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:30,080
Do this all day cats and boots and yeah, no we're good. We're good. You know what so they got the iOS devices

306
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,480
They got the Android devices. They have the feature phones all ranging at different prices

307
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:39,640
No contract you only pay for what you use the devices unlocked including they got the zing back again

308
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:44,200
Which gives you that nice screen that tells you exactly how much data you've used you can manage the Wi-Fi password

309
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,560
It is like what I'll show it to you right now

310
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:52,160
This is like you know you know you know those really crappy my fight devices that have like they're really crappy web interface

311
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:56,360
Oh, you have to wait till they're crappy DHCP server finally gets running to get one of their IP addresses

312
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:01,520
You can log doesn't register host names. It doesn't know so the zing it's all just right here on the touchscreen

313
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:06,360
You get to see the Wi-Fi password. You can change the Wi-Fi password. You can see devices connected. I love it

314
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:11,200
Oh, wow also is connected right there. Yes. Yeah, that's great. They all they offer the karma, too

315
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:17,240
if you want to get on that karma business that go check them out linux.ting.com great devices great plans great people and

316
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,240
big supporters of net neutrality

317
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,260
linux.ting.com and a big thanks to ting for supporting linux unplugged

318
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,760
Linux.ting.com

319
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,640
All right, so first up a couple of things about scale. I want to mention I

320
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:37,920
Had to move the time I had to move the time alone. Yeah, yeah, so we go and set up our meeting and then Cory Doctor

321
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:42,040
Oh, he's like hey. You know what that looks like a great time and day. I'm gonna schedule my you know

322
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,160
Yeah, so he scheduled his keynote for that time

323
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:49,320
So I'm like well, and you know what I really love is like some people in the meeper like I'll still come

324
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,880
I'll skip Cory Doctor's keynote

325
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,400
I'm like oh my god that guy is so cool the one guys like well

326
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:57,240
I could come for like a little bit, and then I could maybe like sneak out, and I'm like no

327
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:01,760
Here's what we're gonna. Do we're gonna change. We're gonna just change it so that way we can all go see Cory Doctor's keynote

328
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:06,040
And instead of doing it really early so a whole bunch of geeks have to get up early after partying at scale

329
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,280
We're gonna do it at lunch

330
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:12,920
and then you can go recruit other folks at lunch and then bring them to the meetup and we'll convert them to the Jupiter

331
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:17,800
Broadcasting way if you're gonna be down in Pasadena at scale go to meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting

332
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,160
We got 21 people going already

333
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:24,040
We're gonna get a power lunch after Cory Doctor's keynote and stuff

334
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:30,120
Yeah, I'm pretty excited about it West so meetup calm slash Jupiter broadcasting if you want to get in on that

335
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,960
You're gonna be there poppy. I added you to the event without even asking you

336
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,960
I went to the meetup when you lost

337
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:45,120
Who do I know that's gonna be down there, and I could give them admin access to this so that way if they need to do

338
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,480
Something smart. I'm like well. I'll add poppy. He's gonna be down there. I trust him

339
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:55,320
Yes, I just lost you in there already like good. That's taking care. That's love. Yeah, you know you got it

340
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:59,320
You got to spread the love. I'm excited. I hope the lunch works out. I hope maybe we can bring a few extra friends

341
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:03,160
You guys gotta show up. I mean you're anywhere near there. Yeah, it's gonna be good one

342
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:06,080
And I don't know exactly how I'm getting there yet any of that's all up

343
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,860
So maybe pick Chris up off the side of the road on your right. I'll be hitchin

344
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:14,360
So I wanted to spend a little minute a couple of minutes here and play an interview

345
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:18,920
From a couple of guys behind the scale effort now. There's a lot of people behind scale

346
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:23,800
but Ilian and Gareth are one of the people are working very hard on bringing scale 14x together and

347
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,600
Noah had a chance to talk with him last week

348
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:30,880
We played a couple of minutes of their interview in the Linux action show and I got a couple of other minutes here

349
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,400
I want to play for you about what's new at scale

350
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:39,400
And what's kind of cool and separating it apart, and I think the context of it is you know things like ubi con check it out

351
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:44,320
So we're one of the things that's happened with scale over the years as we've grown become a bit of a hub for other

352
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,320
communities that want to run their events

353
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,920
in or around us so

354
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,520
for example will be you know the

355
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:55,160
Bun to do the bun to community will be running ubu con

356
00:25:55,720 --> 00:26:02,760
Which is there is going to be their their new user and developer conference here at here at scale this year leading into that

357
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,440
Similarly we have events from the Postgres community the mysql community

358
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,280
DevOps day la so

359
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:12,680
So when you come to scale really you're probably getting about ten events in in one

360
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,680
Which is which is one great thing?

361
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:20,000
So in terms of the keynotes that you mentioned. We've got folks like Cory doctor. Oh will be coming out

362
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,400
mark shuttleworth will be a keynote as well talking about

363
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:30,120
You know how open source fits in it fits in a world of app stores and embedded devices where we don't necessarily

364
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,400
you know have access to the

365
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,960
What we don't necessarily have access to

366
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,560
You know to the source code as we're down from from apps or things like that

367
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:42,960
And how do we make how do we continue to make open source be important in that in that sort of an environment?

368
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,840
And then the last keynote will be Sarah sharp

369
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,880
Talking about diversity in the open source community. She's a

370
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,600
former Linux kernel developer that

371
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:57,840
Has a lot of experience with with some of the challenges of being involved in our open source communities

372
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,480
Yeah, yeah, that's absolutely terrific

373
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:06,360
You know and the other thing that I I always look forward to in addition to the actual keynotes is

374
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:09,200
a lot of the presentations that are given some you know

375
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:15,740
They're not they're not necessarily everyone commuting in one big hall for one big presentation by a well-known name, but sometimes

376
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:21,200
There are really cool presentations. I think it was last year or maybe it was a year before they had a

377
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:27,200
Presentation of 20 Linux commands that you never knew that you needed but once you find out about them

378
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:32,900
They should have been included by default in the distribution and man have I been able to implement some of that stuff

379
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:38,060
Yeah, are there any particular presentations that you personally either of you are looking forward to seeing?

380
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:43,060
Well, I mean going back to what I said before where we started the conference

381
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:47,380
To to be a conference that we wanted to attend

382
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:54,060
I think the ironic thing in that is that most of us never actually get to go to the presentations because we're busy

383
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,420
Running the conference. Yeah. Yep

384
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:03,180
and so but but one of the things that kind of touching on that I'm I'm always excited to see is

385
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:06,420
Are those presentations kind of like what you mentioned?

386
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:09,140
where you

387
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:15,300
it's it's not a presentation that you necessarily or a talk that you necessarily think of a

388
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,140
Head of time they're like, oh, yeah

389
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:23,740
I'd really like to see a presentation on the 20 most commands that I didn't know about exactly. I'm excited about the presentations that

390
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:31,180
Those type of presentations as well as the presentations by speakers that no one has ever heard of yeah because in my experience

391
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:39,140
those always end up being really awesome presentations and the speakers end up becoming like really well-known speakers and and it just it's

392
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:45,060
It makes me feel really good that they got their start at our event. Yeah, right on

393
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:49,600
I'm I I can't tell you how excited I am to come to the conference

394
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:54,260
So now I kind of I've been hogging the mic here for a little bit

395
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:59,180
But West have you ever been to an event like scale before have you ever or have you gone to any kind of big?

396
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:02,580
Linux convention where there's a lot of people coming in I went to scale once

397
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:06,700
Oh you do you so I have been I tell you what I have been avoiding scale

398
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:10,320
I've mentioned this before I've been avoiding scale from the very beginning just because it's you know

399
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:14,300
Some of these some of the events they get too big and then I feel like I don't want to go to them anymore

400
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:17,220
I'm kind of curious to see where they walk the line on this one

401
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:22,060
But I'm maybe maybe next year. Maybe next year. We both go down. That sounds great. Wouldn't that be fun?

402
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,580
That'd be really cool. And yeah

403
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:31,220
So I hope to see you guys there at scale anybody in the mummer room any other any poppy anybody have any

404
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:35,360
I've just had an email from one of the organizers saying that my talk has been accepted

405
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:41,580
A thing that I developed with Stuart language

406
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:42,020
I

407
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:47,460
Kind of bought thing that we developed and it's quite cool and I wanted to talk about it and how we developed it now

408
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:49,460
We did it in the community. Well

409
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:53,540
That's awesome. Very nice. Very nice. You know, they rejected that Alan Jude

410
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:59,740
Yeah, he had a time. Well, rightly so yeah, I know you want to talk about BSD BSD get that guy out of here

411
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:03,140
So Linux Expo get him out of here. They can have a booth. Yeah

412
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:09,380
Yeah, my here's my here would be my perfect scenario and I think I'm gonna do this at Linux fest Northwest

413
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:15,780
Oh, I would be to park the rover outside the event and then just like have people come out like, you know

414
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:16,620
Meet them on the ground be like, yeah

415
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:21,580
Well, you come out to this location in the parking lot at this time and just do the interview there cryptic GPS cord

416
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:24,540
It'd be amazing. Yeah, like a scavenger hunt

417
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,660
Okay, now we're into it

418
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:28,060
Okay

419
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:32,700
so if we could do like a scavenger hunt where you could get little clues and they'd they'd walk around the event and then end up

420
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,700
At the rover and then do an interview on JV

421
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:39,940
That would be amazing, especially if we could have like GoPros mountain like key locations, right? Okay

422
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:44,060
Well, maybe in the future one day we can dream big. You never know we dream now

423
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:48,100
Maybe in a few years we can achieve the seeds of the future. These are the seeds

424
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:51,660
Okay, so it's time for us to talk about remix OS

425
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:59,460
Remix I'm gonna be honest. I didn't I didn't think they'd do it when I saw the when I saw the announcement

426
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,340
I didn't even cover it as news

427
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:06,080
Because I'm like, oh, come on. This is nothing. They got some crappy ARM based PC. That's too slow

428
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:11,140
And I'm not interested in that and then they are gonna

429
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:16,780
Supposedly release an ISO at some time in the future. When can I actually see this? Okay

430
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:21,260
Yeah, let me know when the code ships and then we'll actually talk about it. Well today the code shipped

431
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:25,660
Yeah, and they were at CES. They had a booth Wow giving demos

432
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,340
So we're gonna cover all of that

433
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:32,980
Remix OS is a desktop operating system based on Android

434
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,860
and the idea is

435
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:38,260
To turn Android into a desktop

436
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:41,240
productivity

437
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,220
platform

438
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:47,660
So instead of just content consumption, right you can do content creation. So they're introducing windowing

439
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:54,620
They're introducing file managers and things like this a launch bar and a menu all these people you're gonna will show you more about it

440
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:56,620
And they're calling it remix OS

441
00:31:56,620 --> 00:32:01,980
You know the idea would be it's a it's a serious contender to something like Chrome OS or

442
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:08,700
Even perhaps the Linux desktop itself itself. Yeah, so before we get into that, I'm gonna mention Linux Academy

443
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:14,980
Love Linux Academy. This has been something really fun to watch throughout 2015 is to see them grow and they're not done in 2016

444
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:17,060
In fact coming up on the 14th. They've got a big event

445
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:23,540
It's got they got some announcements you can tune in and find out Linux Academy is a great platform to learn about all the technologies

446
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:25,540
around Linux and Linux itself

447
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:27,540
Start by going to linuxacademy.com

448
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:33,060
Unplugged that supports the show keeps us going. Let's Linux Academy know you heard about it here

449
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:39,600
They have so much to learn and and even if you've been using Linux forever

450
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:41,340
There's so much good stuff

451
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:48,300
Like not only are you gonna appreciate the fact that people just truly enthusiastic compassionate about this are putting together putting together a great system

452
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:54,220
But as somebody who has like a pretty good sense of what's up and coming in the Linux world

453
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:58,440
I'm pretty damn impressed with what they've been able to turn around into great courseware and content

454
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,500
They have over

455
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,500
2,000 courses with video

456
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:09,180
instructor help is available downloadable comprehensive study guides distros all up the wazoo you can choose from and the courseware adjust to that

457
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:15,240
Virtual servers you SSH into they spin up on-demand as part of the courseware. I gotta say it again instructor

458
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,240
Help is available when you need it. I

459
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:22,860
Really think this is a platform you should check out. I would say to like if you've been stuck in a spot for a while

460
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,140
you

461
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:28,580
Need to kind of see what interests you you want to kind of see what direction you want to go to this is a safe

462
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:34,620
Playground because they have graded server exercises while you're working on the system. You're gonna get real-time information and feedback

463
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:38,220
That's gonna give you a sense of where your strengths are pretty quickly

464
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:43,740
We just keep seeing success stories of people who've gotten the job after studying at Linux Academy

465
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:46,500
You know there's a lot of interest in this area

466
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:50,900
Yeah, if you can show that you you know through something like Linux Academy that you're a competent

467
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:54,340
Yeah, that is a nice thing to as Linux Academy is a rising star

468
00:33:54,420 --> 00:34:00,340
You you rise with them people in the industry know it already. Yeah, they have some really neat technology

469
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:05,340
Their scenario based labs are pretty unique the fact that they're following the technologies that they are following are great

470
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:08,020
You know their nugget system for when you don't have a lot of time

471
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:11,300
You just want to deep dive into a single topic it makes a lot of sense

472
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:18,380
They were on top they had some of the first and best content on openstack before anybody else because when that was becoming a huge

473
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:23,120
Thing like well this is obvious right you know I know same thing with Docker right the same thing with a lot of the technologies

474
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:27,060
Built around Linux now and including AWS that entire infrastructure I

475
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:31,180
Really like it, and they've got some great stuff coming up. Just around the corner

476
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:36,460
They're gonna announce on the 14th go to Linux Academy comm slash unplugged. You'll get our discount. That's the big thing

477
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:38,460
But also you support this show

478
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:45,260
This is a really solid platform, and if I worked in a job where my educator paid for like a little bit of oh

479
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:48,620
Right or why my employer paid for a little bit of education

480
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:53,660
Oh, man that like when I when I had when I was when I worked for somebody else a lot of times

481
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:56,300
I was just here's the budget first for self education

482
00:34:56,340 --> 00:35:01,120
You know they can take online courses I could go to like a to a local you know a college

483
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:06,660
But this is a great option. This is a really great option so Linux Academy comm slash unplugged

484
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:09,700
Stay up to date on current technologies, too

485
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:12,340
That's what's really cool about it is you can get all the current stuff

486
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:18,660
Experts were really passionate about it instructor help available on-demand and you support this show holy smokes

487
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:24,840
That's a win-win-win Linux Academy comm slash unplugged so remix OS

488
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:29,460
I've been kicking the tires a little bit anybody in the mumble room tried remix OS

489
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:33,100
Yep, all right, okay, okay, so

490
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:38,420
Installing right now all right well before we talk about it

491
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:42,700
Let me set up a little bit about remix OS and they have a they have a video here to do that for us

492
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,700
So yeah, what's up?

493
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:49,820
This is this is at CES. He takes a thumb drive. He plugs it into a Dell PC

494
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:55,780
We're here at CES 2016, and we're really excited to announce remix OS for PCs

495
00:35:55,940 --> 00:36:01,660
It's a project a collaborative project between Android x86 and ourselves and on January 12th

496
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:05,420
It'll be available for free download globally, so let's take a look

497
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:10,060
Oh, this is the guest mode resident mode selection screen one saves no data

498
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:15,540
That's a guest mode and the other saves all your data and apps. That's the resident mode, so let's go in and check it out

499
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:22,500
On the 12th when you download you're going to get two files. What is an iso file one is an exe file?

500
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:25,940
You're going to plug in a usb drive to a PC of your choice

501
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:32,260
And you're going to run the exe file load the iso file into that program and then install it onto a usb drive

502
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,460
all right, so we've done that and

503
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:38,780
Probably what were your first thoughts when you had tried it out, and what did you try it on I?

504
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:47,500
Don't know I tried in a VM. I I didn't want to dedicate a machine to this. Yeah, that's what I did here

505
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:55,300
I've I've tried Android x86 on you know various machines in the past, and I thought I'd give this a go, but

506
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:57,940
two things kind of threw me

507
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:00,460
one

508
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:05,320
I'm guessing you've tried it. Have you read the end user license agreement? No, I didn't that was I've not gotten there

509
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:11,440
That's not the first thing I did. Yeah, I'm guessing yeah, I'm guessing most people would you probably want to read it?

510
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:15,380
It's interesting and some of it is probably copy and pasted from

511
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:20,760
Somewhere else and you can guess where from if I read you three lines from the EULA if that's okay. Yeah

512
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:28,080
You agree that you irrevocably waive any and all ownership legal and moral rights to your user content

513
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:34,240
How's that sounds like that sounds like they got it from Google, right? Okay? This one will give you a better clue

514
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:40,420
You're also not allowed to oppose the basic principles determined in the Constitution of the People's Republic of China

515
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:46,820
Harm its national honor or interests or undermine its national religious policy promoting cults and superstitions

516
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:52,600
What you're not allowed to spread rumor disturb social order or undermine social stability

517
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:57,000
Okay, so that's a little odd. Yeah

518
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,160
Those are my favorite things to do

519
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:03,000
Well, I mean you're outside China

520
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,560
So, you know good luck People's Republic of China for enforcing those rules on those of us in the free West

521
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:11,000
But if you did any of those things and then you went to China

522
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,600
Might have a bit of a problem, huh?

523
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:17,880
Don't go to China Chris. So yeah, cuz yeah, I definitely can't go to China

524
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:22,840
So I've done all of those just in the last ten minutes. That sounds like a copy-pasta little thing, right? I mean, that's gotta be

525
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:28,720
There's other Chinese companies that have that the Xiaomi phone company have it like right there on their website

526
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,640
It's pretty much the same kind of thing

527
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:36,160
But that yeah, that's what you get because they're you know, at least part Chinese company that side

528
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,160
I did try it in a VM and

529
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:42,720
You have to be you know, because it's Android and it's not a general purpose PC OS

530
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,320
You have to be very specific about the hardware that you give it

531
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,520
You know, it doesn't work on every PC is a general purpose, but yeah

532
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,920
There are drivers missing so you have to be you have to tweak it a little bit in virtual box

533
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,920
for example, but it does boot and

534
00:38:56,080 --> 00:39:01,400
It it's very it's very unlike Android in that it's it's got

535
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:07,520
Windows for things like settings I went to the settings screen and I was expecting to get smacked in the face with the usual full

536
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:14,240
Screen and right now settings. Yeah, but no it looked like you know, no more solace or something like that

537
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,760
It looked like a normal modern desktop operating system

538
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,960
And you know, I fiddled around with some of the settings and some of it works

539
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,960
Some of it didn't I went to get a Google Play

540
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,960
APK

541
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:28,320
Because it doesn't ship with Google Play. It doesn't have Chrome or anything. It's got you know, none of the official apps

542
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:32,800
So I went to get the Google Play APK and that wouldn't install

543
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:39,000
In their videos they have the play they do have the place to end Chrome installed, right?

544
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,800
So they put that on it's not on the ISO

545
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:46,320
Yeah, I did try installing it, but it wouldn't open but I didn't give it a huge amount of time, you know

546
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,520
Yeah, if I may step in here. Yeah

547
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:56,800
So I installed it and there is in fact a semi-official version with GF's and I created a USB

548
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:00,360
USB stick out of it and it's running bleeding

549
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:04,400
How did you where did you find that? Is that not part of the regular loader? I

550
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:12,160
I logged into the free node remix OS channel, which is semi-official also and so there were some leaking images

551
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:18,120
But on the official server and there is a version from yesterday that comes with GF's installed

552
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,040
so I

553
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:25,960
Made an USB stick out of it and used it on an AC Chromebook and I was pretty successful

554
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:30,760
So it's bleeding fast. I played Star Wars Angry Birds on it. I was watching live TV

555
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:36,320
Yeah, so so it's there is some potential in this really there is some potential

556
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:42,760
Yeah, there are there are definitely some Android apps. I wouldn't mind having on my on my desktop

557
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:47,440
And you know, you've got you've got some other nice serious applications. So

558
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,680
Before we go on they were at CES and here's a there's also it

559
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:56,640
So there's a hardware component to this as well and a little more information about the project, too

560
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,840
Hello everybody

561
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:05,840
Welcome to the remix OS CES 2016 booth for all the people who couldn't make it but really wanted to be here

562
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,840
I wanted to give you guys

563
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:11,840
Inside look to what our booth looks like and what we're doing at our booth

564
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:15,600
Okay, and they actually when you watch this video, they actually seem like kind of neat people

565
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:22,040
They can think I'm passionate. Yeah about this. So here we are at CES International 2016

566
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:27,320
It's a remix OS booth again, and we've got a few of our team members right now

567
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:30,560
Showing off our product lines as you can see

568
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:36,480
This is the end of the day here at CES, but it's still relatively busy at our booth. So let's take a look

569
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:41,640
Yeah, I don't mind him

570
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,960
Jeff behind the counter right now. He's actually showing off

571
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:50,680
This is the mini which a lot of you already have you know and love if you don't love it

572
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:52,680
right us, but that's that support and

573
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:57,840
This is the mini in action right here on this screen. We've been showing it off at the booth

574
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:02,680
It's been getting really well reception here at the show if you move on down the line

575
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:09,440
This is Owen works with us on PO and what you see here is a very exciting project

576
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:12,040
Let's keep going down and I'm going to show you this project right here

577
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:21,080
So here at the show one of the biggest announcements we're making is this this is the remix

578
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:28,980
I like that there. I like that. They're also just being really upfront. We're working with Android x86 to do this

579
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:32,200
I think that's kind of cool. What it is is we've worked in

580
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,360
collaboration with the Android x86 team

581
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:43,040
Put remakes OS on top of Android x86 and allows remakes OS to boot from any Intel or AMD

582
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
chip PC

583
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,520
Tower

584
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:53,360
Laptops and about 60% of them out in the market or out in the world will work with this

585
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:56,080
ISO file so

586
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:58,120
And so it's a 40%

587
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:02,520
It's a pretty that's a pretty you basically have to have you know let some legacy USB support and things like that

588
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:06,880
But I don't know. I think it's it's interesting that you law obviously leaves me a little concerned

589
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:14,280
But if I could install G apps or gaps on this thing and I could have chrome and I could have Netflix and Plex

590
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,880
Might be kind of compelling

591
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:22,800
So when it comes to chrome chrome is working without problems so at least with the USB stick

592
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,800
And it's easy to create one you just

593
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:31,520
Download unit boot in from the repos and then you can create your stick. You don't even lose your data on your stick

594
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,640
It's just some persistent image files

595
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:38,760
So you get a system image a data image and so on and they're persistent image for your data

596
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:45,640
So the rest of the data that you have still have on the USB this the old daughter is stays on the disk

597
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:50,840
So it's really cool. Hope you. What do you think about the fact that they're they're essentially promising convergence

598
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:56,280
They're promising a desktop operating system that works with touch or the keyboard and they're saying whichever one you want to use

599
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:58,600
Do you think it's possible to deliver it in this type of?

600
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:02,720
It'll windowed system. Yeah, you know, it'll be

601
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:08,160
As you'd expect Android to be on a on a desktop, you know with some modifications

602
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:11,160
I think one of the problems they'll be is they're constantly chasing

603
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:18,320
Google because you know IO has just been announced is going to be in May and they'll be talking about the next version of Android

604
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:21,720
And so x8 Android x86 is always a little way behind

605
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:27,520
Upstream and so they're constantly chasing Android and part of that means that they've got to keep forward porting all of their work

606
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:33,280
So if they can keep that momentum going and they have enough contributors to

607
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:39,080
Keep their stuff working then. Yeah, they could they could end up having an interesting converged device

608
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:41,480
There's a lot of Android games. I mean

609
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:46,280
You know right there this could be an interesting desktop for some people. I don't know

610
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:48,280
Yeah, imagine imagine putting that on a desktop

611
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:56,040
Yeah, yeah, and imagine doing it maybe at a school, right where you don't want to necessarily be cooked up to Google apps and Chrome

612
00:44:56,680 --> 00:45:01,680
But you want to take advantage of all the development and applications and the fact that a lot of people you're hiring are gonna know

613
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:07,680
How to write Android apps. I think they're gonna have to be a little bit careful. I mean you can see why they've not

614
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:09,760
Put a public

615
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:14,200
URL up there with all the Google apps in there, but you know giving it away on IRC

616
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:19,520
And you know done it kind of under the table kind of thing so that you know Google aren't gonna come after them

617
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:23,880
Which you know if they if they started doing that kind of publicly then Google would come after them

618
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:26,680
And that's something they've got to worry about they've got to have a you know

619
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:32,200
Or they build a relationship with Google and start doing it properly rather than you know

620
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:37,320
Based off of a OSP right? Yeah, that'd be a big indicator. See what happens, huh? Yeah

621
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:40,680
And hopefully they don't go the way a sign engine mod and start integrating with Google

622
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:47,000
Yeah, and hopefully they don't go the way a sign engine mod and start integrating Microsoft through all the OS like that's been happening lately

623
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:53,240
Cortana and like you can now you can you can get Microsoft services. It's just all over

624
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:57,960
It's just really great. They give a shot. They give a shout out to Ubuntu on there on their page, too

625
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:02,640
So anyways if you're out there tried remix OS let us know what you think Linux action showed at reddit.com

626
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:07,120
Anybody else in the mumble room and trying it or have any other thoughts they want to share about remix OS

627
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:09,800
remix

628
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:14,100
Remix OS. No, I did happen to just notice that they're already on

629
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:16,680
2.0 on the latest ones. Oh

630
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:23,960
Oh 2.0. Yeah, and at a booth at CES that suggests some funding. Don't you think it's a serious project?

631
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:29,000
Yeah, that's not a cheap thing pull off. Yeah, so that's and they're also touting the performance

632
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,960
They say we beat we've benchmarked remix OS performance using remix OS

633
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:37,160
For PCs against some of the best Android hardware in the biz and quite honestly nothing comes close

634
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:40,160
So they're running they show this benchmark here. This is so funny

635
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:44,680
This they show this benchmark here of remix OS for the PC running on an i7

636
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:50,840
4790 quad core up against a galaxy 5 note and a galaxy s6 and it just

637
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:56,060
It is just like it's not even in the same dimension. It's so much. I 7 is so much faster

638
00:46:56,060 --> 00:47:00,080
Well, yeah, you think I guess the point is you could run your Android apps on a really fast machine

639
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:04,820
That would be kind of interesting. Yeah, but yeah, I could see installing this for like

640
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:09,540
a grandparent or something if they you know, they're already familiar maybe with Android on a tablet

641
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:12,280
Oh, I see the Internet is already beginning to gripe about the EULA

642
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:16,100
So the issues about the EULA have yeah, look at that, you know

643
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:19,140
I did see the EULA come up first thing when I when I loaded it

644
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:24,200
Harming national honor and interest national honor boy

645
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:29,220
That's will be played back to you in a Chinese court in like three years Chris. That is a loose definition this day

646
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:36,760
Yeah, well, what do they do about security updates? I don't know. That's a very good thing about Android

647
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:44,560
On your Nexus devices getting a regular cadence of security updates a week. I mean obviously this is an alpha

648
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:48,560
So it's completely unsupported and there will be no security updates, which is fair enough as you'd expect

649
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:54,000
But I'd be interested to know what the future holds and what their plans are for delivering

650
00:47:54,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Delivering updates to all those, you know PC users, right? Yes, but it sounds like they have the operating system fairly separated out from user

651
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,840
Data and so then they maybe they have something in mind that will be fairly manageable

652
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:11,640
They don't know. Yeah, I have to wait and see you know, so here we are

653
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:14,240
We're towards the end of the show when we were towards the end of the second

654
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:20,040
Vertex IPA and I gotta say I mean, I'm glad you brought it, but I'm not loving the aftertaste

655
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:23,560
Either that's kind of disappointed. It's a little it's a little dank of my mouth

656
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:29,320
Yeah, right now. I feel like I'm gonna need a couple of cups of a couple glasses of water after this would not buy again

657
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:33,720
Yeah, that's too bad. I'd like to like the bot. I mean the can is yeah

658
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:37,000
It's got a good design on there. The dude's got a flag. He's got a nice hat. I like that

659
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:40,800
Very nice seemed like it was made with care. Yeah. Yeah

660
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:43,720
6.3 percent, huh?

661
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:45,480
Where did you pick this up?

662
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:50,520
Hagan, okay. Well, there you go. You know, Hagan's got a good selection. It was a good try. It was a good solid try

663
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:54,800
I mean, I'm better next week. I would I would also pick that one if I can't I don't think you can really be blamed

664
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,920
Okay, yeah. Thank you. All right

665
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:02,320
well, so we have an interesting thread that West found this week is like I think we got to talk about this on the show and

666
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,960
I answer kind of agree and I wonder if I want to challenge the premise a little bit too

667
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:15,000
But before we get to that good talk about digital ocean do the big do and use the promo code do unplugged all one word

668
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,160
lowercase

669
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:18,160
Guess what ten dollar credit? Whoa?

670
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:24,200
Linux rigs up in the cloud y'all on-demand less than 55 seconds

671
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:32,160
$5 a month you get 512 megabytes of RAM a 20 gigabyte SSD one CPU and a terabyte of transfer a

672
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:35,920
Terabyte of transfer over digital ocean comm and if you use the promo code do unplugged

673
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:42,400
$10 credit you can try that $5 rig two months for free and they've got data center locations in New York, San Francisco

674
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:47,120
Singapore Amsterdam London Germany and children with Alan Jude up in Toronto

675
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:50,280
Hey, hey, yeah, yeah, I think he just stops in there from time to time

676
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:54,280
Yeah, I don't know for sure, but really what I like about digital ocean

677
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:57,680
Well, I mean, I don't know why nobody else can figure this out

678
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:03,400
But boy his digital ocean got just a huge head start on everybody so yeah, they've got SSDs. That's brilliant

679
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:06,180
They would just you know they got in on that super early before any other

680
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:10,240
Provider out there was willing to spend the money, so they totally leveraged that

681
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:16,560
I think they were brilliant in the fact that they jumped on KVM and started building their product around KVM way before other vendors

682
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:21,640
Were willing to consider KVM now. They're just introducing KVM as a feature right, but they're struggling

683
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:27,320
They're struggling to keep up, and then they brought it all together with the incredible interface over digital ocean

684
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:29,880
It's very simple very intuitive and very powerful

685
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:34,760
It lets you destroy machines deploy machines one-click application deployments of an entire stacks

686
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:42,120
Or you know you want like you want everything from Ubuntu Apache and a blogging platform in a single click boom

687
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:45,560
It all gets deployed for you, or maybe you just want the base operating system

688
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:52,080
They've got a bunch of great distributions you get to choose from Ubuntu CentOS Debian Fedora core OS and even free BSD

689
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:54,560
one-click applications you can deploy

690
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:57,120
fantastic tutorials and

691
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:01,680
Incredible prices go to digital ocean comm and use the promo code do unplugged

692
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:07,880
And see why it's been my Linux infrastructure on-demand whenever I need it. I mean really at five dollars a month

693
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:12,680
There's almost nothing. I won't spin up on a digital ocean droplet, so I got an idea Chris

694
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:18,000
Yeah, so sometimes. I just don't have a great route somewhere. You know Comcast. It's everyone's on Comcast

695
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,680
Oh, and I get frustrated. Maybe I'm talking to Europe the worst you know maybe

696
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:25,360
Last number last Tuesday's you're having all kinds of issues all kinds of issues

697
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:30,000
Yes, right, but so what I do when I'm thinking maybe a script with their api's

698
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,360
There's a need you spin up a DO droplet. Whatever is closest to you. I don't you could probably figure that

699
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:39,360
I do the same friend myself. Yeah, and then SSH. Did you know you can spin up a tunnel interface?

700
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:43,840
Oh, yeah, and have SSH provide IP transit. Yeah, so you just you spin that right?

701
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:48,280
Oh, yeah, and then BAM you route everything through your have done that make a new. Oh, yeah

702
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:53,920
I have I have legitimately done that when we've had Comcast issues. Yeah, so what I'm just saying

703
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:57,720
There's other things in like Amsterdam that you might be in London

704
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:00,120
I'm saying there might be a reason why you want to be located in London

705
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:00,920
I'm not saying what it is

706
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:05,600
But or if you're in London and all of a sudden it'd be really useful to be located in New York or Singapore or?

707
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:10,840
Or Toronto or maybe San Francisco digital ocean makes it that easy it does for five dollars a month

708
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:14,160
And if you use the promo code do unplug to get it two months for free so a big

709
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:18,080
Thank you digital ocean for sponsoring the Linux unplug program you guys are the rock source

710
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:20,240
All right

711
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:26,560
So what do you do when you keep getting the geek squad treatment? He says I'm an IT manager for a website

712
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:30,760
I manage developers and perform a lot of hands-on activities to work. I'm not really a hardware tech anymore

713
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:38,520
However friends and family rarely make the decision or I'm sorry distinction when their tablet or their laptop or their desktop is broken

714
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:44,480
And they often ask me for help obviously without any compensation as a matter of gentlemanly discourse

715
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:49,200
I never ask for technical professional help for many of my friends or family if I do which isn't often

716
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:53,480
I pay in exchange for the favor immediately or simply ask for instructions

717
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:56,720
I also don't intrude on their personal time or expect anything inside a schedule

718
00:52:57,080 --> 00:53:00,980
Call these my I call these my golden rules of personal professional exchange

719
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:06,140
But for some time now certain family members and close friends have mistakenly begun to treat me like the geek squad

720
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:11,040
Except without pain and certainly just as insistent and impolite as one of their customers

721
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:15,280
I don't mind helping and I don't understand their frustration and I and I understand their frustration

722
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:21,040
But it started to chat me a little bit people get snippy when I don't feel like helping and they rely on me during

723
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:26,960
outside hours quote-unquote which cuts into my personal time and weirdly enough blame me for their troubles as

724
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:34,240
If I'm the one getting their pet hair into their desktop overheating their altar book while gaming from the comfort of their comforter or

725
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:38,000
clicking pop-ups I shouldn't from an insurance browser from an insecure browser or

726
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:44,400
I'm the one who invited they're breaking breaking out their phone and breaking their gorilla glass do I seem better

727
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:50,640
Maybe anyways here's the question has anyone found a polite quick sensitive way to immediately shut down friends and family

728
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:56,920
When they ask you to be the geek squad I have really found a foolproof rejection anti rejection method

729
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:00,720
And I was wondering when we look at this

730
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:06,560
What our mumble room and what West thinks because a lot of us probably get called in as the technical support?

731
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:08,720
I imagine in this audience. I know I certainly do

732
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:13,480
In fact you know and I because I know my mom's not gonna listen to this

733
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:18,860
I just call her out so this last Sunday after the Linux action show okay

734
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:23,040
Oh, I should back up even further so about a week ago. My mom messages me

735
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:28,960
She says who do you use for hosting and I respond digital ocean right right and I'm like what is my mom care, right?

736
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:37,560
And then like the next day my mom replies to me. Oh, I see they support HTML, and I'm like oh my god

737
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:43,800
Yeah, mom. They support HTML after you deploy the Linux server you set up the Apache web server and then

738
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:49,280
You can like or you like to the one click Apple app deployment, but like might mean open mom's not

739
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:52,800
No, I'm not following exactly what needs to happen here, and so I'm like mom

740
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:57,080
I'm not sure so sure you understand, so then she messages me like a couple of days ago

741
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:59,720
Well, I would like to see you this weekend when can we can we get together?

742
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:00,760
And I tell her well

743
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:03,680
I have a little bit of time after I'm done with the Linux action show on Sunday

744
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:07,720
But you know really like I just got done with the show what I would like to do is relax

745
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:12,680
I would like your little bit of weekend. Yeah, like I got like a couple hours left on this Sunday

746
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:15,040
There's a couch over there man. That sounds good

747
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:15,520
No

748
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:19,760
So mom wants to come up and she wants to consult with me on her new business endeavors website

749
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:23,720
And it doesn't really there's not like a lot of discussion about like how busy I've been

750
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:29,200
Or the fact that I'm prepping to go to scale trying to get a new running business running my own business

751
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,760
It was my daughter's birthday

752
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:36,400
It was also an anniversary and then on top of all of that like I'm doing the show this weekend like there was no consideration

753
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:41,000
There's not really like I don't really have a good way to say sorry mom like I know this is important to you

754
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:45,040
But I also have a life like I don't really know how to have that have you ever been in a position like that

755
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:47,440
Yeah, definitely. I mean you know that's

756
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:50,180
There's a big there's just some users that

757
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:55,840
They don't understand like because you have the ability that ergo you are you are obligated to help

758
00:55:55,840 --> 00:56:00,160
It's not yeah, it's not placing value on your time and sometimes you just have to tell people that

759
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:04,840
Marks, do you think it's weird to get into the discussion of monetary exchange for these things?

760
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:11,240
I'm not sure about monetary exchange when it comes to family, but maybe some sort of like-for-like thing because you know

761
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:15,840
Say you've got a fat. Yeah, so your sister's a nurse you might ask her to you know

762
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:20,640
Take a look at your foot when it's if you've got something wrong with it, and you wouldn't well

763
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:25,800
I mean obviously your your health system is different of course we wouldn't pay for for something like that over here, but

764
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:28,600
you know why if

765
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:33,160
If you've got if you've got a family member who has a profession and you'd you'd be

766
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:38,680
Expect them or not necessarily expect them ask them to help you out with something based on their knowledge, then yeah sure

767
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:42,480
Maybe you doing tech support for them for free isn't a big deal

768
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:48,440
Here is my current excuse and this is why I couldn't get out of the one with my mom because I got a go-to

769
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:50,440
that's pretty solid and

770
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:52,960
Because if they are willing to take me up on it

771
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:57,200
I'm willing to commit and my go-to is you know I switched away from Linux

772
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:03,880
After Windows XP, and I don't really know Windows anymore. I'm a Linux user and so if you want to switch to Linux

773
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:07,240
I can help you with that and if they do it if they buy it. I'm like all right. I'll commit to that

774
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:12,320
Yeah, I like I don't mind, but when it comes to server hosting stuff like what what do I say? Yeah? Well?

775
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:18,560
Sorry mom. I used to support ground there like it's it's not like you give her some tips on server administration

776
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:24,360
Yeah, no now you're administering her server. Yeah, yeah, yeah, poppy everybody in your family must know you work for a technology company

777
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:28,160
Yeah, poppy everybody in your family must know you work for a technology company you must get this

778
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:35,480
Yeah, so there's a couple of things like my brother is completely non-technical. He's a hairdresser. I can't cut my own hair

779
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:37,680
He cuts my hair. I saw his computers out

780
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:42,860
So is that there's a as Mark said if there's someone in your family who can do something so that that seems reasonable to me

781
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:46,400
however I I

782
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:52,080
Can't say no to my mom right and I couldn't say no to my mother-in-law in fact

783
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:57,080
Well, you've been on air my mother-in-law has has pinned me on Facebook and said hey

784
00:57:57,080 --> 00:58:00,620
That new hard drive is arrived for me to do time machine backups on my Mac

785
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:05,660
But the box says it needs formatting for a Mac, and I'm my reply was yeah

786
00:58:05,660 --> 00:58:06,240
Well, that's fine

787
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:11,320
Do you want me to help because she's my mother-in-law and she will cook me roast dinners. There is that?

788
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:18,060
That is an exchange. I'm willing to go down with and the flipside and also point out. She is your mom dude

789
00:58:18,060 --> 00:58:23,000
No, I'm helping her. I'm helping her, but I'm telling you like I do I feel like I get roped into this stuff now

790
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,680
The mom one is a difficult one. Yes, but you must have this with the family too, right?

791
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:30,080
I mean they everybody must be aware of what you do. They must be where your technical guy

792
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:33,280
yeah, and

793
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:39,320
Ubuntu Marte was the solution to that problem so like yourself you get these questions about you know

794
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:46,320
Well some of the so on my wife's side of the family all of all of those got migrated to Ubuntu

795
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:47,600
versus

796
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:51,280
X so a long time ago and on my side of the family

797
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:55,320
They've been a little bit more resistance, and I played the same card. Oh well

798
00:58:55,320 --> 00:59:00,160
You know I haven't used Windows for years. You know I stopped using Linux that Windows a long long time ago

799
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:03,320
I really don't know how it works and then

800
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:07,880
On my wife's side of the family they were still running 10-0 for

801
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:11,680
that was getting quite out of date and

802
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:18,360
We tried some of things and then Ubuntu Marte sort of got created to sort of support them so now

803
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:25,900
My solution to this problem is basically you spend 20 years using and learning Linux you then create a Linux distribution

804
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:29,720
You then form a hardware partnership with a local hardware company

805
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:34,800
When your family say they need help you say go to this website buy this computer

806
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:37,600
And it comes pre-installed and I never have to do anything

807
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:44,560
Unfortunately the length you really have to go to yeah, and it sounds it sounds sarcastic

808
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:49,400
But it's true because three of my family have now bought computers from Entroware and I've had them

809
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:57,360
Shipped pre-installed with Ubuntu Marte, and I haven't had to be involved go round there. It just works, so it's paid off

810
00:59:57,720 --> 00:59:59,720
Yeah

811
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:05,760
And didn't you also buy and set up routers for all of your family I did yes, yeah, that's a good move

812
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:10,840
That is a good move. That is a flash them all with gargoyle. Yeah, I think that's I think that's something

813
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:12,320
I'm going to be doing to

814
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:14,320
the drawback to this approach is

815
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:19,920
Every month there are 10,000 other people who I don't know on the internet that are now all demanding

816
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:24,720
There is that problem, but you could think of them as extended family testers. They're testing

817
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:29,180
They're a new group of friends. I didn't have a year ago, so it's all good

818
01:00:29,180 --> 01:00:34,160
Yeah, I had like I think I mentioned a few weeks ago. I had a successful switch over the holidays

819
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:40,480
I was out. I went somewhere. I didn't even have an internet connection when I did it and I had an Ubuntu Marte

820
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:44,280
This is bragging rights. No internet. No internet connection

821
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:48,320
And I had I had I already had a flash to a thumb drive because I actually used my laptop bag to pack my clothes

822
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:51,040
And if I took the laptop out and I put my clothes in there

823
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:54,880
But I I left my front thing that has all my thumb drives loaded cuz like I'm not gonna unload all that crap

824
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:58,140
No, and that's always like I got there the guy was having problems with Windows 8 one

825
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:01,920
He was thinking about getting a Mac and it's like try this and so

826
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:04,680
Da-da-da-da. Mm-hmm. It worked out pretty good. It was a good success

827
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:11,920
It was like hey, I had a I had a Linux switch story over the holidays. That's amazing. Yeah, so I agree there is

828
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:17,800
two solutions that I feel pretty good about when it's your mom or your mother-in-law or

829
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:22,400
Or if you give them a switch to Linux, those are the conditions in which you should support them

830
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:25,320
I think it but here's the thing remember we can also be ambassadors

831
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:32,000
We can be ambassadors to these people in times of need. So if you have the emotional capacity, I encourage you to the option

832
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,560
Yeah, I mean it's all on you got to check with yourself

833
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:37,800
You got an ABC always be checking before you commit

834
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:42,440
But I'm just saying if you can you could be an ambassador to the open-source world

835
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:50,080
It's an opportunity to switch or at least get them started on maybe moving from Outlook to Thunderbird or from Internet Explorer to Firefox

836
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:51,600
Right. There's so many different ways

837
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:56,080
You can sometimes solve problems like if they're having a malware issue on their Windows box get them going with Firefox

838
01:01:56,080 --> 01:02:00,160
And that gets them started on the path and then down the road the switch is a lot easier

839
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:02,000
I also have to say the article do you touch on this?

840
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:08,840
But if you get some sort of beverage or delicious food item in exchange that sometimes can work out as well. Yeah

841
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:14,160
and a bit like you've just said the the other good one is I

842
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:21,480
think the non-technical people in the family are becoming more aware of the

843
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:24,940
security implications of running older Windows

844
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:27,160
operating systems

845
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:32,660
So what I've started doing is saying here's a USB stick that boots Linux

846
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:36,680
When you need to do your online banking or your online shopping

847
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:38,700
use this

848
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:44,920
Because it's secure and it will forget everything that you've just done when you unplug

849
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:48,300
Ah, so it's like Linux on training wheels because you're just doing it for a little bit

850
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:54,760
You're just using it for some web browsing stuff and it's for your important stuff to be secure

851
01:02:54,760 --> 01:03:00,800
Yeah, yeah, and and that sort of makes them think oh, you know, this is just like any other computer, right?

852
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:06,200
This isn't complicated. This isn't daunting and it's just a little sort of you know taster

853
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:10,720
That's actually really smart because then later on when they want to move on you'd be like, you know

854
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:14,880
That operating system you've been used for all your really important stuff. Why don't you choose that all the time, right?

855
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:18,640
And it's like oh, well, yeah, I trust that. Yeah, I like it. Oh

856
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:25,080
That is some that is some like level two like psychological switcher stuff right there. I like it

857
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:27,760
Yeah

858
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:32,640
Pocket Casey in the chat room asked if I when I have time what I love to he'd love to see a little coverage of the

859
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:38,400
Tink talk that would be really that would be very interesting. So pocket Casey if you could tweet me the day of that talk

860
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:41,920
You could be the ambassador of that talk if you want and remind me while I'm there

861
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:45,480
I'll try to do it, but tell ask me now. There's no way I can remember but I would like to see that one

862
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:49,960
Yeah, I would as well because I didn't even hear about tink until West came along start talking

863
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:56,340
Linux action show dot reddit dot com. That's the subreddit you go to to submit content to this show or feedback next week

864
01:03:56,920 --> 01:04:01,340
Because of scale no will be sitting in for me. So it'll be West and Noah in the mumble room

865
01:04:01,340 --> 01:04:04,660
yeah, yeah, that should be a good time and I

866
01:04:05,020 --> 01:04:10,100
He'll you guys maybe might want to get the ball rolling earlier in slack than we normally do. We're pretty quick now

867
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:13,980
We've got a down. That's true. We got it down. But you know, no that guy's new that guy

868
01:04:13,980 --> 01:04:17,620
He doesn't you know, so you got to watch out for him. So go check it out

869
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:19,900
Thank you very much for being here everybody

870
01:04:19,900 --> 01:04:27,700
We do the Linux unplugged show live on Tuesdays over at jblive.tv at 2 p.m. Is that right or 1 p.m. Yeah

871
01:04:27,700 --> 01:04:34,060
Okay. Hmm seems really the day with you seems pretty wet, huh? You know what if I got confused I would just

872
01:04:34,740 --> 01:04:38,020
If I got confused, I would just go to Jupiter broadcasting comm slash calendar

873
01:04:38,020 --> 01:04:40,860
That's what I would do that's her that would converge my local time zone

874
01:04:40,860 --> 01:04:43,900
You could show you could show up live hang out in our virtual log hang on our chatter

875
01:04:43,900 --> 01:04:46,540
But if you can't just download it, we've got RSS feeds

876
01:04:46,540 --> 01:04:51,120
We appreciate it Linux action show dot reddit dot com Jupiter broadcasting comm slash contact to send us feedback

877
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:57,560
Thanks so much for tuning in and we'll see you right back here next week. Well, they will

878
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:23,120
Oh

879
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:37,600
Well, you see that where's West there hey there worse you see that

880
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:40,240
Marcus is trying out MB

881
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:43,880
Yeah, so tell us. So what do you think Mario? So you go with I got you. What do you think marks?

882
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:47,840
What do you think of the MB? Yeah, it's really good because I've got a

883
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:50,440
Cody box in my living room

884
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:52,440
and I've been

885
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:54,760
having

886
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:57,720
Reasonable success with with managing my library on it

887
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:04,320
But I I'd like having all my music on my server and streaming that so I've had them and patchy running on there for a while

888
01:06:05,080 --> 01:06:10,200
Which is fairly decent, but it only does music and I've got my videos on the server, too

889
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:14,480
So it's nice to just have one solution. So I thought I'd stick MB on there and give it a go

890
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:17,000
and I found

891
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:20,520
It does the video library really well and since that's coding nicely

892
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:28,360
It doesn't sync the video library to Cody so nicely for some reason but because it's got the remote control feature

893
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:30,120
you can just

894
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:34,400
You just go into the web interface or the app on MB and you say send it to Cody

895
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:39,940
It's brilliant using the the MB plug-in at all for Cody

896
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:46,120
Yeah, so that's what I think you you put the MB plug-in in and that's what sinks your mute your video library

897
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:52,080
I think and it also means that then your other MB apps will recognize it as somewhere that you can send media

898
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:56,660
It's worked very well my but you're saying the music part does not work as well

899
01:06:57,220 --> 01:07:03,740
Well, it works, but only if you use another app to like select the playlist or the music

900
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:10,800
So it doesn't sync the music library to Cody's music library for some reason. Where's where's either I am

901
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:13,920
Can you hear me? Where's is Chris recording yet? Yes

902
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:19,160
Yeah, yeah. Okay. Why why what's wrong? I've got a question for you Chris. Yeah, what's that?

903
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:22,400
15 arrived yet

904
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:29,600
No, that is you know what you know what I don't I don't even know what to say because now I'm going on this trip

905
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:34,920
And I'm I'm I am literally in the position of like I'm like which one of the which one of the machines can I?

906
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:40,640
Sacrifice in the studio and not disrupt the shows that will be going next week because the thing is doing a job

907
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:45,080
What if I need to do production from the road like what if I need to do some production from the road?

908
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:49,120
Can I do it all my xps 13? I don't think so. I need a larger screen machine

909
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:51,880
just oh oh

910
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:54,160
Oh

911
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:59,320
Yeah, I would I would I would do anything to have that rig monitor built into the rover

912
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:01,440
You know what? I would like at this point anything is

913
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:04,160
I would just like you know what to be honest with you at this point

914
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:06,560
I would just like a refund I think and I just need to get something

915
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:11,520
You should contact them and ask them if they come to scale and maybe they could bring your laptop along yeah

916
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:13,520
I should I wonder if they will be a scale

917
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:21,280
Wonder hmm. You should drive the rover over to their office, and then just camp outside until he gives you empty empty your black tank in there

918
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:25,040
Wow I

919
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:28,600
Empty my tank in your direction sir

920
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:32,880
Yikes yikes, so you know the thing is is

921
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:40,160
I've driven a gas vehicle my entire life, and this thing runs on top of basically a diesel chassis, right?

922
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:41,700
It's a it is a diesel it is more

923
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:47,520
It's more of a diesel truck than it is anything else so it's got like air brakes and air suspension

924
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:50,200
and it has like glow plugs and

925
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:55,720
Like all the add a DF and a DF tank to help reduce the diesel emissions

926
01:08:56,360 --> 01:08:59,320
And so it's got like all this stuff that I have to learn how to operate

927
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:03,520
Scaling up here plus. It's got plus. It's got a built-in generator with an auto start system

928
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:06,080
So I can set conditions for when the generator automatically kicks in

929
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:12,480
But like I gotta learn how to manage all of these things in like well tomorrow morning basically

930
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:17,240
And I don't have a great memory, so I think what it really means is as Chris because you should record it

931
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:21,440
I'm gonna be good. Yes exactly. That's why I probably will record, and I'm gonna be googling while on the road

932
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:28,480
Oh the good news is a diesel is quite a bit cheaper than gasoline fuel right now, so

933
01:09:29,320 --> 01:09:33,800
That's that's the good news. Yeah, yeah, that's great, and it's more more efficient as well

934
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:38,940
Yeah, and they might look at you a little funny if you show up with a GoPro on a bicycle helmet though

935
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:41,960
Yeah, well it is a lot to learn before the trip

936
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:45,980
But I had to learn everything about the rover before the last trip, and I managed to pull that off

937
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:49,520
So I got I am I'm up for the challenge

938
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:52,880
I think but it is a lot it is a lot to when I think about it

939
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:55,320
It is a lot to go through and then maybe none of it happens

940
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:59,960
And then maybe I just end up taking the truck and the and the rover and then they it's it's it's whatever

941
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:01,960
It's no big deal

942
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:08,040
Yeah, I found it interesting listening to you talking about the rover and

943
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:10,560
then

944
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:18,160
Sort of ending up living in the rover and then enjoying that space yeah, and I can identify with this because

945
01:10:18,160 --> 01:10:23,360
My wife's parents have got a barge, and I absolutely love living on the barge

946
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:29,520
This is a narrowboat that goes up and down the canals in the UK so very thin and long

947
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:32,520
so not much space, but I kind of like the

948
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:38,940
Efficiency of living that you have to adopt when you're living in and you know small space like that

949
01:10:38,940 --> 01:10:42,680
So what is it about living in the RV that that you find?

950
01:10:42,680 --> 01:10:50,400
Yeah, it's pretty it's definitely an aspect of that so like there's no reason for me to go to a furniture store because I'm not

951
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:56,680
Gonna be able to buy anything in that furnished furniture store and bring it home and that it's sort of freeing like when we have

952
01:10:56,680 --> 01:11:01,420
a really big mess to clean up it takes 10 15 minutes and the entire space is

953
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:04,200
Immaculate and it's so nice

954
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:08,720
So there is a lot less need of things and there's a lot less

955
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:16,040
like maintenance and maintaining that a big place comes with you know a big place gets cluttered up

956
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:19,800
There's stuff all over all of the wherever there's counter space or or wherever

957
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:23,400
There's a flat surface stuff ends up getting stacked on top of it

958
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:28,280
and then they have they have yards that have to be maintained, and I don't have time or energy for that and

959
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:34,380
I also hate my neighbors like I constantly I look for things like there's a new guy

960
01:11:34,380 --> 01:11:38,820
There's a new guy who he's a renter that lives over in the house across over there

961
01:11:38,820 --> 01:11:41,340
Hey, and he's out there, and he's smoking all the time when I'm outside

962
01:11:41,740 --> 01:11:42,860
So you know I'm here

963
01:11:42,860 --> 01:11:44,940
I am loading unloading stuff from the back of my truck

964
01:11:44,940 --> 01:11:50,600
You know grunting and huffing and puffing and this guy's just sitting out there for like 20 minutes watching me like a 20 minute smoke

965
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:52,820
Break just sitting there staring at me the whole time and then one

966
01:11:53,820 --> 01:11:58,780
And then like two weeks into it. I get out of my truck, and I lock it and I'm walking and he says hey

967
01:11:59,780 --> 01:12:01,340
Your lights are on

968
01:12:01,340 --> 01:12:06,460
Now I have been doing this for two weeks since this guy's moved in and he's the lights have always

969
01:12:06,620 --> 01:12:11,100
Automatically turned themselves off they have since the first time he's seen me show up for two weeks in a row

970
01:12:11,340 --> 01:12:15,840
The lights automatically turned themselves off and then two weeks into he's like hey your lights

971
01:12:16,340 --> 01:12:20,460
And like and I'm like I just stopped there. I'm like well. Yeah, they turn

972
01:12:21,180 --> 01:12:23,940
And it's not even like I'm like some famous in 2012

973
01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:27,260
It's not some fancy vehicle right the lights just turned themselves off so anyways I

974
01:12:27,260 --> 01:12:31,960
I developed Hicks about like and then I could tell you about these guys, so we tell you about these guys right

975
01:12:32,460 --> 01:12:35,380
These guys right here. They're coming and going at the same time

976
01:12:35,380 --> 01:12:38,900
I am all the time now obviously how long ago, and I tell you about this no, it's true

977
01:12:38,900 --> 01:12:41,780
It's I've observed the same. I had I've complained about it

978
01:12:41,780 --> 01:12:47,100
I've even sent you pictures of them coming and going when I'm coming and going why are they always coming to go when I'm coming?

979
01:12:47,100 --> 01:12:53,020
And going I come and go weird times. I'm a podcaster and yet they're coming and going at weird times. It's suspicious

980
01:12:53,020 --> 01:12:57,420
Maybe they have it's almost like you listen to the live stream, and then they're coming and going when I'm coming and going

981
01:12:58,060 --> 01:13:00,940
Great way to spy on your neighbor. Oh well. He just has this life

982
01:13:00,940 --> 01:13:07,120
Yeah, so and then and then and then this is another one where I think maybe I am I have some sort of condition

983
01:13:07,420 --> 01:13:09,420
I'm not very good at

984
01:13:10,740 --> 01:13:14,860
So that there's the neighbor thing so I like to be able to I like the ability to pick up and move so there might

985
01:13:14,860 --> 01:13:18,860
Be some sort of condition there where I just start to develop ticks about the people you know what it is is

986
01:13:18,860 --> 01:13:23,020
I observe a lot of patterns in people and then when they when they have bad patterns

987
01:13:23,020 --> 01:13:27,860
I can't help but notice them and then they drive me crazy because then like I have to build the narrative around why they have

988
01:13:27,860 --> 01:13:29,860
Such an awful pattern in their life

989
01:13:29,940 --> 01:13:34,940
Anyways, so it's nice to be able to pick up and move so that's one you know plus for the for the mobile lifestyle

990
01:13:35,620 --> 01:13:42,260
You know the other thing is is I really I really put a lot of my time and energy into the network like

991
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:47,940
So much so that I'm negligent to other aspects of my life not and it doesn't really matter how important it is

992
01:13:47,940 --> 01:13:49,740
It's like could be it could be a health issue

993
01:13:49,740 --> 01:13:53,420
It could be taking care of personal insurance doesn't really matter what it is

994
01:13:53,420 --> 01:13:55,940
I'm just not very good at addressing it and along with that

995
01:13:56,300 --> 01:14:01,140
Comes things like all of the crap you have to manage and pay and when I mean manage

996
01:14:01,140 --> 01:14:04,380
I mean even having to like go into bill pay and set up payments and

997
01:14:04,700 --> 01:14:11,820
and and send checks to your power company and your water company and your cable company and and the garbage company and all this all

998
01:14:11,820 --> 01:14:14,340
the all of the different organizations or or

999
01:14:14,340 --> 01:14:19,220
Utilities that you have to pay when you own a house. They just drive me crazy

1000
01:14:19,220 --> 01:14:23,460
I don't have time to manage that I don't want to bother with any of it and so one of the nice things about where

1001
01:14:23,460 --> 01:14:25,460
I'm staying at is it's

1002
01:14:25,740 --> 01:14:27,140
All just part of the deal

1003
01:14:27,140 --> 01:14:28,740
I pay a flat

1004
01:14:28,740 --> 01:14:33,720
$35 and it's just all part of the deal I can use as much power as I want I use as much water as I

1005
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:36,380
Want the garbage is built in all of its one

1006
01:14:36,380 --> 01:14:42,380
But it's just one $35 charge that automatically goes on my card and that and I don't have to I don't have to mail anybody

1007
01:14:42,380 --> 01:14:47,260
A check nothing. It's just very simple for me to manage and it lets me focus on other things

1008
01:14:47,260 --> 01:14:50,140
So the smaller space lets me not have to focus on

1009
01:14:50,420 --> 01:14:55,740
Maintaining my house and making it look nice and not having to worry about the yard and the smaller space keeps it efficient

1010
01:14:55,740 --> 01:14:57,740
I don't need to buy a lot like

1011
01:14:58,060 --> 01:15:01,880
If I do get this new rig, you know along with that new rig is well

1012
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:07,740
That's also my couch and my dining room table and my oven and my microwave and my refrigerator

1013
01:15:07,740 --> 01:15:12,980
And so and my king-size bed now all of it will just be part of like I otherwise

1014
01:15:12,980 --> 01:15:17,700
I would have to go out and buy all of those things individually like I don't have any of those things anymore

1015
01:15:17,700 --> 01:15:19,440
So I would have to go buy a couch

1016
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:23,260
I would have to go buy a dining room table set with chairs, and I would have to go buy

1017
01:15:23,900 --> 01:15:27,380
Recliner chairs, and I would have to go buy the televisions. I don't have any televisions right

1018
01:15:27,380 --> 01:15:32,820
I don't to go buy the televisions and the bedding and all of that stuff it when you when you get a nice

1019
01:15:32,820 --> 01:15:38,380
Rig it just all is nice, and it all just comes with it, and so it not only does it check all those other boxes

1020
01:15:38,380 --> 01:15:44,060
But it also is mobile which is great for me to go do these events and do productions on the road and it has all

1021
01:15:44,060 --> 01:15:47,780
It checks all the boxes as far as things you'd have to buy when you get a house that just come with it

1022
01:15:47,780 --> 01:15:49,780
Don't write it. Yeah, I

1023
01:15:50,140 --> 01:15:52,420
Like it a lot and on top of all of that

1024
01:15:52,580 --> 01:15:59,100
It's pretty damn green because at max it can only pull 50 amps which you're never gonna pull that much and

1025
01:15:59,100 --> 01:16:04,420
And and the average US house is 200 amps so by it uses less power

1026
01:16:04,420 --> 01:16:09,100
It has we uses way less water in fact. We're actually very acutely aware of exactly how much water

1027
01:16:09,100 --> 01:16:11,100
We use every single week. I know in gallons

1028
01:16:11,420 --> 01:16:16,460
When's the last time you knew in gallons exactly how much water use every single week absolutely never right you need to live in

1029
01:16:16,460 --> 01:16:18,460
the UK yeah

1030
01:16:18,660 --> 01:16:22,580
So you know I mean it's it's very like we're and because also it's a smaller space

1031
01:16:22,580 --> 01:16:26,060
We're buying less food. We have less waste we have less things

1032
01:16:26,060 --> 01:16:31,860
We're getting that we're not using so it feels like it's also as a side effect a greener way to live

You know when you're not you're not having to go shopping for furniture

1035
01:16:37,860 --> 01:16:41,740
And you're not having to spend so much time tidying and and all that kind of stuff

1036
01:16:41,740 --> 01:16:56,500
It gives you a lot more time to round to us online. I think
