1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,440
Man, I tell you what, that Windows 10, that Windows 10, I am impressed at how Windows

2
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,640
it still is.

3
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,280
It really is just Windows still.

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:20,320
I tried it recently on that $10,000 Dell laptop and not impressed.

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:27,400
First of all, I am shocked at how badly Windows 10 shits the bed when you have previously

6
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:33,400
had Linux installed on it, so say you have existing Ubuntu partitions, like just extended

7
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,320
4, nothing even fancy.

8
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,520
And maybe they are GUID instead of MBR, I do not know.

9
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,640
So Windows 10 will see all of the partitions.

10
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,900
You go to click a partition, say you just want to use like the same sizes, the sizes

11
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:54,120
all work for you, you go to delete the partition, okay, so far so good, you create a new partition,

12
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,720
it automatically says you want it this size, which is the maximum size available, you hit

13
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:58,720
apply.

14
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,720
Okay, good to go.

15
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,320
It says it is formatting.

16
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,160
Then when you go to click next, you get an error message that says BitLocker is enabled

17
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:09,200
on this disk, go to control panel and then it tells you where to go in the control panel,

18
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,160
which obviously you cannot do because you are in setup, the only thing you can do is

19
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:16,960
do control F10 and bring up the emergency console, you cannot go to the BitLocker control

20
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:23,180
panel and turn off BitLocker for that drive with the instructions, so it is unbelievable

21
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:28,920
that this company in their latest version has an error message in their installer that

22
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:34,080
comes up, which is completely wrong, the drive has totally been reformatted with NTFS, it

23
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:38,320
does not have BitLocker turned on, so but then the error message comes up and it tells

24
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,080
you all these steps to go to the control panel, which do not exist and what you really have

25
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:46,760
to do is you have to bring up the emergency console, you have to use their disk utility

26
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:51,160
emergency thing, you have to go into the volume and you have to select the partition and then

27
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:55,760
you have to reformat it again from the command line and you cannot reboot in between, if

28
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,800
you see what I did is the first time I did that I made the mistake and then I rebooted

29
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,440
just to make sure everything was good and clean and went back in the installer, same

30
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:05,960
exact problem, threw me for a loop, I am like oh shit that did not fix it, I thought for

31
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,040
sure that would have fixed it, no, no, no, no, no, what you got to do is you got to delete

32
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:12,460
it again in the installer, then you got to go to the emergency console, then you got

33
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:15,640
to run the disk utility, go in there, you got to reformat it again, close the emergency

34
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,440
console and then go back in the installer and finish the installation.

35
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:23,160
Well that is probably what happens when less than 1% of your users use your drive encryption

36
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,960
technology.

37
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:30,160
And even I do not think they totally test for installing on a system after Ubuntu, but

38
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,960
what I was surprised by was how little.

39
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,360
No Chris, I hear that Microsoft loves Linux.

40
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,320
I was surprised, first of all when you search for that error message you get very little

41
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:42,080
information, I was surprised by that, thank you Mr. Beard for stepping in.

42
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,160
I hear Mr. West is here.

43
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,260
Yeah I hear that too, I hear that rumor.

44
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:49,760
He's a jerk, he's kicking me off the air.

45
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,760
Yeah you know him.

46
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,760
I would never.

47
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,760
Hello Wes.

48
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,760
Hello.

49
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,560
I missed you, it's good to see you.

50
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,520
So that was my Windows 10, I mean it's like just that whole thing, it's just such garbage,

51
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,520
crazy garbage, crazy, crazy garbage.

52
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,760
What are you doing with Windows?

53
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:09,760
Oh well I got, I stole this laptop from Dell and I wanted to try out Premiere on it, just

54
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:17,480
to compare it against Lightworks 14 and that sounds reasonable, and was just blown away

55
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:21,920
by the amazing problems that you still have with Microsoft and this is a fully like anniversary

56
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,680
update or creator's update or whatever they call it, whatever stupid name they have for

57
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,680
it.

58
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,600
It's all fully like the latest ISO, yeah latest, all that and it still does all this

59
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,880
stupid shenanigans.

60
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:48,560
This is Linux Unplugged episode 193 for April 18th, 2017.

61
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,520
Welcome to Linux Unplugged and yes the band is back together this week, we've got a great

62
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,680
show and my name is Chris.

63
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,680
My name is Wes.

64
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,880
Hello Wes, very excited about some of the things, we have like a new segment, a new

65
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:06,160
segment, that's one of the things, yes and we also have a very interesting introspective

66
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:11,160
look at Ubuntu 17.04 if I don't say so myself, but there's something in there that nobody's

67
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:15,400
really covered yet, it's kind of a shame, so we're going to talk about that, Wes and

68
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,880
I have been kicking the tires, we have some interesting hardware news to discuss in a

69
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,200
little bit and we're going to go through a bunch of our favorite open source project

70
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:27,720
updates, maybe add a couple of new ones to the map as well, yeah we'll tell you about

71
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:32,480
those coming up, coming up in a little bit, it's good to be back Wes, Wes, it is great

72
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:36,520
that you're back, you did, you did a fantastic job, now I feel like I should just be, I can

73
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,920
go all the time, well there you go, I feel like I can leave all the time, I think it's

74
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,480
in the network's interest for you to adventure, how did it go for you, how did it go, it was

75
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,920
good, it was a lot of fun, yeah.

76
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:47,760
I heard there was a bit of a mixer situation where something was going on, you had to unmute

77
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:52,280
all the channels, yeah something crazy happened, so you know what I'm going to do, I was thinking

78
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:56,400
about this, because I know that, that software mixer, that's like the worst thing about it,

79
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,320
it is right, absolutely, for me I use it every day, so like it's no problem, I'm learning,

80
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,160
I'm getting better, I'm getting better, but yeah, no don't worry, don't worry, I have,

81
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:09,960
I have good news, oh, I think probably before the next time I'm gone, we'll have a big old

82
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:15,720
huge Linux powered console right here, good old, that would be awesome, yeah physical

83
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:20,120
switches and dials and all that, so you can look at it and you'll know what's going on,

84
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,880
I can press buttons, yeah, I think it's going to be, I think it's going to be real good,

85
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:28,240
so yeah, that'll be nice right, yeah, it'll be a good upgrade, so look forward to that,

86
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,720
alright well, before we go any further, what we really got to do is take care of a little

87
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:36,640
business, we got to bring in our virtual, time appropriate greetings mummer room, greetings

88
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:44,880
brothers, hello, hello, hello, have you missed them Chris, I did, I did, you know, I wish

89
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,800
I could have joined in the mummer room, because that's always fun, yeah, but it turns out,

90
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,240
you never know what kind of reception you're going to get, that's right, you never know,

91
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:57,920
speaking of reception, the reception to the announcement that Canonical is discontinuing

92
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:01,920
their efforts on Unity and switching to GNOME, go figure that happens when I'm gone, right,

93
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:05,480
what the, damn it Mark, like right after you left, damn it Mark, you know, I thought, I

94
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:10,240
thought we were buddies, I thought you and I were buddies, kind of ironic, I don't know

95
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:16,920
if Noah got to share this tidbit, he must have, but I got the news on my phone, I got

96
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:21,840
a push notification to my phone, as I'm sitting with the Project Sputnik team, who of course

97
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,840
are basing these products around the Unity desktop, and so I had to break the news to

98
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:31,960
that team, wow, that's kind of a bummer, yeah, and it was like, well it was just a very interesting

99
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:36,080
position to be in, like, because I got to watch them go, oh shit, well I guess we're

100
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,000
going to be, see the wheels turning, we're going to be responding to that, yeah, so that

101
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,040
was interesting, and so that's going to sort of flavour our discussion a little bit later,

102
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:49,360
coming up on 1704, yeah, but I want to talk about something kind of from like a project

103
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,960
standpoint that is inevitable, and of course this is going to happen, there's a lot of

104
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:58,320
different takes on this, a lot of different forks of like the mobile aspect, the guy behind

105
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:02,960
Ubiport is keeping that going, there's also folks that are going to try to create their

106
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,320
own version of the Unity desktop, and the one that grabbed my attention this week, and

107
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:11,520
you guys may have heard about it, is the, I'm going to say enjade, yeah, I think so,

108
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:17,880
desktop, yeah, and so right now it's early days, but they call it a modern unified desktop

109
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:22,960
environment, what it really is, is Plasma that's been sort of mixed up to look a lot

110
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,060
more like Unity with a few other things, the way they describe it is a community project

111
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:31,280
to recreate and continue the Unity desktop environment, from the versatile dash down

112
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:37,520
to the global menu, enjade promises to provide a familiar experience that Ubuntu users love,

113
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,760
while adding new features to keep it up with the latest trends, I don't know what that

114
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:45,560
means, but I think that sounds good, it does sound good, the entire desktop created from

115
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:53,600
Plasma, compatibility with Wayland, distribution through Snappy and Flatpacks, hey, and it's

116
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:58,520
going to have a search function, okay, you know what, I'm good on the search stuff, I'm

117
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:03,800
good on that, let's put our efforts into other things, because we just, it always, like the

118
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:09,040
indexer always manages to go crazy, it always, anyways, right, people are sort of downplaying

119
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,560
this one, but something about this one to me, feels like they've got some real momentum

120
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,440
behind it, first of all I think the idea is kind of solid, some of us were looking forward

121
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:23,500
to a QT Unity 8, kind of seemed like a good idea, and I've been a big fan of the Plasma

122
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:29,400
desktop recently, running on half my machines right now, and it's very possible to make

123
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:33,980
the Plasma desktop a lot like Unity, there's just a few things missing, yeah, totally,

124
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:38,340
and the Plasma desktop is very extensible, configurable, so it seems like a natural platform

125
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:42,800
to try to build that on, yeah, yeah, we'll watch and see where it goes, there's a few

126
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,720
other projects out there, including ones that are just like themes that can be applied and

127
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,840
styles that can be applied to the Plasma desktop, so clearly there's a lot of interest, or at

128
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:52,200
least right now, yeah, and we're going to talk a little bit more about it later on in

129
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,680
the show, but I just wanted to talk about that, and then on the other end, so if you're

130
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:01,200
a GTK desktop fan and you're not going anywhere, but you did like a few things from Unity,

131
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,840
a lot of people have said to me, you know, the thing I really liked about Unity was the

132
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:08,000
HUD, in fact Wimpy, you remember when Wimpy used to come on this show, oh yeah, that Wimpy

133
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,600
back before there was some things going on at Canonical, I suspect, I haven't heard from

134
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,680
them in a while, but back when Wimpy used to come on this show, one of his favorite

135
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:20,000
things about Unity was the HUD, they've even worked on it for the Mate desktop, so that's

136
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,540
something that I think a lot of people that are coming from Unity and going to the GNOME

137
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:27,920
desktop might miss, it's kind of a neat feature if you get used to it, and it's sort of unique

138
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:34,020
to Unity, well there is a GNOME extension that sort of recreates the whole Unity HUD

139
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:39,480
experience for GTK applications, so if you're familiar with like Sublime Text or Addams

140
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:45,680
Command Palette that you can fire up, it's a lot like that, you get essentially anything

141
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,760
that the menus can do, you can do from the keyboard, it brings that to every application

142
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:58,460
that uses GTK 3, it automatically extracts all available commands, and it does that by

143
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:04,240
also observing what is the running application, it will adapt the UI to match the appropriate

144
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:09,080
application which sounds really cool, also to relevant actions, and it requires no modifications

145
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,880
to the applications because it's using just the features of GTK.

146
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,200
It looks pretty slick, I might give this a try.

147
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:20,760
Yeah, it actually looks really cool, and really if you think about it, if HUD is one of the

148
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:27,880
things you like the most about Unity, but you're trying to get to where the puck is

149
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:32,240
going to be hit by a Canadian or something, something about Canadians and pucks, if you're

150
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,120
going that direction, this might be something to try.

151
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,120
Absolutely.

152
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,120
Pretty cool.

153
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:42,520
And we will have that linked in the show notes, because it's up on Github, but it's, how do

154
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:49,520
you say it, what are you going to say it was, Plotinus, yeah, so it's P-L-O-T-I-N-U-S, Plotinus

155
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,520
perhaps.

156
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,520
Yeah.

157
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:57,840
It's really nice, and it's an example of ways that you can tweak Gnome.

158
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:04,400
Ryan and Noah had a conversation about System76 making modifications.

159
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,040
If I were System76, I'd probably be looking at extensions like this.

160
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,040
Yeah, definitely.

161
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,480
And then the market will decide if they like something like that.

162
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,480
Yeah.

163
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,480
Like, wow.

164
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:17,760
Now's the time we can dissect what we like about Unity, spread that across the other

165
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,960
desktop environments.

166
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:23,160
In some ways, I wonder if in a few weeks, in a few months, people will be speaking more

167
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,840
positively of Unity.

168
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,140
Because now that they know that there's a light at the end of the tunnel, that this

169
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:30,920
great travesty that was committed against the Linux community will finally be coming

170
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,920
to an end.

171
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,160
Right, the part they hate, which is just the, you know, not invented here, or fork, or whatever,

172
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,160
that part's done.

173
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,160
Yeah.

174
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,600
So now we can talk about all the great things that Unity did right.

175
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,160
I don't know about that, but maybe it's coming a little bit.

176
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:47,840
So I'd also, if you're switching over to Gnome for the first time, and you've discovered

177
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:51,000
a new extension, tweet me at ChrisLAS and let me know what you're trying.

178
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I'd like to know.

179
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,800
I want to talk a little hardware here for a second.

180
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,520
So I was just talking about the Sputnik team.

181
00:11:55,520 --> 00:12:00,720
This is a blog post by Barton George, and he is announcing something that we got our

182
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,440
hands on while we were at it.

183
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,240
It's their new Precision desktop.

184
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,240
It's an all-in-one.

185
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,120
Now, I'm talking about this for a couple of reasons, because I think this is a super badass

186
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,120
machine.

187
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:14,040
And this is one of the reasons why I was recently really considering trying to switch to Lightworks.

188
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:19,640
It's a 27-inch all-in-one, but it's like, this Precision one has a Xeon processor.

189
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:23,000
You can get it with ECC RAM, you can get it with, I think you can even get it with Ryzen

190
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
graphics.

191
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Oh, wow.

192
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
27-inch screen.

193
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,840
It's the Dell Precision 5720, but I got to play with it.

194
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,960
I don't know if it's Ryzen or not.

195
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:35,960
They say the latest AMD Radeon Pro graphics.

196
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,360
Does anybody in the moment know what the hell that means?

197
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,800
Does anybody know what the hell that means?

198
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:45,760
I don't know if that means Ryzen or not, because it's the latest Pro graphics.

199
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,920
But it's the Precision 5270.

200
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:52,520
It's a pretty monstrous machine.

201
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:56,640
The thing that I should be talking about is probably the graphics and that stuff.

202
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:01,120
I got to impress upon you, the coolest thing about this machine was the soundbar that they've

203
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,120
built into it.

204
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,120
Really?

205
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,120
It's essentially a soundbar.

206
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,120
Okay.

207
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,320
It shouldn't be the speakers, but you guys got to understand how cool these speakers

208
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,320
are.

209
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,280
We had a little demo, and it doesn't convey very well, because we're just listening with

210
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,280
a microphone.

211
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:18,160
But I'll give you a hint of what it was like as I cut out a part of the demo that we didn't

212
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,360
air because it doesn't really translate very well, but it gives you an idea.

213
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,480
There's this integrated soundbar here, basically.

214
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,800
We actually partnered with a multiple Grammy Award-winning record producer, Jack Joseph

215
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,760
Pewig, to design and tune this audio solution.

216
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:35,640
It is best-in-class audio solution in a PC, hands down.

217
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:38,360
It's got these... You can see the six front-firing speakers.

218
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:43,200
There's two down-firing speakers and two passive radiators, so it's 10 total speakers.

219
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:47,120
It is the only system that includes both the front-firing and the down-firing speakers.

220
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,080
We're going to do an audio demo.

221
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:55,360
This is a mix playlist here, so we'll get to experience and hopefully you can hear the

222
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,920
audio come through.

223
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:02,120
It makes me feel like... It makes me feel like...

224
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:08,760
Now, remind you, this is right on Noah's directional microphone here.

225
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:14,320
You kind of get a sense of how loud it is, but what I did is I cut out the audio demo

226
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,560
here because a very funny thing happened.

227
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,560
You got to picture the scene.

228
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,800
We're in a large conference room.

229
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:23,760
The room, you can kind of tell by the audio, it's a very large room.

230
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:28,440
You could easily fit 25, 30 people in this room.

231
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:32,320
Thick walls, thick doors, double-paned glass.

232
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:40,040
This is like an industrial conference room where people can have hearty conversations.

233
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,640
We kind of disturbed the entire office.

234
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,640
Wow.

235
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,520
I'll cut a little bit here.

236
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,760
Somebody walks in and they're like, you got to turn it down, turn it down.

237
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,880
Then we're like, well, no.

238
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,880
They're doing a demo.

239
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,880
They're filming right now.

240
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,240
No, you've got to turn it down.

241
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,240
You've got to turn it down.

242
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:57,920
It's so good that we got the teams over here enjoying it.

243
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,880
Now what's funny is I cut in a little bit of the Dell promo for this where they show

244
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,880
the speakers.

245
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,880
That was pretty slick.

246
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,880
Check this out.

247
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:09,060
In the promotion, they make reference to disturbing the neighbors.

248
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:13,260
So watch this right here.

249
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,600
Not this part, but that is kind of cool too.

250
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,040
So they show you the diet, how all these speakers are built, but I thought this was right here

251
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:23,800
so the neighbors can enjoy it too, which was very ironic when I went back and watched this

252
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:27,440
promotional video because they had to come in because the rooms next to us, it was too

253
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,800
loud for them.

254
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,360
And then what she says after we were done, she says, yeah, that was only like a half

255
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,360
volume.

256
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,360
Wow.

257
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,360
Okay.

258
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,360
So you're legit impressed with this thing.

259
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,720
I was really, I was like, okay, all right, this would be a great machine for editing

260
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:43,720
because you can get a really great processor in there and get a ton of RAM in there.

261
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:47,240
See, that's like one of those features where I would be initially skeptical of it.

262
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:51,520
There'll probably be some standard, I'm going to get other speakers anyway or use headphones,

263
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,520
but that's awesome.

264
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,000
Sounds like a good deal.

265
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,960
What I think is interesting is, so you have this, so what I now understand about Dell

266
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,520
is that I like the dimension and precision lines.

267
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:05,280
I didn't realize that, but these are like the workstation class stuff.

268
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,480
It's a lot better.

269
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,180
That's when you start getting like the Xeons and you get the high quality build materials

270
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,800
and all this kind of stuff.

271
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,680
So now it all clicks now that I've gone there and seen it.

272
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:19,360
And the reason why I think this is a big story is, so not only is this obviously a vendor

273
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:24,520
that has tons of enterprise relationships and school relationships and an incredibly

274
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:30,640
large brand recognition, but they have transitioned from a company that when they first... When

275
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,140
I bought... Oh, it's in the other room.

276
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:37,880
When I bought the XPS410 from Dell a decade ago, I bought that computer actually almost

277
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,160
11 years ago from Dell.

278
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:43,960
It was one of the first what they call client devices they ever tried to sell shipping Linux.

279
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:49,040
And the whole idea behind it was, how cheap can we sell a computer?

280
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:54,480
Because if we knock $100 off for Windows, we put a 5400 RPM drive in there, how cheap

281
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,640
can we sell a computer?

282
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,080
And part of making it cheap is putting Linux on it.

283
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,360
That was Dell's approach.

284
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,720
And to me, that was what I was always extremely skeptical.

285
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,960
I even said in my predictions episode for the last, at the beginning of January, I don't

286
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:10,400
know if Dell's serious about Linux, because that to me was like, you're screwing around

287
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,400
here.

288
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,400
You're not taking it seriously.

289
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,720
I want a nice computer.

290
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:21,720
So now what we have is we have them shipping the Precision 5720.

291
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:30,120
We have them shipping that crazy $10,000 laptop that we covered, that monster machine.

292
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:33,480
I think it's called the Precision 7720.

293
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:39,920
They have these really nice systems now that they're shipping with Linux that they're not

294
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,840
shipping because they're cheap, they're shipping them because they're high end workstations

295
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:52,920
with Xeon processors and ECC RAM, and I think it's going to be big for them.

296
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:57,660
He said just on their developer laptop program, they're seeing a year over year 100% growth.

297
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:01,260
So in two years, they've seen a 200% growth.

298
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,260
Those are big numbers.

299
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,260
Could be huge.

300
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:07,000
It would be pretty nice to imagine getting a new job, you get a new laptop, you can get

301
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,800
this supported right from Dell.

302
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,440
Well maybe kick Lenovo in the butt a bit.

303
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:15,280
Get them off their game, or get them on their game.

304
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,280
Get them off their butt.

305
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,280
Get them off the pod.

306
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,400
Realize there's a market here, or could be.

307
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:24,160
It'd be really good to get some competition in that area, and then everybody wins.

308
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,280
The more people in the market, the more competition, I think it's better for everybody.

309
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,280
We'll see.

310
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,280
We'll see where it goes.

311
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,400
You know what else there's competition for?

312
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,400
Highly skilled folks.

313
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,720
Go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged and become one of them.

314
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:42,680
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged, support the show and sign up for a free seven day trial.

315
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,000
This is a platform to learn more about Linux.

316
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,320
Now you could be somebody who's worked with Linux for a decade, and you know there's still

317
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,960
little things you can go learn.

318
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,040
That's what I love about the Nuggets.

319
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:58,280
Even if you're a busy person already with kids or a job, I know how it feels, and sometimes

320
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,520
it's hard to continue your education.

321
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,560
That's why I love their course scheduler and their Nuggets.

322
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,420
These are features I probably talk about the most in these spots because they relate to

323
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,800
me the most.

324
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:11,640
It's where I continue even after a couple of years now to get value from linuxacademy.com

325
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,640
slash unplugged.

326
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:17,840
You go there to support the show and you sign up for a free seven day trial.

327
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,200
One of the things that I really realized that Linux Academy was clicking with the community

328
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,960
is when they developed their flashcard feature.

329
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:28,760
It's simple, but it's perfect for somebody like me who just needs little bits to study

330
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:34,960
from, but they can get stale after a while.

331
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,920
The Linux Academy flashcard system not only can randomize a set of cards for you to study

332
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:42,120
from, but they can be forked and improved by the community.

333
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:47,880
The community is full of Jupyter broadcasting members, so it's like top grade stuff.

334
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:50,840
They have Nuggets for just little bits of wisdom when you have just a little bit of

335
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,440
time, and they have study tools and lesson audio and personal notebooks that you can

336
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:58,360
take with you offline, iOS and Android apps to help you study on the go.

337
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,840
They spin up cloud servers on demand that you can SSH into.

338
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:04,920
They have Learning Paths, which are a series of courses and contents planned for very specific

339
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,840
types of certs or exams.

340
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,840
It's great.

341
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:13,360
And to top it all off, like the sprinkles on top of a delicious cupcake, they have instructor

342
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,360
mentoring.

343
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:17,400
And what that means is they have real full time human beings that can help you with the

344
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,400
subject material.

345
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,400
That's huge.

346
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,400
Huge.

347
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,400
Very big.

348
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,800
Also, if you're at DockerCon this week, stop by and say hi to Justin.

349
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,080
He's there from Linux Academy.

350
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,520
He's down there taking notes for the team to see what's coming up.

351
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:34,240
And I think also, he's going to be at the AWS Summit as well.

352
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,680
I mean, he's got guys all over the place.

353
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,680
Check it out.

354
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:39,720
Then check out Linux Academy on Twitter as well, LinuxAcademy.com, where they're telling

355
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,960
you about all this kind of stuff.

356
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,720
You can stay apprised if they're at an event you're going to.

357
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,720
Check out their Twitter feed.

358
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,720
You'll probably see about it.

359
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,040
And you can go say hi.

360
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,240
Go check out the booth.

361
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,880
Maybe get a little penguin plush from time.

362
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,000
I hear they have those from time to time.

363
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
What?

364
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
My kids love them.

365
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,200
Go to LinuxAcademy.com slash unplug to support the show and find them on Twitter, LinuxAcademy.com,

366
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,440
and probably coming to Mastodon sometime soon.

367
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,760
Mastodon reference.

368
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,760
OK.

369
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,680
I wanted to start a new segment in the show.

370
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:18,680
And I wanted to take projects that have been in a darkness, a silence, perhaps a cone of

371
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:23,840
silence.

372
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,280
I want to take these out of the cone of silence.

373
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,280
Shine some light.

374
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,280
I don't want to shine some light.

375
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,280
Because I think these are fascinating.

376
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:33,080
And if anybody in the moment has any experience with any of these, feel free to interrupt

377
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,360
with your set experience.

378
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:41,000
The first one up, Wes, is Torrent Peak, a new contender for our favorite open source

379
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,600
projects here on the show, Torrent Peak.

380
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,600
Distributed search engines.

381
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,800
Oh, got me there.

382
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,800
Using BitTorrent.

383
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,800
Oh.

384
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,800
Oh, you're hooked already.

385
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,800
OK.

386
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,800
And SQLite.

387
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,800
OK.

388
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,800
OK.

389
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,800
Now, this is a real fresh product.

390
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,760
I mean, we're talking updated just as a matter a couple of days ago.

391
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:00,400
It's a distributed search engine using BitTorrent and SQLite.

392
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,560
And that's kind of a cool idea.

393
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:07,360
So site owners create a SQLite database and create a torrent file from this.

394
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,480
They then proceed to seed this torrent, just like they would seed any other file.

395
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,640
Site users then start downloading the site torrent.

396
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:18,880
But rather than downloading pieces of a torrent, they download pieces based on a search query

397
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,880
they've performed.

398
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,600
In other words, a given search query, such as Indiana Jones, Torrent Peak knows how to

399
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,720
download pieces of a torrent where data for Indiana Jones is likely to be stored at.

400
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,680
Results are given to users in a timely manner without having to wait for the entire database

401
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,840
to download.

402
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,480
And since search queries are just regular torrent piece downloads, a search query can

403
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:39,560
be satisfied by many different peers in a swarm, effectively allowing for distributed

404
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,560
search.

405
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,560
That sounds nice.

406
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,560
Yeah.

407
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,960
It does have a couple of other pros, too.

408
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,840
You can create...

409
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,400
Hosting your own is just as simple as seeding.

410
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,560
So if you can seed a torrent, you can do this.

411
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,560
That's pretty great.

412
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,560
You don't have to buy a domain name.

413
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:56,180
You don't have to put it up on a server somewhere.

414
00:22:56,180 --> 00:23:00,880
Since you control your address, your public key, which is broadcasted via the DHT, it's

415
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:05,760
much harder for governments and institutions to block the content you're sharing.

416
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,560
And via SQL torrent, you drive your users...

417
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,560
I don't even know what this last...

418
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,560
It's hard to read.

419
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,200
Anyways, but here's a couple of downsides.

420
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,200
Read only sites for now.

421
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:17,080
Your site doesn't get a pretty name.

422
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,720
And there's really not any standards in place to do this.

423
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,000
But the idea is kind of interesting.

424
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Yeah, it definitely is.

425
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,800
So I thought maybe we'd add it to the watch list and see where it goes.

426
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:28,120
This seems like one of those things where you might not use it.

427
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:32,920
I mean, it's not even used as a library, but it pushes things forward.

428
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,200
We're building the tools slowly that we need to solve these problems.

429
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,400
And Yacy is great, but it hasn't gone very far.

430
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,900
I keep playing around with it, and it just is sort of the same.

431
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:44,880
And I just wonder if something like this might come along and move things forward.

432
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,880
Yeah, definitely.

433
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,880
I'm always...

434
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,280
There's always a conversation when Noah is in town.

435
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,120
There will be when he comes in for Linux Fest Northwest.

436
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,120
You wait.

437
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,120
You watch for him.

438
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,120
I'm calling it right now.

439
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:57,480
It's the, you can do anything on the command line.

440
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:01,120
It usually goes, well, actually, you could do that on the command line.

441
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:06,040
And then the conversation between Noah the Beard and I for the next hour is, no way could

442
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,160
you do that on the command line.

443
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:12,640
And usually it's video editing, podcast editing, photo editing, something like that, where

444
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,840
maybe you technically could do it, but if you're just so much more efficient if you

445
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:16,840
have a...

446
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,840
Yeah.

447
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,440
Well, maybe Noah can check another one off as you can do it on the command line list,

448
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,080
because I think he's going to have another one for his list.

449
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:29,160
Audio editing of images.

450
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,160
Audio editing...

451
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,160
What?

452
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,160
Of images.

453
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,160
Yeah.

454
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,160
Check this out.

455
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:40,480
This guy, I believe it's a gentleman, has come up with an incredible way to edit images

456
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,620
as if it was audio data.

457
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,600
He calls it AudioShop.

458
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,920
AudioShop is a simple script that was cobbled together that gets you started with mangling

459
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,400
image data as if it were audio data.

460
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:57,520
The script wraps three individually excellent tools, FMPEG, ImageMagick, and SOX.

461
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:02,240
The way it works is by first converting an image to a raw format like YUV.

462
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,880
This is done to prevent audio editor from destroying the structure so you still have

463
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,800
the original PNG or JPEG or whatever.

464
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:11,320
If converting to a raw format, then after it does that, it imports the raw image data

465
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:14,280
into the audio editor.

466
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:20,480
And he can then apply audio editor techniques to the image to get the results you'd expect.

467
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:27,260
So for example, he can overdrive the signal to overdrive the image and you get a very

468
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:29,440
blown out red and green image.

469
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,440
Yeah, look at that.

470
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:33,720
He can apply a reverb or an echo and you get multiple...

471
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:38,320
So he has a picture here of the Eiffel Tower and you get four instances of the Eiffel Tower

472
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:42,920
because he applied a reverb or an echo to the image data.

473
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:47,560
You never open it up in a graphical application, all done with a script.

474
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,560
AudioShop.

475
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,560
It's got a great name too.

476
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,520
Yeah, definitely.

477
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,520
So that just came out.

478
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,840
I think I will play with this one because it seems kind of cool.

479
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,840
Yeah, yeah.

480
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,840
It's up on GitHub.

481
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:57,840
We'll have a link in the show notes.

482
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,200
So that's another project we'll be keeping an eye on.

483
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,200
It's actually not that complicated.

484
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,960
It's like 300 lines, it's all scripted, you can go check it out.

485
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:07,400
Because it's really sitting on top of FFmpeg, ImageMagick, and Socks.

486
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:11,440
And so they're all doing the heavy lifting and they're all tools we're familiar with.

487
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,960
Maybe Socks for those of you...

488
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,680
Because you're probably all familiar with ImageMagick and FFmpeg, but Socks stands

489
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,680
for sound exchange.

490
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:21,440
It's a cross-platform utility that can convert various formats of computer audio.

491
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,440
So you can use it...

492
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:25,640
I've had clients that even use it on Windows for like a call answering system once.

493
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,640
Oh really?

494
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,640
Yeah.

495
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:32,360
And then this is your language warning for a moment.

496
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,360
Hello everybody.

497
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,360
Get it out of here.

498
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:40,940
You've got three seconds left before we use a swear word.

499
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:45,060
The next open source project is called The Fuck, which is an app that corrects your previous

500
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,060
console command.

501
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:48,640
That's what they've called it, The Fuck.

502
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:54,720
And they have a little animation here that shows it.

503
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,640
Essentially, you type the wrong command here and it says, that command's not found.

504
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,960
Did you actually mean this command?

505
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,080
And if you did, you type fuck.

506
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,640
And then it corrects the command and then runs it for you.

507
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,200
It's pretty cool.

508
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,720
It's just nice if you, oh, I meant to type Python, but you typo'd Python.

509
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,360
You know, The Fuck takes care of it for you.

510
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,360
Yeah, definitely.

511
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:18,160
So that's a project that I've actually, I think I've seen before, but it looks, you

512
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:23,800
know, this repo, okay, I have seen this once before, but it was updated just as of eight

513
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,800
days ago.

514
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,800
Days?

515
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:26,800
Yeah.

516
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,800
So I wonder how broad the support is.

517
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,400
It's apparently pretty active in development still.

518
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:33,920
There was an original version where it just added sudo in front of everything.

519
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:38,080
So you screw up and forget to put sudo and you type it and then the next thing you just

520
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,400
type in is that and then just put sudo in front.

521
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:45,200
It like just converts it back into and puts some sudo in front of it before you do anything.

522
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,760
But this is kind of cool because if it's like detecting what you're, it's even better.

523
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,160
But if it does that and this, that's pretty cool.

524
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,160
Yeah.

525
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,160
So, okay.

526
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:57,520
So now if that's too obscene for you, if that's too intense, then on the other end we have

527
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:03,120
Tiny Care Terminal, Tiny Care Terminal with emoticons, with hard emoticons, a little dashboard

528
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,280
that tries to take care of you when you're using the terminal.

529
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,280
Is it that sweet?

530
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,280
It's wonderful.

531
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,660
It is so wonderful.

532
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:12,120
This is a little dashboard that tries to take care of you.

533
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,600
It tells you you're cute.

534
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:18,320
It tells you to take care of yourself and it tries not to stress you out.

535
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:24,760
It shows you the last tweets from at tiny care bot, at self care bot and magic is real

536
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,760
bot.

537
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:29,240
Oh my God.

538
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:33,480
Speaking of echo chambers, the first two tend to tweet reminders about taking breaks, drinking

539
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:36,200
water and taking a look outside.

540
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,800
The latter tells you strange whimsical stories.

541
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,560
If you don't like these bots, they're completely configurable.

542
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:46,240
Your good commits from today and the last seven days will also be shown and when you

543
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,660
get stressed out because you think you haven't done anything, it turns out it'll show you

544
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:54,960
all of the hard work you've done recently and also it'll tell you about the weather

545
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,800
because you might get rained on.

546
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,920
Oh my God.

547
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:02,920
And then so they have a screenshot here and they show you your commits today and for the

548
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,920
week.

549
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:07,960
They show you that maybe you should download a mindfulness app for your phone so you can

550
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,840
meditate.

551
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:14,760
There's a end curses type animated parrot that tells you to breathe.

552
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,760
It looks pretty good.

553
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:22,640
I mean from a design standpoint, it's a pretty handsome looking terminal app.

554
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,640
See this is good.

555
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:27,180
This like goes right back into just you could do anything on the terminal and this will

556
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:29,820
help you maybe feel more at home while you're there.

557
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:30,820
That is so true.

558
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:31,820
Oh my gosh.

559
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:33,000
This would be, you know, would be great.

560
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,000
This is actually just a, this would be fantastic to replace people's shell with this.

561
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Right.

562
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,200
And just so like, you know, somebody leaves the machine unlocked.

563
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,200
This is the new thing.

564
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,400
You change their shell to this and then they open.

565
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,400
What the hell is this?

566
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,480
You know, they're told to breathe deep.

567
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:50,440
So they're upset, but they're not that upset because they meditate about it.

568
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:53,520
They're like, okay, well it's cool, man.

569
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,520
If they get upset, you just give them the Care Bear stare.

570
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,280
Oh, that always helps.

571
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,320
So there you go.

572
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:03,720
There's a couple of open source projects to help make things right in the world that we're

573
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,720
watching.

574
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,760
There's also one that's not really a project, just kind of a neat idea.

575
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,760
I think it's by a guy named Scott.

576
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:15,680
So Scott had a great idea and I don't know why Red Hat or somebody else like the Linux

577
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:20,640
Foundation hasn't thought of this, but it's linuxlifecycle.com and I guess what it does,

578
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:25,520
it tells you how long the support cycles are on major distributions in one place.

579
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,520
Simply easy.

580
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:30,160
I mean, it's not an official page put together by like Linus Torvalds.

581
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:35,720
I mean, it's not, it's a guy named Scott doing this, but hopefully he keeps it up.

582
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:39,840
And so he breaks it down with Red Hat and CentOS, Ubuntu and Debian, and he tells you

583
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:44,000
which releases are still supported and when the end of life is.

584
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:49,120
And it's focused on enterprise, but it looks like Scott plans to set up like an API as

585
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:54,440
data is JSON, so people can, this could eventually be a legitimate resource for this kind of

586
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,440
thing.

587
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,040
And it could be expanded to cover a lot more, especially if there's a JSON where you could

588
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,320
pull out other distros and display it on your own page.

589
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,320
I mean.

590
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,320
The API, you could have like monitors.

591
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,000
Your software is going to go out of state.

592
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,160
How does DistroWatch not have this?

593
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,440
They have individual things.

594
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,440
I like how.

595
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,440
They have a list.

596
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:17,360
There's Wikipedia has a list too, so maybe he's like just collecting all the information

597
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,360
and putting it in one place.

598
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,360
Yeah, it's nice.

599
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:23,800
And you see how he displays it in like these easy, so he's got rel7, rel6 and rel5, green

600
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:26,880
check mark, green check mark, RedX.

601
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,860
Nice and clear, really straightforward, easy to understand.

602
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:33,520
So if you, you know, if you don't often, this would be perfect for somebody like me.

603
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:39,360
Like if I had mostly worked when I was in IT, I'd either be rel, CentOS or Debian Ubuntu.

604
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:44,240
I wouldn't very often sit down at the SUSE machine after I left banking.

605
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,800
But if I did, I could easily just go to this page and say, okay, well, I'm on SUSE Enterprise

606
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,800
10.

607
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,560
Oh man, it was end of life on July 31st, 2013.

608
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,000
I've really got to get this client to update.

609
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,440
I mean, it's just those sort of simple things because when you go look it up from the vendor

610
00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:00,040
themselves, you read all this weird vendor speak and you have to dig through these knowledge

611
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,040
bases.

612
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,040
That's nice to see.

613
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:06,040
That's linuxlifecycle.com if you want to check for yourself.

614
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,040
Pretty handy.

615
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,040
Pretty handy.

616
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:11,000
I'd be okay with some free BSD or other things on there as well.

617
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I'm sorry, what?

618
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Just saying.

619
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Just saying.

620
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
I blacked out for a second.

621
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,440
A broader list, right?

622
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,600
Just maybe on a secondary page.

623
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:25,480
It makes so much sense for a BSD kernel to be on a website called Linux Life Cycle.

624
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:29,720
I mean, it's not like there's a lot of BSDs to keep track of either.

625
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,720
True.

626
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,320
See, it's a small ass.

627
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:36,240
We have some huge BSD news to talk about today on the show.

628
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,520
We've got to talk about FreeNAS Coral.

629
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:40,640
In fact, we're going to do that in just a second, but I wanted to ask you before we

630
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:46,600
do it, do you mostly now use Ubuntu at work for the server side?

631
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,600
Yes.

632
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,600
No CentOS Red Hat?

633
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,600
No, there is some CentOS.

634
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,600
Oh, okay.

635
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,600
But for what you touch?

636
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,600
Yeah.

637
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,760
I've been pretty much exclusively Ubuntu.

638
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,880
You know what you need to get your hands on?

639
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,360
A new Linux Action Show t-shirt.

640
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,360
What?

641
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,360
Yeah.

642
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,120
So Linux Action Show, there's three episodes left, and people have been like, Chris, you've

643
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:07,160
got to do a going away swag, teespring.com slash all good things.

644
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:11,120
It is my favorite version of the logo we've ever done, and I kind of wish we would have

645
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,120
done this all the time.

646
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,120
Yeah, that's nice.

647
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:17,500
We wanted to have something special as like a final edition, so we tweaked our Linux Action

648
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:21,700
Show logo to represent the runtime of the show, so it's like a commemorative edition

649
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:27,960
of the shirt, but we also gave Tux a dignified badass beard.

650
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:32,440
I don't know why all Tuxes should have a beard like this.

651
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:36,680
This is something the community should take and run with, but it starts here.

652
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,720
The revolution starts here.

653
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:40,920
You go to teespring.com slash all good things.

654
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:45,120
We've got a t-shirt, a hoodie, and a long sleeve.

655
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:49,720
I'm mentioning it in this show because with only three episodes left, it's not like this

656
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,520
is going to be something we're going to be promoting very much.

657
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,520
We're doing it right now.

658
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,520
Yeah.

659
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:56,880
Anyways, check it out, teespring.com slash all good things, and you've already got one

660
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,880
on the way.

661
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,880
Ooh.

662
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,880
Mm-hmm.

663
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,880
Rumor has it, Wes.

664
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,880
Rumor has it.

665
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:07,120
This is a big story that I think happened while I was still in Arizona, and I tried

666
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,440
to follow it as closely as possible.

667
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,160
I'm not putting RIP on the back.

668
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,120
Oh my gosh, iMacon.

669
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,760
Oh my gosh.

670
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,760
A purple hoodie.

671
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:20,440
You know they have, by the way, I think... Sorry, you blame iMacon.

672
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,920
He's just sidetracked me again.

673
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,920
Blame.

674
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:23,920
Blame him.

675
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,920
It's totally his fault.

676
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:30,280
So I think if you look at the shirt, they have some interesting sizes this year.

677
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:33,960
I think they have different sizes or something, so you might look at the... Yeah, okay, okay.

678
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,960
I'm looking at the long sleeve too.

679
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:42,960
Anyways, teespring.com slash all good things, and if you guys are Star Trek fans, you probably

680
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,520
get the reference to the... Do you get it?

681
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,520
Oh yeah.

682
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,520
You do?

683
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,520
I'm proud of you, Wes.

684
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,520
I'm proud of you.

685
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:55,280
So anyways, this was a huge story that I was trying to follow because we're a FreeNAS user

686
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,400
here at Jupiter Broadcasting.

687
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:01,600
We have friends that work on the FreeNAS project.

688
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:08,400
I love the folks over at IX Systems who are the sponsors of the FreeNAS project.

689
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,760
It's the BSD thing that even gets Linux users to turn their heads and use it, right?

690
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,760
Everybody loves FreeNAS.

691
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,440
Noah's all in on FreeNAS.

692
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:24,200
It's sort of the number one DIY NAS solution, and then when you combine it with some of

693
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:28,680
IX's hardware, it can be a serious business solution too.

694
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:36,960
So everybody had their eyes on FreeNAS 10, aka FreeNAS Coral, and Jordan Hubbard, which

695
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,400
is one of the guys that's been... He'd been at IX for a long time.

696
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:46,040
He's up in the high ranks, very, very involved with the FreeNAS 10 project.

697
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:48,720
He gave us a demo when I was at MeetBSD California.

698
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,720
Oh, really?

699
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:53,860
Yeah, he gave us... Man, Wes, he was showing... First of all, this was like this revolutionary

700
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:54,860
new UI for FreeNAS.

701
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:59,840
I mean, it had gone from the FreeNAS UI we might know to this totally new dark-themed

702
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,840
click and drag.

703
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:04,720
He did this maneuver where he added 35 hard drives at once to this FreeNAS server because

704
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,720
they had this huge, crazy setup back at IX.

705
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,720
Naturally.

706
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,920
He had VPNed into.

707
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:15,520
And so he VPNs into his... He's up on stage at MeetBSD, and this is out of Berkeley, one

708
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:20,200
of the Berkeley campuses, so everybody's in this auditorium, and we're all watching Jordan

709
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:24,780
up on stage as he gets up there and VPNs back into IX systems and connects to this monster

710
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:28,520
demo FreeNAS rig, Coral rig.

711
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:32,200
He's talking about all of the massive changes, and he's talking about the fact that they're

712
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:37,920
rolling out Docker support, and this totally new UI, and this engine, and they're rebasing

713
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:42,440
on this version of FreeBSD, and all of these fundamental changes.

714
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:49,240
My last show before I left for Texas, the last show with Linux Unplugged I did, I sort

715
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,240
of gave a heads up.

716
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:53,240
I was like, I'm hearing some bad things about... I mean, I'm hearing people are getting

717
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:56,240
a little concerned about FreeNAS 10, and I'm hearing some bad things, like plugins are

718
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:00,940
getting disabled, your data's safe, but you've got to reset up all your plugins in Docker.

719
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:03,200
People are not super thrilled.

720
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,200
Just FYI.

721
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:07,760
It was kind of like the general vibe of the coverage right before I left for Texas.

722
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:14,080
And then while I was gone, huge news, huge, huge news from the FreeNAS project, and it's

723
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:21,480
the kind of news that sort of sticks to a project for a while, and I think maybe it

724
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:25,840
explains why when last time I was on the show, we talked about Jordan leaving IX to go into

725
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:28,480
the bio... he couldn't do a bio field.

726
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:34,760
Well, I think now we know why he left, and so we're going to talk about all of that first.

727
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,880
I want to say thanks to Ting.

728
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:40,760
Go to linux.ting.com to support the show, and save $25 off your device.

729
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:46,520
Or if you have a CDMA or GSM device, whoa, yeah, because you know, everybody's got one

730
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,520
these days.

731
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,520
Heck yes.

732
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,520
Just check their BYOD page.

733
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,520
It's probably compatible.

734
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,520
Then you get $25 in service credit.

735
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,880
And you know what, Wes?

736
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:53,880
Average monthly Ting bill?

737
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:54,880
$23.

738
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:55,880
What?

739
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:56,880
Mm-hmm.

740
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,680
It's pretty cool, because they've got... so this is the genius of it.

741
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:05,840
So it turns out, guys, it's 2017, and the cellular infrastructure in the United States

742
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,760
is pretty much in place.

743
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,720
Everybody's heard of cell phones at this point.

744
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,360
We've all kind of got it figured out.

745
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,520
So Ting wanted to do something that was really different.

746
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:17,080
Now, I've been a Ting customer now for like two and a half, three years.

747
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,080
I don't know.

748
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:22,440
I mean, it's been a long time, and I love it, because they are an MVNO.

749
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:26,160
They are able to ride on top of other carrier networks that they create agreements with,

750
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:30,600
and they can create these agreements sort of as business needs drive it, so that they

751
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,860
have sort of an incredible flexibility here.

752
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:35,440
But the big thing is, is they're not out there digging holes in the ground and putting up

753
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,440
big towers.

754
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:41,780
I've actually had clients that were responsible for designing and zoning cell towers.

755
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:43,400
It's an entire industry on its own.

756
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:48,040
It is the kind of industry that only multi-billion dollar corporations can even think of getting

757
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,040
into.

758
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,560
And so Ting said, well, let's just short circuit all of that.

759
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:55,400
So they took the MVNO approach, and by creating agreements with multiple cellular providers,

760
00:38:55,400 --> 00:39:02,480
DMA and GSM networks, they can invest in things like an in-house call center of human beings

761
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,800
that work there in the office with them.

762
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,840
Their support staff actually works in the building.

763
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:11,880
That's where they can spend money on their website, and on their app, and on customer

764
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:15,720
service, and on creating incredibly competitive pricing plans.

765
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,720
It's pay for what you use wireless.

766
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:20,800
It's $6 a month, and then just your usage on top of that.

767
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,800
They got a great dashboard.

768
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,760
You can turn services on and off as you need it.

769
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,840
You want to turn off a line.

770
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,160
There's no early termination fee.

771
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,600
There's no contract.

772
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,600
You don't want data.

773
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,600
You need data.

774
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,600
You only want calls.

775
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,600
You only want text.

776
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,600
You can do it all with Ting.

777
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,120
And they've got a savings calculator you can try out.

778
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:37,520
And when you go there, linux.ting.com, also check out their blog.

779
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:41,340
If you've switched to Ting since you've heard some of our ads, and you have a story to share,

780
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:44,160
you could win $100 Ting credit.

781
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:48,640
Just start by going to linux.ting.com, and a big thank you to Ting for sponsoring this

782
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,920
here, Unplugged Program.

783
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:55,440
So let's finish the FreeNAS thing, because we started that, then we'll get to Mobi.

784
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,360
Mobi is happening right now.

785
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:00,720
There's a DockerCon going on, and it's all happening.

786
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,560
But while I was gone, FreeNAS Coral was canned.

787
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,560
Development was halted.

788
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:09,600
It was relegated to technology preview status.

789
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:14,440
They're going to revert back to the FreeNAS 9 code base.

790
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:18,760
My rough understanding, and I'm going to tell you that I don't know much, and you could

791
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:22,720
get a much better, much clearer explanation tomorrow on BSD Now, because I think they're

792
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:27,360
going to have Chris Moore on to talk about all of this.

793
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,800
And Alan happens to know Chris, so that should work out pretty well.

794
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,520
They should be able to cover this.

795
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:37,120
I would expect BSD Now to have probably the best coverage out there tomorrow.

796
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:41,920
But what I seem to understand at this point is that there was essentially two teams on

797
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,200
FreeNAS working FreeNAS.

798
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,600
There's the FreeNAS 9 team kind of keeping that going and supported, and then there was

799
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:50,320
Jordan's team, which was sort of creating the new revolutionary product, the FreeNAS

800
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,640
Coral.

801
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:57,780
And what happened is their internal metrics were showing that they were having a massive

802
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:03,640
abandon rate of FreeNAS Coral, something like a huge percentage.

803
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:06,400
I think it's maybe somewhere in the 50% range or greater.

804
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:12,080
We're reverting back to FreeNAS 9, and so they were just seeing... I think that metric,

805
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:16,720
this is from what I've read, I think that metric freaked them out the most.

806
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,840
And they probably said, Jordan, you should probably go find something else to do.

807
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,920
We're going to not do this anymore.

808
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:26,200
And the team that they had kept around working on FreeNAS 9, in the meantime, was shoring

809
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:31,820
up the existing base, was developing a new UI, and actually has a lot of super great

810
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:35,160
plans in place already for FreeNAS 9.

811
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,720
Chris Moore was pretty clear about some of the features they're working on in a forum

812
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:41,440
post, and he was already showing screenshots of the new UI.

813
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:45,000
They're working, I think, maybe on getting some of the FreeNAS Coral plug-ins to work

814
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
as well under...

815
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Okay.

816
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Yeah.

817
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,800
So, I mean, they're definitely doing a pretty tight about face, and have a pretty good plan

818
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:55,880
B, but there is some egg on the face here, because FreeNAS has sort of achieved this

819
00:41:55,880 --> 00:42:01,320
rock solid appliance status, and when you take a big leap like this, and it doesn't

820
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:07,000
land right, it can sometimes, that can stick to the reputation of the project a bit.

821
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,440
Now I got to really think that any serious enterprise installation wasn't jumping to

822
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:15,720
the next version of FreeNAS yet, so the effect rate is probably exaggerated.

823
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:19,040
Hopefully it's just people who are curious about it.

824
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,960
I think probably because the type of user base it was updating is the type of user base

825
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:26,920
that goes to Reddit forums and IRCs, it's probably more of an exaggerated issue, but

826
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:30,760
they have their own internal metrics that showed that there was a high abandonment rate.

827
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:31,760
That's my understanding, at least.

828
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:35,480
And it sounds like they have a pretty good plan going forward.

829
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:38,880
But whew, that is a rough thing to do.

830
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:39,880
Yeah.

831
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:40,880
Yeah.

832
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:41,880
And, you know.

833
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:44,240
Not the kind of thing you want to see for your storage appliance.

834
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,240
Yeah.

835
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:46,240
Yeah.

836
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,600
50%, it was 50%, says the chat room.

837
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:51,720
Yeah, that's a huge, that's a huge reversion rate.

838
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:55,440
So Chris will be on BSD Now tomorrow to talk more about it, so I'll be watching that, because

839
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,160
that, that affects us.

840
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:01,040
So let's talk about, we have a little, right now while we're recording this show, there's

841
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,040
a little bit of breaking news.

842
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,040
What?

843
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:07,760
CNN breaking news.

844
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:15,120
The DockerCon in Austin, Texas is going on right now, and the Docker company announced

845
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:16,120
Moby.

846
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:19,320
And I wasn't really going to talk about it on the show, but after going back and forth

847
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:22,840
a lot in chat, you and I actually kind of whittled down what the hell this is and why

848
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:26,160
it actually matters, and why it could be a good thing.

849
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,280
So we're going to talk about it now.

850
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:31,920
But I want to start just reading it to you, and I want to see, okay, somebody, let's see,

851
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:36,040
let's, we got to pick, I say, let's, let's, William, are you up for a game?

852
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:37,840
Is he there?

853
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:38,840
William, are you there?

854
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:39,840
How about, okay.

855
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:40,840
Let's, let's pick on Rotten.

856
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:42,840
Michael, are you up for a game?

857
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:45,360
Somebody, somebody, nobody.

858
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:46,520
It depends on the kind of game.

859
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:51,720
Well, I'm going to read to you the description of the Moby project, and I want you to guess

860
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:53,680
what it is that it does.

861
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:54,680
Fun.

862
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:55,680
Okay.

863
00:43:55,680 --> 00:44:00,360
So the Moby project is a new open source project to advance the software containerization

864
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:04,600
movement and help the ecosystem take containers mainstream.

865
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,600
Okay.

866
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:11,120
No, yeah, I wouldn't have a guess, but that's, that's their description.

867
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:12,120
All right.

868
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:13,120
I'll read a little more.

869
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:16,800
It provides a library of components, a framework for assembling them into custom container

870
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:23,680
based systems, and a place for all container enthusiasts to experiment and exchange ideas.

871
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,480
Is it a store or something?

872
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:26,480
I know, or a forum.

873
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,400
It could be like something like a discussion forum, right?

874
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,400
All right.

875
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:30,400
I'll read a little more for you.

876
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,880
I mean, you know, we just got to go through this corporate ease.

877
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:36,360
Maybe we can figure it out if we just read a little more.

878
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:40,840
It turns out that Docker has been innovating in open source.

879
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:45,200
As a company, Docker uses open source as their innovation lab, they say.

880
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:48,920
And last year, our customers started to ask for Docker on many platforms beyond Linux,

881
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:54,960
Mac, Windows, and desktop, and Windows servers, and cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and Googs.

882
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:58,480
We created a dozen Docker editions specialized for these platforms in order to be able to

883
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:02,240
build and ship these specialized editions in a relatively short time with small teams

884
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:07,040
in a scalable way without having to reinvent components, but also assemble components and

885
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:11,380
borrow an idea from the car industry where assemblies of components and reuse to build

886
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:12,880
completely different cars.

887
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:13,880
Okay.

888
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:16,520
Oh, see, I know exactly what this is now.

889
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:19,120
So okay, so we've read quite a bit.

890
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:22,600
In fact, we've read through the entire description of what this is now.

891
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:25,120
That is the extent of what it is.

892
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:35,320
Then they then later reiterate that it's a library, a framework, and a reference assembly.

893
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:40,160
It took Wes and I five minutes in chat to parse what the hell any of this means, and

894
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:43,800
I bring this up just simply because I find this astonishing that first of all, a company

895
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:46,280
... Well, actually, I think it plays a larger role here.

896
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:48,760
I think I figured out what my problem with Docker is.

897
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:52,440
My problem with Docker is they're shipping... They're basically taking advantage of

898
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:54,720
a feature that comes built into the operating system.

899
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:59,360
And so because that's such a commoditized product, they have to commoditize the ecosystem.

900
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:02,080
They have to monetize the ecosystem.

901
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:05,280
And so Docker has to come up with a way to be relevant when you can mix and match your

902
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,280
environment.

903
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:13,680
In fact, in here in this blog post, they talk about containers have been massively adopted,

904
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:19,360
but in a lot of cases, customers are building their own unique individualized component

905
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:26,000
stacks for their particular industry like manufacturing, or healthcare, or web hosting.

906
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,760
And that translates to Docker not being in the game.

907
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:32,320
The problem is that people... Because you can just use built-in components in the operating

908
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:36,080
system, you don't really have to use Docker if you just need something specific.

909
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:39,400
If you don't need to share with the wider Docker ecosystem, right?

910
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:42,080
So they had to come up with a way to solve this problem because the issue is-

911
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:43,080
How do we get to there?

912
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:46,640
The issue is they're selling water to a community that has a town well.

913
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:50,300
And so they have to either sell the cups or the buckets.

914
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:53,680
And so they've come up with a way to sell more buckets, in a sense, right?

915
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:54,680
What is Mobi, Wes?

916
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:55,680
Help me understand.

917
00:46:55,680 --> 00:47:00,360
Mobi is like a toolkit for making something like Docker.

918
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:06,080
So it's frameworks, libraries, tools to help you take various pieces of what you might

919
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:11,080
need for a full containerized application, maybe even distributed, right?

920
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:17,480
So like schedulers, loggers, storage appliances or abstractions, networking configurations,

921
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:18,480
all of those things, right?

922
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:19,600
You can get with different pieces.

923
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:22,240
Sure, right now it uses all the default Docker things, right?

924
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,440
So container D is their default runtime.

925
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:29,640
But in theory, they're trying to make it so you can then easily and with tools to help

926
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:33,480
distribute them, package them, slot these pieces in and out.

927
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:38,320
So you could use Rocket or LXD maybe instead of Docker as the runtime, but you could still

928
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:39,560
use the Docker...

929
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:43,360
Yeah, or maybe even something as minimal as Run C or other things, yeah.

930
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,360
I don't know.

931
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:45,360
I've not played with it.

932
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:46,960
They do have a GitHub page up.

933
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:50,600
It actually looks like Docker is moving all of their open source things under the Mobi

934
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:52,160
project now.

935
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:56,100
So here's what I found interesting about the story, is essentially what happened at Docker

936
00:47:56,100 --> 00:48:00,800
is they had to come up with a way to create Docker for Windows and for the Mac and all

937
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,740
these other web cloud platforms.

938
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:06,200
And I have wondered, how the hell are they building all these additions and not being

939
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:09,600
crushed by the weight of maintaining all these different versions of Docker?

940
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:13,680
Because the whole idea seems like it's just insane from a maintenance standpoint.

941
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:17,680
Especially if it's like the same, it started as this very like Linux specific thing.

942
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:18,680
Yeah, yes.

943
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:24,040
So what they did is they took the tool that they created to do all that work and they're

944
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:26,560
now releasing it open source and calling it Mobi.

945
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:29,840
And that's what this really is, is this is what let them build this mix and match pieces.

946
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:33,960
So on Windows, you can use the Docker runtime but use the Windows event log for logs and

947
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:35,600
stuff like that.

948
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:40,080
So anyways, Mobi project, big news everybody, and it probably actually will be a good way

949
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:42,920
for Docker to stay in the game even when you're not using a Docker stack.

950
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:46,760
Well, I think the thing they're missing is they haven't really convinced me yet because

951
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:48,720
they have to tell me about their synergy.

952
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:49,720
Right?

953
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:50,720
Yeah, definitely.

954
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:51,920
You should read there and count how many...

955
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:56,680
Wes and I were joking in chat that like they had like a quota of how many times they had

956
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:57,680
to say open source.

957
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:01,380
They were just throwing open source in there randomly, yeah.

958
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:02,480
It's super thick.

959
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:06,280
It's almost like they don't want you to understand what it is they're doing because there's easier

960
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:08,620
clearer ways to describe that.

961
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:13,200
I think the way we just described it is more clear and they didn't choose that.

962
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,100
And then you have to wonder what's the intent behind that.

963
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:17,000
Why are you choosing to write so thick?

964
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,840
That's the best I can describe it.

965
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:23,660
Like, you know, you take a look at the Solace project, nice, concise, clear communication

966
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:26,440
both in social and on their official blog post.

967
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:31,900
And part of that is because, you know, Josh is a great communicator but our friends over

968
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:35,800
at Solace have a new release that I think we'll talk more about next week after I've

969
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:40,320
had a chance to run it but what's interesting about this release is it's the first official

970
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:43,520
GNOME edition of Solace.

971
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:44,520
And also...

972
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:45,520
Interesting.

973
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:48,000
If you recall our conversation with Ikey a couple of weeks ago where he talked about

974
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,240
Clear Boot and doing bulletproof boot management.

975
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:51,640
Yes, I'm very interested in that.

976
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:53,440
This is the first version that ships with that.

977
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:54,440
Okay.

978
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:57,220
Yeah, so the Clear Boot manager is in there now which means down the road it'll be easy

979
00:49:57,220 --> 00:49:58,880
to run different types of kernels.

980
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:02,080
It'll be easy to roll back if there's a kernel upgrade gone wrong.

981
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:04,760
I thought it was interesting is they've done a few tweaks to the GNOME stack.

982
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:12,120
So it's GNOME 3.2.4 and they've made a few patches to like the EJ...

983
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:13,120
Where is it?

984
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:14,120
Oh, here it is.

985
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:17,160
They made a few patches to resolve items not appearing in the GNOME menu.

986
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:23,580
They've tweaked a few options in Nautilus, a few things for SDL games.

987
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:24,920
Pretty minimal stuff.

988
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:26,720
Pretty minimal stuff though for their...

989
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:31,640
So it's a pretty and they've even turned on a couple of extensions like a dash to dock

990
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:34,000
and a couple of other things.

991
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,960
So otherwise they're pretty straightforward GNOME implementation and now they also have

992
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:39,000
the Mate edition as well.

993
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,480
Three flavors now of Solus started out with just...

994
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:42,480
Those are all tasty.

995
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:45,840
So if I want to play with the Clear Boot manager, which flavor should I pick?

996
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:51,040
I want to ask Ikey if the Solus GNOME edition is a hedge against his whole switching budgie

997
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:52,760
to QT blowing up.

998
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:53,760
Oh, yeah.

999
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:54,760
That's a good question.

1000
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:58,040
I mean, or is there, I mean, which is a fine motivation, is that why you're including it

1001
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:03,220
because you want to give the people who are going to cry wolf over the changes, you want

1002
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:05,520
to give them a place to go?

1003
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:06,520
GNOME is just everywhere now.

1004
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:07,520
Yeah, it is everywhere.

1005
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:08,520
It's just everywhere.

1006
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:09,520
Sounds like overnight.

1007
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:13,840
Like 2017 is the year of GNOME.

1008
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:16,160
It's what the entire internet is talking about right now.

1009
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:21,480
I feel bad for my Plasma desktop friends because I'm over here running Plasma desktop and I

1010
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:23,880
feel like I'm a loner now.

1011
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:26,120
We need to talk about the Church of Neon.

1012
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:27,120
There we go.

1013
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:28,120
Yes.

1014
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:29,120
Are you feeling this at all?

1015
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:30,120
Heavily.

1016
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:31,120
Yeah.

1017
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:32,120
Yeah, I am.

1018
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:38,320
I've actually been in conversations with many people who all the time they would say something

1019
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:42,200
about GNOME being like, it's so great they're switching to GNOME.

1020
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:47,040
Not really because it means that they're kind of abandoning all of what they were doing

1021
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:50,480
because they even said that they're going to ship basically what GNOME wants.

1022
00:51:50,480 --> 00:52:00,120
So GNOME is not typically known for being receiving and receptive at all to anyone's

1023
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:05,640
opinion from any topic from any place in the world.

1024
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:11,580
So I would be shocked if Canonical had anything changed in GNOME ever.

1025
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:16,560
So I think that it's going to be basically just GNOME with Ubuntu slapped on top of it

1026
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:19,000
as like a branding and that's it.

1027
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,800
Which I consider that incredibly sad.

1028
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:23,320
I want to talk about that too.

1029
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:27,280
Let's go right into the 1704 review right now because I've been running Ubuntu GNOME

1030
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:36,900
1704 and while it's fine, it's very sad in a sense because so Rodden, it feels like there's

1031
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:38,080
no character to it.

1032
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:39,740
Like there's no distinctiveness.

1033
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:41,720
There's nothing unique about it.

1034
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:42,720
It's just GNOME.

1035
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:44,200
That's it.

1036
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:47,640
It's GNOME with Ubuntu branding.

1037
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:53,440
Which was great when I needed a refuge from Unity, which felt very Ubuntu heavy.

1038
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:57,840
But when there's nothing that represents Ubuntu anymore and it's just, I mean they've got

1039
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:02,160
to do something and it's got to be more than a wallpaper.

1040
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:05,520
I think that they're probably not going to do much at all.

1041
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:10,080
I mean I don't even think they're going to try to take over extensions at all, like even

1042
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:12,920
try to make a global menu or anything.

1043
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:17,960
I think they're just going to accept, just wash their hands of the situation of the customizations

1044
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:19,720
and just ship GNOME.

1045
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:26,020
Which I think would actually be a kind of a travesty because all of the cool innovations

1046
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:28,320
that they have done will be just thrown away.

1047
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:32,640
Yeah, I completely agree and it was weird because I didn't expect it.

1048
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:36,160
When I loaded Ubuntu GNOME, I was like, okay, here we go, I'm going to go to the future.

1049
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:42,200
I'm going to see what it's like in a future Ubuntu, oh my god, it's so sad.

1050
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:43,200
It's so sad.

1051
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:44,200
Like Antigros.

1052
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:46,760
You can't say that 17.10 will be different, they might do more customizations because

1053
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:51,320
they weren't really technically backing them yet, but I still don't think so.

1054
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:58,960
Yeah, Antigros has way more character and unique, Fedora even, just way more character

1055
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:01,800
and feel to it.

1056
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:05,800
Why do you pick Ubuntu?

1057
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:11,160
Once it's GNOME, is it just for their package repository?

1058
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:14,360
Compatibility, software compatibility.

1059
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:17,240
How does the GNOME desktop, how does it market itself there?

1060
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:18,240
How does it fit in with that?

1061
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:22,120
Well, now GNOME could be the... It's the same thing as what it was seven years

1062
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:28,360
ago when it was just 2010, 10.04, whatever, where it was basically GNOME, but with like

1063
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:31,120
... Well, okay, so I don't want to go too far

1064
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:33,800
down this path because I think this could be a separate discussion, but I disagree now

1065
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:40,640
because GNOME with GTK since 3.20 and with Flatpaks and the Software Center and all this

1066
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,880
work they've been doing with Builder.

1067
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:48,800
It's more now of an application target, like come write a GTK application for the GNOME

1068
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:49,800
platform.

1069
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:53,120
It's much more of that now than it was back when Canonical was originally shipping a GNOME

1070
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:54,120
desktop.

1071
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:57,400
I just wanted, before we move on, because Ike just joined us and so I want to talk about

1072
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:03,360
the Solus GNOME edition too while we're talking about GNOME, but Poppy, remember when Poppy

1073
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:04,360
used to come on this show?

1074
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:05,360
Yeah.

1075
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:06,360
Oh.

1076
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:07,360
That was great.

1077
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:08,360
I love that.

1078
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:09,360
I miss those guys.

1079
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:10,360
I miss those guys.

1080
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:11,360
I would love to go visit Poppy.

1081
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:12,360
Yeah.

1082
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:13,360
I would love that.

1083
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:14,360
That would be a lot of fun.

1084
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:15,360
Love that.

1085
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:20,000
But he did a really great blog post about how he configured GNOME on his 1604 desktop.

1086
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,320
So if you want to stick with the LTS to look more familiar.

1087
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:32,620
Just speaking of the Plasma thing, I made a video explaining how you could make Plasma

1088
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:37,360
look like Unity and function like Unity with the global menus, merging title bars, all

1089
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:40,240
that good stuff like the system menu and all kinds of stuff.

1090
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:44,600
And I think that if it wasn't even remotely possible for the canonical to even consider

1091
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:48,960
it that Plasma would be a fantastic foundation for Unity.

1092
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:52,000
And I don't mean like they should switch to Plasma.

1093
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:56,160
I think they should switch to Plasma for a foundation to continue the focus of Unity.

1094
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:58,760
Yeah, but I always thought that should have been the case when they were going to use

1095
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:00,360
Qt to begin with.

1096
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:02,120
Maybe Ike can tell us why he's not doing that.

1097
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:07,600
But before we get there, I also just wanted to say in the land of 1704 releases and all

1098
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:14,280
of the associated Ubuntu editions, our friend Wimpy has really blown the doors off with

1099
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:15,280
Mate 1704.

1100
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:18,960
And I'd say that even if he didn't come on this show.

1101
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:22,800
This is, I said it on last and it's true.

1102
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:27,600
This goes back to the era where there was a time where the dot 10 releases were so damn

1103
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:30,360
good that you were willing to throw out the LTS and upgrade.

1104
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:31,360
I remember that.

1105
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:32,360
That's what this is.

1106
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:37,880
You know, he's had work with, Ike's gone into this, work from Daniel from elementary OS

1107
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:38,880
has gone into this.

1108
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:40,680
But a lot of folks have put a lot of hard work in this.

1109
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:47,080
And I think it's just a killer release.

1110
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:52,080
And in fact, there's even a credit for producer Michael in here.

1111
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:53,080
Nice.

1112
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:55,440
What did you do, producer Michael?

1113
00:56:55,440 --> 00:57:00,480
I helped with the graphic stuff for icons and high DPI support, stuff like that.

1114
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:05,840
Yeah, we've got the Brisk menu in this one that Ike helped with.

1115
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:07,800
It's got a really nice theme.

1116
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:11,840
But the other thing that I thought was just a standout feature that just makes deployment

1117
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:17,000
Mate desktops really nice is the software boutique now by default does queued installations.

1118
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,000
You can queue up a bunch of stuff.

1119
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,180
I like that.

1120
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:24,760
You combine that with the fact that you've got a genuine GTK3 desktop using the traditional

1121
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:25,920
desktop paradigm.

1122
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:30,080
There's more options now for like pre-configured desktops that are really great.

1123
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:36,040
And the theme is, I can't even believe they can make Mate look this good.

1124
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:37,040
So it's 17.04.

1125
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:40,080
I think out of all of the Mate edition of 17.04, I think out of all of them is just

1126
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:41,080
an easy win.

1127
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:42,400
Yeah, it's a really nice one.

1128
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:46,840
If you want to, if you're installing it for anyone, you know, who works for so many people.

1129
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:50,840
I wish I could have all of these things on the LTS because I have a couple of computers

1130
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:53,480
in the studio that I want to reinstall.

1131
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:58,640
And I would love to put, so I have this machine over here that runs my mixer that soon will

1132
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:00,360
not be running my mixer anymore.

1133
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:05,040
And I'd like to put Linux, I'd like to put Ubuntu Mate, but I want it to look like this.

1134
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:06,040
But I want an LTS.

1135
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:07,040
Yes.

1136
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:08,040
But you don't want the, yeah, the temp.

1137
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:09,040
Damn it, Wimpy.

1138
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:12,800
Also, other people should definitely, if they installed 17.04, they should make sure that

1139
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:19,840
they check the box for the Ubuntu Mate welcome update because it inactivates a PPA that you

1140
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:26,040
can continuously get things, which is really important when applications are removed from

1141
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:31,760
the software boutique because of, like, they're not building for 17.04.

1142
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:34,760
And then as soon as they start building for it, it gets added back.

1143
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:35,760
That's nice.

1144
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:36,760
Oh yeah, that's really good.

1145
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:38,320
And you just get the latest, if you get the latest version, you get that?

1146
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:42,380
Yeah, it'll automatically, if you check the box, it'll automatically update Ubuntu Mate

1147
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:46,040
welcome, which also updates software boutique, so every time they make a change, you get

1148
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:47,040
it.

1149
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:48,040
Perfect.

1150
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:51,400
I also wanted to shout out, so for those of you who, like me, are trying out Ubuntu

1151
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:56,720
Gnome again for kind of, like, the first time, trying it out again for the first time, it's,

1152
00:58:56,720 --> 00:59:02,960
yeah, you may run into a few problems if you just have straight-up Chrome or now Firefox,

1153
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:07,640
so I have a link in the show notes on getting extensions installed, but cooler than that,

1154
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:12,040
you can also sync Gnome extensions between your desktops using Google Chrome, between

1155
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:13,040
your Gnome desktop.

1156
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:14,040
Really?

1157
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:15,040
Yeah.

1158
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:16,040
Tell me more.

1159
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:17,040
Yeah, sure.

1160
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:18,040
Isn't that interesting?

1161
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:19,040
Yeah.

1162
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:24,440
And you have to install the Gnome shell extension on your desktop using, there's a little sync

1163
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:25,440
feature in there.

1164
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:29,140
Once enabled, you can sync your Gnome extensions from, say, your desktop to other machines

1165
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:30,140
pretty much automatically.

1166
00:59:30,140 --> 00:59:34,480
Now, you have to go in and turn the sync feature on on each computer, but once you do that,

1167
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:40,120
yeah, and you don't have to have, you don't have to have straight-up, like, binary from

1168
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:41,120
Google Chrome.

1169
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:43,480
You can just get Chromium from the repo if you want.

1170
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:44,480
Isn't that neat?

1171
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:45,480
Yeah, that is awesome.

1172
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:51,360
Yeah, and only, you have to have the corresponding Gnome shell extension, Google Chrome shell.

1173
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:52,360
You gotta get that.

1174
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:59,280
Actually, I also made an extension for basically every browser, which gives you access to download

1175
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:02,040
the zip files for each extension, so you can just, like, store them if you want.

1176
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:03,040
Oh, good idea.

1177
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:04,040
Yeah, that's nice.

1178
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:08,920
So, you need the tweak tool, you know, the Gnome tweak tool, but you just get the zip

1179
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:11,400
file and just install it from there, and there you go.

1180
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:12,400
All right.

1181
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:15,680
So, let's mention DigitalOcean, then I'm gonna, let's talk to Aiki, because we gotta,

1182
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:21,000
this is, I would like to talk about the Gnome edition, and also if Aiki feels like he's

1183
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:26,000
more on an isolated island with QT now than ever, now that Canonical has gotten cold feet

1184
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,000
and running away.

1185
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,640
Running away from their dreams?

1186
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:34,160
DigitalOcean.com, go fulfill your dreams with a server in the cloud on their awesome infrastructure.

1187
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:37,640
Yeah, I mean, you could go rack it if you want, if you're insane, but DigitalOcean

1188
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:41,260
is a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering an easy and intuitive way for

1189
01:00:41,260 --> 01:00:42,260
you to get going.

1190
01:00:42,260 --> 01:00:45,760
You just spin up, create an account, and use our promo code DEO, unplugged, one word, and

1191
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:47,120
you get a $10 credit.

1192
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:51,420
You can use that to spin up a $5 rig, run it for two months, try it out, put a project

1193
01:00:51,420 --> 01:00:54,760
on there, a blog, maybe you wanna try Mastodon.

1194
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:59,560
I've seen a couple of guides now, I was looking on the pre-show, for setting them up on DigitalOcean.

1195
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:00,560
Or what about Mumble?

1196
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:01,560
Yeah.

1197
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:02,860
Mumble's another good one.

1198
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:06,680
If you wanna try out an Elias sync engine, run that on a DigitalOcean.

1199
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:07,680
I should probably try that again.

1200
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:08,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1201
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:11,320
Well, you know, they got a new version out which uses less syncing.

1202
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:12,320
Ooh.

1203
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:13,320
Less.

1204
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:16,760
But you can still run a component on your own server if you'd like.

1205
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:17,960
It's seriously easy.

1206
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:21,600
So we were talking about Docker earlier, one of the things that's really nice about DigitalOcean

1207
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:25,760
is you can deploy an entire application stack with everything installed for some apps, or

1208
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:32,000
you just do the base installation, or the sweet spot is Ubuntu LTS, Docker pre-loaded,

1209
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:36,800
with the repos from Docker, with the right GPG keys in there, with everything up to date,

1210
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:37,800
good to go.

1211
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:38,800
Easy peasy.

1212
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:40,240
Yeah, that's crazy powerful.

1213
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:41,960
That's just you can get trying something in no time.

1214
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:45,080
When you use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED, you can try it out for free.

1215
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:48,720
They got data centers all over the world, and they have the best interface in the business

1216
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:50,880
with an API to die for.

1217
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:51,880
An API to die for.

1218
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:56,240
I'm trying to make it rhyme, but I need something, an API to cry, cry for the API.

1219
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:57,960
I cry for that API.

1220
01:01:57,960 --> 01:01:58,960
I'm trying hard, Wes.

1221
01:01:58,960 --> 01:01:59,960
You really are.

1222
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:04,080
Crying for that API over at DigitalOcean.com, use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED, go spin up

1223
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:08,160
a Linux rig on their infrastructure, they use KVM for the virtualizer, Linux for the

1224
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:13,400
host, 40 gigabit connections into that hypervisor, I know it, and a beautiful control panel to

1225
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:15,640
top it all off at DigitalOcean.com.

1226
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:19,560
Also, check out their block storage.

1227
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:20,560
It's all SSD-based.

1228
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:21,560
It's crazy.

1229
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:24,080
DigitalOcean.com, use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

1230
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:26,600
Ike, you're supposed to be in bed.

1231
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:29,520
You weren't going to come on the show today because you are supposed to be asleep right

1232
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:30,520
now.

1233
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:32,480
That was the last I heard of it.

1234
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:34,080
You're a maniac.

1235
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:36,880
Well, you said things about solos.

1236
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:37,880
It's sort of like-

1237
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:38,880
It's turned off.

1238
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:39,880
It's turned off.

1239
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:40,880
Yeah.

1240
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:41,880
It's amazing.

1241
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:42,880
I don't know.

1242
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:43,880
That's almost spooky in a sense.

1243
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:47,200
So, Ike, first of all, congratulations on the new release.

1244
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:48,200
Yeah.

1245
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:49,200
Thank you very much.

1246
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:50,200
You've got a big deal.

1247
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:51,200
Got clear boot out the door.

1248
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:52,200
Very excited about that.

1249
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:53,200
Yeap.

1250
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:57,720
Well, let's talk about the GNOME edition because that's the big news, I think, and I say, sir,

1251
01:02:57,720 --> 01:02:59,520
you're hedging.

1252
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:00,520
You say I am hedging.

1253
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:01,520
Right?

1254
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:04,840
Well, I don't know about that, but it seems like it could be a possibility.

1255
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:08,040
No, I mean, we've had GNOME in the repos for ages.

1256
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:11,200
Like we've had GNOME, Shell, GDM, you know, it's been up on the Wiki and now the Help

1257
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:12,800
Center.

1258
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:17,020
And basically, it kind of felt a bit stupid not having an ISO for it because we have the

1259
01:03:17,020 --> 01:03:20,400
infrastructure tooling and all that just to put one out.

1260
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:25,160
And especially with budget going towards in the future, having that GNOME stack there

1261
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:28,960
and then not using it and then not making an ISO out of it kind of feels a bit stupid.

1262
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:31,960
And there are going to be people who are diehard GNOME.

1263
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:33,160
They want to stay on their site.

1264
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:37,880
So it's like, okay, well, here's an option and here's GNOME how we think it should be

1265
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:41,960
within soldiers, you know, like kind of fitting with our sanity.

1266
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:43,720
So that's what it mostly comes down to.

1267
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:47,160
So Josh is responsible for that ISO and he uses GNOME Shell daily.

1268
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:49,800
Well, thank you, Josh, because I think it's going to be the one I'll be loading on my

1269
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:51,180
machines for a bit, too.

1270
01:03:51,180 --> 01:03:52,440
It's fairly sexy.

1271
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:55,800
Tell me about the EGL device for EGL streams and mutter.

1272
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:59,080
What the hell is this and why does it matter?

1273
01:03:59,080 --> 01:04:02,560
Yeah, I mean, that's certainly not the sexiest news on the segment.

1274
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:03,560
I found it interesting.

1275
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:04,560
That's what Pharaonyx picked up on.

1276
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:07,320
No, I'm sitting here and you're bum reading right off the blog post here.

1277
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:12,120
Yeah, it's basically preliminary support for the Nvidia proprietary drivers on the mutter,

1278
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:13,120
so.

1279
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:16,000
Oh, no wonder why Pharaonyx is covering it.

1280
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Yeah, that does make sense.

1281
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Yeah.

1282
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,000
I like that, though.

1283
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,040
That actually, I'm actually I'm excited about that.

1284
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:22,600
I'm glad I asked.

1285
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:26,520
And then, of course, I have to ask, how is things going with Budgie?

1286
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:29,120
And do you kind of feel like you're off on a cute island now?

1287
01:04:29,120 --> 01:04:31,000
No, not at all.

1288
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:34,840
I've got Budgie 10.3.1 out now.

1289
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:36,320
We've actually fixed all tab.

1290
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:37,320
Yeah, congrats.

1291
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:43,040
Yeah, so basically, I kind of knew the way the release schedule was looking this weekend

1292
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:45,680
and I was like, OK, let's be sensible here.

1293
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:49,320
I'm not going to get it done because I haven't got it done so far.

1294
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:53,220
So I put a bounty up and I basically said on Thursday, I think it was, if anyone can

1295
01:04:53,220 --> 01:04:56,980
get it done before Sunday evening or was it Saturday evening, I think it was Saturday

1296
01:04:56,980 --> 01:04:57,980
evening.

1297
01:04:57,980 --> 01:04:58,980
I'll pay you 500 euros.

1298
01:04:58,980 --> 01:04:59,980
Wow.

1299
01:04:59,980 --> 01:05:03,400
And I was like, yeah, I mean, I wanted it done and a way for the community to get involved.

1300
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:04,400
That's great.

1301
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:05,400
I think it's awesome.

1302
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:09,360
And then there was free pull requests in and I basically said the first one that was, you

1303
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:12,920
know, first value pull request came in would be merged.

1304
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:16,440
So we had two active by the end of it and basically, they were both making fixes in

1305
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:17,440
parallel.

1306
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:21,600
It's like, well, it's kind of hard to say who really came first now.

1307
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:24,320
I was like, OK, well, there are bugs in each.

1308
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:28,600
And this particular one, which is by a member of the community called Tim, kind of ticks

1309
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:33,120
the boxes and it's something I can extend and fix afterwards, which it did.

1310
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:39,480
So Budgie 11 has been blocked by the lack of Budgie 10.3 because the idea was we fix

1311
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:44,240
these last little regressions and these annoying minor bugs like Altab, right?

1312
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:46,400
It was like the meme of Budgie.

1313
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:50,680
So if we can fix those, get those out of the way, then it's almost like 10.3 became a bit

1314
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:56,560
more like, well, I guess our Unity 7, really.

1315
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:57,560
Already already.

1316
01:05:57,560 --> 01:06:01,240
I know, too soon, too soon.

1317
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:03,920
So that becomes like our kind of LTS thing.

1318
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:09,200
And it buys me time to get Budgie 11 done and done how I want to do it.

1319
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:12,760
So yeah, it's going to be cool, it's going to be cool.

1320
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:13,760
All right.

1321
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:15,840
So now I got to go get this installed on a machine.

1322
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:16,840
Oh, yeah.

1323
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:17,840
OK.

1324
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:21,960
Let's just let's play armchair futurist and let's speculate for a moment.

1325
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:26,320
What if like what if you wake up one day, you look at some statistics, some metric that

1326
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:32,760
you look at and you say, holy crap, the gnome edition has become our number one download.

1327
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:35,760
People are downloading the gnome edition above and beyond everything else.

1328
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:36,760
Does anything change?

1329
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:39,880
Is there a is there a change in plans at all?

1330
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:44,600
I mean, not really, because it's kind of hard to gauge that with an existing user base as

1331
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:45,600
well.

1332
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:48,680
I mean, I can tell you now basically how they're doing.

1333
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:53,160
Let's look at Linux tracker on the torrents because, you know, I mean, Ike, you think

1334
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:54,160
about it.

1335
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:58,680
You're spending this weird, weird, weird time in the resurgence of gnome.

1336
01:06:58,680 --> 01:06:59,680
It's huge.

1337
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:02,680
And it's I mean, it's across I mean, even solace now you can get a gnome edition.

1338
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:07,760
And so it's really becoming it could become this really close to universal desktop.

1339
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:08,760
Almost.

1340
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:13,200
I mean, the other the other benefit that also brings in as well is flat back.

1341
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:14,200
Yeah, exactly.

1342
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:16,280
Think about it, because it's like they go hand in hand.

1343
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:19,760
So now we know across every distribution, there's going to be known, there's going to

1344
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:20,760
be flat back.

1345
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:21,760
Right.

1346
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:22,760
Well, that depends on your definition of benefit.

1347
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:26,440
Well, yeah, I mean, just loosely skating around that one.

1348
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:30,880
But looking at the download numbers now just for the torrents, because I know earlier on,

1349
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:34,800
between two of the mirrors, they've been 800 and 700 downloads total earlier on.

1350
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:39,160
We released I think, like five o'clock this morning or something stupid.

1351
01:07:39,160 --> 01:07:43,880
So the Mate ISO has had just 241 downloads.

1352
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:46,900
The gnome one has had 347 downloads.

1353
01:07:46,900 --> 01:07:49,400
So it's more popular than the Mate one now.

1354
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:52,040
And the Budgie one has had 499.

1355
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:53,520
The gnome one is repping pretty well.

1356
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:54,760
Of course, people are curious, right?

1357
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:55,760
They're taking a look.

1358
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:56,760
Oh, it's now 500.

1359
01:07:56,760 --> 01:07:57,760
Real sad updates.

1360
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:01,920
Well, and of course, I probably I don't know.

1361
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:02,920
I don't know.

1362
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:03,920
I don't know how I'll pull it down.

1363
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:04,920
I probably get a torrent.

1364
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:05,920
I've debated which one I want right now.

1365
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:06,920
I think I got to do the gnome one.

1366
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:07,920
I think.

1367
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:10,760
They are a little bit bigger this time.

1368
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:14,120
Like last time, there was 900 makes or so.

1369
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:17,060
And you know, like, we've been four months since we've done a release.

1370
01:08:17,060 --> 01:08:21,100
So it's been a bit of a while, you know, you're getting a bit rusty doing this kind of stuff.

1371
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:24,460
So I started looking through some of the older YouTube reviews, and you know, even listening

1372
01:08:24,460 --> 01:08:29,120
to some of the old Linux Unplugged things, and it's like, you start to collect some of

1373
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:30,120
the problems.

1374
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:33,200
And one of the ones that kept coming up is like, why is there not an office suite?

1375
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:39,000
Ah, so now they all have an office suite in them, which basically LibreOffice, you know,

1376
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,040
it's standard, but it's a bit chunky.

1377
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:47,040
So we put that in, taken out VLC and put in gnome MPV, but the Mate one still has VLC

1378
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:49,200
because gnome MPV just looks weird there.

1379
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:51,200
Like you have to go for traditional.

1380
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:54,840
Yeah, so now it's just under 1.2 gigs, so we got a little bit fatter.

1381
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:58,680
I think the choice to switch to gnome MPV was a good one when I saw that in the release

1382
01:08:58,680 --> 01:08:59,680
notes, I thought.

1383
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:00,680
It's pretty.

1384
01:09:00,680 --> 01:09:04,360
And enabling dash to dock by default, I think is a good choice too, especially for people

1385
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:05,880
that come in from Unity.

1386
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:06,880
Yeah.

1387
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:11,560
The one I'm most fond of in terms of the extension there is the tray icons plus that he's put

1388
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:12,560
in there.

1389
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:13,560
What was that?

1390
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:16,640
Well, normally you get the tray icons come out on the little legacy tray on the bottom

1391
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:19,800
left of the screen and just pokes out like a little freakish antenna.

1392
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:20,800
I never liked it.

1393
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:22,440
And now they're all up in the tray.

1394
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:25,320
So it's like it's the top icons extension kind of.

1395
01:09:25,320 --> 01:09:27,480
Yeah, I think it's like top icons plus or something.

1396
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:29,120
Yeah, top icons by legacy tray.

1397
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:30,120
I see.

1398
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:34,760
Yeah, that little tab just never quite, I just literally just accidentally activated

1399
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:35,760
it.

1400
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:36,760
What is this?

1401
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:37,760
While we're talking, I accidentally just triggered it.

1402
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:41,280
It's always, go away, go away, and it shows up on screen all the time.

1403
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:42,440
Yes, it does.

1404
01:09:42,440 --> 01:09:45,720
So we also have brisk menu now in the Mate edition.

1405
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:49,120
They're all 0.3, 0.5, I think we're on now.

1406
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:52,120
Basically the same version as Ubuntu Mate, like we're going parallel on there.

1407
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:53,120
That's great.

1408
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:54,120
Mm-hmm.

1409
01:09:54,120 --> 01:09:56,760
And they've got a lot of theming in which I'm jealous of.

1410
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:58,080
Martin got the theming sorted out.

1411
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:02,360
So it's even better integrated into Ubuntu Mate's theming now.

1412
01:10:02,360 --> 01:10:05,800
So it looks really nice over there.

1413
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:10,200
Which also brings in with Mate 1.18, also brings in lib input, which is nice.

1414
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:11,200
Yeah.

1415
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:15,800
There was a bit of a bug in the last release we did back in January where, unfortunately,

1416
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:21,400
the lib input driver got dragged in on one of the updates, which isn't fatal, but it

1417
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:23,920
stopped some of the configurations from being configurable.

1418
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:24,920
I see.

1419
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:30,280
But then as soon as we put Mate 1.18, it's just like, well, now it has lib input support.

1420
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:32,940
So that fixed that out.

1421
01:10:32,940 --> 01:10:35,640
Which means they're all using lib input now across all of the ISOs.

1422
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:39,520
I couldn't help but notice, too, there's several things in here that seem to be, well, overall

1423
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:44,400
improvements to NVMe drives, but also sort of a secondary effect is a couple of things

1424
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:48,400
in here ended up making MacBook support a little better, including better backlight

1425
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:51,560
support, it looks like, and support for the 2016 SSD.

1426
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:52,560
Yeah.

1427
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:58,760
I was looking at the 2013, 2014, and 2016 ranges of MacBooks and enabling support for

1428
01:10:58,760 --> 01:10:59,760
them.

1429
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:05,600
So we've got initial support for the new MacBook Pro from 2016.

1430
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:08,880
There's going to be some device drivers still missing, basically, until we backport more

1431
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:09,880
from 4.11.

1432
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:14,720
But we do have initial support for their NVMe drives, which that was the one that was up

1433
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:16,120
in the news last year.

1434
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:18,400
You couldn't use Linux on that at all.

1435
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:21,600
So backported that, you know, while it can.

1436
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:26,320
We've got the NVMe power saving patches backported from 4.11 as well.

1437
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:30,160
So they'll save like two to four watts or something overall.

1438
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:34,040
So it's a slightly lower power consumption.

1439
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:37,520
We've also changed basically the way that we do the CPU governor now.

1440
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:43,680
When it used to be back a while back, well, about a year back, we were always using the

1441
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:45,240
performance governor.

1442
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:49,720
Then we changed it to on-demand or power save, depending on whether you was using Intel P-state

1443
01:11:49,720 --> 01:11:51,160
or CPU pre.

1444
01:11:51,160 --> 01:11:56,160
Now we boot up all the time in performance, and once we got to the multi-user target,

1445
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:59,960
you know, using the directed system D, which everybody hates, but it was really useful

1446
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:00,960
here.

1447
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:01,960
So I like it for this.

1448
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:02,960
Yeah.

1449
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:03,960
We'll then change.

1450
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:05,800
If you're using Intel P-state, then it'll go down into power save.

1451
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:06,800
Sure.

1452
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:12,320
So you end up with maximum performance for boot up, and then once the system's loaded.

1453
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:13,320
Exactly.

1454
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:15,800
So you boot up as quick as you can and then save the battery afterwards.

1455
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:19,920
It's disabled under virtualization, so it'll just stay in performance mode, which is kind

1456
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:24,760
of logical because then it's controlled by the system outside the hypervisor anyway.

1457
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:26,040
That is really nice.

1458
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:27,040
Good.

1459
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:28,040
That's a good way to do it.

1460
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:33,160
So you're telling me that if I blow up the Arch install on my 2013 Macbook...

1461
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:35,760
When you get known 3.24, yeah.

1462
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:41,200
You're telling me it's possible to put that Solus might work pretty good on that 2013

1463
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:42,200
hardware?

1464
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:43,200
Yeah.

1465
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:46,080
I mean, I'd love to get some feedback, and if it's not, then we can just start doing

1466
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:47,080
more rapid snapshots.

1467
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:48,080
Interesting.

1468
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:51,560
I mean, I can't get myself one anyway.

1469
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:56,580
I would love to, but I can't really go out and justify that kind of money on one.

1470
01:12:56,580 --> 01:13:00,600
So the more feedback they're getting, the more I can fix, really.

1471
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:01,600
Yeah.

1472
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:05,880
I mean, if they made it with 32 gigs of RAM, I would almost consider falling on that sword

1473
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:10,600
just so I could also have a faster Final Cut machine, but you just can't justify it.

1474
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:12,080
You can't justify it.

1475
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:13,800
Yeah, it's a bit of money.

1476
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:17,440
My machine would literally have to die before I could justify it.

1477
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:19,040
The battery's not as great as it used to be.

1478
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:22,560
It's still okay, and the speakers are all right, but...

1479
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:23,560
Just too useful.

1480
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:26,080
It's just like, damn it, why won't this stupid thing die?

1481
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:28,520
And then the problem is, but then I would still have...

1482
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:30,520
I would have a mourning period if I had to buy a Macbook.

1483
01:13:30,520 --> 01:13:31,720
I would mourn that purchase.

1484
01:13:31,720 --> 01:13:33,400
We'd have to talk about it.

1485
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:34,400
Big buyer's remorse.

1486
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:38,720
The only way I'd feel better is if I could somehow improve a distribution support.

1487
01:13:38,720 --> 01:13:39,720
So I'd do it.

1488
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:40,720
I would do it.

1489
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:45,440
Well, Ike, I'm pretty excited about the release just for myself, personally, because I love

1490
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:46,440
the GNOME edition.

1491
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:49,060
I know it was in the repos, but you know what I always do is I would install the Budgie

1492
01:13:49,060 --> 01:13:51,600
edition and then I would go, yeah, I'm good.

1493
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:52,600
Yeah.

1494
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:56,440
Now you have something that's actually set up to be sane out of the box.

1495
01:13:56,440 --> 01:13:57,440
There's no fiddling.

1496
01:13:57,440 --> 01:14:00,600
And obviously you've got the normal stuff installed, so you've got the Chrome GNOME

1497
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:03,160
shell extension stuff, GNOME Tweet tool, that kind of stuff.

1498
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:04,160
Sorry, Andy.

1499
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:05,160
Oh, we were just talking about that.

1500
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:06,160
Cool.

1501
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:07,160
So that's awesome.

1502
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:10,800
There are a couple of updates coming through in the next day or two.

1503
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:14,800
I basically wanted to speed up the boot even more because apparently I have something wrong

1504
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:15,800
with me.

1505
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:16,800
I can't stop.

1506
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:17,800
Yeah, I don't blame you.

1507
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:18,800
I just can't stop it.

1508
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:21,600
And I was like, oh, I've spotted an opportunity.

1509
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:27,080
So you don't quite get a silent boot at the moment, and part of that is regressing the

1510
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:28,080
boot time.

1511
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:31,880
So I fixed that today so it's an absolutely silent boot.

1512
01:14:31,880 --> 01:14:36,200
I don't want to splash in there because then you're adding like 30 to 40 megs to every

1513
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:40,600
upload because you're including Plimoth and then you're adding like five, six, seven seconds

1514
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:41,600
to the boot.

1515
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:44,120
It's like, let's just make it silent instead.

1516
01:14:44,120 --> 01:14:45,120
So I've managed to do that.

1517
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:49,200
So until X starts, you'll see nothing but black screen.

1518
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:53,000
It's lush and that in itself on my system.

1519
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:58,320
So I'm already booting in about 1.7 seconds on this Broadwell NUC.

1520
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:03,060
Today I've managed to shave in over 450 milliseconds off of that.

1521
01:15:03,060 --> 01:15:07,120
So if that's my SSD booting in that time on my Broadwell NUC, you can imagine how something

1522
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:10,060
like Skull Canyon is going to go.

1523
01:15:10,060 --> 01:15:14,400
Or even people with older systems because then it grows exponentially.

1524
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:19,760
So those updates we come through, we now we pre-link all of the binaries in the unit Ramfests

1525
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:25,280
and strip them so that they actually start up quicker because they haven't got to work

1526
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:27,080
with a linker to find anything.

1527
01:15:27,080 --> 01:15:30,740
We now got AMD early boot code support now as well.

1528
01:15:30,740 --> 01:15:34,840
So that'll hot patch the microcode onto the CPU when it's starting up.

1529
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:37,240
So we've got all of that sexiness to come from this couple of days.

1530
01:15:37,240 --> 01:15:41,080
And that'll be 4.9.2 free, which I got packaged today.

1531
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:42,080
That's awesome.

1532
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:44,320
I mean, he doesn't fall asleep at the keyboard because he's staying up.

1533
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:45,320
Yeah.

1534
01:15:45,320 --> 01:15:49,960
He's like, why does the commit message just say zzzz?

1535
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:51,800
Well, congrats.

1536
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:55,240
So the snapshot for 2017.04.18.0 is out.

1537
01:15:55,240 --> 01:15:57,600
I'm going to go download it.

1538
01:15:57,600 --> 01:15:58,600
And you can read.

1539
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:03,480
I like also the nice, clear snapshot notes by Josh.

1540
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:04,840
It's nice to just read through all of that.

1541
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:05,840
Type free.

1542
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:06,840
Yeah.

1543
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:07,840
Did you see the change log at the end of it?

1544
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:08,840
Yeah, actually.

1545
01:16:08,840 --> 01:16:10,240
You know what I was thinking when I saw that?

1546
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:11,240
That was machine-generated.

1547
01:16:11,240 --> 01:16:12,240
Yeah.

1548
01:16:12,240 --> 01:16:13,240
We'll be honest.

1549
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:16,280
But it's been a long time since I've seen that, really.

1550
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:17,560
That doesn't happen as much anymore.

1551
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:19,120
There's a few projects that still do it.

1552
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:20,120
Yeah.

1553
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:21,760
I mean, we do that for the primary one.

1554
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:24,920
And then when we looked at it, it was like, Jesus Christ, that's obscene.

1555
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:27,800
We've got to include it now, right?

1556
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:29,800
I love that.

1557
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:30,800
That must be.

1558
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:31,800
Yeah.

1559
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:34,400
We've definitely got to put that in there.

1560
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:35,680
That's basically four months.

1561
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:38,880
But that's only showing what's changed on the budget I saw.

1562
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:39,880
Oh.

1563
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:40,880
Oh, really?

1564
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:41,880
Jeez.

1565
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:43,920
Wow, that's quite the list.

1566
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:50,720
So that's not like the repos themselves, which have now grown to such a point that, well,

1567
01:16:50,720 --> 01:16:55,120
you can imagine when we started out with Solus, like certain scripts and systems that we used,

1568
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:56,120
everything just worked.

1569
01:16:56,120 --> 01:16:59,240
And we've got this script that monitors the packages coming into the repo.

1570
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:02,240
And that's been fine for a long time.

1571
01:17:02,240 --> 01:17:05,580
But we started to get to a point where we'll keep free back versions.

1572
01:17:05,580 --> 01:17:09,960
And in between those, you have the deltas, which is fine if you follow that bit so far.

1573
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:14,200
Then when I actually counted the packages the other day in the repos, it was like 75,000

1574
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:17,460
EL package files flown across the repo.

1575
01:17:17,460 --> 01:17:21,440
And the script that monitors them has to index the repo every single time.

1576
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:22,440
Oh, boy.

1577
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:28,400
So it's going through 75,000 files just to add one new one each time.

1578
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:32,040
I was like, right, this might have been a design flaw.

1579
01:17:32,040 --> 01:17:36,560
So that made our release 104 minutes late the other day.

1580
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:38,160
We started off with a different version number.

1581
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:39,160
It was the 17th.

1582
01:17:39,160 --> 01:17:44,640
And then because the script was so long, we switched back to the 18th.

1583
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:47,440
I'd already put up the Twitter post as well with the version number.

1584
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:48,440
Yikes.

1585
01:17:48,440 --> 01:17:49,440
That is funny.

1586
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:50,440
That's a good story.

1587
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:51,440
The secrets of releases.

1588
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:54,040
Yeah, the behind the scenes secrets right there.

1589
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:56,360
Well, Ike, thank you very much, sir, for coming on.

1590
01:17:56,360 --> 01:17:57,360
My pleasure.

1591
01:17:57,360 --> 01:17:59,520
I'm glad we were able to make it work.

1592
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:03,920
And we'll have a link to the release notes in the show notes if you guys want to download.

1593
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:07,200
And check out Ike and the team's fine, fine work.

1594
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:10,880
They also have a link to the 1704 releases in the show notes.

1595
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:12,720
There's just so much good stuff to try.

1596
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:16,020
Also, go check out more of Ike on Late Night Linux.

1597
01:18:16,020 --> 01:18:17,020
That's a great podcast.

1598
01:18:17,020 --> 01:18:20,080
They just had an episode come out a couple of, or yesterday, I think.

1599
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:21,680
So go check all that out.

1600
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:24,040
Mr. Wes, where can people find you on the Twitters?

1601
01:18:24,040 --> 01:18:25,140
At WesPay.

1602
01:18:25,140 --> 01:18:26,440
And also on the TechSnap program.

1603
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:27,440
That's right.

1604
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:28,440
Just stay tuned.

1605
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:29,440
I'm at Chris Elias.

1606
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:30,640
The network's at Jupyter Signal.

1607
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:34,120
Find us live at JupyterBroadcasting.com slash calendar.

1608
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:37,800
We'll be back here next Tuesday.

1609
01:19:04,120 --> 01:19:24,480
I secretly use ArchLina.

1610
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:25,480
Oh, probably stop by.

1611
01:19:25,480 --> 01:19:26,480
That was good.

1612
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:27,480
Hey, good.

1613
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:28,480
I thought he was able to pop in there for a second.

1614
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:29,480
That's nice.

1615
01:19:29,480 --> 01:19:30,480
Missed you, bud.

1616
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:33,440
I think, I think you should take the Solace challenge, Wes.

1617
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:34,440
Yeah.

1618
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:35,440
I think you should do it.

1619
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:36,440
All right.

1620
01:19:36,440 --> 01:19:37,440
It's happening.

1621
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:39,840
I think this machine, too, right here, possibly could be good for Solace.

1622
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:40,840
Yes.

1623
01:19:40,840 --> 01:19:43,720
You know, now that I'm not going to be doing last, I don't have to install a whole bunch

1624
01:19:43,720 --> 01:19:45,840
of apps for the pics all the time.

1625
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:46,840
It changes a fair bit.

1626
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:47,840
Yeah.

1627
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:48,840
It's changing a lot of things for me, actually.

1628
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:51,880
I'm realizing all the little things in life that will be different for me.

1629
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:52,880
Yeah.

1630
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:53,880
So yeah.

1631
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:54,880
All right.

1632
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:55,880
JupyterTitles.com, guys.

1633
01:19:55,880 --> 01:19:56,880
JupyterTitles.com.

1634
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:58,080
Did you guys see the new Google Earth came out today?

1635
01:19:58,080 --> 01:19:59,080
No, really?

1636
01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:00,080
Yeah.

1637
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:01,080
Check this thing out.

1638
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:05,740
This is, like, serious, like, 3D rendering happening.

1639
01:20:05,740 --> 01:20:06,740
So like, yeah, look.

1640
01:20:06,740 --> 01:20:07,740
WebGL.

1641
01:20:07,740 --> 01:20:08,740
This is, yeah.

1642
01:20:08,740 --> 01:20:12,000
Using WebGL, we're going to zoom in here to the Eiffel Tower, and look, they 3D render

1643
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,000
everything now.

1644
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:14,000
Wow.

1645
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:15,000
Yeah.

1646
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:16,400
That is actually kind of neat.

1647
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:17,560
Looks pretty neat.

1648
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:21,680
And then they have this feature now where you can randomly go to cool places, like,

1649
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:22,680
you can roll the dice.

1650
01:20:22,680 --> 01:20:23,680
Why fly?

1651
01:20:23,680 --> 01:20:24,680
You could just Google it.

1652
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:25,680
Yeah.

1653
01:20:25,680 --> 01:20:26,680
So like, let's go over here to, like, vwoom.

1654
01:20:26,680 --> 01:20:27,680
Over to Hawaii.

1655
01:20:27,680 --> 01:20:30,000
Look at that.

1656
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,000
Zoom right in.

1657
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,000
That's actually...

1658
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,000
That's pretty cool.

1659
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,400
You see how it renders the mountains all cool, like, and whatnot?

1660
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:39,400
Like, it really puts some work into this damn thing.

1661
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:40,400
JupyterTitles.com.

1662
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:41,400
JupyterTitles.com.

1663
01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:42,400
Oh, sorry.

1664
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:43,400
Hello, my group.

1665
01:20:43,400 --> 01:20:44,400
Hi.

1666
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:45,400
I missed you.

1667
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:46,600
Thanks for being here, guys.

1668
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:47,600
All y'all.

1669
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:48,600
Yes.

1670
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:49,600
Very much so.

1671
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:50,600
Look at that.

1672
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:51,600
How cool is that, Wes?

1673
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:52,600
Wow.

1674
01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:53,600
All right.

1675
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:54,600
We're going to have to play with that later.

1676
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:55,600
Yeah.

1677
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:56,600
It's smooth, too.

1678
01:20:56,600 --> 01:20:57,600
Yeah.

1679
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:59,160
Well, it's not on all my computers, but on the ones with the higher-end video, dedicated

1680
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:00,960
graphics, it seems to be working pretty well.

1681
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:05,600
Now we're going to go to Lake Superior, one of the large Great Lakes in North America.

1682
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:06,600
Look at that.

1683
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:07,600
That is big.

1684
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:08,600
Yeah.

1685
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:09,600
So that's the view.

1686
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:11,760
And then when you zoom in, you can go to 3D mode here.

1687
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:17,720
So if you tap 3D mode, it starts to render everything out.

1688
01:21:17,720 --> 01:21:19,880
Oh, wow.

1689
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:20,880
Some are better than others.

1690
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:21,880
Yeah.

1691
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:22,880
Yeah.

1692
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:23,880
Look at Google Go.

1693
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:24,880
Look at them go.

1694
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:25,880
It's really...

1695
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:26,880
If you think about...

1696
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:27,880
I don't want...

1697
01:21:27,880 --> 01:21:28,880
Oh, you can...

1698
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:30,080
Big Bend National Park here.

1699
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:31,080
Let's go look at Big Bend.

1700
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:32,080
Look.

1701
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:33,080
We're going all around the world, Wes.

1702
01:21:33,080 --> 01:21:36,080
Going all around the world, Wes.

1703
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:37,080
See?

1704
01:21:37,080 --> 01:21:38,080
And you do podcasting.

1705
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:39,080
You get to travel the world.

1706
01:21:39,080 --> 01:21:40,080
Look at that.

1707
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:41,080
Yeah.

1708
01:21:41,080 --> 01:21:42,080
Yeah.

1709
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:43,080
Cool.

1710
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:44,080
Yeah.

1711
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:45,080
All right.

1712
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:46,080
JBtitles.com.

1713
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:47,080
Yeah.

1714
01:21:47,080 --> 01:21:48,080
Let's pick a title.

1715
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:49,080
Is there anything in the mobile room that we wanted to pick up that didn't get covered

1716
01:21:49,080 --> 01:21:50,080
in the show?

1717
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:51,080
Anybody want to...

1718
01:21:51,080 --> 01:21:52,080
Oh, there's an open floor for a couple more minutes before we go.

1719
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:53,080
Ubuntu's bare gnome.

1720
01:21:53,080 --> 01:21:55,840
That's not bad.

1721
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:59,000
The giant gnome rolling in the Linux.

1722
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:08,840
The chaos of disunity, gnome hunter gnawing on gnome, year of gnome, Docker's whale of

1723
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:09,840
a tail.

1724
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:10,840
Oh, ww.

1725
01:22:10,840 --> 01:22:11,840
Nice.

1726
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:12,840
You're so funny.

1727
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:13,840
I like it.

1728
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:15,360
I see what you did there, ww.

1729
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:16,840
I see what you did there.

1730
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:17,840
Tee hee.

1731
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:18,840
Tee hee hee.

1732
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:19,840
We love you.

1733
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:20,840
Tee hee hee hee.

1734
01:22:20,840 --> 01:22:21,840
Oh, my God.

1735
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:29,320
Mr. Sending Man.

1736
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:32,320
Amazing.

1737
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:37,320
Oh, my God.

1738
01:22:37,320 --> 01:22:40,320
Making the cutest rat I've ever seen.

1739
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:41,320
That's fantastic.

1740
01:22:41,320 --> 01:22:42,320
All right.

1741
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:45,400
And you should send me that so I can play it with high fidelity over here, because that's

1742
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:46,400
good.

1743
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:49,280
Yeah, that's probably not good through my mic.

1744
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:50,280
Is it online?

1745
01:22:50,280 --> 01:22:51,280
Can you link to it?

1746
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:52,280
Yeah, I can link to it over here.

1747
01:22:52,280 --> 01:22:53,280
That's funny.

1748
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:56,480
I don't have the files right now, but I can get it.

1749
01:22:56,480 --> 01:22:57,480
Let's see.

1750
01:22:57,480 --> 01:22:58,480
Fairly sexy.

1751
01:22:58,480 --> 01:22:59,480
I had it on my phone.

1752
01:22:59,480 --> 01:23:00,480
A quote from...

1753
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:01,480
You'll probably get copyrighted.

1754
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:02,480
Yeah, right.

1755
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:03,480
I know.

1756
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:05,840
Ubuntu's bear gnome is up there by Kawasaki.

1757
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:08,120
Oh, I'm hungry all of a sudden.

1758
01:23:08,120 --> 01:23:09,120
Didn't I have lunch?

1759
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:10,120
I did have lunch.

1760
01:23:10,120 --> 01:23:11,120
What the hell's up with that?

1761
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:12,120
The giant gnome...

1762
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:13,120
You've been podcasted, man.

1763
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:14,120
Yeah, I worked up an appetite.

1764
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:15,120
Woo.

1765
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:16,120
Alexa.

1766
01:23:16,120 --> 01:23:19,320
Appetite for a nap.

1767
01:23:19,320 --> 01:23:20,320
Turn on JB1.

1768
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:29,680
Get those lights going for you.

1769
01:23:29,680 --> 01:23:30,680
That was a good...

1770
01:23:30,680 --> 01:23:31,680
That was really well done.

1771
01:23:31,680 --> 01:23:32,680
Now that's really stuck in my head.

1772
01:23:32,680 --> 01:23:36,000
What do you think of Ubuntu's bear gnome?

1773
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:37,000
It's not bad.

1774
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:38,000
Yeah?

1775
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,000
You don't love it?

1776
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:40,000
Yeah?

1777
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:45,000
I don't know how I feel about it.

1778
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:46,000
I don't hate it.

1779
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:49,000
I bet the people seem to like it.

1780
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:50,960
Gnomeo gnomeo.

1781
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:55,920
I thought as far as echo commands go, I think that echo one's safe because probably nobody

1782
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:57,480
else has any devices called JB1.

1783
01:23:57,480 --> 01:23:58,480
Yes.

1784
01:23:58,480 --> 01:23:59,480
That seems pretty easy.

1785
01:23:59,480 --> 01:24:00,480
Yeah.

1786
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:01,480
I also like these.

1787
01:24:01,480 --> 01:24:04,120
Are we gonna have to get to the point where all your commands are random strings?

1788
01:24:04,120 --> 01:24:05,120
These are.

1789
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:09,960
I call these Shatner's hair lights just because there's so many lights in here that Alexa...

1790
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:10,960
Cancel.

1791
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:11,960
Cancel.

1792
01:24:11,960 --> 01:24:15,120
Starts to get confused and mixes...

1793
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:16,120
Cancel.

1794
01:24:16,120 --> 01:24:17,120
Stop.

1795
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:18,120
Shut up.

1796
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:19,120
Shut up.

1797
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:20,120
There we go.

1798
01:24:20,120 --> 01:24:21,120
She wants to be with you.

1799
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:23,800
So she gets confused because they all have light in the name.

1800
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:26,200
So you gotta come up with these totally diverse names.

1801
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:31,360
So I got flow lights and I got hair lights and ambient lights and accent lights and...

1802
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:32,360
Yeah.

1803
01:24:32,360 --> 01:24:34,240
So you should just like...

1804
01:24:34,240 --> 01:24:38,000
Have you tried, Alexa, what is a Whopper?

1805
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,000
I know, actually.

1806
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:40,720
I haven't tried that.

1807
01:24:40,720 --> 01:24:44,440
Alexa, what is a Whopper?

1808
01:24:44,440 --> 01:24:49,480
It's a signature hamburger sold by the international fast food restaurant, chain Burger King and

1809
01:24:49,480 --> 01:24:53,480
its Australian franchise, Hungry Jack's.

1810
01:24:53,480 --> 01:24:54,480
I want to be some Hungry Jack's.

1811
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:57,400
I didn't know they had a Hungry Jack's subsidiary.

1812
01:24:57,400 --> 01:24:58,400
I didn't know that.

1813
01:24:58,400 --> 01:25:02,040
It's really too bad when Hungry Jack is not nearly as...

1814
01:25:02,040 --> 01:25:04,160
I'd rather be the Burger King, personally.

1815
01:25:04,160 --> 01:25:06,480
The OK Google thing.

1816
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:08,480
I'm amazed at how well that works.

1817
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:14,080
My phone was completely across the room and that TV was able to trigger my phone.

1818
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:15,080
I was...

1819
01:25:15,080 --> 01:25:18,640
Actually, so Google says they put out a command to stop it, but what it really does is it

1820
01:25:18,640 --> 01:25:22,960
still recognizes the trigger word and it still bleeps at you and then it just immediately

1821
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:23,960
cancels.

1822
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:25,840
But it still triggers your phone and wakes it up.

1823
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:26,840
Interesting.

1824
01:25:26,840 --> 01:25:27,840
So it's still annoying.

1825
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:28,840
Yeah.

1826
01:25:28,840 --> 01:25:32,840
You know what's actually kind of genius in the mad genius way of trolling where Burger

1827
01:25:32,840 --> 01:25:36,160
King was like, we know Google is going to break this.

1828
01:25:36,160 --> 01:25:39,600
Yeah, that was next level marketing, actually.

1829
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:40,800
I don't think it was a flop at all.

1830
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:41,800
I think it was actually brilliant.

1831
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:44,800
And here we are like a week or two weeks later still talking about it.

1832
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:48,600
It's even better because they knew that Google was going to break it and then they did the

1833
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:56,600
same type of thing on TV marketing, TV commercials, and it was a different phrase so that when

1834
01:25:56,600 --> 01:26:12,400
Google broke the previous phrase, the next one would still work.
