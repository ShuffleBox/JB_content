00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,840
Talking of a brave new world, Chris, as your Librem laptop arrives.

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:15,240
All right, well, let's go over to the Purism website, P-U-R-I dot S-M, and check out the

3
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:21,160
shipping status for the Librem 15 Rev 1, which is, I believe, the one I ordered, or the Rev

4
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,560
2, which is the one I believe I'm getting.

5
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,160
Shipping now, it says.

6
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,160
Shipping now.

7
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,160
Wow.

8
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,160
Wow.

9
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,160
Would you look at that?

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,160
Actually, guess what?

11
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,160
Big news.

12
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,160
Big news.

13
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,160
I got big news.

14
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,160
Oh.

15
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,600
That's right.

16
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,960
The Librem has actually arrived.

17
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:40,960
It's here.

18
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,080
It is here in my hands right now, the Librem 15.

19
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,080
Fantastic.

20
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,080
He is holding it up.

21
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,080
You can't see, but he is holding it up.

22
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:50,040
The camera feed died from in studio today, but yeah, you will hear it soon.

23
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,040
You will hear it soon.

24
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,200
Yeah, we're going to do a little quick hands-on in the show today, I think.

25
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,200
Oh, that would be good.

26
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,200
That would be good.

27
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,000
You know what's super ironic is it showed up Wednesday.

28
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,720
It showed up the day after we recorded it.

29
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,720
The day after.

30
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,720
Yeah.

31
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,720
Yeah.

32
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,720
Well, that's difficult, isn't it?

33
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,720
Yes.

34
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,720
We just had to bust the balls for a while.

35
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,720
Yeah.

36
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,720
Yeah.

37
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,720
Maybe they heard that show on Tuesday.

38
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,720
Maybe.

39
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,720
He keeps talking about us.

40
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:14,720
He's listening live.

41
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,840
I'll tell you, the box looked like it was hastily put together.

42
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,360
It was like I got this weird, generic box that had lots of previous FedEx stickers on

43
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,360
it.

44
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,360
Yeah.

45
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,200
Because we've been wondering where it's at for about 286 days.

46
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,200
So it's here.

47
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,640
It's a previous FedEx sticker, so is it a review unit?

48
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,640
No.

49
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,640
No, it's mine.

50
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,640
It is.

51
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,640
I believe it is mine.

52
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,880
It matches the specs that I ordered, minus a few things I was expecting, which I will

53
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,880
cover.

54
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:46,840
I have presently ran Purism OS on it, and I've ran Ubuntu 16.04 on it, and right now

55
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,040
I have Antigros Linux installed on it.

56
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,760
So I've tried a few different distros.

57
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,760
Running the gamut here.

58
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,760
Yeah.

59
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,760
Done a few different things.

60
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,760
Got some initial hands-on impressions.

61
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,760
Have you tried PCBSD?

62
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,760
No.

63
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,760
It doesn't boot.

64
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,760
It doesn't?

65
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,760
Have you tried it?

66
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,760
Yeah.

67
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,760
I've been playing with it.

68
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,760
I ended up trying Virgin 11 on it.

69
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,760
I got to spend a little time debugging it.

70
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,760
So you have a Purism?

71
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,760
Yeah.

72
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,760
I'm the one who sent you a message on Wednesday when I got mine.

73
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,760
Oh, that's great.

74
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,760
I'm glad you made it.

75
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,760
Thanks for coming.

76
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:11,760
That's cool.

77
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,760
Yeah.

78
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,760
You and I got our rigs the same day, which was interesting, I thought.

79
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,760
Well, I ordered it literally right after I got mine.

80
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,760
Yeah.

81
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,760
That's great.

82
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,760
I'm glad you made it.

83
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,760
Thanks for coming.

84
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,760
That's cool.

85
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,760
Yeah.

86
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:25,760
You and I got our rigs the same day, which was interesting, I thought.

87
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,600
Well, I ordered it literally right after you did.

88
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,560
So you've tried what then?

89
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,760
You've obviously already tried PCBSD.

90
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,640
What else have you tried?

91
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,640
I put the Ubuntu Mate on it as well.

92
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:43,080
I'm still running Pure OS as I need to work on the touchpad issue.

93
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,080
Yeah.

94
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,800
I'll talk about the touchpad a little bit today, if I remember.

95
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,960
I'm going to do a full review on Sunday where I'm really going to throw some tests at it,

96
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:54,800
but right now I'm still in the process of releasing what the battery life is like at

97
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,240
different settings and releasing what I can get from the performance.

98
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:01,800
So I'm really kind of early days into it, but my intention is to get a config, lock

99
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,960
it down, and figure out exactly how it's set up.

100
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:10,560
Maybe do rolling distro, maybe just do Ubuntu 16.04, maybe something else.

101
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:16,700
And then for the next set of hardware I get, so like if I get the Oryx Pro in here or the

102
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:20,560
Entroware when it arrives, I want to have very similar testing sets.

103
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,480
That's not scientific, but I want a very similar testing set so that way when I'm talking about

104
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,480
the machines I can...

105
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,480
Yeah, some kind of baseline.

106
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,480
Yeah.

107
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,800
I don't know if I'm going to be able to test the Oryx Pro, but I hope so.

108
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,200
And I'm very excited to see how the Entroware stacks.

109
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,280
We'll talk more about that, too, because...

110
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:43,000
So I heard from Entroware about an hour ago and your Apollo has been shipped.

111
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Woo!

112
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,360
Oh, the showdown is arriving soon.

113
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:55,240
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 132 for February 16th, 2016.

114
00:03:55,240 --> 00:04:11,120
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that has a brand new Linux laptop,

115
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,520
and I'm all ready and fired up to talk about it.

116
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,520
My name is Chris.

117
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,520
My name is Wes.

118
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,020
Hello there, Wes.

119
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,400
So we have a great show today.

120
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,360
Yes, we do.

121
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:25,080
Sometimes the internet just delivers, and all we have to do is just sit back and receive

122
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,160
the benefits.

123
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,560
We just receive them.

124
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:32,360
This week on the Unplugged show, we're going to talk about the Vulkan API.

125
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,680
It's here!

126
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,080
And as far as launches go, this is tops.

127
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,520
I mean, in all of the years we've been covering stuff like this, I've never seen a launch

128
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,680
like this, and I'm very excited about that because I think this type of execution is

129
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,000
actually going to lead to industry adoption.

130
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,480
We're going to talk about why that's a big deal for Linux, for alternative CPU architectures,

131
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,480
and you.

132
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:57,080
Yeah, coming up in this week's episode plus, we've got updates on Ubuntu Touch, integrating

133
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,360
biometrics.

134
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:02,320
We've got info for all of you out there wondering about the new Purism laptop.

135
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,320
I've got it!

136
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,600
I'm going to give you my first impressions of the Librem 15.

137
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,160
It's right here in my hot hands.

138
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,980
Hear that?

139
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:10,980
That's its metal-like case.

140
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,920
It's the sound of it being real, folks.

141
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:16,360
Yeah, it's actually here, Wes, and we're going to cover it in today's episode.

142
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:21,320
So I'll give you my first impressions, a couple of things that surprised me, not necessarily

143
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,320
for the good.

144
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,320
No.

145
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,160
Yeah, not necessarily.

146
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,760
So we've got that coming up, also a brand new version of FFmpeg.

147
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:33,960
Google finds a major security that affects, well, basically all Linux distributions.

148
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,640
We'll give you a roundup on the Vulkan stuff.

149
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,380
It's going to be huge.

150
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,960
So we've got a lot to cover today in the show, Wes.

151
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,800
So before we get started, I realized we made a fatal flaw last week.

152
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,800
Oh, no.

153
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,800
Do you know what that was?

154
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,800
What?

155
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,800
No beer.

156
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,800
No beer.

157
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,800
No beer.

158
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,800
And what happened?

159
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,800
What happened?

160
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,800
We ended up having a fedora rant.

161
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,800
Yep.

162
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,800
Right?

163
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,800
Got yourself in trouble again.

164
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,760
So this week, Wes, being the good co-host that he is, showed up with some beers.

165
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:04,380
So we're going to be drinking something called, you ready for this?

166
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,840
Big Guns.

167
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,720
Big Guns from Fort George Brewery.

168
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,280
And it's got an ABV of 4.2, so it's not on the high end here.

169
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,280
No, no.

170
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,800
It's an American IPA with no real score from a beer advocate, but the folks there seem

171
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,800
to like it.

172
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,800
Have you been sipping on it, Wes?

173
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,800
What do you think?

174
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,800
Yeah, it's not too bad.

175
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,800
Pretty easy going.

176
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,360
Not as big gun as I was hoping for, honestly.

177
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,360
Wow.

178
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,920
A lot of hops in this beer.

179
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,920
A lot of hops, though.

180
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,920
Maybe it's a hop gun.

181
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,640
This is a bouquet of hops.

182
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,640
But it's not too bitter.

183
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,120
I mean, it's pretty clean.

184
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,280
Yeah, it's not so bad.

185
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:42,440
FortGeorgeBrewery.com slash Big Guns, if you want to check out the beer we're drinking,

186
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,440
unfiltered.

187
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,800
Expect sediment at the bottom of a can.

188
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,200
See this cool green monster they've got, though?

189
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,360
That's a huge hop monster, is what that is.

190
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,800
He's got tats, too.

191
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,200
He's got awesome tats.

192
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,200
And he's shooting a tank.

193
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,560
That's great.

194
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,560
That's what's on the can.

195
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,560
Well, good call, Wes.

196
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,560
Thanks for bringing that in.

197
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,560
My pleasure.

198
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,560
All right.

199
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,940
So we've got some stories to follow up on I'm pretty excited about.

200
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:09,440
And the first one is an Ubuntu phone rumor.

201
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,880
Let's bring in the Momba Room to talk about this.

202
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,480
I'm appropriate gradients, Momba Room.

203
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,480
Hello.

204
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,480
Hello.

205
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,480
Hello.

206
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:21,560
So one thing that I'm very excited about in Android Marshmallow is legitimate fingerprint

207
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,000
API support.

208
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,640
That's a good thing.

209
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:32,320
And I'm having some experience, not a lot, but some experience with Touch ID.

210
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,480
I'm pretty impressed with the implementation.

211
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:38,360
And my Galaxy S6 also had early fingerprint support, even though it was sort of hacked

212
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,360
in by Samsung.

213
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,360
That's right.

214
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:44,280
But when I saw this story by Joey over at OMG Ubuntu, that Ubuntu phone was going to

215
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:48,240
gain biometric security features, kind of got my attention.

216
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,760
Ubuntu phones running secure biometric identity tools will be demoed at next week's Mobile

217
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,880
World Congress.

218
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:57,720
Canonical has partnered with ConsenSys and BlockApps, and BlockApps is going to be important

219
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:04,400
here, I want you to pay attention, to provide a web wallet and biometric identity tools

220
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:11,440
on Ubuntu devices using Ethereum, a decentralized public blockchain protocol.

221
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:16,300
As part of the collaboration, BlockApps' Nimbus U-Port biometric digital identity tool has

222
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:19,480
been ported to run on Ubuntu phones and tablets.

223
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:26,080
U-Port is described as the next generation of identity management systems and is pitched

224
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,480
as a self-sovereign identity.

225
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,480
I want that.

226
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,480
Me too.

227
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,480
I'm self-sovereign.

228
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,480
Yeah, and I like blockchains.

229
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,480
Those are great.

230
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:37,600
U-Port permits secure interaction with the Ethereum blockchain using biometric and encryption

231
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,040
features.

232
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,040
This is unbelievable.

233
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:45,320
If a person is verified through the Ethereum blockchain but the ownership of the identity

234
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:49,140
is determined locally using public and private key pairs, this is going to be integrated

235
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,920
in with Ubuntu touch devices, or at least some of them it sounds like.

236
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:57,760
I don't really know what the end distribution is going to be like, but I guess Canonical

237
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:03,120
is being very cheeky, at least some folks there, and they're calling it the Internet

238
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,240
of People, and it's just beginning.

239
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,240
The Internet of People.

240
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:11,000
Now, of course, I got to pick on Popi just for a moment, but Popi, do you know anything

241
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,480
about this at all that you can make a little more understandable?

242
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,240
Because to me, this sounds like fancy future technology using blockchains on phones that

243
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,280
are going to be out in the future.

244
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,320
I mean, it just all sounds super pie in the sky, but there must be some real code here.

245
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,780
There must be some actual relationships and agreements in place.

246
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,680
I have no idea.

247
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:33,040
So by the way, so Popi, let me tell you more about this then.

248
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,040
Please do.

249
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,580
We've got the inside scoop.

250
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:39,320
It's called Uport and it uses a blockchain.

251
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,280
It's going to kickstart the Internet of People.

252
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,280
Actually you did, me too.

253
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,280
What did you find there, Wes?

254
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,000
Well, this is the Ethereum website.

255
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,720
Ethereum is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts, applications that run

256
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,520
exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud, or third-party

257
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,520
interference.

258
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:58,240
It's the head of devices marketing at Canonical, says Popi.

259
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,240
So I'll let you know.

260
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,880
Canonical is keen to support the development of blockchain applications and their expansion

261
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,000
from business cloud solutions to mobile consumer applications.

262
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,940
Working with ConsenSys and BlockApps on building a platform for consumption and creation of

263
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:15,800
blockchain-based mobile apps is a realization of a promise of Ubuntu as the reinvention

264
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,560
of personal mobile computing.

265
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,280
That's a mouthful.

266
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,760
Yeah.

267
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:27,000
So identity management based on a decentralized blockchain and the key exchange and comparing

268
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,960
is done locally on the device, integrated with a fingerprint sensor on the phone.

269
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:36,820
Popi, is there any Ubuntu Touch device shipping today that has a fingerprint sensor that's

270
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,080
just not turned on?

271
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,080
Nope.

272
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,080
Okay.

273
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:47,440
None of the devices that we ship with or that our partners ship with Ubuntu out of the box

274
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,480
and none of the community-supported ports do either.

275
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,320
So there's a bit of work to do there.

276
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,800
This to me, I mean, Joey's got, he's got quotes from Canonical staff.

277
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,640
He's got links to projects.

278
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,640
I mean, there's some smoke here and so there's probably some fire, but we probably just won't

279
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,160
know all the details or some more details until next week.

280
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,160
Yeah.

281
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,000
All the details we've got are kind of pie in the sky right now.

282
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Yeah.

283
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,680
I think it's kind of one of those pre-MWC announcements that happens every year where

284
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:17,720
it's kind of, we're going to show this off at MWC, come and talk to us kind of thing.

285
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:22,480
And then there'll be backroom conversations with device manufacturers and carriers and

286
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,480
so on.

287
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,480
You know, not necessarily public.

288
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,480
Right.

289
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,480
You know.

290
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:32,040
And also, and now if nothing else, there is down the road, if Canonical is talking to

291
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,840
a hardware provider and they're like, so the device hardware we're thinking about using

292
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,880
with our Ubuntu Touch images has a built-in fingerprint reader.

293
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,100
Can you utilize that?

294
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,320
And now the answer to that is yes.

295
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,320
And here's our solution.

296
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,320
Yep.

297
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,320
Exactly.

298
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,600
So even if there's nothing shipping now in the future, that might help conversations.

299
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:51,120
Speaking of things that might happen in the future but aren't actually shipping yet, Meru.

300
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,120
Meru.

301
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,120
Our old friend.

302
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,120
Yeah.

303
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,120
We talked about it last week.

304
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,120
We're like, where the hell is this coming from?

305
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,240
It was sort of like out of nowhere.

306
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:04,120
And it was a project to run Debian on top of Android so you could hook up your Android

307
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:10,520
phone, a Nexus 5, to a monitor and get a type of convergence, an Android XFCE based, well,

308
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:13,880
I guess it's maybe a virtual machine, I'm not quite sure how it works, but a XFCE based

309
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,480
desktop that runs on top of Android.

310
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,800
You still get Android and you get an external loop.

311
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,800
We talked about it.

312
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,800
How is this possible?

313
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,360
Well, so last Thursday, Meru was announced, the software that turns your smartphone into

314
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,360
a PC.

315
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,920
And the developer said he was expecting some attention, but he thought maybe he'd get a

316
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,120
few early enthusiasts willing to give it a shot.

317
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,480
Instead, he got a couple of thousand.

318
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,760
In a few hours, someone picked it up on Hacker News, where it hit number five.

319
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:43,000
Within the next 48 hours, dozens of text sites, blogs, et cetera, this show, people from all

320
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,880
over the world were asking when Meru would be supported on their devices.

321
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:50,080
The press began speculating about a group of unknown developers challenging the likes

322
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,240
of Microsoft and Ubuntu.

323
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,760
I freaked out.

324
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,380
I was the only one that knew Meru was just me.

325
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:01,280
How the heck was I going to handle thousands of people that signed up for the beta?

326
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:05,120
Then different emails started showing up, emails from people who said they were ready

327
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,800
to offer support in any way and would absolutely love to help and so on.

328
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,280
The support just kept pouring in.

329
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:17,120
I've got to say, the open source community never ceases to amaze me.

330
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:22,420
I've had emails from people asking if they can help test Meru on other devices on a Sunday.

331
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:27,300
How many people, how many normal people do you know that willingly want to give up their

332
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,080
Sundays to help test software?

333
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,080
Probably too many.

334
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,080
Yeah, our audience.

335
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,080
Us.

336
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,080
Yeah.

337
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,280
With that spirit in mind, I'm open sourcing Meru.

338
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,280
Oh.

339
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,280
Heck yes.

340
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:41,200
Setting up a largest open source project is new to me, so please be patient.

341
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,800
There's a decent amount of work that needs to be done to document and automate things

342
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:48,080
so people can easily get started with the code.

343
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:51,880
A pretty good conclusion to the Meru story that we covered last week.

344
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,880
We'll see.

345
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,280
Rodden, I think maybe you seem the most skeptical of the group.

346
00:13:56,280 --> 00:14:00,400
Did he go?

347
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,400
He's not here.

348
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,720
Well, I think we'll see.

349
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:08,480
Rodden essentially put it down to this at least puts it on the may try some days track.

350
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,640
I think what we should actually do is get Rodden to try it.

351
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:13,000
I think a lot depends on how quickly it moves, right?

352
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,680
Like if they can get something that works really well on more than just one phone quickly,

353
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,680
then maybe people use it.

354
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,680
I don't know, man.

355
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:21,360
I actually think sticking to the Nexus 5 is a pretty good strategy.

356
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:27,680
Nexus 5, Nexus 5X, expand to the 6P if you got stuff, but stick to the hardcore enthusiast

357
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,680
devices just for a little while to get that working.

358
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,680
I mean, yeah, definitely.

359
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,840
And you want to have a really good experience.

360
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:36,200
But like Popey pointed out last week, those are also people that are most expecting to

361
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,360
be able to update their devices.

362
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,840
Would you give it a shot?

363
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,840
You got a Nexus 5.

364
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,840
I do.

365
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,840
Yeah, I'd give it a shot.

366
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,840
I signed up for the beta.

367
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:53,360
So when I get what if, like Popey was worried, you can't install, say, the next Android update?

368
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,640
Is that all it takes and you're done?

369
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,640
It depends.

370
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:00,560
If I couldn't install updates at all, if it was a little delayed, or, you know, they're

371
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,040
still working out the update pipeline, we'll see.

372
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,000
I would like to remain relatively current.

373
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I mean, I do run.

374
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,200
Yeah, that's a good point.

375
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:12,120
So I think the interesting story here, and it's one that happens all the time, and he

376
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,520
even says in his blog post, like, how did the media not know it's just one guy?

377
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,360
Why did they all assume it's a group of people?

378
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,360
It's just one guy.

379
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,720
Well, it probably means your presentation was pretty slick, so it looks like it's more

380
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,900
than one person.

381
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:25,240
But this kind of thing happens all the time in open source.

382
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:28,920
We start talking about something like it has a whole team of people behind it, or it has

383
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:34,440
a big bunch of funding, and it turns out to be one guy, one gal, maybe a couple of people

384
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:39,440
at best, who are slaving away at something for years with no thanks.

385
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,140
And then all of a sudden, one day, something happens, and it gets a ton of exposure.

386
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,840
Maybe it's a bug, maybe it's something.

387
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:51,240
And we just kind of run off, and we don't stop and go, this could be just a person.

388
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,680
This could be just somebody's pet project they're working on.

389
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:59,960
In open source, I think we look at it, and we automatically attribute attributes to an

390
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:03,600
open source project that we also attribute to a company.

391
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,880
And so we are familiar with some of the bigger open source projects that do have a lot of

392
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,880
that kind of infrastructure.

393
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,280
But it doesn't mean everyone does.

394
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,800
Kits and Kitty, you had some comments on the Android update issue.

395
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,800
Go ahead.

396
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:19,760
Yeah, I actually think that the Android update issue is a real bummer, and it's always tempting

397
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,880
me to move away.

398
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:25,880
But it's really the only reason I want to see Ubuntu funds succeed.

399
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:31,480
So I think Android gets too much exposure, but really, on the flip side is, I don't want

400
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:35,400
to use Apple.

401
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,520
That's been my internal battle back and forth for a while now.

402
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:44,080
I want a modern, updated smartphone with good apps that actually make me more productive,

403
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,360
things like Uber and whatnot, because I just needed to call Uber recently.

404
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,360
I want all that stuff, and I want it – if I'm going to pay for it, I want it to be

405
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,360
decent.

406
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:56,080
It doesn't have to be perfect, but I want it to be decent.

407
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,960
Speaking of decent, Recon, I'm talking about this today.

408
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:03,960
There are carriers out there that kind of help give you a leg up.

409
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:08,980
If you want a device that gets updates frequently, say you have an S6.

410
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:11,440
You know Samsung is shipping out Marshmallow for the S6?

411
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,440
Are they now?

412
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,760
It depends if your carrier lets you.

413
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,760
Of course.

414
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,760
Yeah, yeah.

415
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:23,640
Some international carriers, I just – that process right there, that drives me so crazy.

416
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,640
That's broken.

417
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,640
That drives me so crazy.

418
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,640
You know who's got it better?

419
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,920
Our buddies over at Ting.

420
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,920
They don't get in the way.

421
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,920
No, they don't get in the way.

422
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,920
I'm not going to lie to you about that stuff.

423
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:34,200
Ting is on a mission to make mobile make sense.

424
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,560
They're on a mobile mission to make it make sense.

425
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,760
Does that make sense?

426
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,200
Mobile sense making by Ting.

427
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,200
Yeah, exactly.

428
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,360
Go over to linux.ting.com to get our discount and support the show.

429
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,040
No contracts, no determination fees, and you only pay for what you use.

430
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,600
It's some sort of wizardry, you guys.

431
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,400
Actually, it makes a lot of sense.

432
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,200
They're an MVNO, and they have the CDMA and GSM network, which means there's a lot of

433
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,400
devices they're compatible with.

434
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,780
It also means they didn't spend the last 20 years digging holes in the ground and putting

435
00:17:58,780 --> 00:17:59,780
towers down.

436
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:03,520
They're able to come in and license the towers from carriers that did that investment, and

437
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,440
they're able to take that savings and turn it around into great service, so they can

438
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:11,680
do things like invest in really good customer service or invest in the best online management

439
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,960
dashboard for your cellular network.

440
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:17,480
They're able to pay unbelievable rates out.

441
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,640
For example, three devices, right?

442
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:27,240
Three devices, three smartphone devices, iPhone 5, Samsung S6, Nexus 5, and there's an iPhone

443
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,240
6.

444
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,240
Actually, it's four devices.

445
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:36,320
We have a 6S on there, too, and all of it together, 30, 35 bucks.

446
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,560
Part of that reasoning is because not all the devices are being used at the same time.

447
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:42,560
You can turn devices on and off depending on what testing we're doing.

448
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:47,000
We can be extremely Wi-Fi savvy, so we can do like Telegram and Hangouts and things like

449
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
that.

450
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,820
On top of it, it's just because it's a flat $6 for the line, and it's just your minutes,

451
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,320
your messages, and your megabytes.

452
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,000
You add that up, that's all you got to pay.

453
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,560
You go to linux.ting.com, you get a discount.

454
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:01,640
You get $25 off a device, you get $25 in service credit, and that is really nice because the

455
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:05,840
average Ting line is $23 a line after minutes and messages and megabytes, 23 bucks.

456
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,720
You get a $25 credit, you're not even going to pay for your first month.

457
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,280
The best part is then you can just try it.

458
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,280
There's no risk.

459
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,840
You can probably bring your phone you already have.

460
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,840
You know what I love?

461
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,840
Shoot.

462
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,640
I love the fact that they got $9 SIMs.

463
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,640
You want to try out Ting?

464
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,640
You're talking about trying out Ting.

465
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:23,960
Get a $9 SIM, pop it in a device, port it over to Ting if it's compatible, and you're

466
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:24,960
good to go.

467
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,640
You're just paying for what you use.

468
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:33,680
They have every device from good, solid feature phones that are $60, $70 for a really good

469
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:37,400
phone with no contract, no early termination fee, and only pay for what you use.

470
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,720
Can you imagine on a feature phone?

471
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,800
Then they go all the way up to the Cadillacs.

472
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:45,240
They got the Caddy, so the S6s, they got the iPhone 6Ss, they got the Nexus size, they

473
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:49,920
got the Moto Xs, all of it because that's what consumers want.

474
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:53,000
They have a powerful control panel.

475
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,120
No BS when you call them.

476
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,120
They're going to help you out.

477
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,120
They'll stick with you.

478
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,940
They got the tools to manage all of it.

479
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:03,880
If you're doing one account or many, go to linux.ting.com, support the show linux.ting.com,

480
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,880
check them out.

481
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,560
And if you're considering cutting the cord, they have some tips for you.

482
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:13,120
This is a thread they've been following for a while, and they're monitoring the cable

483
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,120
TV bills.

484
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,240
In some areas they're doing like fiber in it and stuff like that, so they're watching

485
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,240
the scene.

486
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,240
And they're really breaking it down.

487
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,120
The cable TV companies, what they're charging, what you're paying for.

488
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,280
They've done some good research here.

489
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,000
And different alternatives you can do if you want to cut the cord, all up on the Ting blog.

490
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,440
Go to linux.ting.com and then go check that out.

491
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,760
And a big thank you to Ting for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

492
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,760
Thanks, Ting.

493
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,760
Thank you, Ting.

494
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,760
Thank you, Ting.

495
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,760
Thank you, Ting.

496
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:40,160
Real quick, I want to talk about something that you all need to know about before we

497
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,160
go too much further.

498
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,600
You need to update your boxes.

499
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,600
So I'm sure you all are using rigs that are still getting updates.

500
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,840
You're not using some distros, not getting updates anymore.

501
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,280
You're not crazy like that.

502
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:55,120
Google and the folks over at Red Hat were both eating from the same end of a spaghetti

503
00:20:55,120 --> 00:21:01,600
noodle and ended up kissing in the middle and discovered a flaw in glibc that could

504
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,640
lead to a buffer overflow.

505
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:09,000
The Google blog starts, have you ever been deep in the minds of debugging and suddenly

506
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,520
realized you were staring at something far more interesting than you were expecting?

507
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,200
Well, you're not alone.

508
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,560
Recently, a Google engineer noticed that their SSH client segfaulted every time they tried

509
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:23,320
to connect to a specific host.

510
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:27,440
That engineer filed a ticket to investigate the behavior and then after an intense investigation,

511
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:33,160
we discovered the issue lay in glibc and not in SSH as we were expecting.

512
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:36,100
Thanks to this engineer's keen observation, we were able to determine that the issue could

513
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:39,360
result in remote code execution.

514
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,160
We immediately began an in-depth analysis of the issue and determined whether it could

515
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,160
be exploited and possible fixes.

516
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:48,800
We saw this as a challenge and after some intense hacking sessions, we were able to

517
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:53,920
craft a fully working exploit.

518
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:58,720
In the course of our investigation and to our surprise, we learned that glibc maintainers

519
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,000
had previously been alerted to the issue via their bug tracker in July 2015 and to our

520
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:11,080
delight, Florian and Carlos of Red Hat had also been studying the bug's impact, albeit

521
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:15,280
completely independently due to the sense of nature of the issue, the investigation

522
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:19,760
patch creation and regression test performed primarily by Florian and Carlos had continued

523
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,640
quote unquote off bug.

524
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:25,360
This was an amazing coincidence and thanks to their hard work and cooperation, we were

525
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:30,160
able to translate both teams' knowledge into a comprehensive patch and regression test

526
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:33,920
to protect glibc users and the patch is available here.

527
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,620
Isn't that a beautiful story?

528
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:36,620
That is a beautiful story.

529
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,720
Red Hat and Google, kumbaya coming together.

530
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:43,560
Now of course my friends over at ThreatPost who I generally think do a great job, their

531
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:48,880
headline, it's one of the best, there's a few different ways you could take this.

532
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:59,360
I like theirs a lot, a critical bug in glibc vulnerability puts all Linux machines at risk.

533
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:05,460
So depending on where you go, there's a different take on the severity, all Linux users must

534
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:13,360
patch, all things are bad, the flaw CV 2015 7547 is a stack based buffer overflow in the

535
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:18,080
glibc DNS client resolver that puts Linux machines at risk for remote code execution.

536
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:22,200
I don't really have much more to say other than that, but I just wanted to get the word

537
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,200
out there.

538
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:28,160
This came out since last, probably going to be a patch for your local distro soon.

539
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:31,240
You know, I mean these things come up, right, do we really need to make a big deal about

540
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,240
it?

541
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,080
I mean we can make scary headlines, but yeah.

542
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,920
It's like all software, there are problems, stay up to date.

543
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:41,760
And some of us have larger problems, like some of us there's a lot of machines that

544
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,760
have to be updated.

545
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:46,080
Wimpy, you probably had a few rigs you had to update after this announcement.

546
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,080
A few, yeah, that was an afternoon's work.

547
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,080
Surprise!

548
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:58,080
Yeah, so yeah, Debian have pushed the patches out and what we noticed is their security

549
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:04,120
announcement says the patch is available for Jesse and Unstable, but actually they've also

550
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,400
provided patches for Wheezy as well.

551
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,480
So if you're running Wheezy you need to go back and patch Wheezy, but it's not in the

552
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,480
security announcement.

553
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:15,200
So if you're running Wheezy servers, go and deal with that.

554
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:20,600
But what I think is more interesting about this is, is this the tipping point?

555
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:27,200
Are we at the point now where we don't have to have a catchy name and a sick logo to go

556
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,400
alongside these, you know, landmark vulnerabilities?

557
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:34,280
Is that a good thing?

558
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:37,080
That's why I'm not taking this seriously.

559
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,280
You think without the branding it's not really a big deal?

560
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,280
Yeah, totally.

561
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:43,600
There's no big logo, it's not on the BBC News, I don't care.

562
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,600
I'm just updating my machine like I would if there was an updated GIMP.

563
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:52,080
I'm almost with you, but I'm also with Wimpy at the same time.

564
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:56,640
This is a phenomenon that Alan and I have talked about on TechSnap a lot, is we've watched

565
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,480
this branding that's now happening with vulnerabilities.

566
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:02,640
You know, we can think of things like Shellshock and Heartbleed, these immediately come to

567
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,640
mind, right?

568
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:09,160
And there's others, Ghost, and all of these that, you know, and what's weird now, yeah,

569
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:13,320
what's weird is we have like this common language, like Ghost was that one that affected Bash,

570
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,320
right?

571
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,400
And Heartbleed was that one that affected OpenSSL.

572
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:21,400
Now we can just refer to these names and we all know what we're talking about.

573
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,400
In a way, though...

574
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,000
This is a Dharmak and Jalad moment here.

575
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Yes.

576
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,280
In a way, it's actually, I feel like it begins, this sounds super D-baggy, but I feel like

577
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:34,240
it begins the conversation when you're in an employment situation where like you've

578
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,920
got to go to your boss and say, hey, we've got to update, and it begins that conversation

579
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,120
because they've heard the name.

580
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,120
It's on the news.

581
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,120
It's obviously a big deal.

582
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,120
Right.

583
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,840
Like when Heartbleed came out, I think I even played a clip of CBS Morning News covering

584
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:45,840
it.

585
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,840
Like it was everywhere.

586
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:54,120
So in some ways, I feel like the branding has been good, but the other time, the implicit,

587
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,760
the thing that's implied there, and I'm going to be curious to know your thoughts on this

588
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:02,360
is, doesn't it also sort of drag Linux credibility through the dirt when it's...

589
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,360
Exactly my point.

590
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,360
Yeah.

591
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:10,680
All of the big outlets get hold of it because there is a catchy name and a sexy logo.

592
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:14,880
And it drags Linux reputation through the mud.

593
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,760
Whereas when it's announced like this, and probably the reason there's no sexy logo and

594
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:22,080
branding this time is because it's Red Hat and Google.

595
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,000
They're not security researchers trying to promote themselves.

596
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Exactly.

597
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Trying to promote their company.

598
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Yeah.

599
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,440
Yeah, exactly.

600
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:35,360
And when there is the branding, I just feel that it scares people unnecessarily because

601
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:39,520
the people in the industry know what the issue is and know how to deal with it.

602
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:44,360
And today's announcement through the various distros and security announcements has just

603
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:51,140
been responded to in the same way we respond to any vulnerability that affects components

604
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:55,480
that you're running in your infrastructure and you just go out and patch and move merrily

605
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,480
along.

606
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,600
You don't then have two weeks of media fallout.

607
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,600
Yeah, that's true.

608
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,520
All the security officers are still paying attention to it.

609
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,520
That's true.

610
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:06,320
Kitson though points out, Kitson, you think that was inevitable.

611
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,320
This was going to happen.

612
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,000
I mean, we give everything names.

613
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,880
Yeah, we do.

614
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:15,440
If you really think about it, everybody knows what you're talking about whenever you say

615
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,680
like Hurricane Sandy or Wilma or whatever.

616
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,680
Or Katrina.

617
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:25,640
And those things come up and even like with non-hurricanes, for instance, you have the

618
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,640
May blizzard.

619
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:32,000
A good portion of the people that live through that know what that is.

620
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,480
People name houses and their cars.

621
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,480
Yeah, that's true.

622
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,960
Yeah, the lady Jupiter there.

623
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:36,960
Yeah.

624
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,960
All right.

625
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:42,080
I did notice that one of their suggested mitigations is having a local resolver like

626
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,120
DNS mask or something that will reject non-compliant responses.

627
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:49,080
That's another reason if you are doing that, you can have something like that on your land.

628
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:55,000
I mean, some of those resolvers have been updated as well for the same reason though.

629
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,600
So NCSD got patched today as well.

630
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,560
I also though had the same thought Wimpy did.

631
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,360
I was like, I'm just glad this isn't getting a name.

632
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,720
For some reason, that was also my first reaction.

633
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,400
I'm just glad it's not getting overhyped and we still need to update.

634
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,640
But let's overhype this.

635
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,120
I can't give enough hype to FFmpeg.

636
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,120
Oh, I'm so excited.

637
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:16,940
FFmpeg 3.0 release supports VP9 acceleration, which is going to be good for some folks.

638
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:21,160
New decoding standards, new AAC encoding improvements, which is nice.

639
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:24,400
Meaning you won't have to pull in that special library just to encode.

640
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,800
Well, if it's good enough, we'll see.

641
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,800
Yes.

642
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,800
Well, I trust them.

643
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,800
I mean, I'd be willing to give it a shot.

644
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,800
But yeah, you're right.

645
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,800
That's the whole idea.

646
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:34,040
New filters across the board, which look really good.

647
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,040
What else?

648
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,280
Anything else about FFmpeg 3.0 that jumped out at you?

649
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,280
Intel QuickSync.

650
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,280
Oh, yeah, yeah.

651
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:42,160
You know, there's been a lot of talk of this on the Windows side in the MB community to

652
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,600
get the GPU to do your transcoding.

653
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:48,880
So it sounds like FFmpeg supports this now.

654
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,680
That's not just good for MB.

655
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,240
No, it's good for a lot of people.

656
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:56,080
That's going to be so good for server-side streaming and encoding.

657
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,000
I know Alan was looking at using it.

658
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Yes.

659
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,040
In fact, Alan just recently specced systems with support for that out of the box because

660
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:06,100
he wants to use that to do server-side encoding.

661
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,100
That's a huge deal.

662
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,100
I'm excited.

663
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,100
I mean, I love freaking FFmpeg.

664
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:16,440
And I feel like the thing about FFmpeg is if there was one piece of software that people

665
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:21,240
don't realize contributes so much to their desktop in the background for media playback

666
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,840
and for a lot of podcasters, it's FFmpeg.

667
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,240
Wim, you had a comment about the AAC encoding.

668
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,240
Go ahead.

669
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:33,640
Yeah, only that to get a decent AAC encoder on FFmpeg often means you have to compile

670
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:37,960
it from source and link in third-party libraries that might not be open source.

671
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,720
So I'm pleased to see a native AAC encoder.

672
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:50,280
And I should be interested to try it out and see how it compares with the FAC and FAD components.

673
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:55,240
We've done in-house testing of AAC versus MP3 versus Vorbis.

674
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,800
There's a definite.

675
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:02,240
You can do, for example, this is like two, three years ago that I did this testing.

676
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:09,840
And a 96-kilobit AAC to my ears sounded better than a 128-kilobit Ogg Vorbis or MP3.

677
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,360
I believe that.

678
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:16,080
So you get – in mobile, that makes a difference.

679
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,080
Yeah, congratulations.

680
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:20,400
FFmpeg version 3.0 is out.

681
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:23,520
The other big feature that they introduced a couple of years ago was ProRes support.

682
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,000
I couldn't believe it when they have that.

683
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,800
And now that they have got AAC encoder support.

684
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:30,240
I know they also added support for the GoPro Cineform HD.

685
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,520
So if you have a GoPro, that might help.

686
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:36,800
And then in the previous release, they got the HEVC hardware support.

687
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,200
Cineform is really nice.

688
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:45,640
That is – boy, I wish – I guess an equivalent piece of software from Adobe or something

689
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,640
would be $1,000.

690
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:49,560
Yeah, it's easy.

691
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:53,480
The fact that you can use it on the command line, too, is a huge, huge deal.

692
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,480
Build up all kind of pipelines that you want.

693
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,480
Yes.

694
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,600
And then inside jobs and scripts and even like the encoding for all of our networks,

695
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:05,280
all the shows here on the network, done with FFmpeg on a bash script on the command line.

696
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,640
Just – it's a huge, huge software project.

697
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:11,160
And when – one of these days, when I get the Patreon funding to the level I want where

698
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:14,000
I can start – I want – that's one of the first projects on my list.

699
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Absolutely.

700
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,840
I really can't – it's like they're like the central plumbing for so many multimedia

701
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:19,840
productions.

702
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:20,840
It's really valuable.

703
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,920
I want to take a moment to tell you about something else that's been extremely valuable

704
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,200
for my back-end infrastructure.

705
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,200
That's DigitalOcean.

706
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,600
Go over to DigitalOcean right now and check them out and use our promo code of Absolute

707
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,880
Power, Knowledge and Authority.

708
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,880
That's DOUnplugged.

709
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:35,560
I mean, if you don't like Knowledge, Power and Authority and have – well, maybe save

710
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,560
ten bucks, too.

711
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,560
That's also something else you can do.

712
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,160
When you use the promo code DOUnplugged, then don't use it.

713
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,640
But I like saving ten bucks.

714
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:45,520
I like Knowledge, Power and Authority – Power and Authority by DigitalOcean with your own

715
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,520
Linux rig.

716
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:49,220
It's not like other solutions where you go deploy a machine and there's some sort

717
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:54,800
of like cPanel type interface where you manage it or you have to go use some sort of archaic

718
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:58,080
web interface to go deploy a VPS.

719
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,600
It is a totally different experience.

720
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:05,240
Really great UI, Linux infrastructure throughout using KVM for the virtualizer, SSDs for the

721
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:08,400
drives, 40 gigabit eConnections to the internets.

722
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,960
It is a great solution.

723
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,400
DigitalOcean is very simple to get started to.

724
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,640
In less than 55 seconds, you're going to have your rig running.

725
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:21,280
It is going to – I mean, for example, this weekend, when I was setting up a Discord server,

726
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,280
I did it during the segment break.

727
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,400
I went over to DigitalOcean.

728
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:28,360
I spun up an Ubuntu 14.04 droplet and I got the root password changed.

729
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:33,800
I got some DNS set up in minutes, in minutes, while I'm live on the air.

730
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,800
It's a really great system.

731
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:39,320
And they have data centers in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam, London, Toronto

732
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,720
and Germany.

733
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,200
That interface is so good, but you know what?

734
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,860
You're beyond interfaces.

735
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,680
You're bigger than interfaces.

736
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,680
That's right.

737
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,680
They got an API.

738
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:53,220
They got a straightforward API you can use to just build off of – I mean, just go build

739
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,220
off of like a boss.

740
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:56,560
I mean, I'm not going to tell you what to do, but here's what I'm going to tell you

741
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,560
what to do.

742
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,080
Go use that API to create something.

743
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,400
Go contribute to the tons of great open source code that's out there.

744
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,680
Oh, you need to get started quick?

745
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,680
Well, guess what?

746
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,200
DigitalOcean's got you covered.

747
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,580
One-click application deployments.

748
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:08,140
So this weekend, we covered Discourse.

749
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:09,880
I don't know why we even bothered installing it.

750
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:13,960
They have one-click deployment of Discourse on DigitalOcean.

751
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,200
You don't even need to spend that time.

752
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,200
GitLab.

753
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,360
Go check out GitLab.

754
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,360
Just go play with it for a little bit.

755
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,960
Use our promo code, DOUNPLUG, to get a $10 credit.

756
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:25,840
Or if you want to try something like, I don't know, Rocket Chat or anything Docker container-based,

757
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:26,840
one-click deployment.

758
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,680
You get in the 14.04 base machine.

759
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,680
You get Docker.

760
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,440
You get the whole stack ready to go own cloud.

761
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,880
It's ridiculous how easy it is to get started in own cloud.

762
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,480
Our Mumble Room?

763
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,000
Our Mumble Room powered by DigitalOcean Droplet.

764
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,240
My own cloud installation.

765
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,360
My Sync thing installation.

766
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,360
My BitTorrent.

767
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,640
Yes, I also use BitTorrent Sync still.

768
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,120
Also powered by DigitalOcean.

769
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,440
My Quasicore installation.

770
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,320
Oh my goodness, Wes.

771
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,320
There's so many.

772
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,320
We take calls.

773
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,320
Guess what?

774
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,320
Powered by a DigitalOcean Droplet.

775
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,320
It's fantastic.

776
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,320
It's my go-to proxy as well.

777
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,320
Their connections are so good.

778
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:59,560
I was trying to download Xcode for a family member the other day.

779
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,560
Don't ask me why.

780
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,560
I know it's terrible.

781
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:05,200
But my Comcast connection, you know, way too slow.

782
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,560
Copied those cookies over to DigitalOcean Droplet.

783
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,120
One command line later, and there it was.

784
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,120
Full speed.

785
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,120
Nice.

786
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,120
Good move.

787
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,120
Yeah.

788
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,120
For $5 a month.

789
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,240
When I'm up at the Rover, and I'm all like, or not, Lady Jupiter, hello.

790
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,080
And I'm all like, this is a huge file.

791
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,080
And I'm on a mobile connection.

792
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,080
Exactly.

793
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,080
I go to my studio.

794
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,080
I SSH into my Droplet.

795
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,080
I download it there.

796
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:26,640
And then when I get here at the studio and I pull it down, the DigitalOcean connection

797
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:27,640
is so fast.

798
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:28,640
Just lies.

799
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,020
I have a 100 megabit connection here at the studio.

800
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:33,800
It saturates that entire connection when I pull files down from DigitalOcean.

801
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,360
So it's exactly the same way I do it too.

802
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:40,080
And with the pricing the way it is, and you use our promo code DUNPLUG to get the $10

803
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:44,280
credit, I don't even bother spinning up virtual machines on my desktop anymore.

804
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:47,680
You can run a really, really, really, really nice rig for $0.03 an hour.

805
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:51,200
And when you use the promo code DUNPLUG to get the $10 credit, you can do that for a

806
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,200
while.

807
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,200
It's crazy.

808
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:56,840
You know, those are American U.S. greenback dollars.

809
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,160
So you've got to convert.

810
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,960
But you use the promo code DUNPLUG anywhere in the world.

811
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,440
I hear there's things that will do that for you.

812
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,440
So figure that out.

813
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,440
Probably.

814
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,440
We're not here to help you.

815
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,440
No, no, no.

816
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,440
We're just here to tell you to go to DigitalOcean.

817
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,440
Yeah.

818
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:11,320
DigitalOcean.com, use the promo code DUNPLUG and a huge thank you to DigitalOcean for not

819
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:17,360
only rocking the entire tire back in infrastructure now, but also for having such a freaking great

820
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:20,760
service and a great UI that really make it actually approachable either for beginners

821
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,760
or experts.

822
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:27,160
DigitalOcean.com, use the promo code DUNPLUG and a big thank you to DigitalOcean.

823
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:29,560
All right.

824
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:33,320
Let's spend a moment before we get to the purism, let's spend a moment talking about

825
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,880
the really big long-term thing that happened this week.

826
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:40,600
I'm extremely, extremely, extremely excited to talk about Vulkan for a few moments.

827
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:47,320
No, no, I don't mean of the Mr. Spock variety, although I do like that type of Vulkan.

828
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:52,200
I am talking specifically about the API.

829
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:59,440
So one group that we're going to talk about today doesn't actually have code to show you,

830
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:03,160
but they do have a great video with a guy who does a hell of a VO.

831
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:08,000
Wes, I mean, you know, I thought maybe one day if this podcasting thing didn't work out,

832
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,560
I could do that in the world, right?

833
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,560
Oh, yeah.

834
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,560
Yeah.

835
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,560
Backup career.

836
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,560
Yeah, backup.

837
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,560
Exactly.

838
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,760
This guy though, this guy is really, this guy is going to take the market from right

839
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:19,960
out from underneath me and he's going to tell us about Vulkan.

840
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:26,120
Vulkan is the only open standard and cross-platform API for high efficiency access to graphics

841
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:29,160
and compute on modern GPUs.

842
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:34,920
Derived from AMD's revolutionary Mantle API, the Vulkan API provides applications with

843
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:40,840
direct control over GPU acceleration for optimized efficiency and performance.

844
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:46,520
Vulkan exposes features that were not accessible through OpenGL, delivering benefits that include

845
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:51,960
close to metal control of the GPU, demanded by sophisticated game engines and interactive

846
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:58,080
media, reduced driver overhead and CPU usage, enabling faster performance and better image

847
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:02,440
quality, superior utilization of multi-core processors.

848
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:08,080
Vulkan is the only high performance graphics API that works across multiple operating systems,

849
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,200
including Windows and Linux systems.

850
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:16,480
An industry leader in open standards technologies, AMD donated the Mantle API code to Chrome

851
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:21,400
Monos to jumpstart Vulkan development with a solid and proven technology foundation.

852
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:27,200
AMD's co-development of the Vulkan API paves the way for PC games to run on both Windows

853
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,760
and Linux with the same features and performance.

854
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:35,560
Vulkan makes this possible for the first time, enabling a big step forward for PC gamers

855
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:41,360
seeking an exceptional gaming experience on AMD Radeon GPUs and APUs.

856
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:46,560
For more information, visit www.gpuopen.com.

857
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,560
All right.

858
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,560
I like how they have an echo in there.

859
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,560
That's nice.

860
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,560
Calm.

861
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,560
Calm.

862
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,560
So you know it's serious.

863
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,440
That's AMD's little video on what Vulkan is, so that way I don't have to explain it and

864
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,440
the guy has the video.

865
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,680
He's got a nice voice, but I think your microphone's nicer.

866
00:37:58,680 --> 00:37:59,680
Thanks.

867
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,680
Thanks.

868
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:01,680
Yeah.

869
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:05,040
So Vulkan, industry forged, and there's a lot to talk about here today.

870
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,840
Before we go too far, if anybody in the Mamba Room has anything to add, just tag me in the

871
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:09,840
chat room.

872
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,840
Who is this?

873
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,840
Is it VW?

874
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:12,840
Who's got the...

875
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:18,400
William, you might have a hot key active because I hear you from time to time.

876
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:22,160
So Vulkan, it's a really big deal for a couple of reasons.

877
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,880
First of all, today is the big launch day.

878
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:27,680
1.0 is out, and I got to say, I'm pretty damn impressed.

879
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:31,560
Intel, out of the gate, announces an open source driver ready to go.

880
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:36,640
Nvidia, out of the gate, today has a Linux driver ready for you to go.

881
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,640
AMD.

882
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:38,640
Not quite.

883
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,480
They're working on it though.

884
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,480
They're gonna...

885
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:45,000
They totally have a great video for you to watch, so that's cool.

886
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,240
So we have a lot of support launching today.

887
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:52,480
Wes, how do you feel about Vulkan?

888
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,440
Do you feel like this is actually going to move the needle?

889
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,840
Do you think the industry's gonna get behind Vulkan?

890
00:38:56,840 --> 00:39:02,960
They're gonna start writing games for Windows, Mac OS, Android, iOS, maybe not iOS, Linux

891
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:03,960
using the Vulkan API?

892
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,520
Do you think it's actually gonna happen, Wes?

893
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,720
I think the driver support is a very good first step.

894
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:12,040
If we saw this spec released and it was a lot of staggered releases for drivers, I mean,

895
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:14,520
maybe it's not perfect, but it's a long way.

896
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:20,400
I think Vulkan fits in in kind of a complicated way into the ecosystem.

897
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,600
You have OpenGL, and then you have Vulkan, which has some underlying stuff, but not everyone

898
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,080
is gonna need or want to just use Vulkan.

899
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:29,880
And then you already have DirectX 12, which is kind of a whole own ecosystem.

900
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:33,520
So I think it's gonna be a long game, but it's a strong first step.

901
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,520
Let's go to the number.

902
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:37,520
So Gab, I see in there you say that your friend works with DirectX, and he's thinking about

903
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,000
switching to Vulkan.

904
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,680
Share that story with me.

905
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:48,040
Yeah, I have this friend of mine, which is studying making game engines, and he's been

906
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:54,040
using DirectX and Windows for a lot of time, basically because he says that OpenGL is not

907
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:56,320
on par with DirectX.

908
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:02,160
And he says this with pain because he likes and loves open source technologies, but he's

909
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:08,080
kind of forced to use DirectX because it doesn't really want to bother with OpenGL.

910
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:15,640
And when Vulkan was announced, he was like, me and him were going crazy about it because

911
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:24,280
it opens literally, yeah, it opens literally a great new frontier because it works on every

912
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,280
platform.

913
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:32,480
The video you've shown shows Linux and Windows mainly, but it's bigger than that, though.

914
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,480
Yeah, of course.

915
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,480
The point, that's the point.

916
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:39,640
You can run Vulkan game engines on Android, iOS, macOS, consoles.

917
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:43,520
Save that thought because we're gonna get to that aspect of here in a second, but I

918
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:46,080
want to stay with the Linux aspect for a second.

919
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:49,400
Wimby, you predicted something regarding Vulkan.

920
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,400
Remind me of that.

921
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,400
Yeah.

922
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:55,920
So on the Ubuntu podcast, we did our end of year predictions and my first one that Vulkan

923
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:01,400
would be finalized and released in 2016, I actually said that the measures would be that

924
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:07,640
Linux drivers will be released for Intel IGPs as open source, Nvidia via proprietary drivers

925
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:11,160
and AMD via proprietary drivers.

926
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,160
Well, that's about it.

927
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:20,680
Steam would include support, yeah, but this is the kicker, that on equivalent hardware,

928
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:23,720
Vulkan on Linux will outperform Windows 10.

929
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:28,040
Now in that, do you mean immediately or do you think there's going to be a period of

930
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:31,640
time where Vulkan's gonna have to sort of be optimized and they're gonna have to suss

931
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,240
out how to write for it?

932
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,240
In 2016.

933
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,240
Okay, in 2016.

934
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:41,480
So a game that is written for Vulkan that is available on Linux and Windows on equivalent

935
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:44,680
hardware will run faster and more efficiently.

936
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:50,200
See, the reason I ask you that is the folks that are making, what is it, Tremulous?

937
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,200
I can't remember.

938
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:55,760
There are, I have it linked in the show notes, there is a game developer already about to

939
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,400
ship Vulkan support for their game, yeah, Talos.

940
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,400
That's what it is.

941
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,400
Well, I love that game.

942
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,400
Yeah, Talos, thank you.

943
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:05,320
They say, yep, they say our GPU-bound scenarios, ultra settings, resolution higher than full

944
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:10,840
HD, you're gonna see lower performance with Vulkan, 20 to 30% lower.

945
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:15,560
This is a work in progress and we are analyzing and optimizing performance to get to the bottom

946
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:18,360
of this, as well as the rest of the people in the group.

947
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,360
That's not too bad though.

948
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:21,080
20% is not a ton.

949
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:25,960
Right, but that does mean some interesting, like, headlines out of the gate for Vulkan,

950
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:26,960
right?

951
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:27,960
Yeah.

952
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:28,960
Yeah.

953
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:34,680
The most interesting thing is that this was sort of kickstarted from AMD's Mantle project.

954
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,960
Yes, I agree, that is interesting.

955
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:41,320
And AMD don't have a driver on Linux on the day of launch.

956
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,320
It's hilarious, actually.

957
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,320
AMD's like...

958
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,320
Yeah, AMD's so open, guys.

959
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,320
Pioneer of the tank.

960
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,320
Guys, they're so open.

961
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

962
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:54,520
You feel bad for them, because it must just be an engineering resource contention issue,

963
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:55,520
but...

964
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,440
I mean, they had to spend all that time making that sweet video.

965
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,960
It's the same team.

966
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:02,480
But it's like a bad joke just getting worse.

967
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,480
Yeah, it is.

968
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:07,040
AMD's drivers are always behind and they can't even keep up with their own technology.

969
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:09,760
It's just like, God.

970
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:13,340
So NorthRanger, I'm curious about your assertion here.

971
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:18,880
You think that this might catch Microsoft overreaching, go into detail there.

972
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:27,920
Yeah, I think Vulkan's in an interesting position in that it can be promoted as the cross-platform

973
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:34,560
solution, whereas Microsoft is going out on a limb and saying, if you want DirectX 12,

974
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:39,600
you want that same level of access to your GPU hardware, you're going to have to go to

975
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:40,600
Windows 10.

976
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:41,600
Right, right.

977
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:44,760
And if they're offering upgrades for free, they're still going to keep pushing and pushing

978
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,680
and pushing.

979
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:49,480
And that may be a little overextension on their part.

980
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:54,640
And here's why I think it can't really long-term work that well for Redmond, is it's bigger

981
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,100
than x86.

982
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:58,440
It's way bigger than x86, right?

983
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:03,040
This video I'm playing right here is a Vulkan demo running on a Mali GPU, which is an ARM-based

984
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,040
GPU.

985
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:06,340
Now, Vulkan isn't necessarily about improved graphics.

986
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:13,600
It's a graphics API, but it is about having a uniform cross-platform graphics API.

987
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:19,880
And the fact that we already have working code on Mali CPUs, or Intel's GPUs, I guess

988
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:25,080
I should say GPUs, and also on Nvidia, that's a big deal.

989
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:31,800
But from what I've been reading, it's actually even a bigger deal on ARM GPUs, because Vulkan

990
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:38,000
has some specific stuff in it for memory management that didn't exist before in OpenGL that makes

991
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,560
gaming performance on ARM CPUs much faster.

992
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:45,800
Essentially, there's a lot less back and forth between the CPU and the memory bus and the

993
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:46,800
assets.

994
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:50,640
And instead, the stuff goes into the GPU, it knows what memory buffers it needs to access

995
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:54,600
in the GPU, and it doesn't have to keep referring back to the source material.

996
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:59,000
And on traditional GPUs, that's not as big of a performance hit.

997
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:03,720
But on ARM GPUs, because they don't have as much overhead, it is noticeably a big difference.

998
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:08,880
And so Vulkan might actually improve performance on ARM GPUs.

999
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:12,320
And if that's the case, you're going to have Android, which is huge, right?

1000
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:15,320
That could go from zero to a huge deployment real quick.

1001
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:19,680
Then you've got the fact that you can deploy it on Windows machines and on Steam OS, aka

1002
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:20,680
Linux.

1003
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:23,000
That might just be what tips it right there.

1004
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,680
So the ARM stuff is, you can't underestimate how big of a deal it is.

1005
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:28,560
This is not a Linux-specific technology.

1006
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,880
And that's where our strength lies.

1007
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:35,040
Even if not all the code out there is for Linux first.

1008
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:42,240
And then, if that wasn't enough, the sprinkles on top, Qt is working on Vulkan support directly

1009
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,240
in the Qt framework.

1010
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,240
Whoa.

1011
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:45,240
Yeah, they've announced that today.

1012
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:49,240
The Qt company has joined the Kronos Group to be alongside many other companies supporting

1013
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:51,840
cross-platform industry-backed APIs.

1014
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:52,840
Huge deal.

1015
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:53,840
Huge deal.

1016
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:57,320
That's just more support right in their corner.

1017
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:58,320
Man.

1018
00:45:58,320 --> 00:45:59,320
Here we are.

1019
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:05,240
You've got Qt announcing support, NVIDIA shipping a driver, Intel, by the way, announces their

1020
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:09,280
support on the Mesa mailing list.

1021
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:12,680
As part of the open-source community, Intel announces their support.

1022
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:13,680
Here's the source code.

1023
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:16,160
AMD's like, yeah, we're going to get there, bro.

1024
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:19,380
But a lot of companies are totally behind it.

1025
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:24,400
This is a Class A, well-done, non-botched launch, everybody.

1026
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:25,400
Congratulations.

1027
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:29,240
We're witnessing what it looks like when an industry-backed standard is launched and they

1028
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:32,840
actually do it successfully in a way that's going to build positive momentum.

1029
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:35,760
We don't get to witness this very often, so you might not be recognizing it first.

1030
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:36,760
I understand.

1031
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:37,760
And it's still going to take a while.

1032
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:38,760
It's rare.

1033
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:39,760
Yes, exactly.

1034
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:40,760
It's a ways off.

1035
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:42,880
It's a slow-moving thing, but this is a really good story.

1036
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:50,200
But these SOBs over at the Kronos Group managed to launch 1.0, and they got all of these

1037
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:53,400
lax-a-doodle companies to somehow work together with them.

1038
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,040
All with various different interests.

1039
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,040
Yes.

1040
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:58,480
And actually, I'll make their announcements on day one.

1041
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:04,160
If you were watching Reddit or Hacker News today, it was awash in Vulkan news.

1042
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:08,400
Their hashtag Vulkan API or something like that on Twitter was actually trending for

1043
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:09,480
a short period.

1044
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:13,480
My point is, they managed not to screw it up, everybody.

1045
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:15,240
They actually managed not to screw it up.

1046
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:18,200
And it actually looks like it could have some momentum.

1047
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:21,360
And the beauty is, Linux just is along for the ride.

1048
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:22,360
Right?

1049
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:23,360
First class.

1050
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:24,360
Just, damn.

1051
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:25,360
I'm stoked about that.

1052
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:26,360
Yeah, it is huge.

1053
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:30,000
I think it's one of the biggest things to happen to Linux this year, but we just won't

1054
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,920
see the results for a year or two.

1055
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:34,200
In two years, we'll be really, really pleased with all this.

1056
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:37,880
Now, we just get to sit back and watch all these green-blooded graphics.

1057
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:43,160
Someday, we'll be running Sweet Wayland on Vulkan hardware that's going to be great.

1058
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:50,920
With my Vulkan GPU-accelerated Mate desktop on Ubuntu 16.10.

1059
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:53,040
Or maybe it's going to be 17.04.

1060
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,920
I'm not so sure.

1061
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:59,720
But you know, the great thing is, too, is that our friends over at Valve have a particular

1062
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:00,880
interest in this.

1063
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:04,640
So they're watching this as well and moving it forward for the Linux side.

1064
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:05,780
They're working with Steam developers.

1065
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:07,480
I've got links about that in the show notes.

1066
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:08,640
So there's a lot going on here.

1067
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:09,640
Yeah, there is.

1068
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:11,520
This is a big day.

1069
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:12,600
Mark it on your calendars, everybody.

1070
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:14,560
The day Vulkan was born.

1071
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:16,480
And it's not the Mr. Spock variety.

1072
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:19,000
So we've got lots of links for you guys to go check out in the show notes, if you're

1073
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
curious.

1074
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,360
Including the Vulkan decision tree.

1075
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:23,360
Did you see that?

1076
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:24,360
Yeah, I sure did.

1077
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:25,360
This is a fun graph.

1078
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:26,360
That's good, right?

1079
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:28,880
It will answer all your Vulkan-related deployment questions.

1080
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:33,640
Also because we could literally spend multiple episodes on this, and that would bore everyone

1081
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:34,640
to death.

1082
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:39,800
I'm just going to link you to a webinar the Kronos Group is doing on February 18th, a

1083
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:43,640
couple of days from now, 9 a.m. Pacific time.

1084
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:45,080
It's a webinar that's free.

1085
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:46,480
The link is just in the show notes.

1086
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:47,480
You should go sign up.

1087
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:48,600
What's Vulkan about?

1088
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:49,600
Learn about it.

1089
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:51,880
Learn about the API, the people who've been creating it.

1090
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:52,880
It's a one-hour session.

1091
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:53,880
They're going to talk about the API.

1092
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:58,200
They're going to go into details about the SDK and have a Q&A session.

1093
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:01,800
So if you want to, you can attend that and ask questions.

1094
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:04,420
If you don't want to, save that link.

1095
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:08,480
And after their webinar is done, they're going to post the video at the same URL.

1096
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:11,240
So depending on when you're listening to this, you can either attend the webinar or you can

1097
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:13,400
watch the webinar, a one-hour webinar.

1098
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:19,720
More details about Vulkan, the Kronos Vulkan working group chair is going to be there.

1099
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:24,840
The spec editor is going to be there, and also two of the SDK technical leads will be

1100
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:26,520
in the webinar.

1101
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:29,960
So they're obviously going to be way better positioned to talk about it.

1102
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:30,960
Yeah, don't ask us.

1103
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:31,960
Yeah, exactly.

1104
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:32,960
So we've got that linked up there.

1105
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:35,560
I might try to attend that one or at least watch the results.

1106
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:41,000
But I feel like this is, even if you're not a gamer, this is a big deal.

1107
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:46,520
I feel like because with Qt integrating it and all of that, this is the kind of thing

1108
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:50,120
that I've been wanting to see for a long, long time.

1109
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:51,120
And I don't know.

1110
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:53,520
Does anybody in the Mumber Room want to cast a doubt?

1111
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:54,520
Anybody want to play devil's advocate?

1112
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:56,040
Because I'm riding the hype train right now.

1113
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:57,040
I'm very excited about that.

1114
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:59,720
This is the happiest I've seen Chris in a long time.

1115
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:00,720
Yeah.

1116
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:01,720
Well, yeah, that's true.

1117
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:04,000
I do like me the Vulcans.

1118
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,200
I can't help it.

1119
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:10,080
Yeah, so in the show notes, we have links to basically all the software downloads that

1120
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:13,400
are available for Linux right now if you want to check it out.

1121
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:14,400
Hmm.

1122
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:15,400
Hmm.

1123
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:16,400
Hmm.

1124
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:17,400
Pretty exciting.

1125
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:18,400
Pretty exciting.

1126
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:19,400
Pretty exciting.

1127
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:20,400
Pretty exciting.

1128
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:21,400
Pretty exciting.

1129
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:22,400
Pretty exciting.

1130
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:23,400
Pretty exciting.

1131
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:24,400
Pretty exciting.

1132
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:25,400
Pretty exciting.

1133
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:26,400
Alright, we gotta talk about the purism.

1134
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:27,400
We got the Liebroom 15.

1135
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:28,400
Hmm.

1136
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,400
The one and only.

1137
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:30,400
Here, Wes.

1138
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:31,400
You know what I'm gonna do?

1139
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:32,400
You know what I'm gonna do?

1140
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:33,400
I'm gonna talk about Linux Academy for a moment.

1141
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:34,400
Ooh.

1142
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:35,400
And while I talk about Linux Academy, I got a job for you.

1143
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:36,400
Okay, yeah.

1144
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:39,040
I want you to hold this Liebroom in your hands and I want you to identify the number one

1145
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:43,460
thing that's wrong with me, that I have wrong with it, just by the external appearance.

1146
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:44,540
You don't have to crack it open.

1147
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:45,540
Okay.

1148
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:49,480
observe the external appearance of the machine and identify, and don't say till after the

1149
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:52,960
Linux Academy read, but identify what it is, the number one thing that upsets me.

1150
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:55,140
All right, so now I'll tell you about Linux Academy.

1151
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:57,440
Go to LinuxAcademy.com slash unplug.

1152
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:00,280
You go there, you visit, it supports the show, lets them know you heard about it here.

1153
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:03,040
It's basic, it's obvious, but here it gets even better.

1154
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:06,760
You also get a great discount if you want to sign up for the Linux Academy, and man,

1155
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:07,760
is this a great service.

1156
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:11,880
Linux Academy is a platform built for Linux users and enthusiasts by Linux users and enthusiasts

1157
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:14,200
about all of the technologies around Linux.

1158
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:18,200
Unlike those BS other online services that say, oh, we'll teach you how to use Apache,

1159
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:23,080
and then it's like one of many courses including how to fix the sync when it leaks, how to

1160
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:26,440
use Adobe After Effects, like all these other things that are totally unrelated because

1161
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:29,520
they just want to have as many courses as possible.

1162
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:31,520
That's not Linux Academy's approach at all.

1163
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:35,760
Linux Academy has step-by-step video courses, downloadable comprehensive study guides, instructor

1164
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,840
help is available on demand.

1165
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:40,520
You can choose from seven plus distributions.

1166
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:42,440
It'll automatically adjust the courseware.

1167
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:45,080
There's over 2,300 video courses.

1168
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:46,720
You can keep track of your progress as it goes along.

1169
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:52,840
It breaks down hard, unbelievable concepts into hours that you can grok and you can actually

1170
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:53,900
execute on.

1171
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:56,600
They have courseware available that'll automatically adjust to your availability.

1172
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:58,260
They're always doing updates.

1173
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:01,340
That's why you have a subscription, and it is worth it.

1174
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:02,340
They have live streams.

1175
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:06,640
They're making available offline even if you can't attend live, and they constantly have

1176
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:09,480
new scenarios they're putting out there to give you a hands-on experience.

1177
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:11,340
They have graded server exercises.

1178
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:16,560
They get you ready to go out and actually test, to actually do the work, and if nothing

1179
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:22,040
else, they give you the ability to actually work with different types of technologies

1180
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:28,400
and maybe see what you find interesting, see what challenges you, linuxacademy.com slash

1181
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:29,400
unplugged.

1182
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:32,840
If you've ever had to get into AWS, I would invite you to go try out their courseware

1183
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:33,840
on it.

1184
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:39,200
Instructor mentoring, a great community stacked full of Jupyter Broadcasting members and updates

1185
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:40,200
all the time.

1186
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:45,400
They really put a lot of effort into revitalizing older content so it stays current.

1187
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:48,260
They watch the trends in Linux to see what they should do courses on.

1188
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:50,180
It's a great system.

1189
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:54,280
Go check them out at linuxacademy.com slash unplugged, and a big thanks to Linux Academy

1190
00:52:54,280 --> 00:53:00,000
for sponsoring the Unplugged program, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

1191
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,160
Okay, Wes, you had some time to, you know.

1192
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:04,160
Yes, I did.

1193
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:05,720
You know, it's a nice-looking laptop.

1194
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:06,720
It is.

1195
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:07,720
It feels good in the hand.

1196
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:08,720
Yeah, it's not too heavy.

1197
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:09,720
It's reasonably well-balanced.

1198
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:10,720
It's just metal.

1199
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:11,720
So that's kind of cool.

1200
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:13,680
You don't see that every day on a Linux laptop.

1201
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:18,000
So what is missing, as far as I'm concerned, on the Librem 15?

1202
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,640
I will say there are some sharp edges on this thing.

1203
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:21,640
That's true.

1204
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:22,640
That's true.

1205
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:23,640
That is true.

1206
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:27,600
There's something missing, though, that's a pretty big deal to me.

1207
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:29,880
Can you guess what it is?

1208
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:31,720
You're looking in the right area right now.

1209
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:32,720
You're warm.

1210
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:33,720
You're real warm, Wes.

1211
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:34,720
You're real warm.

1212
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:38,400
Well, there's no CD drive, but I don't think that's what you want.

1213
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:39,400
You're right.

1214
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:40,400
It's got SD card.

1215
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:41,400
It's got USB.

1216
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:42,400
It's got a DC in.

1217
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:43,400
That's important.

1218
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:44,400
That is important.

1219
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,760
It's got some seemingly mysteriously unlabeled switches.

1220
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:48,040
Yes, it does.

1221
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:49,040
Unlabeled switches, hardware switches.

1222
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:50,040
It's got HDMI.

1223
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:51,040
Yeah.

1224
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:52,040
Hmm.

1225
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:53,040
I don't know.

1226
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:55,960
There's one port that's not there that's pretty important to me.

1227
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:56,960
Ethernet.

1228
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:57,960
Oh!

1229
00:53:57,960 --> 00:53:58,960
Yeah.

1230
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:02,920
Yeah, there's no Ethernet, and the one I backed specifically did list Ethernet.

1231
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:04,440
That's a bummer.

1232
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:09,160
It was one of those, like, little RJ-45 drop-down ports that, like, is a half-port that you

1233
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:10,160
have to, like, pry open.

1234
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:11,960
Pry open before you can actually use it.

1235
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:15,640
But in the crowdfunding version, it did list Ethernet.

1236
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:22,240
I don't like being live on the air and relying on Wi-Fi, so that was a bit of a bummer.

1237
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:28,060
It was the version I got, the edition I got, no Ethernet, and I've tried to track down

1238
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:31,880
when the Ethernet kind of disappeared, if it was the switch to Rev2 or not, but the

1239
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:35,240
initial report of Rev2, it would have Ethernet, and then there was another post where it doesn't

1240
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:36,800
have a few links in the show notes.

1241
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:39,520
So I was a little, I, you know, I...

1242
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:42,720
You'd have to probably use, like, a USB 3 adapter or something.

1243
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:45,520
Yeah, and it's one of those things where I, the only reason why I kind of mention it is

1244
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:49,040
because I wouldn't have bought it if it didn't have Ethernet, because Ethernet's actually

1245
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:50,040
a pretty big deal to me.

1246
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:52,040
I actually like gigabit speeds, not 802.11.

1247
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:54,640
And you want low latency for studio stuff, anyway.

1248
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:55,640
Yeah, exactly.

1249
00:54:55,640 --> 00:55:02,080
So that was sort of my first impression, but outside of that, the metal coloring, like,

1250
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:03,080
this is not a small thing.

1251
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:04,080
Like, they nailed this.

1252
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:06,320
This looks, mine is not the dark metal.

1253
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:08,440
Mine is, like, an exact, looks like a MacBook.

1254
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:09,440
It really does.

1255
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:10,440
Yeah.

1256
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:11,440
Metal.

1257
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:12,440
Which is pretty cool.

1258
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:14,440
Yeah, it's not a bad looking machine at all.

1259
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:19,520
Couple other things, just first impressions that jumped out at me, is the version I looked

1260
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:26,700
at online, they had, and let's see if I can pull it up here for you, scrolling, scrolling,

1261
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:30,640
they show, there it is, there it is.

1262
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:35,520
They show what they call the purism key, which is the super key, which is where the Windows

1263
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:36,520
key is.

1264
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:37,520
To make sure everything's pure.

1265
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:40,480
I'm gonna go ahead and open the laptop up, which will wake it up, so you may start hearing

1266
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:41,480
it.

1267
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:42,480
Bum, bum, bum, bum.

1268
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:46,560
Wes, if you could just take a look at the keyboard, what does that look like?

1269
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:47,560
What key?

1270
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:49,960
Does that super key to you look like a square to you, or does that look like a Windows key

1271
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:50,960
to you?

1272
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:52,640
No, that looks like the Windows logo, Chris.

1273
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:53,640
Yes.

1274
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:54,640
So I was a little surprised at the keyboard.

1275
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:56,360
Are you running Windows on there?

1276
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:57,360
Did it come with Windows?

1277
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:58,360
No.

1278
00:55:58,360 --> 00:55:59,360
Hmm.

1279
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:00,360
No.

1280
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:01,360
I was a little surprised that the keyboard had a Windows key.

1281
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:02,360
Not a big deal, but I was expecting the hardware.

1282
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:04,720
That's another, you're gonna have to get one of those little penguin stickers.

1283
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:05,720
Yeah, yeah.

1284
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:11,200
The other thing that's challenging about this is the specs that they list online do not

1285
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:15,800
match the specs that I was shipped, because I got an older model.

1286
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:18,720
And the main thing that's really jumping out at me about this one, I don't know if you

1287
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:19,720
can hear it, Wes.

1288
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:20,720
What's that?

1289
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:21,720
Is it windy in the studio, Chris?

1290
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:22,720
No, Wes.

1291
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:27,080
I've woken the laptop up, and so it is, that's the sound it makes.

1292
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:31,720
And it's loud enough, Wes, that like you walk into a...

1293
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:32,720
What the heck is that?

1294
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:33,720
That's the laptop.

1295
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:34,720
That's the laptop.

1296
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:35,720
And I don't...

1297
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:38,920
I gotta tell you, you walk into a room and you can hear this thing.

1298
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:39,920
Yeah, definitely.

1299
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:40,920
I heard it when I walked into the studio this morning.

1300
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:43,920
In fact, I'm gonna put it to sleep again so the sound goes down.

1301
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:44,920
But it's very loud.

1302
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:46,480
Are you holding it up to the microphone and shaking it around?

1303
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:47,480
Close to it.

1304
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:48,480
No, no.

1305
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:49,480
It's...

1306
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:50,480
No, it's...

1307
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:51,480
My mouth is much closer than the fan.

1308
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:52,480
I now have it off.

1309
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:55,600
It's very quiet when it's off, so that's a weird noise.

1310
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:58,760
It sounds like what other laptops make when they're like totally maxed out.

1311
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:01,680
Well, it might be a little weird, because the gate is trying to specifically filter

1312
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:03,720
it out.

1313
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:05,360
Yeah.

1314
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:06,360
So that was...

1315
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:07,820
It sounds like you're rendering a video or something, but...

1316
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:11,600
So that sort of almost immediately eliminates it for production use.

1317
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:15,720
Wes, however, brought over a mini screwdriver kit, and I'm considering opening the bottom

1318
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:18,480
of it and seeing if I can replace the fan.

1319
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:19,480
It's not driver-controlled.

1320
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:20,480
At least take a look, you know.

1321
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:21,480
So here's what I tried to do.

1322
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:26,480
It ships with Purism OS, and I thought, and which is using Cinnamon for the desktop.

1323
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:29,520
And the nice thing about that is you can actually manage the trackpad.

1324
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:34,920
So I reloaded with Ubuntu 16.04 and, you know, did all the installation, set everything up.

1325
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:39,560
The only proprietary driver in use is the Intel microcode stuff.

1326
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:42,080
It's got a Broadwell Iris 6100 graphics.

1327
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:43,080
That sounds nice.

1328
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:45,960
Yeah, it's a three gigahertz processor.

1329
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:49,720
There is nothing you can do thermal management-wise about that fan.

1330
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:51,200
So I could not...

1331
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:52,480
There was no driver to load.

1332
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:54,400
There was no LM sensors command.

1333
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:55,400
There's nothing you can do.

1334
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:57,720
It is just hard set to full blast.

1335
00:57:57,720 --> 00:57:59,520
It's wired just on maximum.

1336
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:02,200
You probably won't have any overheating problems.

1337
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:06,000
So my hope is I'm going to pull off the bottom and see if I can replace that fan or whatever.

1338
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,920
I mean, with integrated graphics and whatnot, I just can't imagine it needs to be running

1339
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:10,920
like that.

1340
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:15,480
Especially when you're not actively really doing it.

1341
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:16,680
Ah, thank you.

1342
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:22,920
So FreeBSDSA says the email from 42715 states that the RJ45 was removed from Rev2.

1343
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:23,920
Yeah.

1344
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:24,920
Yeah.

1345
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:25,920
Is there UFI settings for it?

1346
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:26,920
Perhaps.

1347
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:27,920
Yeah.

1348
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:28,920
Go ahead, Wim.

1349
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:29,920
You had a question regarding the fan noise.

1350
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:33,040
No, I've got a potential solution for fan noise.

1351
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:40,720
Though Entroware ran into this fan noise problem when they were working on the same line of

1352
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:50,240
machines and it's a bug in the firmware from the ODM and you may be able to work around

1353
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:57,760
this by holding the power down for like 10 seconds and hard powering off the machine

1354
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:02,560
and that may reset the system and the fans may correct themselves.

1355
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:03,560
Okay.

1356
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:04,560
So I'm holding it down right now.

1357
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:09,680
Of course, I just went to sleep when I did that, but it actually just turned off instantly.

1358
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:11,160
Yeah.

1359
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:13,240
Yeah.

1360
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:14,920
That I'm willing to play around with.

1361
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:15,920
That is...

1362
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:16,920
Yeah.

1363
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:17,920
That'd be great.

1364
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:18,920
I did go through the BIOS and look for like thermal management settings and stuff like

1365
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:19,920
that.

1366
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:21,880
There's a lot of stuff going on there.

1367
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:22,880
The trackpad.

1368
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:23,880
Let's talk about the trackpad.

1369
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:25,280
I've heard some interesting things about the trackpad online.

1370
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:26,280
It looks pretty big.

1371
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:27,280
All right.

1372
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:29,020
So I'm holding it down for 10 seconds.

1373
00:59:29,020 --> 00:59:31,840
The problem is it instantly turns off and then nothing happens.

1374
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:32,840
The trackpad is big.

1375
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:34,060
It works well.

1376
00:59:34,060 --> 00:59:38,340
The problem is both GNOME and Ubuntu by default, they just only allow you to scroll on the

1377
00:59:38,340 --> 00:59:39,640
very small side here.

1378
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:40,640
Yes.

1379
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:41,640
Right.

1380
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:44,460
If you use Purism OS, it comes with Cinnamon and Cinnamon's mouse control panel settings

1381
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:47,880
allow you to actually change it to two-finger scrolling, which works better.

1382
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:49,000
Keyboard is pretty good.

1383
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,380
The escape key on mine is a little mushy.

1384
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:52,380
Doesn't always register.

1385
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:53,380
Mushy.

1386
00:59:53,380 --> 00:59:54,380
Yeah.

1387
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:55,380
My escape key doesn't always register.

1388
00:59:55,380 --> 00:59:59,400
So I sometimes have to hit escape twice, which means sometimes I have to hit it four times.

1389
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:00,960
So it's not awesome that way.

1390
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:04,400
But I'm holding it down for 10 seconds.

1391
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:07,720
Let's see what happens.

1392
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:08,720
Maybe grub.

1393
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:10,440
I'll keep it at grub so it doesn't boot.

1394
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:11,440
All right.

1395
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:12,680
So I should be about five seconds in.

1396
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:13,680
This thing's really loud.

1397
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:14,680
Yeah, it is.

1398
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:15,680
Okay.

1399
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:20,620
This might be like a workplace hazard.

1400
01:00:20,620 --> 01:00:21,620
Still running.

1401
01:00:21,620 --> 01:00:24,800
It hasn't turned off yet.

1402
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:25,800
I don't know if it's going to turn off.

1403
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:28,800
I feel like I've been holding it for like 20 seconds.

1404
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:31,800
Feels like it's been like 10 minutes.

1405
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:37,600
Yeah, it's still going.

1406
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:39,000
I know Mike's listening.

1407
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,480
Mike, telegram me.

1408
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:42,520
There's something else we should be doing.

1409
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:43,520
Did it get quieter?

1410
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:44,520
Is it quieter now?

1411
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:45,520
I don't think so.

1412
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:48,920
Well, what I was expecting is the machine should go off and once it's off, you can then

1413
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:51,760
power it on again and it may.

1414
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:52,760
It's not guaranteed.

1415
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:53,760
It may.

1416
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:54,760
All right.

1417
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:55,760
So I just let off and turn off the fans.

1418
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:56,760
No.

1419
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:57,760
Huh.

1420
01:00:57,760 --> 01:00:58,760
Yeah.

1421
01:00:58,760 --> 01:00:59,760
Yeah.

1422
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:02,480
Your GQ is loose.

1423
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:04,120
So FreeBSDi, you have yours.

1424
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:07,560
What have been your initial impressions?

1425
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:10,920
It's not a bad piece of hardware.

1426
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:17,160
If I'd have seen it in the store before, backing it, I probably wouldn't have bought it.

1427
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:20,840
All in all, it is nice except for, like I said, the loose GQ.

1428
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:24,940
And of course, when I'm running something other than PROS, I have trackpad problems

1429
01:01:24,940 --> 01:01:26,440
that I'm going to work on.

1430
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:27,440
Yeah.

1431
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:30,280
That's been my experience too.

1432
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:31,760
Performance, pretty darn good.

1433
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:35,120
Performance, you thought it's been pretty performant on yours?

1434
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:37,600
Yeah, it performs really well.

1435
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:43,200
I've done some full screen flash movies on it with no problem.

1436
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:47,840
Now Wimpy, I guess sort of the trackpad has a bit of a rep.

1437
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:50,440
You know a little bit about some of its tricks already.

1438
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:51,440
Yeah.

1439
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:58,960
There's no mainline Linux kernel support for the trackpad that's in the Librems.

1440
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:06,000
So there's been a few of us working on a driver for the BYD trackpad.

1441
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,160
And that's currently an out-of-tree patch.

1442
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:18,640
And what Purism are doing is shipping a bespoke kernel with PureOS, has the full touch gesture

1443
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:20,360
support in PureOS.

1444
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:29,720
But if you install any other version of Linux, then it will revert to a PS2 mouse.

1445
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:32,280
Sense the weird scroll and stuff like that.

1446
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:35,720
So I have a kernel patch I can send you.

1447
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:36,720
Wow.

1448
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:37,720
Take it back like 10 years here.

1449
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:41,280
This is not why you buy a laptop dedicated for Linux though, you know?

1450
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:43,560
No, this is the point.

1451
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:51,600
And the other thing is, you know when in the past you've talked about System76 don't just

1452
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:56,000
take the ODM equipment and stick their badge on it and ship it out the door.

1453
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:03,200
They actually work on firmware and BIOS enhancements and all the rest of it and get bespoke changes.

1454
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:04,200
Right.

1455
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:05,200
Yeah.

1456
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:11,640
So this is the same sort of thing that Entroware have done and they've overcome some of these

1457
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:16,960
issues that you're discussing now, like the fan for example.

1458
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:20,680
And that doesn't seem to have happened here.

1459
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:26,040
So here's the rig I got, 8 gigabytes of RAM, 500 gigabyte SSD, which I paid a little extra

1460
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:27,040
for.

1461
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:28,480
It's supposed to have a CD-ROM and DVD.

1462
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:30,920
It does not, which I don't care about.

1463
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:31,920
No big deal.

1464
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:40,200
I'm looking at the specs I bought on Indiegogo, it is listed as having a CD and DVD-ROM.

1465
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:45,800
It also ships with like a 65 watt adapter, which I'm not sure is actually enough.

1466
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:46,800
It takes a while to charge.

1467
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:48,920
The nice thing is that's kind of small.

1468
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:57,920
I paid for a core, this is a 3 gigahertz Broadwell CPU, Iris 6100 graphics, 8 gigabytes of RAM,

1469
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:04,680
I would have preferred 16, 8 gigabytes of RAM, 1920 by 1080 display.

1470
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:09,720
I paid $1,824 for this machine.

1471
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:14,240
If I was going to spend $1,800 on a machine today, you could guarantee it's going to come

1472
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:15,640
with Skylake.

1473
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:16,640
You could guarantee.

1474
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:22,040
Probably at least 16, with the RAM.

1475
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:24,520
Maybe dedicated graphics at $1,800.

1476
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:26,120
You might get that too.

1477
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:29,920
Now is it going to be something that has hardware switches for a webcam?

1478
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:32,640
Is it going to have something that has hardware switches for the mic and stuff like that?

1479
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:35,080
I actually do really like that.

1480
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:39,320
I also like the idea of supporting a company who is pushing the conversation about privacy

1481
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:44,600
and security forward and it's their primary leading cause.

1482
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:48,280
Those are things that my money went towards that I still like.

1483
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:51,960
Basically where I'm at right now with this thing, it has a strange USB-C port that I

1484
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:52,960
wasn't expecting.

1485
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:53,960
Yes, I saw that.

1486
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:54,960
That's interesting.

1487
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:55,960
I don't know.

1488
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:57,280
It didn't come with any documentation.

1489
01:04:57,280 --> 01:04:58,280
It just came naked.

1490
01:04:58,280 --> 01:04:59,280
So there's no manual.

1491
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:00,280
There's no...

1492
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:01,280
Naked in the box.

1493
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:02,960
And it's a very generic box.

1494
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:07,240
In fact, when I got the box, I immediately started to feel like, oh no.

1495
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:11,560
I immediately started to feel like it was starting to set my expectations low because

1496
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:12,560
the box was used.

1497
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:13,560
The finished kind of thing.

1498
01:05:13,560 --> 01:05:21,360
It had like five or ten other FedEx stickers on it and there was not even like a brochure

1499
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:22,360
in the box.

1500
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:23,360
Right?

1501
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:24,360
It was no documentation.

1502
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:25,360
Nothing.

1503
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:26,360
It was just backing our project.

1504
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:27,360
Sorry it took so long.

1505
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:28,360
Nothing.

1506
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:32,320
And so that sort of was like, eh, I'm a little worried about that.

1507
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:35,520
That all aside though, one of the things I would have liked to have in the box is what

1508
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:36,640
is this USB-C port?

1509
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:38,760
Because the one I backed doesn't have this port.

1510
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:42,520
The one I backed, where this port's at, was an Ethernet port.

1511
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:43,520
And is this USB-C?

1512
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:44,520
Can I charge the device with this?

1513
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:45,520
Because it hasn't...

1514
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:46,520
Is it real USB-C?

1515
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:47,520
It's USB-C with an electricity bolt.

1516
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:51,000
Does that mean I can actually draw power from that port?

1517
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,640
What does that do?

1518
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:54,640
I got nothing.

1519
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:58,360
Also, there's questions if this is actually HDMI 2.0 or not.

1520
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:02,120
I'm not sure about that.

1521
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:03,120
Those are issues.

1522
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:04,600
Have you tried the SD card slot?

1523
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:05,600
No.

1524
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:08,240
But I think the other thing I like is it looks like perhaps that's a physical switch for

1525
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:09,240
the SD card slot.

1526
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:10,240
Oh, wow.

1527
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:11,240
Perhaps physically turn it off.

1528
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:12,280
I'm not sure.

1529
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:16,560
If I could get this fan replaced, this is a pretty...

1530
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:20,360
The thing I do like about this is it is a damn unique one-off laptop.

1531
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:21,360
Yes, it is.

1532
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:22,360
And it is...

1533
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:23,360
It looks pretty special, whatever you are with it.

1534
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:26,520
It's a great showcase for a lot of really good stickers because it's completely unbranded

1535
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:27,520
all over.

1536
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:28,520
It really draws your eye.

1537
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:30,320
There's no big Mac logo or Dell logo.

1538
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:31,320
No Intel sticker.

1539
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:32,320
No nothing.

1540
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:35,960
In fact, the only sticker on it, on the bottom, is a UPC barcode, a small one.

1541
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:38,440
And other than that, it is untouched.

1542
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:40,600
It is a metal housing that is untouched.

1543
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:41,940
It feels good in the hand.

1544
01:06:41,940 --> 01:06:44,280
It has that MacBook angular slope to it.

1545
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:45,880
Yes, it does.

1546
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:50,920
It's got one, two, three, four USB 3.0 ports plus the USB-C port.

1547
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:51,920
That's pretty good.

1548
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:52,920
It's like four times as many on that MacBook.

1549
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:58,680
It's got HDMI out, and it has headphones out, and it has an SD card slot reader.

1550
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:00,520
I like that.

1551
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:01,520
This could...

1552
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:06,840
My XPS 13 doesn't have an HDMI port, or I'm sorry, it doesn't have an Ethernet port either.

1553
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:10,160
If I can get this fan fixed, this could replace the XPS for me.

1554
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:11,160
But it can't...

1555
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:14,080
I don't know if it can be a production machine without...

1556
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:19,560
The lightning bolt by the Type-C port means it may support Thunderbolt, says North Ranger.

1557
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:20,560
Is that true, North?

1558
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:21,560
Is that really a thing?

1559
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:26,880
Yeah, a lot of vendors, especially if you have a Broadwell system, are using an Intel

1560
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:35,960
add-on chip in the chipset that provides not only Type-C USB support, but also 40-gig Thunderbolt,

1561
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:37,920
things like external graphics cards.

1562
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:38,920
That would be...

1563
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:39,920
I was about to say that, yeah.

1564
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:40,920
If I could hook up...

1565
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:46,360
See, that would make me feel a lot better if I could hook up a high-end Ethernet adapter

1566
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:48,480
to that USB-C port.

1567
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:51,120
Here's FreeBSA's.

1568
01:07:51,120 --> 01:07:52,760
He sent this to me when he got his.

1569
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:56,480
There he was listening to episode 131 of Unplugged, where we're like, where the hell is my laptop?

1570
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:59,240
And there's his purism right there.

1571
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:01,160
What was your out-of-the-box experience like FreeBSD?

1572
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:06,080
Was it the same kind of like rattle experience, or did you get some documentation, did you

1573
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:07,080
get a nice...

1574
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:09,200
What was your initial experience like?

1575
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:13,280
Yeah, documentation, non-existent.

1576
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:16,680
I haven't played with the hardware switches yet to figure out what they turn off, but

1577
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:19,440
it would be nice if there was some information.

1578
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:25,400
I even looked on the hard drive to see if there was documentation in the form of a PDF,

1579
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:26,880
and I don't see anything on there.

1580
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:29,600
All right, so I'm turning it back on.

1581
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:30,600
I'm going to check...

1582
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:31,600
There's proof.

1583
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:32,600
Yeah.

1584
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:33,600
Wimpy wanted to know if...

1585
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:36,880
Now, the BIOS, I want to give purism credit here.

1586
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:41,120
The BIOS is like, every setting you could ever want to tweak is available.

1587
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:42,120
That's cool.

1588
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:47,280
Some OEMs, basically all of them, they really kind of limit down the BIOS, and this one,

1589
01:08:47,280 --> 01:08:50,960
you can tweak everything from overclocking to everything.

1590
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:55,760
So that being said, there's so much in here, it actually takes a little while to find stuff.

1591
01:08:55,760 --> 01:09:02,400
I'm looking through here right now, and I don't know if I see Bluetooth, chipset, security.

1592
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:03,400
Look at all this stuff, Wes.

1593
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:04,400
I mean, look at all...

1594
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:05,400
Wow.

1595
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:06,400
And all of these have submenus to them, too.

1596
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:08,240
Like, there's just a ton of stuff in here.

1597
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:09,240
Yeah.

1598
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:13,520
What specifically are you looking for, Wimpy?

1599
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:19,320
Does it have a Bluetooth device in it?

1600
01:09:19,320 --> 01:09:21,280
And the reason I'm asking you to look in the BIOS...

1601
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:22,280
The BIOS?

1602
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:25,840
Well, I believe it's a BIOS, isn't it?

1603
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:26,840
Mm-hmm.

1604
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:27,840
Yeah, it has a BIOS.

1605
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:28,840
Yeah.

1606
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:36,960
Is because I'm not sure if the Bluetooth device that's in the machine is supported by Linux,

1607
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:38,800
so it may not go up.

1608
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:39,800
Oh.

1609
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:40,800
I could...

1610
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:44,120
Yeah, I don't see anything in the BIOS, but you know what I'll do is I'll boot into Antigros

1611
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:46,040
Arch, which boots...

1612
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:50,440
I mean, one thing, by the way, is once Linux is installed, this thing freaking flies.

1613
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:52,560
Like, it is nice to have a nice modern computer again.

1614
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:53,560
I tell you, it's been a while since I've had it.

1615
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:56,640
It looks like it got that Samsung SSD in there.

1616
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:58,280
And that thing is fast.

1617
01:09:58,280 --> 01:09:59,280
So I'll see.

1618
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:00,280
I can log in right now, Wimpy.

1619
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:01,280
It just boots that fast.

1620
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:02,280
I'm already booted.

1621
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:03,280
I'm already in GNOME system settings.

1622
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:04,280
So I will take a...

1623
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:05,280
Fucking yeah.

1624
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:07,000
It does look like it supports UEFI, right?

1625
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,000
It must support...

1626
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Yeah, it does.

1627
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Actually, look at that.

1628
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:13,680
It is discovering the Bluetooth devices around me right now.

1629
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:14,680
So it must have Bluetooth.

1630
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:15,680
Oh, right.

1631
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:16,680
Okay, cool.

1632
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:17,680
That works then.

1633
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:18,680
That's great.

1634
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:19,680
Yeah.

1635
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:20,680
Cool.

1636
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:21,680
Yeah.

1637
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:23,200
That was something that they'd mentioned may not work at some point in the past.

1638
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:24,760
So they must have changed their...

1639
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:26,920
You know, I haven't tried the webcam either.

1640
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:29,040
Let me try the webcam real quick.

1641
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:31,480
Yeah, webcam works.

1642
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:32,480
Hey, look at that.

1643
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:33,480
It's me.

1644
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:34,480
Hey, look, Wes, there's you.

1645
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:35,480
See?

1646
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:36,480
Well, it's me.

1647
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:37,480
Yeah, webcam.

1648
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:38,480
So the webcam works.

1649
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:39,480
That's good.

1650
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:40,480
It's a little slow.

1651
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:41,480
But I'm going to keep playing with it.

1652
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:46,640
I think my next big task is to see if I can alter that fan.

1653
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:49,280
And then on top of that, I'm going to just benchmark the shit out of this thing.

1654
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:50,280
Yeah.

1655
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:52,880
I mean, it's already going to sound super loud, so you might as well, you know, make

1656
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:53,880
it do some work.

1657
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:54,880
Yeah.

1658
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:57,920
Well, it's funny how mentally in the back of my mind, I associate loud laptop with high

1659
01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:58,920
CPU usage.

1660
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:03,360
So like, after I've been working on this thing for about 20 minutes, I was sort of just,

1661
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:05,280
you know, getting into the flow of things.

1662
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:08,160
And I remember thinking, I stopped my work phone and go, why is my computer working so

1663
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:09,160
hard?

1664
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:10,160
No, it's just fine.

1665
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:11,160
It's fine.

1666
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:12,160
Yeah.

1667
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:14,320
So if anybody knows anything about the fan noise, I would, I would love to, I'd love

1668
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:15,320
to hear you.

1669
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:16,320
If you could get that solved.

1670
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:17,320
I mean.

1671
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:18,320
Yeah.

1672
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:19,320
Yeah.

1673
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:20,320
But so I'm going to, but that side, I'm going to put that aside.

1674
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:22,800
I'm going to keep working with it and see what kind of, what kind of things I can get

1675
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:23,800
done with it.

1676
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:27,560
So I, just to recap, I paid $1,800 for this thing.

1677
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:30,340
It did ship 286 days late.

1678
01:11:30,340 --> 01:11:33,440
It was originally expected to ship on April 2015.

1679
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:36,960
I backed it in November of 2015, I believe.

1680
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:39,840
November 22nd, 2015, I believe was when I backed it.

1681
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:40,840
Oh, I'm sorry.

1682
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:41,840
2014.

1683
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:42,840
14, right.

1684
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:43,840
Sorry.

1685
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:51,680
I wouldn't necessarily buy it today, but that said, I think it would be interesting, like

1686
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:53,720
I'm picturing bringing it to conferences and whatnot.

1687
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:54,720
Yeah.

1688
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:57,240
You would, you know, it might be a pretty good machine, especially if you can just a

1689
01:11:57,240 --> 01:11:58,240
little quieter.

1690
01:11:58,240 --> 01:12:01,160
And the feel in the hand is good.

1691
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:03,960
The hinge is good on the laptop screen.

1692
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:05,960
And it's nice to have something that feels like that.

1693
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:08,960
And it's not, oh, I bought a Mac book and I put Linux on it.

1694
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:10,520
It's like, this is something totally different.

1695
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:11,520
Yes, exactly.

1696
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:13,880
So that's exactly how I'm feeling right now about it.

1697
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:14,880
So this is the Rev2.

1698
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:17,040
Oh, one more thing I wanted to show you, which I'm not super happy with.

1699
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:20,520
I'm going to talk more about this on last and I'll have visuals to show you guys.

1700
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:24,640
It does have a backlit keyboard and all of the FN keys work, but I want to show you what

1701
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:26,400
the backlit keyboard looks like with.

1702
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:28,360
Oh, hold on a second.

1703
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:29,360
It's not working.

1704
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:30,360
Oh, there you go.

1705
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:33,220
So that's the, so the keys are backlit, but the, the, the actual letters themselves are

1706
01:12:33,220 --> 01:12:34,840
not translucent.

1707
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:37,880
So just there's light around the keys, but you can't actually seem like that would be

1708
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:39,120
that bright at night.

1709
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:42,480
It doesn't work because the keys themselves are black objects in the night and there's

1710
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:44,200
just light around them.

1711
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:48,400
The keys have, there's basically an led light behind the keyboard, but the keys themselves.

1712
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:52,240
So if you were concerned about where the keyboard was, it would help you find that, but not

1713
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:53,600
the individual keys.

1714
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:54,600
Exactly.

1715
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:59,160
That's just a, you know, they were confused about that.

1716
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:00,160
Exactly.

1717
01:13:00,160 --> 01:13:02,760
So if you ever need to find your keyboard, it can, it can do that pretty well, but you

1718
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:06,520
can't find individual keys.

1719
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:13,440
So I guess the, at the end of the day, I would say if I was betting the farm on a laptop

1720
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:19,360
right now and that was my machine, I could make it work, but I would be very disappointed.

1721
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:20,360
Chris.

1722
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:21,360
Windows key.

1723
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:22,360
I mean, all of that.

1724
01:13:22,360 --> 01:13:23,360
Yeah.

1725
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:24,360
Yeah.

1726
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:25,360
Go ahead.

1727
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:30,260
Um, I, I don't know if this is because you're, you know, recording this and this is going

1728
01:13:30,260 --> 01:13:36,040
out live and you know, uh, this will live forever on the internet or what, but I was

1729
01:13:36,040 --> 01:13:41,420
in your position, personally speaking, I would be somewhere on the barometer between mildly

1730
01:13:41,420 --> 01:13:47,600
pissed off and incandescent with wrench about this because you didn't get what you paid

1731
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:48,600
for.

1732
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:49,600
You paid a lot for it.

1733
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:54,760
It came in a shitty box with no documentation and it's not up to par.

1734
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:56,480
I would be sending it back.

1735
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:59,640
I would be getting pretty pissed off and want to talk to someone about it.

1736
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:00,640
Yeah.

1737
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:01,640
I mean, I don't know.

1738
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:03,440
You seem pretty, you're more chilled out than me clearly.

1739
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:07,000
Well, because when I, when I backed it, I knew it was a long shot and I backed it.

1740
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:11,240
I backed it for, I backed it for content because I wanted, I mean, I really liked the idea

1741
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:12,400
of the ultimate Linux laptop.

1742
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:16,440
We always have, um, you're right.

1743
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:17,440
Linux suckers.

1744
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:18,440
You're right.

1745
01:14:18,440 --> 01:14:22,100
Because that's somewhat of a unicorn, you know, and, and some companies, some very large

1746
01:14:22,100 --> 01:14:24,760
companies still don't get it a hundred percent right.

1747
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:30,040
So it, yes, okay, it is somewhat surprising that a one man band can, can churn out something

1748
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:35,760
better than a Dell, you know, Sputnik or, or system 76 or intro or whoever that would

1749
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:36,760
be surprising.

1750
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:37,760
Yeah.

1751
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:41,880
But I still think they could have tried a bit harder.

1752
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:42,880
Yeah.

1753
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:48,240
I mean, I really, I really want to be positive about this, but the, the, the honest truth

1754
01:14:48,240 --> 01:14:52,880
is, um, I guess the reason where it's a, where it's, I'm going to close the lid again cause

1755
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:56,680
I really just can't stand the fan noise, uh, where, where, uh, where it falls down for

1756
01:14:56,680 --> 01:14:59,200
me is it begins with Purism OS.

1757
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:05,240
Um, I bought this laptop to run Linux, not to run a specific distribution of Linux, and

1758
01:15:05,240 --> 01:15:06,560
that's a bit of a letdown.

1759
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:08,600
And so that's where my letdown begins.

1760
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:13,400
The fact that I also bought a rig with an RJ45 port and it doesn't have one is a bit

1761
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:14,400
of a letdown.

1762
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:21,280
Um, there's that the, the, the issues around the fan, I mean, I, here I have an 1800 laptop

1763
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:26,320
and my first order of business is break open the case and literally replace the fan with

1764
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:28,120
something I buy off Newegg.

1765
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:29,680
That's also not a great position to be in.

1766
01:15:29,680 --> 01:15:36,400
Um, I look at it as a, like a, like a model kit car or like a, like a spec car or something

1767
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:37,400
like that.

1768
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:38,400
Only it's a laptop.

1769
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:41,040
It's a spec computer and that's how I'm looking at it.

1770
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:45,440
And um, now my best hope is to make it usable.

1771
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:50,800
Uh, I think if, I think if there weren't other solutions out there, I'd be feeling pretty,

1772
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:51,800
uh, desperate.

1773
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:53,160
I'd be feeling pretty bad right now.

1774
01:15:53,160 --> 01:15:57,400
But the fact that Entraware and System76 have solutions out there and Dell, I'm feeling

1775
01:15:57,400 --> 01:15:58,400
better about it.

1776
01:15:58,400 --> 01:15:59,640
Plus this isn't your only computer.

1777
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:02,760
I mean, I realize, you know, you may have a bunch of old computers and some of them

1778
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:05,960
are dedicated to other tasks, but this isn't your only computing device.

1779
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:11,480
I would imagine if you'd saved up your pennies and you know, you were a student and you know,

1780
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:14,640
this was your one computing device, you might be a little bit more pissed.

1781
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:15,640
Oh man.

1782
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:18,880
I would be, I would be really, I would be up a creek right now.

1783
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:23,480
Now FreeBSDSA, um, okay.

1784
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:25,360
I thought it had NVIDIA graphics.

1785
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:28,280
So you remember that too, that it included NVIDIA graphics?

1786
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:33,140
Oh yeah, it was, remember it was supposed to be for 2D, it was going to be the onboard

1787
01:16:33,140 --> 01:16:37,200
Intel chipset, but for 3D it was going to be discrete graphics from NVIDIA.

1788
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:39,920
I didn't think I'd buy a 15 inch laptop with integrated graphics.

1789
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:43,440
That's like, if I go integrated graphics, that's for my smaller form factor laptops.

1790
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:45,800
When I go 15 inch and above, I'm expecting- That's a working machine.

1791
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:46,800
That's dedicated graphics.

1792
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:47,800
Yeah.

1793
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:48,800
I thought so.

1794
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:49,800
Oh.

1795
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:53,440
Do you remember the NVIDIA graphics issue?

1796
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:59,680
Yeah, I remember that that was the original, you know, launch spec, but I think they got

1797
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:06,040
a lot of negative feedback about how can this be a open source friendly laptop with NVIDIA

1798
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:11,240
chips and they went back on that and went with the Intel integrated instead.

1799
01:17:11,240 --> 01:17:17,000
So if this Thunderbolt works, we can build you external housing that has a nice external

1800
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,680
GPU and your ethernet port.

1801
01:17:19,680 --> 01:17:20,680
Right, I'm good.

1802
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:21,680
I'm good then.

1803
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:23,840
I wonder if that really is Thunderbolt.

1804
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:29,720
My other question is if you do LSPCI, can you just tell us what the wifi card is and

1805
01:17:29,720 --> 01:17:31,720
what the Bluetooth card is?

1806
01:17:31,720 --> 01:17:35,360
I have that up on the screen right now if I can, let's see, I will, I will wake it back

1807
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:36,360
up here.

1808
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:37,360
Okay.

1809
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:42,120
And Chris, Chris, while you're at it, I've also mentioned the LSPCI output for that Thunderbolt

1810
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:43,120
controller.

1811
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:45,840
Oh, clever boy, clever boy.

1812
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:46,840
All right.

1813
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:51,560
So we have a Broadwell U-host controller, let's see, audio devices, Intel Broadwell

1814
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:57,560
U-audio controller, USB is the Wildcat XHC-i controller, communication controller for a

1815
01:17:57,560 --> 01:17:58,560
Wildcat point.

1816
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:00,560
Let's see, what are we looking for specifically?

1817
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:03,440
Bluetooth and wifi.

1818
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:04,440
Hmm.

1819
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:06,120
I don't actually...

1820
01:18:06,120 --> 01:18:07,960
Bluetooth might be on the USB bus, of course.

1821
01:18:07,960 --> 01:18:15,080
Yeah, I think it is because looking at LSPCI, I see an Ethereos AR9462 wireless network adapter.

1822
01:18:15,080 --> 01:18:16,080
Okay.

1823
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:17,880
So there's our, there's our Ethereos wireless adapter.

1824
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:19,680
Yep, that's the ATH9K driven.

1825
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:20,680
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

1826
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:23,000
But I do not see the Bluetooth controller.

1827
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:24,000
Do you see that listed here, Wes?

1828
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,000
No.

1829
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,000
Yeah, I don't either.

1830
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:27,000
So yeah.

1831
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:32,760
Let's take a look, see if we can...

1832
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:41,240
On the USB bus, I see, I see a light on Ethereos AR3012 Bluetooth controller.

1833
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:44,080
So AR3012 Bluetooth.

1834
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:45,800
And a Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub.

1835
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:46,800
Hey, how about that?

1836
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:47,800
Ooh.

1837
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:48,800
Hey, how about that?

1838
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:50,400
Everyone's favorite root hub.

1839
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:51,400
Yeah.

1840
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:53,160
Yeah, exactly.

1841
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:56,400
And the CPU, just so that we have it all, I'll cat proc CPU info real quick and then

1842
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:59,400
I'll shut it down again.

1843
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:01,920
CPU info.

1844
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:10,120
It is the, it is the Intel Core i7-557U running at 3.1 gigahertz.

1845
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:11,400
And I'm closing the lid again because it's too loud.

1846
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:12,400
Is it only dual core?

1847
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:14,400
It is, well, I think maybe the mobile is.

1848
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:18,160
But it says, I think it actually lists, it lists, I know, I just turned it off.

1849
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:21,960
It does list three CPUs, which if you count zero means four cores.

1850
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:23,840
So right, right, right, right?

1851
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:25,840
If you count CPU, you know what I'm saying?

1852
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:26,840
Yeah.

1853
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:27,840
Yeah.

1854
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:28,840
So let me bring it back up.

1855
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:29,840
I think it said three CPUs.

1856
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:30,840
Yes.

1857
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:31,840
So it has four cores.

1858
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:32,840
Okay.

1859
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:33,840
Good.

1860
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:34,840
Yeah.

1861
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:40,080
I tell you what, I tell you what, the fan noise is really a killer for me.

1862
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:41,080
It really is too bad.

1863
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:42,080
All right.

1864
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:46,520
Any other, FreeBSD, any other thoughts on the, on your Libra before we wrap up the,

1865
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:47,520
the session?

1866
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:49,400
No, not really.

1867
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:52,720
I'll have more as I really dig into it and play with it.

1868
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:53,720
Okay.

1869
01:19:53,720 --> 01:19:56,480
So it is two cores and it's just because it has Hypershred and the other, the other logical

1870
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:57,480
cores.

1871
01:19:57,480 --> 01:19:58,480
Yeah.

1872
01:19:58,480 --> 01:19:59,800
I'll give you guys more on it too.

1873
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:01,920
I'm hoping to have more good things to report.

1874
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:05,920
Now I've got, so I've been primarily doing Ubuntu based OSs and now I've got Arch on

1875
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:06,920
there.

1876
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:07,920
Do that for a couple of days.

1877
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:08,920
You can try Korora.

1878
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:09,920
Yeah.

1879
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:10,920
Try, install some Steam games.

1880
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:11,920
See how those play.

1881
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:14,080
See how it works from that perspective.

1882
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:15,720
Actually getting work done.

1883
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:19,240
You know, one thing that I have to admit, feels really good holding it.

1884
01:20:19,240 --> 01:20:20,240
I'm holding it right now.

1885
01:20:20,240 --> 01:20:21,400
It just feels good in my hand.

1886
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:23,480
It's really a good, a pretty good weight distribution.

1887
01:20:23,480 --> 01:20:24,480
Yeah.

1888
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:25,480
They really nailed that.

1889
01:20:25,480 --> 01:20:30,120
The battery life real early, I'm getting so far and I've only done one, one full test

1890
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:32,960
about four and a half hours, but I, I don't have any optimization.

1891
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:34,840
I was going to say if you like power top or anything.

1892
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:35,840
Nope.

1893
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:36,840
Nope.

1894
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:39,840
But I did turn the screen down to like 80% from a hundred, but other than that, no other

1895
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:44,180
tweaks, four and a half hours and I'm going to run it through a few more cycles.

1896
01:20:44,180 --> 01:20:45,180
It's interesting.

1897
01:20:45,180 --> 01:20:49,160
The different desktop distros, all are reading the battery differently for me.

1898
01:20:49,160 --> 01:20:50,160
Of course.

1899
01:20:50,160 --> 01:20:51,160
Yeah.

1900
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:52,160
Purism reads it one way.

1901
01:20:52,160 --> 01:20:53,160
It says seven hours.

1902
01:20:53,160 --> 01:20:58,400
Ubuntu 16.04 gave me four hours and Arch said it's going to give me an hour and a half,

1903
01:20:58,400 --> 01:20:59,400
even though it was way wrong.

1904
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:00,400
Oh man.

1905
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:01,400
It was way wrong.

1906
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:02,400
But yeah.

1907
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:04,640
So each, each desktop I've installed has to give me completely different reads on how long

1908
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:05,640
the battery is going to last.

1909
01:21:05,640 --> 01:21:07,800
And the only way to really find out is you just got to run it for a while.

1910
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:08,800
So I have that in testing.

1911
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:13,160
If you have any questions, you can, uh, on, on linuxactionshow.reddit.com find episode

1912
01:21:13,160 --> 01:21:17,400
132, ask your questions about the purism there, and I'll try to incorporate them into my review

1913
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:20,200
on a, on Sunday's episode of the Linux action show.

1914
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:22,360
Once you've really lived with it.

1915
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:23,360
Yeah.

1916
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:26,800
Once I get used to the track pad a little more and see if I can maybe install.

1917
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:31,160
You know, maybe if it's, if you won't have an editor, this is going to be an interesting

1918
01:21:31,160 --> 01:21:32,200
Linux action show.

1919
01:21:32,200 --> 01:21:34,720
Maybe you should just use it as your, your show machine.

1920
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:35,720
Maybe, maybe.

1921
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:36,720
It'll be a loud show.

1922
01:21:36,720 --> 01:21:37,720
We won't be able to hear you.

1923
01:21:37,720 --> 01:21:42,640
The audience won't be able to listen to the whole show, but, uh, I'll done it on a purism.

1924
01:21:42,640 --> 01:21:43,640
Yeah.

1925
01:21:43,640 --> 01:21:44,640
Yeah.

1926
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:49,880
Well, I'm, I'm, I like the way the timing worked out because we got it right after we

1927
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:51,000
covered it last week.

1928
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:54,960
And then, uh, I'm going to have a chance to actually really be fully like dedicated to

1929
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:55,960
this.

1930
01:21:55,960 --> 01:21:57,760
And then the entryware will show up and I'll try that for awhile.

1931
01:21:57,760 --> 01:22:00,000
So I think the timing is actually is pretty good.

1932
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,560
Um, and I'll, I'll give you guys an update.

1933
01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:06,600
Um, I dunno, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm in process of deciding where I'm at.

1934
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:08,080
I'm very happy to have it.

1935
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:09,080
Yeah, definitely.

1936
01:22:09,080 --> 01:22:11,680
And if you have, if you've gotten yours out there, let me know how it's going.

1937
01:22:11,680 --> 01:22:12,680
Send us an email.

1938
01:22:12,680 --> 01:22:14,880
Go to jupitabroadcasting.com slash contact.

1939
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:21,280
You can send us in your feedback or linuxactionshow.reddit.com or you can always join us live.

1940
01:22:21,280 --> 01:22:22,800
Did you know the unplugged show is live, Wes?

1941
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:23,800
Oh yeah.

1942
01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:24,800
It's a blast.

1943
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:25,800
It's a big show.

1944
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:28,280
We, we've been having some big shows and the live contribution from our Mamba Room makes

1945
01:22:28,280 --> 01:22:29,280
all the difference.

1946
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:30,280
Go to jblive.tv.

1947
01:22:30,280 --> 01:22:33,520
We do the show 2 PM Pacific on a Tuesday.

1948
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:37,880
Go to jupitabroadcasting.com slash calendar to get that converted to your local time zone.

1949
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:38,880
What?

1950
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:39,880
What are you laughing at?

1951
01:22:39,880 --> 01:22:40,880
What?

1952
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:41,880
What is it?

1953
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:42,880
Specs on the, what?

1954
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:44,120
Uh, thermal design at low noise.

1955
01:22:44,120 --> 01:22:45,120
They say that on the site?

1956
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:46,120
Low noise?

1957
01:22:46,120 --> 01:22:47,120
Low fan noise?

1958
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:48,120
It must be a firmware bug.

1959
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:49,120
It must be.

1960
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:50,120
It must be.

1961
01:22:50,120 --> 01:22:51,120
We'll find out.

1962
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:52,120
I dunno.

1963
01:22:52,120 --> 01:22:53,120
I'll keep you guys updated.

1964
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:56,480
Thanks for tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged and we'll see you right back here

1965
01:22:56,480 --> 01:23:11,880
next Tuesday.

1966
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:32,680
Aw, crap, Wes.

1967
01:23:32,680 --> 01:23:34,880
What if I try out Windows and the fan noise stops?

1968
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:35,880
Oh, you have to.

1969
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:36,880
Now you have to.

1970
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:39,440
No, I don't want to.

1971
01:23:39,440 --> 01:23:40,440
I'll install it for you.

1972
01:23:40,440 --> 01:23:43,040
Since Rekai will be gone, I know he normally does that.

1973
01:23:43,040 --> 01:23:44,040
The dirty deed for you.

1974
01:23:44,040 --> 01:23:45,040
The dirty deed.

1975
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:46,040
Yeah.

1976
01:23:46,040 --> 01:23:47,040
I'll put Windows 10 on there.

1977
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:49,200
It'll be better than ever.

1978
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:52,280
You could probably waste a whole weekend on this troubleshooting.

1979
01:23:52,280 --> 01:23:53,280
I know.

1980
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:54,280
I know.

1981
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:55,280
I know.

1982
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:56,280
That's why it's a Linux laptop.

1983
01:23:56,280 --> 01:23:57,280
It gives you these little opportunities.

1984
01:23:57,280 --> 01:24:27,120
It gives me something to do.
