00:00.000 --> 00:06.080
Check this out West found it wiki house. It's an open source project to reinvent the way we make homes

00:06.120 --> 00:10.300
It's being developed by architects designers engineers inventors manufacturers builders

00:10.800 --> 00:18.440
Collaborating develop the best simplest most sustainable high-performance building technologies that anyone can use. This is kind of an awesome project

00:18.440 --> 00:21.880
They're like on their fourth and a half iteration right now of it

00:21.880 --> 00:25.080
This video gives you a little bit of details about it here

00:25.080 --> 00:30.660
This is the team we're at the beginning of an industrial revolution which is allowing us to use the web and digital tools

00:30.660 --> 00:35.100
To make it much much simpler to design homes that are customized to each of us

00:35.100 --> 00:41.520
So they're showing a website where you go in and kind of customize the home and it creates the like the printing spec that can even

00:41.520 --> 00:47.980
Be locally printed using digital manufacturing tools and then simply assembled even by small businesses and homeowners themselves

00:47.980 --> 00:55.400
really robust sustainable beautiful homes that has the potential to fundamentally change the rules of

00:56.080 --> 01:00.440
How we make houses in Britain instead of selling the land to just one developer

01:00.440 --> 01:03.340
We divide sites up into plots to be bought or rented

01:03.720 --> 01:07.780
Directly by local families at a price that they can afford together with the local planners

01:07.780 --> 01:09.480
The community would develop an outline

01:09.480 --> 01:13.600
Neighborhood plan and a basic set of design rules as long as you stay within the rules

01:13.600 --> 01:18.440
You can build modify or extend without having to get any further planning permission from the council

01:18.440 --> 01:24.800
That's residents are then free to create their own homes using any building method supported by not just one or even ten companies

01:24.800 --> 01:29.760
But hundreds of companies so I watched a couple of videos they have on YouTube from a couple

01:30.120 --> 01:35.520
One of the ones I watched was a couple that made a house and they said that there's the first time they've ever done anything

01:35.520 --> 01:42.020
Like this, but the thing that was really awesome for them was that there were so many other community members that built a house before

01:42.020 --> 01:46.720
Them where they had found something that didn't work quite right or made little changes

01:46.720 --> 01:49.840
And so the by the time they were on version 4 another beyond the version they were even using

01:49.960 --> 01:53.440
There were so many little things as they were so many like, oh, I'm so glad somebody thought of that

01:53.440 --> 01:59.340
I'm so glad somebody thought of that. It's awesome. And it's kind of like how you would share a 3d printing spec. Totally

02:00.080 --> 02:02.680
Really neat. So it's a wiki house dot CC

02:02.960 --> 02:04.280
Yeah, I don't know

02:04.280 --> 02:07.700
I part of me loves the whole tiny house thing because I think sometimes

02:07.700 --> 02:13.100
People just by default think they need some huge palace to live in when you could probably get by with a lot less and have

02:13.100 --> 02:18.860
A lot less to have to manage and keep up, you know, keep clean and keep on top of repairs

02:18.860 --> 02:20.860
I think a small house could work for a lot of people

02:21.340 --> 02:24.620
But if you're somebody like me, I'd have nowhere no idea where to start

02:25.480 --> 02:31.460
Wiki house dot CC seemed kind of fun an open-source house. I'd like to see what some of these finished houses look like

02:32.340 --> 02:35.060
Somebody build one and let us know. Yeah, there we go. Come on audience

02:35.060 --> 02:37.820
This is Linux unplugged episode

02:38.940 --> 02:41.620
188 for March 14th, 2017

02:52.100 --> 02:52.740
Oh

02:52.740 --> 02:58.380
Welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that's so excited about Pi Day. It's borderline obnoxious

02:58.880 --> 03:03.680
My name is Chris. My name is Wes. Hello, Wes. It is a big day today. Not just Pi Day

03:03.680 --> 03:09.120
It's a major birthday of 23 years today and nobody's talking about it. Do you agree?

03:09.120 --> 03:15.000
Yeah, no, we literally had to fact-check it three different places because nobody's nobody's talking about it

03:15.000 --> 03:20.480
Well, we're gonna talk about today on the show. It's a big deal. We're gonna get into that. Plus, are you ready for the challenge?

03:20.480 --> 03:25.960
I have no idea. I like that honest answer, Wes. On Pi Day

03:25.960 --> 03:30.100
We thought what would be better than Mycroft on a Raspberry Pi?

03:30.100 --> 03:36.160
How about Mycroft and Alexa on a cancel on a Raspberry Pi?

03:37.020 --> 03:38.740
cancel

03:38.740 --> 03:45.220
We're gonna try to load them both Mycroft and the echo software platform on a Raspberry Pi

03:45.580 --> 03:47.900
Live on the show and see if we can create the ultimate

03:48.740 --> 03:54.780
personal assistant powered by a Raspberry Pi on Pi Day plus we're gonna give you an update on some of our favorite open source projects that

03:54.780 --> 03:57.120
we follow every single week and then

03:57.120 --> 03:59.720
Despite Wimpy's denial

04:01.800 --> 04:03.720
VR on Linux

04:03.720 --> 04:10.520
Had a big boost this week. It actually ladies and gentlemen, may be crossing into the legitimate territory

04:10.520 --> 04:15.960
What what I know I I did not actually think I'd be saying that on this show anytime soon

04:16.240 --> 04:20.880
But I we got everything from gaming to creating a VR Linux desktop

04:22.320 --> 04:25.740
Yeah, and also those people who say AR is the future

04:25.740 --> 04:28.020
We're gonna talk about that too wimpy

04:28.020 --> 04:31.940
I mean, we'll be talking about that later on in the show and we're gonna wrap it

04:31.940 --> 04:37.220
We're gonna wrap it wrap it all up with a celebration of 23 years of the official release of

04:37.700 --> 04:43.740
The Linux kernel and only in the only way your Linux unplugged show could the only way so we got a really big show

04:43.740 --> 04:47.300
So big so let's real big great show ever great best show ever

04:47.300 --> 04:55.900
So let's bring in our mumble room to make it all happen time-appropriate greetings virtual lug how

04:56.420 --> 04:58.420
Hello everybody it is good

04:59.860 --> 05:05.780
Alexa and stop. I'm not talking to her. Did you she's very eager to gosh?

05:05.780 --> 05:10.860
I I feel like something to prove I feel like she's getting triggered more today than she ever has before

05:10.940 --> 05:15.100
I think she wants to be in the show. She wants yeah, she should dial into the mumble room

05:15.100 --> 05:20.620
Well guys I want to start with I we always like to open the show with some of our favorite open source project

05:20.620 --> 05:25.620
And there's nothing too much higher on that list except for maybe comp isn't barrel

05:25.860 --> 05:30.300
It's the matte desktop, and we have a big release version one dot one eight

05:30.860 --> 05:32.140
released

05:32.140 --> 05:34.060
just yesterday

05:34.060 --> 05:39.900
Martin Wimperth, I'm not familiar with who Martin is but maybe wimpy could help us understand

05:40.020 --> 05:44.740
What's new and mate one dot one eight hello wimpy hello there? How you doing good good?

05:44.740 --> 05:50.980
And very excited about the new release it seems like the March towards gtk3 continues, right?

05:51.940 --> 05:55.900
Well the March towards gtk3 or completing it. I should say yeah

05:56.780 --> 06:01.460
So we're finally there as in everything is now only

06:02.220 --> 06:04.540
buildable with gtk3 and

06:05.140 --> 06:11.780
any of the remaining GTK to support code that we had kicking around has been ejected and

06:12.540 --> 06:13.980
the

06:13.980 --> 06:16.640
One dot one eight release has really been focused around

06:17.660 --> 06:23.860
Cleaning up that gtk3 implementation. There's still a bit of work to do, but this is a huge step forwards

06:24.300 --> 06:28.220
On a number of fronts bringing the whole underpinnings up to date

06:28.860 --> 06:33.520
Fat and it looks like oh hi there. It looks like it's based on three dot fourteen is that right?

06:34.620 --> 06:39.580
It supports gtk3 14 and up. Oh, I see that's what it. That's the lowest I see

06:39.580 --> 06:43.140
That's the lowest it will support yeah, but it supports all the way up to three two two

06:43.140 --> 06:50.060
Notifications now implemented awesome lock screen will load the user selected background very nice new features

06:50.060 --> 06:54.460
Yeah, that one. I think is probably going to be about the most popular. Which one's that?

06:55.020 --> 06:56.340
the

06:56.340 --> 07:03.980
Setting the lock screen on to whatever the selected backdrop is rather than the system really really we've had people asking

07:04.780 --> 07:06.780
Things everyone notices I suppose

07:07.380 --> 07:09.380
it's it's a curious one because

07:09.380 --> 07:13.660
Where that where that image is set it runs in a in a

07:14.020 --> 07:21.100
Process with elevated permissions, so the reason that we hadn't done it for such a long time is there were security considerations

07:21.100 --> 07:24.260
So had to be done properly which it has been done

07:24.260 --> 07:27.340
So now when you change your backdrop, and you lock the screen that is the backdrop

07:27.340 --> 07:32.860
You'll see on the lock screen which is a small thing, but lots of people have been asking for that for ages

07:32.860 --> 07:40.380
So this I believe also is landing in 1704 so anyone that will have a point to 1704

07:41.140 --> 07:44.460
Will have a point to one dot one eight is it my m is that right am I getting that wrong?

07:44.780 --> 07:47.340
Yeah, it has landed in fact. Oh it has already

07:48.340 --> 07:53.300
Yeah, it's it's it's landed at some point today, but yeah, it's all in there now

07:53.300 --> 07:58.620
So if you're running the up into Marte 1704 alpha

07:58.620 --> 08:04.260
Yeah, and you apt update and apt upgrade you'll you'll get all of this stuff now now

08:04.260 --> 08:06.260
Was there a debate to go directly to two?

08:07.260 --> 08:09.900
Well, yeah, so yeah, yeah

08:09.900 --> 08:16.620
I I was myself and the fedora maintainer were keen that we call this to do. Oh, yeah, okay?

08:16.620 --> 08:19.260
That's my thought you know democracy is king

08:20.740 --> 08:26.620
There was a 50-50 split on on the vote as to whether we were going to go to dot naught and I decided that

08:26.620 --> 08:30.700
It wasn't worth it wasn't worth fighting over so step down

08:30.700 --> 08:32.220
So this is one dot one eight

08:32.220 --> 08:38.300
But this has got all of the features in it that we discussed when I was I was trying to push the agenda and say

08:38.300 --> 08:44.100
That this should be a 2.0. Release. Well, I suppose it's it makes it seem less of a big change

08:44.100 --> 08:48.460
Which is probably comfortable to imitate users and some just some degree to some. Yeah

08:48.860 --> 08:54.380
Yeah, some of the other developers feel that it needs some a bigger significant

08:54.380 --> 08:58.220
Step forward in terms of technology support for it to be a 2.0

08:58.220 --> 09:02.300
So they're suggesting that the 2.0 will only come when?

09:03.780 --> 09:07.540
When Wayland is supported so that could be some time

09:08.300 --> 09:15.660
Interesting idea though. We get there interesting. That's the same thing as like that, you know, Linux 2.7

09:15.660 --> 09:17.100
hundred and fifty

09:17.100 --> 09:20.620
Yeah, it's gonna result in the same kind of ridiculous thing

09:20.620 --> 09:23.740
Joe you had a point about the shifting sands of GTK. I want to hear that

09:24.540 --> 09:29.980
Yes, so Martin good to speak to you on this show one of the many we've spoken to each other on

09:31.340 --> 09:35.740
But GTK it seems to me is just a constantly shifting sand

09:35.740 --> 09:40.140
Isn't it where you you you seem to not be able to be sure exactly?

09:40.700 --> 09:45.660
Which one's going to be the stable version and stuff? So that must factor into your decisions

09:45.660 --> 09:51.500
In terms of porting it to GTK 3 and finalizing things and making things stable as Marte is famously known for

09:52.620 --> 09:55.820
Yeah, so the we've been you know

09:57.100 --> 10:03.340
Struggling with keeping pace at the at the rate of change in the GTK 3 toolkit for a number of years

10:03.980 --> 10:07.420
But with GTK 3 2 2 that is now

10:08.060 --> 10:11.100
Behind us. So GTK 3 2 2 is now

10:11.100 --> 10:17.420
That is now behind us. So GTK 3 2 2 is going to remain the same

10:17.500 --> 10:23.100
There's not going to be a 3 2 4 3 2 2 is just going to get point releases that fix stuff

10:24.300 --> 10:28.460
But no API or API changes as far as as far as I'm aware

10:29.340 --> 10:36.700
so the Marte desktop is going to or at least what we've discussed is stick to GTK 3 2 2 now because

10:36.700 --> 10:43.580
Because we can stabilize and coalesce around that and refine what we've been working towards

10:44.140 --> 10:46.860
And there's a lot of good stuff that we can still enable

10:47.660 --> 10:49.900
on top of GTK 3 2 2

10:50.860 --> 10:54.780
And GTK 4 is just around the corner

10:55.340 --> 10:59.820
But the GTK developers have made it clear that GTK 4 is going to be

10:59.820 --> 11:07.580
a very much iterative development with lots of API and ABI changes in the early versions

11:08.220 --> 11:10.220
and that they will

11:10.860 --> 11:13.500
Make it clear when a GTK 4 release

11:14.460 --> 11:17.420
Gets to an API stable version

11:17.980 --> 11:23.900
So it's not how things have been in the past where they've you know attempted to maintain or that with GTK 3

11:23.980 --> 11:27.100
This is part of the problem why that why they're changing this in GTK 4

11:27.100 --> 11:33.180
But they're not going to try and maintain stability in GTK 4. It is going to be very much rapid and right

11:33.260 --> 11:36.060
All things are going to change for quite some time. So

11:36.620 --> 11:41.420
Not a platform we're going to target because we've been living with that for a number of years

11:41.420 --> 11:49.180
And we now just want a quiet life and just want to just clean things up and maybe add a few features rather than keep on fighting

11:49.660 --> 11:51.660
You know the constant change in the API

11:51.660 --> 11:57.740
So I also had a little inclination that perhaps we should oh is it chillin? It's chillin, right?

11:57.740 --> 12:02.940
Ubuntu chillin. We should follow up on that because was it was it two three weeks ago you and I were talking about it

12:02.940 --> 12:07.420
And I think what sort of piqued your interest. Do you have any updates on that particular project for us?

12:08.140 --> 12:13.100
Yeah, so um, i've i've spoken to a couple of guys from the chillin team

12:13.740 --> 12:16.940
So when we last spoke whenever it was a few weeks back

12:16.940 --> 12:21.020
They'd obviously announced that they had um forked. Uh,

12:21.820 --> 12:25.660
Some big chunk of Marte and called it UK UI

12:26.780 --> 12:30.780
And that they'd given it very much a windows-esque look and feel

12:31.500 --> 12:38.620
And this was going to be the new default in uh, Ubuntu chillin, which is the distro that's specifically made for the Chinese market

12:39.500 --> 12:44.300
Um and working with them what we've been able to do is instead of forking like a

12:44.300 --> 12:50.780
We've been able to do is instead of forking like all the things we've now got that down to just seven packages

12:51.420 --> 12:53.580
so they're forking seven packages and

12:54.140 --> 12:56.140
I think two of them are actually

12:56.620 --> 12:58.620
um, not so much forks but

12:59.180 --> 13:06.460
derivative works, um in their own right so that they don't really count so there's five packages that are forks of Marte

13:06.460 --> 13:13.580
Um, so what that means is that they're going to be sitting on top of most of the Marte stack with just a few packages

13:14.060 --> 13:19.260
Um that they need so obviously they need their own session manager because they need to identify as their own desktop session

13:20.060 --> 13:21.180
and

13:21.180 --> 13:23.180
most of the other

13:23.180 --> 13:29.340
Uh packages that they've forked things like i'm not quite sure how it's pronounced but peony or peony or something like that

13:29.340 --> 13:31.340
Which is their file manager?

13:31.340 --> 13:33.340
which is forked from kaja and

13:33.900 --> 13:35.100
um

13:35.100 --> 13:43.980
That we're simply not going to accept the the changes that they've made upstream because they've basically made it look exactly like windows explorer

13:44.700 --> 13:49.660
Which just doesn't fit with you know, what Marte is setting out to do

13:50.300 --> 13:56.300
So there are some things that they're just going to fork they're going to maintain that themselves and it's fair enough

13:57.180 --> 14:01.340
Um, but then most of the other stuff they're going to sit on all of the same underpinnings

14:01.420 --> 14:03.500
So they will get to benefit from this new

14:03.500 --> 14:09.980
Uh Marte release in 1704 because that's going to be the first release of Ubuntu chillin

14:10.700 --> 14:13.580
That features the new uk ui desktop

14:14.540 --> 14:16.540
So um, they get a new

14:16.860 --> 14:18.860
new uh set of packages as well

14:19.740 --> 14:23.340
So they uh, they've they've modified it to look more like explorer. That's interesting

14:23.420 --> 14:26.380
I wonder if they'll also update it to include the new ads that windows 10

14:27.020 --> 14:27.980
Oh, i'm kidding

14:27.980 --> 14:30.220
So wimpy, how has it gone just communicating with them?

14:30.220 --> 14:35.260
Has it been is it been fairly effective and efficient and they seem to be receptive to talking to you. Yeah

14:35.580 --> 14:41.100
Yeah, it's been great. So they filed a bug in launchpad that outlined everything that they wanted to fork

14:41.660 --> 14:42.780
um

14:42.780 --> 14:47.420
and there's another guy who works on Ubuntu gnome and he's also one of the um,

14:47.980 --> 14:52.460
Uh the community developers for on the on the desktop side of things as well

14:53.420 --> 14:58.300
So jeremy beecher and he's he's been helping them as well. So we responded on the

14:58.300 --> 15:03.660
um on their bug and basically said do you need to fork all of this stuff and here's some ideas about how you can

15:04.060 --> 15:06.060
save yourself some effort and

15:06.140 --> 15:07.100
just

15:07.100 --> 15:11.820
Use some of the facilities that they exist in marte so that you don't have to fork everything

15:12.220 --> 15:17.500
So we talked through there and and I said, you know, come and join us in irc. This is our channel

15:17.900 --> 15:20.700
These are the people you want to talk to which they did

15:21.260 --> 15:27.260
So we've had a good a good discussion with them and um, yeah, uh, I don't know that we'll be

15:27.260 --> 15:32.380
Closely collaborating. I think they've got a lot on at the moment to try and get this first release out

15:32.460 --> 15:37.420
And then after the first release out is out for them. I'm going to go back to them and see if I can get them more

15:37.980 --> 15:43.260
More involved with with marta as a whole because obviously they're they're going to be using great chunks of it

15:43.260 --> 15:44.700
And it'll be nice to see

15:44.700 --> 15:46.220
If they get a lot of users on it, too

15:46.220 --> 15:50.460
It'd be good to get some of their observations and bug fixes or at least bugs they find

15:50.460 --> 15:54.620
I've heard there's quite a lot of people in china. Yeah, and there's quite a lot of people using Ubuntu

15:54.620 --> 15:55.820
Yeah, definitely

15:55.820 --> 16:01.260
China seems like you could get some good feedback and input at least if nothing else indeed indeed. That's fascinating

16:01.740 --> 16:06.300
I I wanted to uh shift gears and talk about uh rising just for a second

16:06.300 --> 16:09.660
But it was actually following up to something that uh poppy and wimpy

16:10.220 --> 16:16.940
Were discussing on the uh latest episode of the ubuntu podcast of the new season. Yeah, and it's something we touched on too

16:17.580 --> 16:24.220
A little bit and it's it's rising and I wanted to I wanted to pick your guys's brains. Uh, specifically around

16:24.220 --> 16:28.300
We so your ubuntu podcast covered it and I think we discussed it on

16:28.460 --> 16:33.260
It was either this last little linux action show or the one before I can't remember exactly because we pre-recorded a couple of them

16:34.140 --> 16:36.140
uh, and I I noticed that

16:36.380 --> 16:43.260
Hoping you seem to sort of shrug it off. But the more i've thought about this. I really think that perhaps amd might be willing to make

16:43.260 --> 16:44.620
a big

16:44.620 --> 16:49.820
A big product differentiating change here. Uh, and so what do you think poppy? Do you think we could be?

16:49.820 --> 16:56.620
Looking at the at the possibility of amd stepping up and saying we're going to take the amd control processor

16:56.620 --> 17:00.860
We're going to take some of our binary blobs and we're going to open source them and not just for the desktop

17:00.860 --> 17:04.220
But maybe also for server and other uses do you think it could happen?

17:05.660 --> 17:10.700
I'd love to see it and I feel a bit jaded because I've heard

17:11.260 --> 17:15.340
Numerous times that amd are going to do the next big thing and you know this next

17:15.340 --> 17:19.420
Product that they're going to come out with it's going to be open source. It's all going to be clean and it's going to be

17:19.420 --> 17:24.540
The thing that's going to kill nvidia or it's it's it's the thing you want to put in your computer and

17:25.100 --> 17:28.620
I just don't I just don't because I don't trust them. I don't trust them

17:29.180 --> 17:32.460
To deliver on what they keep saying they're going to deliver

17:32.460 --> 17:38.140
But do you think it also betrays the fact that perhaps there has been some internal discussions and debating and they feel like it's something

17:38.140 --> 17:40.540
They should do but I can't quite figure out how to pull the trigger

17:40.540 --> 17:46.700
And that was exciting to be able to see, you know a conversation on reddit turn into a ceo level conversation

17:46.780 --> 17:52.380
Yeah, that's great. And I hope it follows through. I hope it doesn't just die as yet

17:52.380 --> 18:00.060
Another project internal to the company that you doesn't actually materialize or they realize well actually there aren't that many desktop linux users

18:00.060 --> 18:05.340
So we don't really care. It just seems like even if they didn't even if they didn't care about the desktop

18:05.340 --> 18:12.540
Even if they didn't care about the desktop if they just totally ignored the desktop the benefits of doing the server side for gpu-based

18:12.860 --> 18:17.180
Tasks and entire server systems built using amd's whole platform

18:17.820 --> 18:23.020
It feels like they would they would almost become the default for really reliable completely open

18:23.740 --> 18:27.740
And and by the way by completely open also means auditable linux servers

18:28.300 --> 18:31.340
I would love that to happen. I'm just not holding my breath. Yeah

18:31.340 --> 18:37.340
Yeah, okay. All right. It feels like to me and I hate to use this term because it kind of feels like a debug term

18:37.340 --> 18:41.180
But in the post-snowden quote-unquote or the post vault 7 reality

18:42.460 --> 18:48.620
If I want a highly confidential highly secure cloud server, I would like to have something that is

18:49.420 --> 18:54.380
From the blobs that run the hardware all the way up to the code that runs my web server

18:54.780 --> 18:56.220
And the web apps that run on top of it

18:56.220 --> 19:02.300
I would like to be able to audit that especially if i'm a government institution or or a non-profit of some type that might be

19:02.860 --> 19:08.300
In the political light. I feel like this is this was the market pressure would almost would almost just

19:08.760 --> 19:13.580
Handsomely reward amd enough to make it worth it just in the server area alone. I could be wrong

19:14.620 --> 19:16.700
Does anybody else in the moment have a sense of that before we move on?

19:16.780 --> 19:21.580
I'm, pretty excited about ryzen, even though I don't have any intentions of buying. In fact, I may be buying a

19:21.580 --> 19:28.540
A 1080 graphics card from nvidia pretty soon actually for just a vr, but i'll save that for later

19:29.100 --> 19:30.460
All right, so what happens?

19:30.460 --> 19:34.780
I share poppy skepticism because it said the same thing in 2009

19:35.020 --> 19:42.300
And I think I kept believing that right up until vulkan came out. Yeah for every other platform, but amd

19:43.420 --> 19:45.420
Yeah, I I agree. Joe you were going to say something too

19:45.420 --> 19:51.340
Yeah, I was going to say what happens when they do their next deal with microsoft or sony for playstation or xbox?

19:51.580 --> 19:53.900
And have to put a processor in one of those

19:54.220 --> 19:58.460
You can be sure right. They are not going to want that stuff to be open source, right?

19:58.780 --> 20:03.980
Right. I just really would love to see some solid competition to intel because it's not just the graphics, right?

20:03.980 --> 20:07.420
It could be it could be the whole platform would be so I agree

20:07.420 --> 20:12.460
I'm trying not to get too excited about it, but just the idea and who knows how accurate it is and perhaps I

20:12.460 --> 20:18.300
Sorry, chris in a dream world. Yes. I agree. I would love this. I would love for it to be yes

20:18.300 --> 20:20.700
The comp the compute platform of choice, right?

20:20.780 --> 20:27.820
Like whether it's you know, you could throw out your intel cpus throw out your proprietary nvidia drivers and you could go all in

20:28.620 --> 20:31.100
amd and have your racks full of

20:32.140 --> 20:37.660
CUDA cores doing all your compute and you could be super happy with everything being open source and auditable

20:38.540 --> 20:39.740
I'm

20:39.740 --> 20:46.380
Yeah, imagine really 4k gaming and vr with uh open source amd drivers, right? That is surely the dream

20:46.460 --> 20:49.180
Yes, joe joe you mispronounced ar there

20:50.620 --> 20:52.620
There it is

20:52.620 --> 20:54.620
We're getting there. We're getting there

20:55.100 --> 21:04.140
Yeah, okay, um, so ryzen's an interesting development from amd, but I think it's most interesting, um in for server use because

21:04.860 --> 21:07.100
What you're getting is something that's a little bit cheaper

21:07.100 --> 21:14.620
Um almost equivalent, um in terms of compute power not quite intel can best it in in in most areas by just a smidge

21:15.100 --> 21:17.980
But the big thing the big thing at the data center is is power

21:18.700 --> 21:24.940
And this these new ryzen chips are significantly lower power than the equivalent intel. That's a great point

21:24.940 --> 21:31.180
So I think that's where it matters and likewise if amd have any aspirations to

21:31.180 --> 21:36.300
Uh make their uh cpus available through libre boot or core boot or whatever

21:36.860 --> 21:43.260
Um, then it makes most sense in the server market because the linux desktop market share just isn't big enough to warrant them

21:43.660 --> 21:48.780
Uh putting that time and effort in but they could be persuaded that on servers

21:49.740 --> 21:52.300
There's there's some benefit to that imagine a world

21:53.100 --> 21:57.260
Just just just because often you'll see well, why do we want commercial software on the linux?

21:57.260 --> 22:02.060
Desktop, why do we care if we have more users for linux desktop? Maybe it should just be for us technical people

22:02.060 --> 22:05.580
We'll have a haven of an os built for us. Oh, that sounds nice. Yeah, it does

22:06.220 --> 22:14.700
But imagine for a moment if you will ladies and gentlemen, let's imagineer that adobe has released photoshop premiere and after effects on linux

22:16.060 --> 22:22.860
If this is the if that if those applications existed on the linux desktop amd would probably be all in on doing this

22:22.860 --> 22:27.420
This would be an obvious decision for them because they would want to dominate that workstation market

22:28.460 --> 22:31.580
So that's why I say like I don't I at the end of the day

22:31.580 --> 22:35.660
I don't necessarily want a desktop full of closed source applications on my linux desktop

22:35.980 --> 22:40.940
But if we got a couple of market dominating applications for a couple of segments

22:41.420 --> 22:47.660
Then all of a sudden there is a lot more reason to invest in the desktop platform and right now our best in

22:47.660 --> 22:53.820
Is the server or mobile market and we hope to god that there's a trickle down effect that applies to us desktop users

22:54.140 --> 22:59.280
That's what we have right now. And if we had a couple of just totally category owning applications

22:59.900 --> 23:01.820
that demanded

23:01.820 --> 23:08.380
Great hardware. You would see companies like amd tripping over themselves to deliver this and we're just we just we're not there yet

23:08.940 --> 23:14.940
What were we talking about dream worlds a little bit? Yeah. Yeah, I know well, even if you look at it

23:14.940 --> 23:20.300
Seems like it should be an adobe's best interest unless they feel like distributing uh photoshop via the microsoft app store one day

23:20.780 --> 23:22.460
It seems like it should be obvious

23:22.460 --> 23:25.180
They should be seeing the same lights that valve is seeing the same warnings

23:25.180 --> 23:27.740
But we're going to get there actually in just a moment. Uh, but

23:28.780 --> 23:34.140
Yeah, yeah, maybe I maybe my uh, maybe my linux goggles are just too rose-colored for me to understand why they don't do it

23:34.140 --> 23:39.020
But I tell you what, uh, there is like a suggestion why they don't do it. What is it?

23:39.020 --> 23:44.940
Package distribution is a massive pain. Yeah, I know but it's that that is actually solvable

23:44.940 --> 23:50.060
It is it really is it's not perfect, but it's it's not only is there things like snaps

23:50.540 --> 23:56.460
But there's also just target an lts of buntu. I was gonna say that does seem to be like a it's not ideal

23:56.460 --> 23:59.500
But it does mostly just every other distro will figure it out

24:00.060 --> 24:02.060
They would have to be like, you know

24:02.060 --> 24:05.740
Dealing with a bunch of hate from us to like so many people like oh, why are you picking me?

24:05.740 --> 24:12.380
I disagree. I wouldn't I agree deal with hate from a very small minority people who would never run their software and the professional market

24:12.380 --> 24:13.660
Would not care

24:13.660 --> 24:19.020
Yeah, plus stick it on ubuntu and what's going to happen people are going to port it to arch and exactly

24:19.020 --> 24:23.340
Yeah, there'll be an aur in 15 minutes that pulls down the deb and installs it on my arch box

24:24.140 --> 24:30.780
That's just you know, that's why also if you look at what valve did where they just created an ubuntu runtime inside their directory structure

24:30.780 --> 24:34.300
And now they just did they just held their directory structure and they just they just held their directory structure

24:34.300 --> 24:39.180
And now they just did they just held they have all of their folks play target to that and that works fine

24:39.420 --> 24:45.340
Adobe could do that adobe could create a horribly out of date runtime environment full of libraries

24:45.340 --> 24:50.080
They do not take advantage of the latest features of my system and they could target that and make applications

24:50.620 --> 24:54.540
For all the linux desktops that would still be 20 times better in performance than they are on windows

24:55.180 --> 24:57.180
snaps is a new lsb

24:57.340 --> 25:00.380
I would also take a snap. I would even I would even take an app image

25:00.380 --> 25:06.060
I I I tell you there is hardware out there now like the oryx pro and the xps 15

25:06.860 --> 25:12.780
That if I had a competent video editing software and and and compositing software besides blender

25:13.580 --> 25:15.580
I would pull the trigger. I would pull the trigger

25:16.140 --> 25:20.140
I would I would not be doing the show right now. I'd be buying that hardware. I would pull the trigger so hard

25:20.780 --> 25:24.860
I just would love to see it and then maybe that we'd have a viable platform, you know for real creative professionals

25:24.860 --> 25:29.340
You can put some elementary on there if you had that lts support. I love that. I love it

25:29.340 --> 25:33.980
So we're gonna we're gonna get into valve here in a moment and also our old friend sync thing

25:34.540 --> 25:40.380
Some interesting. Yeah, some interesting numbers from syncing in a while since he's come around, but yeah, it's back. Yeah. Yeah

25:40.460 --> 25:43.660
It's back in town. Yes visiting the pacific northwest all synced up

25:45.740 --> 25:49.580
We're gonna sync up with yeah, that's right. I see what you did there west that's that's pretty good

25:49.740 --> 25:51.840
First we're going to talk about linux academy at linuxacademy.com

25:52.860 --> 25:58.060
Unplugged go there to support the show and sign up for a free seven-day trial a free seven-day trial of a platform

25:58.060 --> 26:03.820
to help expand your mind about linux linux the nitty itty bitty details and also

26:04.220 --> 26:08.560
The really big heady stuff built around linux like that open stack azure containers

26:09.400 --> 26:12.140
Infrastructure management they make it all really accessible

26:12.220 --> 26:15.740
whatever it is, if you're just learning how to manage a firewall on a linux box or

26:16.220 --> 26:19.660
Browse the directory or if you want to go all in on the really huge topics

26:19.900 --> 26:22.220
They've got self-paced in-depth video courses

26:22.220 --> 26:26.140
They have labs give you hands-on experience instructor mentoring when you need it

26:26.140 --> 26:30.140
I don't know what to call it because the platform feels like something that is

26:31.420 --> 26:36.780
Like like like a platform sounds like something you do to to to connect a whole bunch of stuff and sell stuff

26:36.780 --> 26:43.020
Like it's not a it's it is a learning. It is well, you know what? It's an online academy. That's what it is

26:43.340 --> 26:49.660
Whether you're an experienced sysadmin or new to the world of linux azure and aws open stack and devops

26:49.660 --> 26:57.580
A sharp skill set is an absolute necessity to succeed meet linux academy an online linux and cloud training platform

26:57.820 --> 27:05.020
That uses self-paced video courses and hands-on labs to give you real world experience for a wide range of skills

27:05.580 --> 27:11.020
Trained for your certification learn the latest devops tools and grow your skill set to do better work

27:11.420 --> 27:18.700
Linux academy is not just a video library our scenario based server labs and quiz system allow you to learn hands-on

27:18.700 --> 27:25.740
We also have full-time human instructors who answer questions and help you earn that certification or promotion at work

27:26.220 --> 27:30.300
We add new training every week. So you'll always be up to date on the latest tech

27:30.920 --> 27:38.220
Sysadmins of every experience level use linux academy to stay on the bleeding edge of the linux ecosystem. You should too

27:39.500 --> 27:41.500
I've never installed gnu

27:41.900 --> 27:43.500
linuxacademy.com

27:43.500 --> 27:49.580
Plugs where you go to support the show sign up for a free seven-day trial check out some of their downloadable comprehensive study guides

27:49.900 --> 27:55.900
The vibrant community packed full of jupiter broadcasting members the course scheduler that works with your busy schedule

27:56.140 --> 28:02.300
The note cards that get forked and improved by those very community members and of course the instructor mentoring the real humans that help you

28:02.860 --> 28:04.880
When you need it at linuxacademy.com

28:06.280 --> 28:10.620
Slash unplugged. Okay before we get into the sync thing. Hey, hey wes. How's it going out there?

28:10.620 --> 28:17.660
Yeah, yeah, you're doing it. He's got a raspberry pi. Why are you doing it in the other room wes?

28:20.380 --> 28:26.140
Are you using the tv out there for your screen hilarious? That's awesome. I feel like I should take a picture of that

28:26.140 --> 28:30.300
So, uh, what do you have right now on the raspberry pi right now? We've got a minecraft

28:30.300 --> 28:33.660
It should maybe be working. I might need to restart it. I just plugged in the microphone

28:33.660 --> 28:37.660
I brought for it. Oh good thinking, but it's all paired up with their online service now

28:37.660 --> 28:40.780
So good so the step is alexa if that's working

28:41.980 --> 28:46.620
So the minecraft portions might might be working right? That's awesome. All right. Well, we'll check back in good work

28:46.620 --> 28:51.420
I mean, that's it. Nice. That's a nice that's that's a pretty good accomplishment right there wes i'm impressed already

28:51.660 --> 28:56.700
So sync thing has published some I don't I I think this is new data dot sync thing net

28:56.860 --> 29:02.300
It's new to me at least and they're showing the total number of unique users that have reporting turned on which by the way

29:02.300 --> 29:03.740
Not on my default

29:03.740 --> 29:08.700
uh, and uh, it's fascinating because what it basically shows is a

29:09.240 --> 29:15.660
consistent with the exception of uh, the release from dot 9 to dot 10 a consistent trend line of growth

29:15.980 --> 29:18.220
Uh new users joining every single day growing

29:18.620 --> 29:23.660
Uh each version getting more downloads than the last version files managed per device growing

29:24.380 --> 29:28.540
Memory usage growing. Haha, I get it. So, uh, I thought actually

29:29.980 --> 29:31.980
in in the age of of

29:31.980 --> 29:37.660
Uh constantly talking about how dropbox is this or dropbox is that or libre vault's gonna be or libre vault can't be

29:38.300 --> 29:43.260
I thought it was interesting to go back and revisit our old friend sync thing and see how active it actually appears to be

29:43.740 --> 29:45.260
um with uh

29:45.260 --> 29:49.500
Nearly now 30 000 unique users that have data reporting on per day

29:50.380 --> 29:52.380
Active not bad

29:52.460 --> 29:53.260
Yeah

29:53.260 --> 29:58.220
Yeah, I saw some discussion about this too. Like some folks are saying there's not very many relay servers still so uh,

29:58.220 --> 30:02.620
Uh one guy's got one going on digital ocean and it's like on the san francisco data center

30:02.620 --> 30:04.300
It's like one of the most popular on the west coast

30:04.300 --> 30:06.060
Oh, wow, not that many running

30:06.060 --> 30:10.860
So people are working on setting up containers with the relays in there to help make it easier for people to throw those up

30:11.180 --> 30:16.540
Yeah, have you messed with it at all sync thing? Have you ever have you been I still have a couple things going

30:16.540 --> 30:18.540
They've just been running. Yes, uh

30:19.340 --> 30:22.620
Very much in the background. So this is actually a good motivator for me to kind of

30:23.020 --> 30:25.820
Check back in with that. See I mean it's all been working because I use it

30:25.820 --> 30:29.340
Uh, but really it's just a way to easily shuffle files around right now. Mm-hmm

30:29.900 --> 30:31.900
Wimpy, you know i've got to ask. Oh, go ahead

30:32.700 --> 30:38.940
I use it every day. You are you are producer michael. Ladies and gentlemen to the rescue every day. Tell me about it

30:39.740 --> 30:44.540
I use it to sync all my some config files for multiple computers and also for a

30:44.860 --> 30:51.260
Custom to do system that I built and uh, it syncs through my phone through multiple computers and a pie

30:51.980 --> 30:53.980
on a pie now is there um

30:53.980 --> 30:55.180
Um, yeah

30:55.180 --> 30:57.180
Is there ever any issue of like, uh?

30:57.180 --> 31:02.220
You have the same program running on two computers at once and the and the config files are getting written to by both programs

31:03.580 --> 31:08.140
Uh, no because you can set it to be one as a master. So if there's a conflict it always pulls from the main one

31:09.100 --> 31:09.900
That's it

31:09.900 --> 31:14.220
That's exactly what i've thought about using sync thing because the nice thing about sync thing as opposed to something like dropbox

31:14.380 --> 31:17.020
Is you can have sync thing look at any folder on your file system

31:17.580 --> 31:20.060
So multiple sync folders. Yes. Yeah

31:20.060 --> 31:23.340
I and the best part is that you don't have to have like a specific

31:23.900 --> 31:28.460
Um folder for this you can just pick one random. So I don't I don't have a sync thing

31:29.100 --> 31:32.220
Uh infrastructure in this like you just go in and say you can actually

31:32.700 --> 31:36.780
Create like ids for each folder so you can have a different name for the different folder on the thing

31:36.860 --> 31:38.860
As long as the sync idea is the same

31:39.740 --> 31:40.700
That's a good tip

31:40.700 --> 31:44.300
Wimby do you have anything to contribute to the sync conversation before we move on because I always go to you

31:44.380 --> 31:46.380
But I don't know if there's much you have

31:46.380 --> 31:50.140
I haven't used sync thing in ages because I switched to a different solution for what I was using

31:51.100 --> 31:53.740
Any updates or anything you want to share with the class or nothing in particular?

31:54.620 --> 31:59.180
No, not about sync thing. I can't add anything about syncing in general. I can't remember what you switched to

31:59.740 --> 32:04.860
Uh, well my my use case for sync thing and bit torrent sync before it was to sync

32:05.260 --> 32:12.540
Dot files and stuff like that and i'm now using yadim, which is yet another dot manager and uh, that's git based

32:12.620 --> 32:15.980
And that's right brilliant. That's what i've been thinking about using too is something git based

32:15.980 --> 32:22.460
I hadn't had a oh look into that. Thank you. Yeah, it was great. All right, so let's talk about your favorite subject. Um,

32:23.580 --> 32:26.700
I feel like we well, you know, I feel like we can we can talk about it now

32:26.700 --> 32:29.580
We can you want do you want i'll give you a little more time i'm gonna give you a little more time

32:30.060 --> 32:35.260
Let's talk about vr on linux. Oh, yeah, let's do it. Let's do it. Let's do it

32:36.140 --> 32:41.100
I got an htc vive sitting in the other room right now. So I feel like uh, I just got to bring it all out

32:41.100 --> 32:47.500
Uh, so valve starting with this particular story not necessarily directly vr but probably going to play in a little bit valve has hired

32:47.580 --> 32:50.540
Another developer who a well a well-known one too keith packard

32:51.020 --> 32:53.260
He's worked on the x windows system in the past

32:53.260 --> 32:59.100
He worked for intel then he moved to hp and now he's at valve to continue development on the linux driver stack for graphics

32:59.900 --> 33:05.820
So that's a bit of news. Yeah, it's a bit of news right there. So that's something that I thought was worth mentioning also

33:06.140 --> 33:07.100
um

33:07.100 --> 33:12.620
Steam vr has gotten some update builds for steam vr beta now with linux support. Ladies and gentlemen

33:13.500 --> 33:16.940
valve has pushed out linux support for their steam vr

33:17.420 --> 33:21.900
And uh, they've set up a couple of different resources that I want to point you to if you're trying to make this work

33:22.220 --> 33:25.980
Number one is they have a github issues tracker for the valve software account

33:25.980 --> 33:27.980
Which I have linked in the show notes

33:27.980 --> 33:33.580
And there are some community threads in the steam vr group specific to linux. I have those linked as well

33:33.580 --> 33:36.700
If you're on arch, I also have a warning for you

33:37.420 --> 33:42.620
It looks like there is currently an issue with the invidia beta driver

33:42.620 --> 33:48.540
Which is required to use steam vr and the module failing to build for the arch kernel 4.10

33:48.940 --> 33:51.420
So if you're on arch and you want to play with steam vr

33:51.420 --> 33:56.380
It looks like you need to use the lts kernel on arch for now because that module will build

33:57.020 --> 33:59.820
That's that seems to be one issue right now because you have to be on a fairly recent

33:59.820 --> 34:05.740
Kernel and you have to be on the beta version of the invidia driver and you have to have something that supports balkan

34:07.020 --> 34:12.380
Balkan so that is uh, that is sort of the state of steam vr right now

34:12.700 --> 34:16.380
And it looks like also there is sort of uh at the same time

34:16.940 --> 34:22.220
A really interesting write-up about somebody who decided to modify a few programs

34:22.860 --> 34:27.020
Chain a few things together and create a vr workspace for linux

34:27.020 --> 34:29.660
And it's kind of fascinating how he did it. He said first

34:29.660 --> 34:32.380
I needed to figure out a way to capture the images running on my desktop

34:32.620 --> 34:36.460
There's a lot of ways to do that. So I ran the xypher display server

34:37.100 --> 34:41.100
Then I had this thing set up to take screenshots which used some python scripts

34:41.260 --> 34:43.740
The screenshots are handled and are base64 encoded

34:43.900 --> 34:48.560
He made those images available for a smartphone with through a data distribution service. He chose crossbar

34:49.420 --> 34:52.960
The crossbar system is a networking platform for real-time applications

34:52.960 --> 34:58.320
It has a static web server built in which can be used to distribute javascript to a smartphone

35:00.000 --> 35:03.120
So then his smartphone client then connects to crossbar or whatever

35:03.600 --> 35:07.360
Whatever the in-between thing is could be the linux client could be anything connects to crossbar

35:07.760 --> 35:12.240
It feeds the images from something uh from from the system and it titles them as topics

35:12.560 --> 35:16.800
So then crossbar is configured around the web server and it runs on port 80 80

35:16.800 --> 35:24.160
Then you point your machine at that on the same network you open, you know ip address port 80 80 and it's set up to run

35:24.960 --> 35:26.960
linux desktop applications

35:27.600 --> 35:32.000
In vr now, I just blew through all that because there's no way i'm going to walk you through all of the python code

35:32.000 --> 35:32.960
That he set up and stuff like that

35:32.960 --> 35:36.240
But we do have it linked in the show notes a way to take individual apps

35:36.640 --> 35:41.440
And project them into vr using any kind of anything from the vive to google cardboard

35:41.440 --> 35:48.560
And uh, so he looks at things like stellaris and uh and apps like that to uh as a way to take advantage of this now

35:49.120 --> 35:53.040
having listened to uh, episode one of season 10 of the ubuntu podcast

35:53.760 --> 35:59.040
I heard wimpy talk about his uh experience with augmented reality and I heard wimpy proclaim

36:00.000 --> 36:07.280
That augmented reality was the future and the vr was not going to be the future and I have to I have to strongly

36:07.280 --> 36:14.000
strongly disagree because a I will present that I believe what wimpy was experiencing was in fact virtual reality and not

36:14.000 --> 36:20.080
Augmented reality because there was no jet engine in the room. It created the entire jet engine from a virtual reality

36:20.160 --> 36:26.160
So a I would I would argue wimpy did not in fact experience augmented reality and b

36:26.800 --> 36:30.480
Are two which I forget which mechanism i'm using I would argue that

36:30.480 --> 36:37.120
That ar and vr are not mutually exclusive and that they may be more closer to the same thing than that's not a coke

36:37.120 --> 36:42.000
And pepsi competition is what i'm trying to say now. I look at this. I look at steam vr

36:42.240 --> 36:44.640
I look at the fact that you have even just these

36:45.420 --> 36:46.400
easily

36:46.400 --> 36:54.000
Put together methods to put some sort of rudimentary vr experience together and I say to you with htc vive shipping

36:54.000 --> 37:00.160
With steam vr shipping and with systems like this that even work with simple applications like vr cardboard simple

37:00.800 --> 37:02.800
vr has arrived for linux

37:04.400 --> 37:07.200
With all due respect chris you're wrong. Okay, tell me

37:08.560 --> 37:10.560
That's why we like yeah

37:10.720 --> 37:17.200
Is an ar system because while the jet engine isn't in the room you can see through the glasses and the yeah

37:17.440 --> 37:22.880
um, the user interface is on the wall so you can glance up at the wall and

37:22.880 --> 37:27.600
Navigate through the menus. They're over on the wall over there. So you could leave them on the wall

37:28.000 --> 37:29.280
Oh, I like that

37:29.280 --> 37:31.280
But couldn't they do that in a virtual room just as well

37:31.520 --> 37:36.240
You could but you can't see what's what's around you because with vr, but the jet engine isn't there?

37:37.200 --> 37:39.360
No, but with vr nothing is there with

37:42.400 --> 37:48.160
The table what you made everything around you is there okay what you may not have gleaned from the the demo that I

37:48.480 --> 37:50.480
I got to do was

37:50.480 --> 37:54.000
Uh, the use case is i'm a jet engine repair man

37:54.480 --> 37:56.880
There is a jet engine in the room

37:57.680 --> 38:04.720
And I want to bring up this vr overlay sure and the service manuals in front of me

38:05.360 --> 38:06.800
as part of

38:06.800 --> 38:12.820
the additional context to what i'm doing and the idea here is that as a maintenance

38:13.420 --> 38:17.840
engineer you have access to stuff in front of you immediately and

38:17.840 --> 38:24.320
And you can reference that and the hope is that there will be fewer human errors when you're doing these sort of maintenance

38:24.380 --> 38:29.440
Operations because all of the information you need is available to you and you can check out

38:30.560 --> 38:35.360
Uh where the parts are on the virtual model before you actually go and start, you know

38:35.660 --> 38:40.800
Spanning the real engine. I like that. I would I would say two things. Number one. I would say, uh,

38:40.800 --> 38:47.920
Uh, I feel like you could still do all of that in vr. You would have a headset on you wouldn't see through it

38:48.000 --> 38:51.680
But there would be sensors that would be aware of the physical shape of the object

38:51.840 --> 38:56.560
And they would that physical shape would be represented in the virtual reality that would be proportional to the actual object

38:56.640 --> 39:02.160
But that said i'm really just playing devil's advocate because to me ar does seem to make way more sense

39:02.220 --> 39:07.040
Especially in the industrial applications where you have a known setup

39:07.040 --> 39:10.720
It's maybe a factory or it's a jet engine or whatever

39:10.720 --> 39:15.360
It's it's a reactor even and but it is it is always in this spot in the room

39:15.680 --> 39:20.020
It is always this dimension. It always has these components. It always has these attributes

39:20.640 --> 39:24.500
And and that to me seems like a much more achievable

39:26.560 --> 39:30.000
Practical a practical application of this technology simply because

39:30.640 --> 39:35.600
Those variables are locked down and they're known quantities when you have people's homes

39:35.600 --> 39:42.080
where you'll never know the layout and the lighting is always going to be different and the colors are always going to be different and

39:42.160 --> 39:48.800
The and all of these all of these random variables. I think that's where ar begins to break down and vr will be stronger

39:50.240 --> 39:55.600
Can I just find an analogy that I often like to go to right and that is with networking

39:55.680 --> 39:56.320
Okay

39:56.320 --> 39:58.640
It took quite a few years for us to get

39:59.040 --> 40:03.760
wired networking perfect with the tcp ip stack and all that kind of stuff and we got to gigabit and

40:03.760 --> 40:06.560
And all that kind of stuff and now that's working perfectly

40:07.280 --> 40:09.280
and beyond and then

40:09.360 --> 40:17.120
In parallel we were also working on wireless and we got to um, you know g and n and then ac and beyond

40:17.520 --> 40:19.360
and it feels like

40:19.360 --> 40:22.640
ar is wireless wi-fi and

40:23.200 --> 40:27.040
Vr is wired and they're kind of two ways to look at the same. That's how I see it

40:27.120 --> 40:32.160
That's a that's a great analogy. I really do see it as two almost complementary technologies in some sense

40:32.160 --> 40:34.160
They are complementary, but they're not the same

40:34.320 --> 40:40.320
Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, but the wireless isn't the same as wired, but they they're still complementary and you you kind of

40:40.880 --> 40:46.080
Need to to build that base of virtual reality first I feel and perfect that

40:46.480 --> 40:52.320
And then once you have that then you introduce cameras and blending of that into the rest of reality

40:52.560 --> 40:58.020
And and that's when it's going to be truly useful. Also, don't you think virtual reality seems more applicable to entertainment?

40:58.020 --> 41:04.120
Games movies porn perhaps whereas augmented reality seems more applicable to industrial applications

41:04.340 --> 41:07.780
Or getting getting work done or even here in the studio west wouldn't it be nice to have ar

41:08.100 --> 41:10.820
Overlaid on the equipment when you're setting up for tech snap. Absolutely

41:11.460 --> 41:16.020
I want to jump in here because there's there's a key point that you're missing and and you're right you're talking about

41:16.340 --> 41:23.620
Using it in the home, right? So at the moment if you've got a vive you've got to blindfold yourself and tether yourself to a computer

41:23.620 --> 41:28.740
Yep, and then stand in a room big enough that can accommodate all of the other poles and things

41:30.020 --> 41:32.020
Yeah

41:32.100 --> 41:37.380
Yeah, so you need a very much actually that's that is legitimately a problem. Yeah, so you talk about entertainment

41:37.460 --> 41:41.940
I don't think any of that is particularly entertaining and also it's kind of solitary because

41:42.660 --> 41:49.220
Doing that with two people. Basically, you're just going to chin each other aren't you? I mean you you're going to be walking around blind

41:49.220 --> 41:54.020
Hang on. Hang on wimpy. Hang on yours. You're trying to tell me that people don't want to play games on their own

41:54.340 --> 41:57.140
Connected to a billion other people in the world

41:57.860 --> 42:01.620
Uh now, I know they like to play with the other person in the room

42:02.180 --> 42:05.540
Well, I I mean, let's not let's not forget I two

42:06.100 --> 42:11.780
Really apparently smart individuals would seem to think people are very interested in this and that would be mark zuckerberg and gabien

42:12.100 --> 42:17.140
They both seem to agree that people are going to want to put these full visors on and be completely

42:17.140 --> 42:19.140
Lost in this virtual holodeck

42:19.460 --> 42:24.740
So yeah, it's like you're sitting in front of your workstation your battle station. It's it's very similar. There are a few people

42:24.740 --> 42:27.540
There is there's a niche of people who are going to want to do that

42:27.860 --> 42:31.620
But probably more mainstream is more like the wii where it's kind of more cartooning

42:31.700 --> 42:37.780
You've got these motion controllers and and now with the switch and stuff like that. So it feels like there are two markets there

42:38.740 --> 42:42.340
But the the ar headset I had on a couple of weeks ago

42:42.340 --> 42:46.900
Was was a helmet it you you wore it like um a hard hat. Okay?

42:47.460 --> 42:52.900
Um, there were no cables. There were no wires. The whole thing was self-powered running a boon

42:52.900 --> 42:57.860
And and I wasn't blindfolded. I could see everyone and everything around me

42:58.500 --> 43:00.500
And I was also able to see

43:00.900 --> 43:07.220
The 3d images that this thing was projecting into a space that I could move around it and interact with it

43:07.220 --> 43:12.420
That to me is light years more compelling than being

43:13.380 --> 43:15.380
tethered and blindfolded and

43:16.180 --> 43:22.660
Not being able to see what's going on. And whilst I agree. There's an application for vr for gaming. I I can totally see that

43:23.380 --> 43:29.220
At the moment. I haven't actually seen any compelling game. I'm not a big gamer, but I haven't seen any compelling games

43:29.780 --> 43:33.540
That utilize vr at the moment. We just have a shitload of tech demos

43:33.540 --> 43:39.860
I-racing is amazing. I but I think wimby. I did one compelling. Yeah, I kind of take your point there

43:39.860 --> 43:45.160
I take your point there overall to be that is true. Like I I can't I can't I can't articulate

43:45.700 --> 43:52.100
The absolutely killer app for vr. I I am interested in this why it's just really quickly blasted through it a few minutes ago

43:52.100 --> 43:54.100
I am kind of interested in

43:54.660 --> 43:59.860
In what I could do with vr and and my desktop just for a little bit

43:59.860 --> 44:06.100
Do with vr and and my desktop just from like a maybe a content creation standpoint

44:06.180 --> 44:08.660
But that's so far down the road. It doesn't really seem

44:09.220 --> 44:16.420
And ar may be even better for that. I don't I grant you I can conceptualize the the real good use cases for ar

44:16.820 --> 44:20.420
Uh much easier and that's why i've been more of a kind of more of on that side of the fence

44:20.820 --> 44:25.060
But I i've come to see it more like joe's with joe's analogy is wireless and an ethernet

44:25.060 --> 44:30.660
Uh, I I think vr the time the time I was really blown away by vr

44:31.140 --> 44:35.880
It was sort of a hippie good feeling experience where I I got the oculus dk2

44:36.500 --> 44:41.300
I put it on my head. I put on headphones and there's like tech demos same stuff tech demos

44:41.620 --> 44:46.100
And so what tech demo did I try? Well, I tried they go float on a raft in the middle of the ocean tech demo

44:46.660 --> 44:51.700
and um, I think it's in part because I had had headphones on so it was a more immersive experience, but

44:51.700 --> 44:56.180
I I took that off after five minutes and I felt like I just meditated for 30 minutes

44:56.420 --> 44:59.220
It was a really powerful sort of like holy shit. I really kind of

44:59.940 --> 45:01.940
not all of me, but

45:02.020 --> 45:06.740
50 percent of me maybe even 40 percent of me felt like I was actually on a raft in the middle of the ocean

45:07.220 --> 45:10.820
And that was uh, that was a pretty intense experience. It took you out of where you were

45:10.980 --> 45:15.620
Yeah, because I was actually in this room. Yeah, but it uh, that was a pretty so and then and then I

45:16.260 --> 45:20.020
Then because I was so impacted by it. I then wanted everybody around me to try it

45:20.020 --> 45:23.300
So I then I put the helmet on there. I try this. Oh, you think it's crazy

45:24.500 --> 45:28.980
People were generally pretty impressed. Uh, I saw intense experiences a second

45:29.140 --> 45:33.220
Um, what was it that made vhs successful over beta max?

45:33.540 --> 45:37.460
And what was it that made uh blu-ray successful over hd dvd?

45:37.860 --> 45:40.820
Speaking of intense experiences that you touched on earlier chris

45:41.300 --> 45:46.580
It's it you know, it's it's not a comfortable topic for most people to talk about but it's very

45:46.580 --> 45:50.600
Very possible that porn is going to drive what becomes the next

45:51.160 --> 45:53.160
uh, yeah

45:54.200 --> 45:59.240
In the case of hd dvd and in blu-ray that was sony spending billions of dollars and getting

45:59.720 --> 46:01.880
Uh exclusivity deals with movie companies

46:03.000 --> 46:04.120
That's true, too

46:04.120 --> 46:05.320
That is you know

46:05.320 --> 46:10.200
We will we all we will all just look back at this in five years and laugh at all of our of our floundering

46:10.280 --> 46:12.200
To figure it all out. But yeah

46:12.200 --> 46:17.000
Okay, so I we just got a note from uh, dan for techsnaps. There's a blizzard west. There's a blizzard over there

46:17.000 --> 46:18.920
That's uh, so we're gonna pick the pace up

46:18.920 --> 46:25.000
But I do want to celebrate the 23rd year anniversary or the birthday if you will of linux 1.0

46:25.080 --> 46:29.880
And then we'll follow up on west's challenge over there. So before we jump into the rest of the show, let me thank ting

46:30.360 --> 46:35.080
Thank you ting. There you go. Thanks. They're the best. All right linux.ting.com. Well, we're basically done

46:35.480 --> 46:39.240
What you you didn't know that ting is a is a mobile service provider super simple

46:39.240 --> 46:45.080
Have you been six dollars a month for the line guys and you just pay for what you use? It's amazing

46:45.480 --> 46:48.840
Go to linux.ting.com and check them out. They have such a simple

46:48.920 --> 46:51.800
I really feel like it's almost too good to be true

46:51.880 --> 46:55.480
Like this can't be possible if I hadn't been a customer for like two and a half years now

46:55.560 --> 46:58.360
I'd tell you this can't be true. I didn't believe it. This can't be true, but it's true

46:58.520 --> 47:01.800
It's actually how they're structured. They're so first of all, they're owned by two cows

47:01.800 --> 47:03.000
So this is like they've been around for a while

47:03.000 --> 47:07.480
They know how to do this kind of stuff and they've set up an mvno network where they have cdma and gsm

47:07.480 --> 47:11.560
You get to pick from it, whichever one works better for you. You pay six dollars a month plus your usage

47:11.640 --> 47:17.480
Whatever uncle sam takes that's it for a line. That's it. It's really nice. They got great customer service. Go check them out

47:17.480 --> 47:19.960
They also have a blog right now on the most

47:20.840 --> 47:21.720
well

47:21.720 --> 47:25.960
Capable is probably a generous thing. I was gonna say the best smartphones for under a hundred dollars. I'm gonna say the best

47:26.440 --> 47:31.720
Capable smartphones under a hundred dollars. Yeah, check it out. They have it at their blog. Just do us a favor and start

47:31.720 --> 47:37.080
By going to linux.ting.com and a big thanks to ting for sponsoring the unplugged show

47:38.440 --> 47:39.560
so

47:39.560 --> 47:43.240
These are the final moments of the show west. I know you're doing great. You got a lot going on

47:43.320 --> 47:44.680
So what I want to do

47:44.680 --> 47:47.820
Is i'm going to give you a little time by celebrating the 23rd birthday

47:48.600 --> 47:53.640
That's of linux 1.0. Yeah 1.0 came out on march 14th

47:53.640 --> 48:00.620
1994 and what I decided to do to sort of celebrate this moment. I was trying to think what could we what could we really do?

48:02.140 --> 48:04.140
I wanted to do a little time machine

48:04.460 --> 48:09.580
I wanted to do a little time machine and i'm going to play i'm going to play an interview on this show

48:10.780 --> 48:15.500
I would be willing to bet I I got a guess nobody i'd be willing to bet nobody

48:16.140 --> 48:18.140
Has seen this before it's possible

48:18.140 --> 48:23.820
But i'd be willing to bet you haven't because this was taken from a live recording of cnn

48:24.380 --> 48:26.140
recorded to vhs

48:26.140 --> 48:29.180
And uploaded by a dude to youtube recently

48:30.540 --> 48:34.700
I've never seen it before and I and it's it's great because it's linus around

48:35.880 --> 48:39.180
1997 98 if from what I can kind of grok

48:39.900 --> 48:43.740
And it's it's so awesome because the clip starts out in the typical

48:43.740 --> 48:47.660
Do you worry about bill gates? Does bill gates worry about you?

48:47.980 --> 48:52.140
Is mike, you know this whole threat model and you could tell him the answer bill gates might be worried about linux

48:52.300 --> 48:55.900
But linus ain't worried about microsoft. Do you think that bill gates worries about you?

48:56.940 --> 48:58.380
No

48:58.380 --> 49:04.460
Um, I think he thinks about linux a lot because I just think that he's a person who likes to be in control

49:04.540 --> 49:06.620
I mean microsoft is it's his baby

49:07.420 --> 49:08.380
and

49:08.380 --> 49:10.380
he worries about anything that

49:10.380 --> 49:14.540
Keeps his baby from being number one and linux is one of those things

49:14.940 --> 49:21.580
I don't think he really really worries deep down because he can always look at and look at his pile of cash and then say

49:21.660 --> 49:23.660
Okay, i'm, okay

49:24.460 --> 49:26.460
So do you see that?

49:26.700 --> 49:29.900
Somewhere down the line that linux is going to be bigger than microsoft

49:30.300 --> 49:33.660
I think this microsoft is going to be smaller than microsoft. Oh

49:34.460 --> 49:35.740
that

49:35.740 --> 49:40.220
Microsoft is obviously in an enviable position from a market sense right now

49:40.940 --> 49:46.380
But at the same time this is what what's called despotism to control a resource

49:46.700 --> 49:53.580
And that's what happened in the old west when when people control the resource of water and became very rich in the process

49:53.820 --> 49:56.700
It's a powerful tool for for making money

49:58.300 --> 50:02.300
But it does have one downside and the one downside is that

50:02.300 --> 50:07.180
It never lasts forever and when when it breaks as a tool

50:07.820 --> 50:09.820
Uh, you've lost everything

50:10.780 --> 50:14.060
That field that that was pretty good. That was that was that was late 90s

50:14.060 --> 50:19.900
That was late 90s, uh linux was just a baby back then but starting to get some server traction

50:20.140 --> 50:22.160
So now let's fast forward to 2001

50:23.980 --> 50:25.260
about uh

50:25.260 --> 50:28.300
About four or five six years out from the mobile revolution

50:28.300 --> 50:33.660
Yeah before android before ios and uh linus sits down with uh charlie rose

50:34.140 --> 50:37.580
Or a stupid question to ask will linux supplant windows?

50:39.180 --> 50:44.220
It's a hard question to answer. I don't know if it's a smart question to ask. Why is it hard to answer?

50:44.300 --> 50:46.300
I mean either well, it's

50:47.100 --> 50:53.340
This just be a niche operating system that I I think linux has a very strong future on the desktop actually

50:53.580 --> 50:55.260
It's a desktop

50:55.260 --> 51:01.820
Including the desktop. I mean linux already has like a quarter of the uh web server market or more

51:02.380 --> 51:08.860
So so in certain markets linux is very strong today. The desktop is obviously for a lot of reasons

51:08.940 --> 51:10.940
It's a very interesting market

51:11.100 --> 51:15.900
And it's also very obviously a market that microsoft completely dominates today

51:16.620 --> 51:19.420
And makes a lot of money dominating

51:19.420 --> 51:25.500
Uh, and it's a market that a lot of people have tried to enter I mean apple

51:27.180 --> 51:29.180
IBM tried with os2

51:29.260 --> 51:32.140
Uh a lot of the unix vendors tried and the only reason

51:32.700 --> 51:37.420
Like your average person doesn't even know that they tried is that they failed so horribly

51:38.140 --> 51:41.660
And uh, the reason I I think linux actually has a chance

51:42.620 --> 51:43.580
and

51:43.580 --> 51:50.620
Why I feel in five years the situation will be different is that linux kind of works around the market it

51:51.900 --> 51:53.980
A lot of people are very interested in the desktop

51:54.060 --> 51:59.180
So a lot of people will be working on all the applications going on the desktop making it look nice

51:59.500 --> 52:04.540
And you can really see the the changes that have been going on in the last few years now

52:04.540 --> 52:06.540
He was close, you know, he says you know

52:06.540 --> 52:09.100
I want linux to take off on the desktop in the next few years

52:09.100 --> 52:14.460
But there was something he said in there that was very accurate and that was linux works around the market

52:14.780 --> 52:19.740
And so it's I think that with that sort of mindset that uh when he talks about this next thing

52:20.300 --> 52:22.700
I thought this was fascinating linus says

52:23.740 --> 52:26.380
What would be most disappointing for him about linux in the future?

52:27.420 --> 52:30.460
Would be if it all went exactly how he expected it would go

52:31.420 --> 52:33.420
I don't control the thing. I'm actually the

52:33.420 --> 52:40.860
The single nicest thing about linux as far as i'm concerned has been how it has evolved in ways. I hadn't expected it to

52:41.580 --> 52:44.640
People are doing things with linux that I never envisioned

52:45.580 --> 52:47.580
People are doing things linux that i'm frankly

52:48.060 --> 52:50.060
Not that interested in that's fine

52:50.300 --> 52:55.740
And it's very interesting to see how people use linux even if they use linux in ways that I would never use it

52:55.980 --> 52:58.060
So i'm hoping that I mean in five years

52:58.540 --> 53:00.380
If I were to make a prediction right now

53:00.380 --> 53:05.340
Which i'm not going to if that prediction actually came true i'd be really disappointed part of it

53:05.740 --> 53:10.940
Because there ought to be unexpected. Yeah, a lot of the fun has been that people have done things. I never expected

53:11.500 --> 53:17.180
I wonder if android would fall into that because that was that was about five years out from from android being announced

53:18.300 --> 53:24.220
A world before smartphone. Yeah, isn't that something and so I wonder if android would fall into that category. So here we are

53:24.220 --> 53:30.140
23 years later this day in history march 14 1994 linux 1.0.0 was released

53:30.460 --> 53:37.980
Of course, it was 91 really when version zero zero. What was it zero dot zero zero two, I think was announced by linus

53:37.980 --> 53:43.500
So that's some people celebrate different days, but I think if you go by the 1.0 release that's today pi day

53:44.060 --> 53:49.820
Especially where here, you know, it's starting to become a little more serious and the you know, like the enterprise server thing

53:49.820 --> 53:52.620
Yeah, the linux we know today. Yeah. Yeah

53:52.620 --> 53:55.980
Yeah, uh, I will have some links to some of those videos

53:56.140 --> 53:59.500
Uh, yeah, because I was doing some trolling to find those I had not seen those interviews before

54:00.220 --> 54:02.300
Linus was on charlie rose to promote a book

54:03.420 --> 54:07.260
Yeah, let me see if you know what? Let me see. I don't know if I have the original beginning

54:07.500 --> 54:09.500
But that is actually kind of a fascinating

54:10.140 --> 54:12.860
That's a fascinating aspect of it is I in fact

54:12.860 --> 54:18.620
I think I made i've created like a linus folder now where I just have interviews with linus torvalds

54:18.620 --> 54:24.780
And uh, yeah, here it is. Here's part one where I think he's introduced as as with as amongst other things an author

54:27.900 --> 54:32.700
Oh, we don't need the old charlie rose intro wow, although it's so 90s it's almost perfect it's so

54:34.620 --> 54:37.100
Actually, it's kind of what it is now that's horrible

54:38.540 --> 54:40.540
Charlie rose

54:40.540 --> 54:48.300
Linus torvalds was just a 21 year old student in 1991 when he created linux the groundbreaking operating system for computers

54:48.700 --> 54:56.220
After developing the system, he posted it on the internet for free inviting users to download share and modify

54:56.620 --> 55:01.500
Its popularity has skyrocketed over the last few years. There are currently more than 12 million

55:02.940 --> 55:10.000
In addition tech stalwarts including sun microsystems oracle and ibm have begun incorporating it into their operations

55:10.000 --> 55:14.160
Today torvalds is hailed as a hero by the open source community

55:14.480 --> 55:19.220
His new book is quote just for fun the story of an accidental revolutionary

55:19.920 --> 55:22.400
There you go. I have that book just for fun. Yep

55:23.120 --> 55:24.640
19 uh

55:24.640 --> 55:25.840
Was it uh?

55:25.840 --> 55:27.840
Or 2001 when that book came out 2001

55:28.800 --> 55:32.640
Wow, it's so weird to look back. It's so weird to look back at a different time. Mm-hmm

55:33.360 --> 55:36.960
How long how young linus looked so how young so how young?

55:36.960 --> 55:41.200
All right. So I thought that was fun and happy birthday to version 1o of the linux kernel

55:41.440 --> 55:44.720
And thank you to linus for continuing to work on it for so long. It's a fascinating interview

55:44.720 --> 55:50.160
I will try to get links to the entire ones in the show notes west before we check in on the

55:51.020 --> 55:53.020
mycroft echo challenge

55:53.760 --> 55:56.400
Let's thank digital ocean if you want to run your own infrastructure

55:56.400 --> 56:00.080
Maybe you want to run jarvis or maybe you just want to run your own webmail client or heck

56:00.080 --> 56:07.200
Just a sync thing instance digital ocean could have you coverage the simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way

56:08.000 --> 56:12.400
To spin up a super fast linux rig on their super nice infrastructure all ssd storage

56:12.800 --> 56:18.000
40 gigabit e connections into them hypervisors, of course the hypervisors run linux running kvm

56:18.480 --> 56:21.760
They got data centers all over the world and they have the world's best interface

56:22.400 --> 56:25.520
Other people are like trying to adapt and compete with digital ocean

56:25.520 --> 56:32.720
But I I think they can't actually compete with digital ocean because digital ocean's interface was created by an organism from the future

56:32.800 --> 56:34.960
That doesn't actually take our corporeal form

56:35.600 --> 56:42.080
And what they have done is they've interfaced directly with the digital ocean computers and they have coded right into their editors

56:42.720 --> 56:45.040
This amazing interface. It's the only thing that explains it

56:45.760 --> 56:48.560
And then thanks to a time flux vortex

56:48.880 --> 56:53.120
They're able to pull in this main this code for this amazing api that makes it all simple now

56:53.120 --> 56:55.360
The the I like to mention the interface because it's great

56:55.440 --> 56:57.440
But once you actually start working with digital ocean

56:57.600 --> 57:00.880
You're going to be using the api even if you don't know what an api is

57:00.960 --> 57:04.720
You're going to end up using it because it's so great so straightforward so simple so bootiful

57:05.040 --> 57:11.360
Check them out at digital ocean.com. The pricing is to die for if you want to go hourly check this out

57:11.600 --> 57:19.280
Three cents an hour two gigs of ram two core processor a 40 gigabyte ssd and three terabytes of transfer for three cents an hour

57:19.360 --> 57:20.720
three cents

57:20.720 --> 57:25.440
That's crazy. Like they have one-click deployments of like an entire ubuntu lts rig with docker

57:25.840 --> 57:31.120
You could try out sync thing or set up one of those syncing relay nodes the discovery nodes in seconds

57:32.080 --> 57:33.680
And just try it out at three cents an hour

57:33.680 --> 57:37.520
It's and and if you use our promo code do unplugged you get a ten dollar credit, right?

57:37.600 --> 57:40.080
In the time it takes you to complain there's not enough relay servers

57:40.080 --> 57:45.360
You could have one going on do use our promo code do unplug to support the show get a ten dollar credit

57:45.360 --> 57:48.000
You just go over to digital ocean.com you sign up

57:48.000 --> 57:51.920
Once you've created your account use our promo code do unplug to support the show and keep us going. It's

57:52.640 --> 57:58.560
Very much appreciated digital ocean dot com and thank you digital ocean for sponsoring the unplugged program

57:58.560 --> 58:02.320
And thank you to everybody for using the promo code do unplugged

58:05.280 --> 58:07.280
All right, wes

58:08.080 --> 58:11.680
I noticed you're sitting here at the laptop. You're not at the raspberry pi anymore

58:12.720 --> 58:15.440
I assume you have an ssh connection. Oh, yeah

58:15.440 --> 58:17.280
Oh, yeah

58:17.280 --> 58:22.160
What are we running as our base linux distro? We are running. Uh, it looks like a fork of raspian

58:22.400 --> 58:28.720
Okay, so something debbie-ish debbie-ish debbie-ish. Okay. All right, and we got microsoft running. We got microsoft now

58:29.520 --> 58:30.880
Hold on. Should I?

58:30.880 --> 58:35.520
Are you ready to what with with poppy's voice? No, that's yep. Oh, yeah

58:37.420 --> 58:40.500
Unfortunately right now wait wait, what what it's only outputting

58:41.200 --> 58:43.200
on the 3.5 millimeter

58:43.200 --> 58:47.040
Oh, okay, so we don't have a way to play it. We don't have a way but we could set that up for the future

58:47.040 --> 58:50.640
Yeah, that's pretty darn easy. All right, so it's it's just plugged in a usb

58:50.640 --> 58:55.040
So the process of getting microsoft set up on the raspberry pi stupid simple

58:55.200 --> 58:59.040
They even have it so that it'll start up their own little microsoft ap at first

58:59.120 --> 59:04.240
You connect your phone to it then it does like a chromecast style. Hey, what's your lens wi-fi password?

59:04.640 --> 59:08.720
And then from there just it popped up you did like it gives you a little pair which will speak for you

59:08.800 --> 59:11.600
Or you can see the speech log really pair that on their website

59:11.600 --> 59:16.400
And then it just started working you can ask it stuff. So like to log in over ssh. I was just like hey microsoft

59:16.640 --> 59:18.400
What's your ip address?

59:18.400 --> 59:24.640
Really? Yep, I secretly and that's exactly yep, and then poppy was reading me 192. Really?

59:24.960 --> 59:30.400
Yes. Now, how did it go when you tried to get to the echo software? So here's the thing. Uh-oh

59:30.720 --> 59:36.240
It's it's installing but it is a lot more the microsoft stuff was pretty there's a lot of it is in python

59:36.320 --> 59:38.320
It was pretty lightweight to get going

59:38.320 --> 59:41.520
This just downloaded the oracle 8 jdk. So

59:42.560 --> 59:46.480
It's a little bit different. Uh, there's also like you have to jump through a fair number

59:46.560 --> 59:48.400
I mean I had to go to the microsoft website to be fair

59:48.400 --> 59:51.760
Right and I had to put in a code and stuff and I made an account but the account was very easy

59:52.480 --> 59:57.520
The alexis service you gotta go register as an amazon developer. You gotta check out a number of boxes being like no

59:57.520 --> 59:59.520
I'm not making money. No, this isn't for kids

01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:01.680
Etc, etc. Yeah

01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:03.680
And so I think it's gonna work beautifully

01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:10.800
Whenever the thing I liked about that is if you are if you are in that camp of this is a cia surveillance device

01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:15.680
Put into your home run by a private corporation that has a deal with the cia to run its infrastructure

01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:20.960
You're a maniac for using an echo like if that's the camp you kind of find yourself in which I can understand

01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:23.200
uh, I think

01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:24.960
This shows you

01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:30.640
What a tech tech hack this product really is in some sense like once you go through this process you realize

01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:34.160
The limitations very quickly of the software. Oh, yeah, that's a good point

01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:37.680
So it's a good way like if you're concerned about the security of the echo it

01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:43.120
It is a good way to get intimate with what the actual technology stack is that it's using and you realize it's just

01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:48.320
It's really plain jane vanilla stuff running on linux. They I mean they they tie it in with their backend infrastructure

01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:50.640
I know. I mean i'm just to that point, you know

01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:54.400
I just sourced their install script and away it goes and actually that part was actually pretty nice

01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:56.720
Like it has some good like hey, yes, do you agree to this?

01:00:56.720 --> 01:01:02.000
But then it asks hey, do you want to output over hdmi or 3.5 million? So that part I was actually pretty impressed

01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:03.920
Oh, where's the mycroft one?

01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:08.240
Yes, I imagine there's a way to go tweak that obviously, but do you have a speaker hooked up to it right now?

01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:13.120
No, I just have headphones. I know I want to hear poppy speak. I know right? Yeah, I can never get enough of him

01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:16.880
I think it should just work. We just have to move the stuff and we just have to find a way to plug it in

01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:21.760
Yeah, well, I could just actually I would just I would like to get earbuds so that way poppy's in my ears

01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:24.240
You know, I want to just hook them up

01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:26.400
One of those batteries yeah, just like that

01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:32.960
You get a battery pack for the pie and then you can tether it to your phone through your ting connection

01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:37.840
And then you can just be talking with mycroft. There you go all the time. You can also just wiretap poppy's echo

01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:42.320
That would work too. Yeah, that might be easier. Yeah, that's probably already done. Let's be honest

01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:46.720
Uh, actually they got a little credit bit of credit recently for uh trying to fight a court case

01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:50.880
So did you hear about this? Yes, I did. Yeah amazon and then the defendant decided actually

01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:55.280
I think we might talk about that very briefly in today's room. Oh, really, you know what? That's a good tease

01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:56.720
That's a good tease right there. I will leave it there

01:01:56.720 --> 01:02:00.000
In fact, if you're not watching wes on the tech snap program, what's the matter with you?

01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:04.960
Dan and wes are really, you know, it's been what how it's been what episode number you on now?

01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:13.040
Uh eight three ten ten ten ten weeks, although some of those were doubles. Yeah. Yeah, that's true

01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:16.480
But damn guys, wow, you guys are cranking those things out. I like it

01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:20.800
Uh, well, all right, so then we should probably end it there because yeah, dan's in the middle of a blizzard out there

01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:22.240
And he doesn't know how much longer he's gonna have power

01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:26.640
So we on the west coast have it easy. I complain about the rain, but dan's in the middle of a blizzard. Yes, exactly

01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:29.840
Yeah, uh, well, are you gonna poke at it and see if you can get the echo on there?

01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:31.760
We can have some updates. Yeah, maybe we'll do that

01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:34.080
We'll follow up on that and see so happy pie to everybody

01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:37.920
But so it does seem like what we weren't sure before the show started

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
I guess I should make this point clear before we go

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:45.440
What we weren't sure before the show was could you take the same base linux image that you use to set up microsoft?

01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:51.280
Could that also support the the echo software stack or is there going to be version conflicts?

01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:54.240
Would there and it does appear you it seems like it's going to work just fine

01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:59.840
I don't know not quite done setting up but uh fingers crossed. There you go. Tune in and find out next week

01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:05.120
That's the that's the word on that. I guess i'm kind of curious because that could be the ultimate personal assistant

01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:06.640
Yeah, a little bit of this a little bit of that

01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:09.360
I'm also curious to play with it, but i'm not like I haven't been at the

01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:14.800
Level even to buy a dot yet. Right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah now if I have one there. Wow, what's my excuse? Yeah

01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:17.440
Yeah, you know, I got the assistant on the phone. Oh, yeah

01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:20.480
It's really not that different. Yeah. Yeah

01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:24.800
All right. Well that brings us to the end of episode 188. We're going to get out here on the account of snow

01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:28.240
There's so much more show we could do there's so much more show. So check out the show notes

01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:34.000
We got more stuff in there that didn't fit in today's episode. Check out next week's episode of the linux action show

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.480
We're gonna have a really unique take on our visit to scale

01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:40.880
I like it. I also if if it's if i'm somebody who's never been to scale

01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:41.600
I would really like it

01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:44.800
If somebody's gone every year, I would like it. I watched the video already. No did a great job

01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:46.480

Most of the web runs on servers powered by linux it's for people who like to mess with computers

01:04:47.540 --> 01:04:52.660
JBtitles.com that's not us. No. No, certainly not. Wow
