WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.200
You know, some weeks, I mean, most of the time, really,

00:03.200 --> 00:06.080
let's be honest, but some weeks, it really

00:06.080 --> 00:07.800
feels good to be a Linux user.

00:07.800 --> 00:11.600
And on its 30th birthday, it's kind of one of those weeks.

00:11.600 --> 00:15.320
Did you hear about this Razer mouse driver issue?

00:15.320 --> 00:16.840
I did not hear about this.

00:16.840 --> 00:19.100
All right, well, Brent, say that you need local admin

00:19.100 --> 00:21.240
on a Windows box, and you have physical access,

00:21.240 --> 00:24.040
but of course, you weren't given the admin password.

00:24.040 --> 00:26.140
Don't ask why you need this on a Windows box.

00:26.140 --> 00:27.480
Don't ask why it's a Windows box.

00:27.480 --> 00:31.640
But all you have to do, get yourself a Razer mouse,

00:31.640 --> 00:34.040
or even just the dongle.

00:34.040 --> 00:36.680
Windows Update, the second you plug that sucker in,

00:36.680 --> 00:39.600
will hopefully download and execute the Razer installer

00:39.600 --> 00:41.520
to get those drivers going for you.

00:41.520 --> 00:44.800
Sounds great, until you realize that program downloaded

00:44.800 --> 00:47.960
from the internet, yeah, that's run as system, which

00:47.960 --> 00:50.520
is like super root on Windows.

00:50.520 --> 00:52.680
And because it's Windows, well, you

00:52.680 --> 00:54.400
get to choose where you install some stuff,

00:54.400 --> 00:56.240
and that opens up an Explorer window.

00:56.240 --> 00:59.000
If you right-click in there, you can open PowerShell,

00:59.000 --> 01:01.200
which inherits root privileges.

01:01.200 --> 01:09.600
Oh, this is Unplugged 420, a sophisticated episode

01:09.600 --> 01:14.480
that will be making no pot jokes, no references, none

01:14.480 --> 01:14.800
at all.

01:21.840 --> 01:25.120
Hello, and welcome in to your weekly Linux talk show,

01:25.120 --> 01:27.880
a sophisticated program this week that is brought to you

01:27.880 --> 01:30.360
by our friends at a Cloud Guru, the leader in learning

01:30.360 --> 01:32.800
for the Cloud, Linux, and other modern tech skills,

01:32.800 --> 01:34.960
hundreds of courses and thousands of hands-on labs.

01:34.960 --> 01:39.080
Get certified, get hired, get learning at acloudguru.com.

01:39.080 --> 01:40.780
Coming up on the show today, we are

01:40.780 --> 01:43.880
riding high on a community rush in the Mile High City

01:43.880 --> 01:46.680
this week and sharing some of our meetup adventures,

01:46.680 --> 01:48.960
featuring some great emails that have come into the show

01:48.960 --> 01:51.240
recently, and a spot of Linux news for you

01:51.240 --> 01:52.280
all that you can use.

01:52.280 --> 01:54.040
So we'll tell you about that, and we'll

01:54.040 --> 01:55.960
tell you about the time we recorded a Linux

01:55.960 --> 01:57.200
podcast from a golf course.

01:57.200 --> 01:59.320
But we have a special arrangement today.

01:59.320 --> 02:01.520
Wes is back home in the Seattle area.

02:01.520 --> 02:02.360
Hello, Wes.

02:02.360 --> 02:03.480
Hello.

02:03.480 --> 02:06.360
I hate to tell you this, but it's mid-70s and very cool

02:06.360 --> 02:07.120
today.

02:07.120 --> 02:08.720
You do just exactly how to needle me

02:08.720 --> 02:11.000
at the very beginning of the show.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.400
That's well done.

02:12.400 --> 02:13.320
That's well done.

02:13.320 --> 02:15.600
And Brent has joined me in Colorado Springs,

02:15.600 --> 02:17.080
so we're just down a couple hours

02:17.080 --> 02:19.120
from Denver in the lovely Colorado Springs.

02:19.120 --> 02:19.720
Hello, Brent.

02:19.720 --> 02:20.440
Welcome back.

02:20.440 --> 02:21.960
Hello, Chris.

02:21.960 --> 02:23.120
It's nice to have you here.

02:23.120 --> 02:25.240
It's like an ongoing adventure.

02:25.240 --> 02:27.080
And you were there for a lot of what went down.

02:27.080 --> 02:27.840
We had the meetup.

02:27.840 --> 02:29.240
We had our big Denver meetup.

02:29.240 --> 02:30.920
We just had such a great time.

02:30.920 --> 02:32.680
We want to tell you a little bit about that.

02:32.680 --> 02:35.320
We got a couple of quick chats from there.

02:35.320 --> 02:38.480
All kinds of stuff, but you have now moved out.

02:38.480 --> 02:40.680
You're out of the RV now.

02:40.680 --> 02:42.960
You're staying here in Colorado Springs for a while.

02:42.960 --> 02:45.160
Also, the kids flew home.

02:45.160 --> 02:46.200
It's real quiet here.

02:46.200 --> 02:47.680
I don't even see a Levi today.

02:47.680 --> 02:50.320
No, Hadia and Levi, the wife and the dog,

02:50.320 --> 02:53.280
are out with a friend visiting Boulder.

02:53.280 --> 02:55.920
They're going to be back probably some point during the show.

02:55.920 --> 02:59.080
But yeah, I went from this place being packed.

02:59.080 --> 03:01.280
And we were off grid for eight days,

03:01.280 --> 03:04.600
and we had the slides in for eight days.

03:04.600 --> 03:06.800
We had all slides in, so it was really cramped in here.

03:06.800 --> 03:09.480
Now we're down to the KOA in Colorado Springs.

03:09.480 --> 03:11.640
I got full hookups with water.

03:11.640 --> 03:12.920
I got air conditioning.

03:12.920 --> 03:17.000
My slides are out, and I got the entire RV to myself.

03:17.000 --> 03:20.560
It feels luxurious.

03:20.560 --> 03:24.120
And so I'm like, let's get some Linux podcasting done.

03:24.120 --> 03:28.160
And then after this, we are moving on.

03:28.160 --> 03:30.440
But before we leave the Colorado Springs area,

03:30.440 --> 03:32.520
we are going to do a micro meetup.

03:32.520 --> 03:35.040
If you're listening live today, if you're in the Colorado

03:35.040 --> 03:38.520
Springs area Tuesday, August 24, 2021,

03:38.520 --> 03:42.120
join us at 4.30 local time at the view house in Colorado

03:42.120 --> 03:42.640
Springs.

03:42.640 --> 03:44.480
There are several of the view houses.

03:44.480 --> 03:47.440
We're going to the one in Colorado Springs right off 25.

03:47.440 --> 03:48.840
And then we'll have a dinner.

03:48.840 --> 03:51.040
We'll say goodbye to our friends in Colorado Springs,

03:51.040 --> 03:53.360
and then we head off to Tucson.

03:53.360 --> 03:55.320
Tucson, that sounds exciting.

03:55.320 --> 03:56.480
Also going to be hot, I'm sure.

03:56.480 --> 03:58.640
I'm sad to say I'm not going to be joining you.

03:58.640 --> 03:59.640
I know.

03:59.640 --> 04:01.680
I know we're going to have to say our goodbyes at that point.

04:01.680 --> 04:03.120
Who's going to make you brunch?

04:03.120 --> 04:05.280
Maybe you could make me a few brunches,

04:05.280 --> 04:06.480
and I could like seal them up.

04:06.480 --> 04:07.200
Pre-brunches.

04:07.200 --> 04:08.320
Yeah, like heat them up.

04:08.320 --> 04:09.680
You know, you just leave me a little instructions.

04:09.680 --> 04:09.880
All right.

04:09.880 --> 04:11.880
Don't forget them, because they get nasty in that fridge.

04:11.880 --> 04:13.720
That's what Hadia does when she leaves.

04:13.720 --> 04:15.920
She leaves me little sticky notes that tell me,

04:15.920 --> 04:17.040
like, this goes with this.

04:17.040 --> 04:18.760
You combine these things.

04:18.760 --> 04:20.040
She leaves me a little map.

04:20.040 --> 04:22.720
It's like putting Ikea furniture together.

04:22.720 --> 04:24.520
You're totally an adult. Totally.

04:24.520 --> 04:26.520
Yeah, no, totally.

04:26.520 --> 04:28.720
So then after that, yeah, so we're going to Tucson,

04:28.720 --> 04:32.200
because there is a shop down there of room slide system

04:32.200 --> 04:36.560
that Colonel in our mumble room found, and it's experimental.

04:36.560 --> 04:38.720
I can't find anybody that's done it before,

04:38.720 --> 04:41.280
anybody that has a testimony except for the guy that

04:41.280 --> 04:43.120
did it to his own rig.

04:43.120 --> 04:47.840
But it looks solid, but it's a risky move for sure.

04:47.840 --> 04:50.120
So we're going to be working out a recording schedule

04:50.120 --> 04:50.760
for next week.

04:50.760 --> 04:52.240
It's probably not going to be live.

04:52.240 --> 04:54.680
It's probably going to be pre-recorded next week.

04:54.680 --> 04:56.240
But we'll still have a show for you.

04:56.240 --> 04:58.120
But it's just going to be kind of all up in the air.

04:58.120 --> 04:58.480
Well, yeah.

04:58.480 --> 04:59.600
I mean, if we did it live, you'd just

04:59.600 --> 05:01.840
be a nervous wreck fretting about your slides.

05:01.840 --> 05:04.080
We don't want that.

05:04.080 --> 05:05.880
Yeah, and I also think every now and then,

05:05.880 --> 05:07.520
Wes has got to be let out of his house.

05:07.520 --> 05:09.000
He's got to get outside.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.880
You know, you've got to walk your Wes from time to time.

05:10.880 --> 05:11.520
Yeah, that's right.

05:11.520 --> 05:12.320
Really, it's my fault.

05:12.320 --> 05:13.680
I'm going on a camping trip.

05:13.680 --> 05:15.360
Well, and I'm using that opportunity, too,

05:15.360 --> 05:17.240
to get in there and get some slide work done.

05:17.240 --> 05:19.760
So it's a win-win for sure.

05:19.760 --> 05:21.840
Now, let's get into a little community news.

05:21.840 --> 05:24.360
And the story that we've been trying

05:24.360 --> 05:27.120
to figure out when to kind of fit it in that we just haven't

05:27.120 --> 05:30.120
gotten to yet is one that kind of underscores

05:30.120 --> 05:32.360
the entire reason why we like to talk about ButterFS

05:32.360 --> 05:33.440
here on this show.

05:33.440 --> 05:36.720
And obviously, we recognize it's a multi-file system world.

05:36.720 --> 05:38.640
I mean, you're talking to a guy right now that's

05:38.640 --> 05:41.000
got XFS, ButterFS, and ZFS on one system.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.120
It's a multi-file system world out there.

05:43.120 --> 05:45.960
But we've argued for a while now that ButterFS

05:45.960 --> 05:48.680
should be taken seriously in the workstation context,

05:48.680 --> 05:52.000
especially in the single SSD laptop kind of situation

05:52.000 --> 05:53.880
or like your desktop workstation.

05:53.880 --> 05:55.440
There's a lot of features there that

05:55.440 --> 05:57.400
make it a real competitive file system compared

05:57.400 --> 06:00.400
to what commercial desktops offer now on Mac and Windows.

06:00.400 --> 06:03.120
Yeah, we definitely love ButterFS.

06:03.120 --> 06:04.960
But there's an interesting kernel feature

06:04.960 --> 06:07.640
that just landed with Linux 5.12.

06:07.640 --> 06:11.760
And up till recently, ButterFS, well, it was missing out.

06:11.760 --> 06:12.720
My name is Christian.

06:12.720 --> 06:18.320
I'm one of the organizers of the Container Step Room.

06:18.320 --> 06:22.920
I'm also one of the maintainers of the Lexi and Lexi projects

06:22.920 --> 06:25.880
and mostly work on the kernel side of things

06:25.880 --> 06:27.280
on the low-level stuff.

06:27.280 --> 06:28.960
And today, I want to talk about something

06:28.960 --> 06:33.600
that we've been working on for quite a while, namely,

06:33.600 --> 06:35.600
the ID map mounts concept.

06:35.600 --> 06:38.760
ID maps are a fascinating idea.

06:38.760 --> 06:41.240
They allow for different mounts to expose the same file

06:41.240 --> 06:44.120
or directory with different ownership.

06:44.120 --> 06:45.560
It makes it possible to easily share

06:45.560 --> 06:48.920
files between multiple users or multiple machines,

06:48.920 --> 06:51.320
especially in some complex scenarios.

06:51.320 --> 06:52.400
I could imagine why, too.

06:52.400 --> 06:54.560
This is probably pretty critical in a container workload.

06:54.560 --> 06:56.400
Maybe I could even see a use case in this for something

06:56.400 --> 06:57.680
like Flatpak as well.

06:57.680 --> 06:58.600
Oh, yeah, definitely.

06:58.600 --> 07:01.600
I mean, even if you've just got multiple OSes on your machine,

07:01.600 --> 07:04.440
if you've installed, say, Pop OS in one area

07:04.440 --> 07:06.080
and Fedora on another, maybe you've

07:06.080 --> 07:08.640
got multiple users involved and the UIDs and GIDs

07:08.640 --> 07:10.720
don't map up, we've all been there, right?

07:10.720 --> 07:12.100
You mount something, you want to go grab some files

07:12.100 --> 07:14.200
from the other file system, and, oh, I've

07:14.200 --> 07:15.560
kind of elevated to root privileges

07:15.560 --> 07:19.160
because I'm a different user and I don't own these files.

07:19.160 --> 07:21.080
And then when you add in containers,

07:21.080 --> 07:22.840
it just gets way more complicated

07:22.840 --> 07:27.000
because, of course, containers often use username spaces,

07:27.000 --> 07:30.040
which is a way of mapping different UIDs and GIDs

07:30.040 --> 07:31.160
inside that process.

07:31.160 --> 07:33.800
You can have a whole new set of users isolated

07:33.800 --> 07:37.720
in that container that map to real users on the host system.

07:37.720 --> 07:39.440
Maybe you've run into this where you're

07:39.440 --> 07:40.440
doing some stuff in a container.

07:40.440 --> 07:43.280
Maybe you've got it downloading files or doing backups.

07:43.280 --> 07:46.680
And you've also got to deal with these darn permissions.

07:46.680 --> 07:49.200
Now, a lot of people come into contact with this

07:49.200 --> 07:51.560
if they're using some of those great Linux server I.O.

07:51.560 --> 07:54.880
images because they've done some stuff where you can specify

07:54.880 --> 08:00.160
P, UID, PGID stuff to customize what UIDs and GIDs get handled

08:00.160 --> 08:01.560
in the container.

08:01.560 --> 08:03.520
And that works, but it takes a lot of planning.

08:03.520 --> 08:04.640
You've kind of got to orchestrate it.

08:04.640 --> 08:07.040
You've got to have a consistent set of IDs.

08:07.040 --> 08:08.800
And that just doesn't work for everything,

08:08.800 --> 08:12.560
let alone fancier use cases like systemd homed,

08:12.560 --> 08:14.720
which has some ideas about decoupling

08:14.720 --> 08:18.360
these hard-coded UIDs and GIDs from the actual user identity.

08:18.360 --> 08:19.680
We just can't do that today.

08:19.680 --> 08:21.080
Yeah, and so practically speaking,

08:21.080 --> 08:25.280
so you're running a Plex app or MB or something like that,

08:25.280 --> 08:26.960
Jellyfin, in a container.

08:26.960 --> 08:29.800
And you add a bunch of files as one user to your file system,

08:29.800 --> 08:32.400
but that UID doesn't match up with what

08:32.400 --> 08:34.200
the user is inside that container.

08:34.200 --> 08:36.200
And so you just get a permissions error.

08:36.200 --> 08:37.440
Your files don't show up.

08:37.440 --> 08:40.600
I think this is a super common problem for new users that

08:40.600 --> 08:42.640
are hosting their files or people that are trying

08:42.640 --> 08:44.080
to execute applications that have

08:44.080 --> 08:47.840
to interact with the host file system in some crazy scary way.

08:47.840 --> 08:49.160
This is going to be a no-brainer,

08:49.160 --> 08:51.880
but I thought we would let Christian

08:51.880 --> 08:54.080
explain sort of why it matters.

08:54.080 --> 08:56.400
And this is hopefully going to be

08:56.400 --> 08:58.380
pretty useful for the container use case

08:58.380 --> 09:00.480
when you want to share the same root

09:00.480 --> 09:02.400
of S between different containers,

09:02.400 --> 09:06.640
when you want to share with different ID mappings,

09:06.640 --> 09:10.160
when you want to share data between privileged and

09:10.160 --> 09:12.120
unprivileged containers, so containers making

09:12.120 --> 09:14.680
use of username spaces and containers not making

09:14.680 --> 09:16.360
use of username spaces.

09:16.360 --> 09:18.320
Or you want to have something that SystemD

09:18.320 --> 09:21.440
has been working on, portable home directories, where

09:21.440 --> 09:25.040
you can expose the same USB stick with different UID

09:25.040 --> 09:32.680
and GID to multiple owners, basically decoupling the file

09:32.680 --> 09:38.520
ownership, file ownership, making it more flexible.

09:38.520 --> 09:43.120
And you don't need to have a fixed UID or GID

09:43.120 --> 09:47.200
when you log into a system anymore.

09:47.200 --> 09:49.880
While we are on the subject of containers,

09:49.880 --> 09:52.240
Fedora not too long ago made the move

09:52.240 --> 09:55.840
to cgroups version 2, which has been around forever.

09:55.840 --> 10:00.780
And it appears 2110 will also be making that transition.

10:00.780 --> 10:03.920
And they'll be setting cgroups version 2 as enabled by default

10:03.920 --> 10:05.600
in Ubuntu 2110.

10:05.600 --> 10:07.760
It should make a lot of these complicated container

10:07.760 --> 10:10.640
scenarios a lot easier to deal with.

10:10.640 --> 10:15.680
ID map mounts came with support for ext4, XFS, and FAT32

10:15.680 --> 10:19.400
by default. But ButterFS, well, it just wasn't in there

10:19.400 --> 10:22.440
because they've already made the changes to the VFS

10:22.440 --> 10:23.960
layer in the kernel, but you also

10:23.960 --> 10:26.520
needed changes per file system.

10:26.520 --> 10:29.880
So finally, coming soon, full ID map mount

10:29.880 --> 10:32.040
support for ButterFS.

10:32.040 --> 10:33.240
Dun, dun, dun, dun.

10:33.240 --> 10:35.760
Yes, and it looks like in Linux 5.15

10:35.760 --> 10:39.280
is probably when we can expect that, so that's great to see.

10:39.280 --> 10:41.920
Fedora 35 has added a nice feature

10:41.920 --> 10:47.360
that I'm kind of surprised wasn't in there, actually.

10:47.360 --> 10:50.180
In Fedora 35, user services will be restarted

10:50.180 --> 10:51.640
on package upgrades now.

10:51.640 --> 10:54.100
I mean, that's nice because it's going to allow user services

10:54.100 --> 10:56.680
like PipeWire to seamlessly restart when upgrading rather

10:56.680 --> 10:58.520
than needing to reboot the entire box.

10:58.520 --> 11:00.600
And I always wondered why Fedora seemed

11:00.600 --> 11:04.440
like the most insistent distro on rebooting after an update.

11:04.440 --> 11:06.240
I mean, I figured it was good hygiene.

11:06.240 --> 11:07.800
I never even stopped to think about it

11:07.800 --> 11:09.400
was a service level thing.

11:09.400 --> 11:12.080
Now, Fedora currently allows restarting system services

11:12.080 --> 11:15.160
automatically when upgrading the packages for those services,

11:15.160 --> 11:17.520
but that's only at the system level.

11:17.520 --> 11:19.800
There really hasn't been that capability for stuff that

11:19.800 --> 11:22.280
runs at the user level, like Pulse or PipeWire or anything

11:22.280 --> 11:26.520
that's not running in the system instance of systemd.

11:26.520 --> 11:28.440
Why did this support take so long?

11:28.440 --> 11:31.840
Well, Fedora wanted to have it, but the technical details

11:31.840 --> 11:33.640
behind the scenes are not trivial

11:33.640 --> 11:36.160
because when you're running these upgrades as root,

11:36.160 --> 11:38.280
you've got to reach from that privileged context

11:38.280 --> 11:41.480
way down into the unprivileged user-managed instances

11:41.480 --> 11:42.840
of systemd.

11:42.840 --> 11:45.640
That finally got added upstream in systemd,

11:45.640 --> 11:48.080
so Fedora can do this in a non-hacky manner.

11:48.080 --> 11:49.640
That's kind of the key thing when

11:49.640 --> 11:53.200
I think about what I like when I use Fedora.

11:53.200 --> 11:55.680
And when people ask me about Fedora,

11:55.680 --> 11:57.640
I have a hard time putting my finger on it.

11:57.640 --> 12:00.600
I can say, oh, they have leading edge packages,

12:00.600 --> 12:02.360
but it's actually this stuff.

12:02.360 --> 12:04.120
When they want to do something like this,

12:04.120 --> 12:07.000
they build it in at the system level.

12:07.000 --> 12:10.760
One route would be to just do some sort of hacky post script

12:10.760 --> 12:13.640
that you execute, and maybe you ask a user

12:13.640 --> 12:15.920
to put their pseudo password in or something like that,

12:15.920 --> 12:18.320
and you could get it done with something like that.

12:18.320 --> 12:20.360
But what they've done is they've taken the route

12:20.360 --> 12:22.360
of going all the way upstream, so that it's

12:22.360 --> 12:24.360
baked into the system now.

12:24.360 --> 12:27.280
And that's going to be maintainable.

12:27.280 --> 12:28.520
That's going to be supportable.

12:28.520 --> 12:30.920
It's going to be obvious to other developers.

12:30.920 --> 12:31.560
And you're right.

12:31.560 --> 12:33.960
This is exactly the kind of correctness thing.

12:33.960 --> 12:36.000
DNF might be slower than I'd like sometimes,

12:36.000 --> 12:38.680
but it really makes me happy that I feel confident

12:38.680 --> 12:42.200
I can do an upgrade, maybe even a new release of Fedora type

12:42.200 --> 12:42.960
upgrade.

12:42.960 --> 12:44.880
And all this stuff, it's been thought of,

12:44.880 --> 12:47.280
taken care of very carefully.

12:47.280 --> 12:49.320
This is something that's been really

12:49.320 --> 12:50.960
wanted for a really long time.

12:50.960 --> 12:53.280
Because some years ago, we decided

12:53.280 --> 12:56.440
to start migrating the GNOME user session

12:56.440 --> 12:58.640
from running in its own privileged context

12:58.640 --> 13:01.280
than it would do its own user session management

13:01.280 --> 13:03.160
to using system to user.

13:03.160 --> 13:07.640
This actually also happened with Fedora Linux 34 for KDE Plasma

13:07.640 --> 13:08.600
as well.

13:08.600 --> 13:11.120
And that change means that when you

13:11.120 --> 13:13.840
do upgrades of the desktop environment,

13:13.840 --> 13:18.440
we actually can't do anything to make sure everything,

13:18.440 --> 13:20.680
like services get restarted in an orderly fashion,

13:20.680 --> 13:22.440
especially desktop services.

13:22.440 --> 13:24.600
And even with all these changes that have been now,

13:24.600 --> 13:27.800
like it's still not entirely the best.

13:27.800 --> 13:30.440
Because again, we're reaching down from root

13:30.440 --> 13:32.240
down into individual users.

13:32.240 --> 13:36.120
And while the logic is very good, it is not perfect.

13:36.120 --> 13:40.680
The whole idea of doing offline updates and those kinds of

13:40.680 --> 13:45.480
things is basically to guarantee, as much as we can,

13:45.480 --> 13:49.880
consistency between transition states of software.

13:49.880 --> 13:52.800
Because then we're not running the user services

13:52.800 --> 13:54.880
when we're doing the offline update,

13:54.880 --> 13:57.040
because we only go up to just enough

13:57.040 --> 14:01.160
to start PackageKit and Plymouth to print out the output.

14:01.160 --> 14:03.520
And then when it's done, we start back up again.

14:03.520 --> 14:05.600
And this even includes not bringing up network

14:05.600 --> 14:07.160
during offline upgrades.

14:07.160 --> 14:09.880
So a lot of like sensitive finicky things

14:09.880 --> 14:12.960
that tend to break when you're doing an online upgrade

14:12.960 --> 14:14.320
are just simply aren't running.

14:14.320 --> 14:16.760
And while this does definitely improve

14:16.760 --> 14:18.120
like some of the individual cases,

14:18.120 --> 14:20.840
like if you're just doing a DNF upgrade,

14:20.840 --> 14:22.280
when you're running in your desktop,

14:22.280 --> 14:25.960
a lot of those services will restart correctly.

14:25.960 --> 14:27.600
It's still not perfect.

14:27.600 --> 14:30.960
And we're probably not going to roll back

14:30.960 --> 14:32.640
using offline updates by default,

14:32.640 --> 14:35.200
because we wanna provide a consistent usable experience

14:35.200 --> 14:37.320
rather than kind of crossing our fingers

14:37.320 --> 14:40.320
and hoping that we play whack-a-mole properly.

14:40.320 --> 14:41.720
Right, right.

14:41.720 --> 14:43.720
Yeah, it's nice to see it landing.

14:43.720 --> 14:47.360
And it's a great example of some of the thought and care

14:47.360 --> 14:49.200
and intentionality that goes into Fedora

14:49.200 --> 14:50.520
and how that stuff lands upstream.

14:50.520 --> 14:52.720
And then it's how it is done.

14:52.720 --> 14:55.080
And that's what I like about being a Fedora user.

14:55.080 --> 14:59.520
Lino.com slash unplugged.

14:59.520 --> 15:01.720
Go there to get $100 in credit

15:01.720 --> 15:03.760
for 60 days on your new account.

15:03.760 --> 15:05.320
And you go there to support the show.

15:05.320 --> 15:07.800
Linode is how we host everything these days.

15:07.800 --> 15:10.760
Everything we've built in the last couple of years, Linode.

15:10.760 --> 15:13.000
And this episode right here

15:13.000 --> 15:17.200
marks our one-year anniversary of going independent.

15:17.200 --> 15:19.160
And Linode was one of the very first companies

15:19.160 --> 15:20.560
that jumped in to make it possible.

15:20.560 --> 15:22.800
And they are still here with us one year later,

15:22.800 --> 15:25.360
and they helped make the meetup possible.

15:25.360 --> 15:26.720
This is a special company.

15:26.720 --> 15:28.240
And I've had a chance now to work with them

15:28.240 --> 15:29.480
on a business level.

15:29.480 --> 15:32.600
I've had a chance to meet them individually here in town.

15:32.600 --> 15:34.880
And I had a chance to put on a party with them.

15:34.880 --> 15:36.560
But also they've been there supporting us

15:36.560 --> 15:38.400
as we've grown now over this last year,

15:38.400 --> 15:39.840
now that we're independent.

15:39.840 --> 15:43.520
And a huge part of that is you participating in this

15:43.520 --> 15:45.720
by going to linode.com slash unplugged,

15:45.720 --> 15:48.600
or by linking somebody to that when they need to sign up,

15:48.600 --> 15:50.800
taking advantage of our sponsors' offer

15:50.800 --> 15:52.480
and telling them there's value here

15:52.480 --> 15:54.280
in supporting these guys.

15:54.280 --> 15:56.200
Every step of the way since 2003,

15:56.200 --> 15:58.000
Linode has been dedicated to building

15:58.000 --> 16:00.560
awesome, awesome cloud hosting.

16:00.560 --> 16:02.120
Really, if it runs on Linux,

16:02.120 --> 16:03.520
you can run it on Linode.

16:03.520 --> 16:05.440
Recently, we started experimenting

16:05.440 --> 16:07.400
with just offloading, just build jobs.

16:07.400 --> 16:09.560
When I say build jobs, I don't mean software,

16:09.560 --> 16:11.600
like I'm like building some sort of software project,

16:11.600 --> 16:13.880
although I could see doing that actually.

16:13.880 --> 16:16.680
I mean, our projects, like our production projects.

16:16.680 --> 16:17.840
We will upload as a team,

16:17.840 --> 16:21.840
we'll put all of our clips for the day up on object storage.

16:21.840 --> 16:23.600
So we've done that on this trip,

16:23.600 --> 16:26.680
is use Linode S3 compatible object storage

16:26.680 --> 16:29.600
as a way to stash stuff and exchange files around it.

16:29.600 --> 16:32.400
There was a point in time where we were mixing cameras

16:32.400 --> 16:34.480
and mics with the Linode guys who were down here

16:34.480 --> 16:36.720
capturing some stuff for their YouTube channel.

16:36.720 --> 16:38.920
And it just made sense to just put it all up

16:38.920 --> 16:40.000
on Linode object storage.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.960
And it's a quick, easy way to collaborate.

16:41.960 --> 16:43.520
And they really have made their dashboards

16:43.520 --> 16:44.800
simple and easy to understand.

16:44.800 --> 16:47.720
So if you've been using server stuff like forever,

16:47.720 --> 16:49.600
you're gonna be fine, like you're gonna love it.

16:49.600 --> 16:51.440
But if you're brand new, don't feel intimidated.

16:51.440 --> 16:52.760
It's actually really approachable

16:52.760 --> 16:55.360
and they've got great guides and they have fantastic,

16:55.360 --> 16:58.160
well, really the best customer support in the business

16:58.160 --> 17:00.040
by phone or by ticket.

17:00.040 --> 17:01.320
And long timers like us,

17:01.320 --> 17:03.400
we can tell that the people that build this product,

17:03.400 --> 17:04.480
they're Linux enthusiasts.

17:04.480 --> 17:07.160
You know how you can kind of just like suss that out

17:07.160 --> 17:10.480
by using something, yeah, Linode's one of those things.

17:10.480 --> 17:13.160
And so go see how much you can do with a $5 a month rig

17:13.160 --> 17:15.080
or go see how much you can do with one of their fancy

17:15.080 --> 17:17.720
AMD Epic dedicated CPU systems,

17:17.720 --> 17:19.320
because you're gonna get $100 to kick the tires.

17:19.320 --> 17:20.920
You can really try this thing out.

17:20.920 --> 17:24.480
You can really put it to the test at really no cost to you.

17:24.480 --> 17:26.160
And it's a great way to support the show.

17:26.160 --> 17:28.360
So that's linode.com slash unplugged.

17:28.360 --> 17:30.960
Go there, sign up, get $100 in 60 day credit

17:30.960 --> 17:34.560
and you support the show, linode.com slash unplugged.

17:37.600 --> 17:40.160
Well, we did all get together here in Denver

17:40.160 --> 17:43.000
and it was a great time.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.480
And we wanted to share a little bit of that experience

17:45.480 --> 17:47.960
with you because I don't know,

17:47.960 --> 17:51.200
it felt like after something monumental like that happened,

17:51.200 --> 17:53.640
we needed a way to like convey it to the audience

17:53.640 --> 17:54.600
and share it a little bit.

17:54.600 --> 17:56.640
It was an unbelievable time, I gotta say.

17:56.640 --> 17:58.280
The number of people we met,

17:58.280 --> 18:02.120
the broad range of people that we met,

18:02.120 --> 18:03.760
I guess is one way to put it.

18:03.760 --> 18:04.600
That is true.

18:04.600 --> 18:06.440
Like a lot of characters,

18:06.440 --> 18:07.440
and you know what's funny too, Brent,

18:07.440 --> 18:10.480
is like some people just wanted to only talk about Linux

18:10.480 --> 18:11.320
and other people were like,

18:11.320 --> 18:13.120
I'm not talking about Linux at all while I'm here tonight.

18:13.120 --> 18:14.520
It's true.

18:14.520 --> 18:15.480
It's very true.

18:15.480 --> 18:17.040
You and I were kind of bouncing around

18:17.040 --> 18:20.720
and with the rest of the team, which was super fun,

18:20.720 --> 18:22.600
but yeah, you never really knew what to expect

18:22.600 --> 18:24.840
when you would kind of lock eyes with someone

18:24.840 --> 18:27.040
and be like, hey, we haven't quite met yet.

18:27.040 --> 18:27.880
How are you?

18:27.880 --> 18:28.720
You know, it's funny.

18:28.720 --> 18:31.120
I think there's an element that we all know we're nerds.

18:31.120 --> 18:33.720
Like we're here, we were at that meetup for a reason,

18:33.720 --> 18:35.200
following Linux, open source,

18:35.200 --> 18:37.280
didn't really matter your experience level.

18:37.280 --> 18:39.560
I think just knowing you have that common base

18:39.560 --> 18:42.680
makes the rest of just interacting with people easier.

18:42.680 --> 18:43.560
Yeah, it's totally it.

18:43.560 --> 18:47.200
It's sort of like you have the shows to go to,

18:47.200 --> 18:50.640
you have the hosts you could have a laugh about,

18:50.640 --> 18:52.240
or you have Linux you could talk about.

18:52.240 --> 18:53.280
So there's a lot of,

18:53.280 --> 18:55.800
it's really easy to get a conversation going,

18:55.800 --> 18:57.200
even for people who aren't great

18:57.200 --> 18:59.320
at getting a conversation going.

18:59.320 --> 19:01.560
So before we tell you the story of the meetup,

19:01.560 --> 19:04.000
I want to tell you a story that took place eight days

19:04.000 --> 19:05.800
before the meetup-ish.

19:05.800 --> 19:08.600
And we had left Cheyenne, Wyoming,

19:08.600 --> 19:12.020
but we ended up with like an extra day in our schedule.

19:12.020 --> 19:13.920
And we weren't ready to get down into Denver

19:13.920 --> 19:16.140
because of the noise and the parking situation

19:16.140 --> 19:19.200
and tank capacity, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

19:19.200 --> 19:21.540
And our campground reservations in Cheyenne were over

19:21.540 --> 19:23.160
and we weren't gonna spend any more money

19:23.160 --> 19:25.160
at this campground, we were done.

19:25.160 --> 19:28.000
So we thought, let's be bold, let's set off,

19:28.000 --> 19:31.780
we will find some place along the way to camp

19:31.780 --> 19:34.480
and to record Linux action news.

19:34.480 --> 19:35.600
And so we did just that,

19:35.600 --> 19:37.120
we got about 20 miles down the road

19:37.120 --> 19:38.480
and then we stopped at a rest stop

19:38.480 --> 19:40.200
and Brent and I broke off into the car

19:40.200 --> 19:42.320
and we went and did some reconnaissance searching

19:42.320 --> 19:45.600
at a popular camping area, which was totally packed.

19:45.600 --> 19:47.040
Packed and kind of off road.

19:47.040 --> 19:48.340
Yeah, it was a little rough.

19:48.340 --> 19:49.680
I mean, it was nice.

19:49.680 --> 19:52.160
It was like a choice spot in Nebraska,

19:52.160 --> 19:54.440
but it just wasn't gonna work for us.

19:54.440 --> 19:56.620
And so we were a little concerned

19:56.620 --> 19:57.960
because what you gotta do

19:57.960 --> 20:00.300
is you gotta get a nice mix of solar.

20:00.300 --> 20:02.220
We have to have a decent spot to record,

20:02.220 --> 20:03.280
so it needs to be quiet,

20:03.280 --> 20:05.520
ideally quieter than we're at right now.

20:05.520 --> 20:07.040
And we have to have good cell signal

20:07.040 --> 20:09.140
because we're doing some of this stuff live

20:09.140 --> 20:11.880
and you need enough bandwidth to be able to live stream.

20:11.880 --> 20:14.160
And so it was looking pretty rough.

20:14.160 --> 20:18.240
We weren't finding anything in Western Nebraska

20:18.240 --> 20:20.600
and we just didn't want to admit

20:20.600 --> 20:23.240
that we were getting pretty desperate.

20:23.240 --> 20:24.960
But we're totally desperate now.

20:24.960 --> 20:28.360
We are just kind of driving down the road,

20:28.360 --> 20:30.980
scouting for places to pull off

20:30.980 --> 20:32.800
or anything that's clever.

20:32.800 --> 20:34.760
I'm looking at every dirt patch we can find.

20:34.760 --> 20:36.480
We're gonna go look at the next town.

20:36.480 --> 20:38.900
We're just desperate to find a quiet area

20:38.900 --> 20:40.480
and Brent's a man on a mission.

20:41.520 --> 20:43.400
I'm trying my best to make things better,

20:43.400 --> 20:46.200
but I can't will these spots to just appear.

20:46.200 --> 20:48.400
And he's also a role in the tunes for us.

20:48.400 --> 20:49.960
He's our tune master.

20:56.120 --> 20:57.920
So I'm curious, what was going through your head

20:57.920 --> 20:59.200
as we're not finding anything

20:59.200 --> 21:01.920
and we're driving the empty roads of flat Nebraska?

21:01.920 --> 21:03.320
Did you think we were screwed?

21:03.320 --> 21:05.960
Well, it was gorgeous out there, I gotta say.

21:05.960 --> 21:08.120
I think my job is to try to calm you down

21:08.120 --> 21:09.080
in those situations.

21:09.080 --> 21:11.320
Well, you're managing me?

21:11.320 --> 21:12.840
Amazing.

21:12.840 --> 21:15.320
And so I was secretly thinking,

21:15.320 --> 21:18.760
oh man, this is like how much further are we gonna drive?

21:18.760 --> 21:20.240
This just doesn't make any sense.

21:20.240 --> 21:22.640
Hadid was checking us on the find my friends thing

21:22.640 --> 21:25.040
and she said, she was like, where are you going?

21:25.040 --> 21:26.320
Why are you guys still going?

21:26.320 --> 21:27.520
You're going the wrong direction.

21:27.520 --> 21:28.360
We're just going.

21:28.360 --> 21:29.200
Bye, Hadid.

21:29.200 --> 21:31.800
And I'm like, I know we're gonna find something.

21:31.800 --> 21:33.200
I know we're gonna find something.

21:33.200 --> 21:35.720
And actually, we got lucky.

21:35.720 --> 21:39.440
We found a golf course and it looks like they allow RVs

21:39.440 --> 21:40.880
to park here and camp here.

21:40.880 --> 21:43.440
It's quiet, it's beautiful.

21:43.440 --> 21:45.720
And that's a cell tower right there.

21:45.720 --> 21:49.120
Sure, it's like 200 feet that way.

21:49.120 --> 21:50.640
So hopefully, we're walking in right now,

21:50.640 --> 21:52.800
we're gonna go ask them if they're cool with us parking here.

21:52.800 --> 21:54.320
So Lady Jups wasn't there yet.

21:54.320 --> 21:55.960
So we were in the reconnaissance car,

21:55.960 --> 21:57.360
just trying to figure out if it's okay.

21:57.360 --> 22:01.840
And normally, I don't just go walking into some golf course

22:01.840 --> 22:03.040
that I've never been to and ask them

22:03.040 --> 22:04.240
if I could park my RV there.

22:04.240 --> 22:07.320
But I had Harvest Host in my pocket.

22:07.320 --> 22:09.160
Oh man, this would be a good sponsorship opportunity,

22:09.160 --> 22:10.580
but I just am a big fan.

22:10.580 --> 22:11.580
Hey there.

22:11.580 --> 22:12.580
Hey guys.

22:12.580 --> 22:13.580
I'm a Harvest Host member

22:13.580 --> 22:16.580
and I saw that you guys are part of that program.

22:16.580 --> 22:17.580
Yeah.

22:17.580 --> 22:18.580
I've got a rig.

22:18.580 --> 22:19.580
I wouldn't mind parking here.

22:19.580 --> 22:20.580
I just wanted to check with you first.

22:20.580 --> 22:21.580
Yeah, of course.

22:21.580 --> 22:22.580
See, what the deal is.

22:22.580 --> 22:24.580
So, can I get a name?

22:24.580 --> 22:25.580
Yeah, Chris Fischer.

22:25.580 --> 22:26.580
F-I-S-A-G-R.

22:26.580 --> 22:27.580
That's a good phone number.

22:27.580 --> 22:32.580
I'll give you my wife's, because that's probably the truth.

22:32.580 --> 22:33.580
Which you'd think I'd have memorized.

22:33.580 --> 22:38.580
So with the rig, I'm gonna have to get a name.

22:38.580 --> 22:43.580
I'll give you my wife's, because that's probably the truth.

22:43.580 --> 22:44.580
Which you'd think I'd have memorized.

22:44.580 --> 22:45.580
So with the rig, there's this truck parking.

22:45.580 --> 22:46.580
Yeah, we saw that pulling in.

22:46.580 --> 22:47.580
Yeah, just anywhere in that lot you can park.

22:47.580 --> 22:48.580
Awesome.

22:48.580 --> 22:49.580
Looks like a beautiful place.

22:49.580 --> 22:50.580
Our rig is just a little bit down the road.

22:50.580 --> 22:52.580
We thought we'd just head out and just check it out.

22:52.580 --> 22:53.580
It looks great.

22:53.580 --> 22:54.580
All right, we'll be back in just a little bit.

22:54.580 --> 22:55.580
Thanks guys.

22:55.580 --> 22:56.580
Have fun guys.

22:56.580 --> 23:02.580
Well, I think that's gonna work freaking perfect.

23:02.580 --> 23:04.580
It's just when I thought we were out of luck.

23:04.580 --> 23:05.580
I know.

23:05.580 --> 23:06.580
It was just we were going down the road and I'm like,

23:06.580 --> 23:08.580
you know what, I'm gonna open up the Harvest Host app

23:08.580 --> 23:10.580
and check our location and just see what pops up.

23:10.580 --> 23:13.580
And it was five minutes down the road from where we were

23:13.580 --> 23:16.580
at almost the point of just giving up.

23:16.580 --> 23:17.580
That's perfect.

23:17.580 --> 23:18.580
Yeah, this is gonna work though.

23:18.580 --> 23:19.580
And it's gonna be quiet.

23:19.580 --> 23:20.580
We should be able to record land.

23:20.580 --> 23:21.580
No problem.

23:21.580 --> 23:23.580
Look at us solving problems.

23:23.580 --> 23:27.580
What was that?

23:27.580 --> 23:30.580
Oh, that's just a golf ball hitting juice.

23:30.580 --> 23:32.580
It turned out to be a really nice spot.

23:32.580 --> 23:34.580
It was hot, but that first night,

23:34.580 --> 23:35.580
I mean, how would you describe that first night?

23:35.580 --> 23:38.580
It was like Nebraska was giving us a show.

23:38.580 --> 23:41.580
Yeah, I didn't quite know what to expect from Nebraska,

23:41.580 --> 23:44.580
but we parked and it was a little, you know,

23:44.580 --> 23:46.580
it was early enough that we could just relax

23:46.580 --> 23:49.580
without needing to get to, you know, setting everything up.

23:49.580 --> 23:50.580
And then-

23:50.580 --> 23:51.580
That amazing sunset we had.

23:51.580 --> 23:53.580
We just, yeah, turned into the sunset

23:53.580 --> 23:57.580
and it turned out it was like nothing I've ever seen.

23:57.580 --> 24:00.580
And then it turned into a thunder and lightning storm

24:00.580 --> 24:03.580
that sort of formed a U shape around us

24:03.580 --> 24:07.580
and it was far enough away we couldn't hear the thunder.

24:07.580 --> 24:10.580
So we just saw lightning all night long

24:10.580 --> 24:12.580
in a U shape around us.

24:12.580 --> 24:15.580
And then where the clouds were not,

24:15.580 --> 24:18.580
there was the sky and it was so bright.

24:18.580 --> 24:21.580
You could easily, just easily see the Milky Way.

24:21.580 --> 24:23.580
And we saw several shooting stars.

24:23.580 --> 24:25.580
The moon was out as well.

24:25.580 --> 24:27.580
And I think we even spotted Jupiter.

24:27.580 --> 24:28.580
Yeah, that's right.

24:28.580 --> 24:29.580
Yeah, I forgot about that.

24:29.580 --> 24:31.580
Yeah, that was sort of symbolic in a way.

24:31.580 --> 24:33.580
It was, Jupiter was bright.

24:33.580 --> 24:35.580
It was unbelievably bright in the sky.

24:35.580 --> 24:38.580
It was so bright we brought out the apps to double check

24:38.580 --> 24:40.580
actually what we were seeing.

24:40.580 --> 24:43.580
It was like it was Jupiter was shining down on us.

24:43.580 --> 24:45.580
It was a really, really nice time.

24:45.580 --> 24:46.580
We spent a night there.

24:46.580 --> 24:47.580
We spent a day there working.

24:47.580 --> 24:50.580
Brent and I did, Dia took the kids back to Cheyenne

24:50.580 --> 24:53.580
to entertain them while Brent and I got some work done.

24:53.580 --> 24:56.580
And then it was time to wrap up so we can get into Denver.

24:56.580 --> 24:58.580
I just had to take one more walk

24:58.580 --> 25:00.580
to just soak in this Nebraska view.

25:00.580 --> 25:02.580
You know, online people have been mocking Nebraska

25:02.580 --> 25:05.580
for being flat, but I'd say it's kind of roly-poly

25:05.580 --> 25:06.580
where we're at.

25:06.580 --> 25:07.580
Lots of hills.

25:07.580 --> 25:09.580
It's beautiful.

25:09.580 --> 25:11.580
And in the evenings, it's just incredible.

25:11.580 --> 25:14.580
I mean, the temperatures today were harsh.

25:14.580 --> 25:17.580
I think it may have gotten up to 120 degrees in my front cab

25:17.580 --> 25:20.580
where I was recording Linux Action News today.

25:20.580 --> 25:23.580
But it's so much better now.

25:23.580 --> 25:27.580
And we're packing up to head into Denver.

25:27.580 --> 25:29.580
I could have waited an extra day

25:29.580 --> 25:32.580
here in our golf course.

25:32.580 --> 25:36.580
But we do have to press on.

25:36.580 --> 25:37.580
We have much to do.

25:37.580 --> 25:40.580
Denver is going to be very busy.

25:40.580 --> 25:43.580
And Brent has a lady he'd like to see.

25:43.580 --> 25:46.580
And I think it's been hard waiting here in Nebraska.

25:46.580 --> 25:47.580
And he's ready to get in there.

25:47.580 --> 25:49.580
So we're going to pull together and do an evening drive

25:49.580 --> 25:50.580
as a crew.

25:50.580 --> 25:52.580
It'll probably be dark by the time we get to Denver.

25:52.580 --> 25:54.580
But it might mean the roads are clear.

25:56.580 --> 25:57.580
Oh, man.

25:57.580 --> 26:00.580
They were clear, but those were some rough roads.

26:00.580 --> 26:01.580
Yeah.

26:01.580 --> 26:05.580
We had nice sailing for the first maybe quarter of the drive.

26:05.580 --> 26:09.580
And then it just got worse and worse and worse.

26:09.580 --> 26:10.580
Yeah.

26:10.580 --> 26:12.580
It got really, really, really, really bad.

26:12.580 --> 26:16.580
I think we took some damage to our slide that's already damaged.

26:16.580 --> 26:18.580
Now, what was it about the roads, Chris?

26:18.580 --> 26:19.580
It's the cement.

26:19.580 --> 26:22.580
And it's the way the cement sort of settles down.

26:22.580 --> 26:24.580
And then the snow plows come.

26:24.580 --> 26:29.580
And because the cement has settled, the plow hits that bit of cement

26:29.580 --> 26:30.580
that's sticking up.

26:30.580 --> 26:36.580
And bam, creates a huge, huge rivet in the road that my tires hit.

26:36.580 --> 26:39.580
Not that I've been listening to the Idaho Road Podcast or anything.

26:39.580 --> 26:40.580
Never.

26:40.580 --> 26:45.580
But we got down there to System 76's office at like 11 o'clock at night,

26:45.580 --> 26:47.580
11, 30, noon.

26:47.580 --> 26:48.580
Brent took off.

26:48.580 --> 26:50.580
And it was just the kids and Hadia and I.

26:50.580 --> 26:51.580
And it was toasty.

26:51.580 --> 26:55.580
But we woke up that morning to hugs from the System 76 crew.

26:55.580 --> 26:56.580
We got the cheese tour.

26:56.580 --> 26:57.580
Then I did COTA radio.

26:57.580 --> 27:00.580
And it was just a blur.

27:00.580 --> 27:03.580
We spent some time at Emma's, which was amazing.

27:03.580 --> 27:06.580
Emma is an incredible hostess.

27:06.580 --> 27:08.580
Really made everybody feel like they were at home.

27:08.580 --> 27:11.580
And her home was everyone's home, which was amazing,

27:11.580 --> 27:14.580
especially when we've been in a small RV for a few weeks.

27:14.580 --> 27:17.580
That was really just great to see her, too.

27:17.580 --> 27:19.580
And the whole System 76 crew.

27:19.580 --> 27:21.580
And it went by.

27:21.580 --> 27:22.580
It felt like two days.

27:22.580 --> 27:24.580
I didn't even spend a single night at the Airbnb.

27:24.580 --> 27:26.580
The rest of the crew did.

27:26.580 --> 27:27.580
I know you had the intention.

27:27.580 --> 27:30.580
But it was just there was so much going on and balancing all the things.

27:30.580 --> 27:32.580
Well, and Wes and I have that feud going.

27:32.580 --> 27:33.580
Yeah.

27:33.580 --> 27:35.580
I mean, it's hard for us to be in the same room for very long

27:35.580 --> 27:37.580
without awkwardness coming up.

27:37.580 --> 27:39.580
You guys got to solve that.

27:39.580 --> 27:40.580
Yeah, I know.

27:40.580 --> 27:41.580
I know.

27:41.580 --> 27:44.580
But in the meantime, I just stayed in the RV.

27:44.580 --> 27:46.580
But Denver's real kind of treat for it.

27:46.580 --> 27:47.580
Well, there was two things, actually.

27:47.580 --> 27:50.580
I think I have to give a special shout out to Listener Mike,

27:50.580 --> 27:54.580
who took as many of the crew up in his Cessna that asked to go.

27:54.580 --> 27:57.580
And we got an aerial tour of Denver from Listener Mike.

27:57.580 --> 27:59.580
And he was so chill about the whole thing.

27:59.580 --> 28:01.580
He just, oh, yeah, next crew.

28:01.580 --> 28:02.580
Bring them up.

28:02.580 --> 28:03.580
There's a storm coming.

28:03.580 --> 28:04.580
No problem.

28:04.580 --> 28:05.580
Let's bring up another crew.

28:05.580 --> 28:06.580
Yeah, yeah.

28:06.580 --> 28:07.580
And I got to go up with Dylan.

28:07.580 --> 28:10.580
He only did two of us at a time, so it took a few times

28:10.580 --> 28:12.580
because a lot of us wanted to go.

28:12.580 --> 28:14.580
And so I got to go up with my boy.

28:14.580 --> 28:17.580
And we just have a great memory of that now.

28:17.580 --> 28:21.580
And then I think the other great memory for my son and my daughters

28:21.580 --> 28:26.580
as well, actually, was Carl, Carl Weschel from System76,

28:26.580 --> 28:28.580
took him for a spin around the block in his Tesla.

28:28.580 --> 28:31.580
And that was Dylan's first Tesla experience.

28:31.580 --> 28:34.580
You know, I still haven't had one, so he's beating me to it.

28:34.580 --> 28:35.580
I got the full demo.

28:35.580 --> 28:37.580
I got the self-driving demo and everything.

28:37.580 --> 28:39.580
I heard there's rainbow road mode.

28:39.580 --> 28:40.580
There is a rainbow road mode.

28:40.580 --> 28:41.580
There's also a whoopee cushion mode.

28:41.580 --> 28:42.580
What?

28:42.580 --> 28:44.580
Dylan wouldn't be interested in that.

28:44.580 --> 28:45.580
No, no, no.

28:45.580 --> 28:46.580
They just found it immediately.

28:46.580 --> 28:48.580
But really, it was about Friday.

28:48.580 --> 28:49.580
That's why we were there, right?

28:49.580 --> 28:50.580
It was Friday after work.

28:50.580 --> 28:52.580
We had a meetup at Pindustry.

28:52.580 --> 28:54.580
And we didn't really know what to expect.

28:54.580 --> 28:57.580
I think there was like 50-ish on the meetup page maybe.

28:57.580 --> 28:59.580
And, you know, with Delta variant and stuff,

28:59.580 --> 29:02.580
I know some people are concerned, and they were worried about that.

29:02.580 --> 29:04.580
And especially in the Denver area,

29:04.580 --> 29:07.580
people are a little more concerned about that right now.

29:07.580 --> 29:10.580
And it wasn't like super well-structured.

29:10.580 --> 29:13.580
It was a little bit like walking in and just

29:13.580 --> 29:15.580
not knowing what you're going to hit.

29:15.580 --> 29:17.580
But what did you walk into, Chris?

29:17.580 --> 29:20.580
Well, like the rock stars that we accidentally were, we showed up late.

29:20.580 --> 29:21.580
We sure did.

29:21.580 --> 29:23.580
To our own party, because we were the ones getting the donuts.

29:23.580 --> 29:25.580
And we had to get 150 Voodoo donuts.

29:25.580 --> 29:27.580
And it takes a while to get 150 donuts.

29:27.580 --> 29:29.580
We just don't know about the traffic.

29:29.580 --> 29:30.580
Oh, my god.

29:30.580 --> 29:32.580
It was so bad.

29:32.580 --> 29:35.580
And, you know, oh, and then there was, of course,

29:35.580 --> 29:37.580
the situation where they couldn't find our order,

29:37.580 --> 29:39.580
even though there was a stack of 150 donuts

29:39.580 --> 29:40.580
right there on the counter.

29:40.580 --> 29:42.580
How many giant orders do you have today?

29:42.580 --> 29:43.580
I mean, come on.

29:43.580 --> 29:45.580
Right?

29:45.580 --> 29:46.580
But we got that sorted.

29:46.580 --> 29:50.580
We showed up, and holy crap was it a party.

29:50.580 --> 29:55.580
Linode and our crew that was there got cracking immediately

29:55.580 --> 29:58.580
on getting all the swag set up and getting the pizza deployed.

29:58.580 --> 30:00.580
And Linode picked up drinks.

30:00.580 --> 30:03.580
And so people were getting their orders brought to them

30:03.580 --> 30:05.580
and just like, who do I pay for this?

30:05.580 --> 30:07.580
And we're like, Linode paid.

30:07.580 --> 30:08.580
They were great.

30:08.580 --> 30:10.580
Yeah, and it was just a blast.

30:10.580 --> 30:13.580
I think Emma counted somewhere between 80 and 90 people

30:13.580 --> 30:14.580
that showed up.

30:14.580 --> 30:15.580
That's impressive.

30:15.580 --> 30:17.580
Very, very impressive.

30:17.580 --> 30:19.580
And thankfully, the way the pinstri is laid out,

30:19.580 --> 30:21.580
they have those big garage doors that opened up

30:21.580 --> 30:24.580
into an outside seating area with a DJ.

30:24.580 --> 30:26.580
So we could kind of sprawl.

30:26.580 --> 30:27.580
And that worked out really well.

30:27.580 --> 30:29.580
Yeah, what I loved is that anywhere you looked,

30:29.580 --> 30:33.580
there was a crew of just our kind talking.

30:33.580 --> 30:36.580
So you could just sort of move on to the next conversation

30:36.580 --> 30:37.580
and see what's happening over there.

30:37.580 --> 30:38.580
It was really nice.

30:38.580 --> 30:42.580
My favorite moments, well, there's a couple of them.

30:42.580 --> 30:46.580
My favorite moments are when I meet people,

30:46.580 --> 30:48.580
and then it clicks with them that they should probably

30:48.580 --> 30:50.580
tell me what their online handle is.

30:50.580 --> 30:53.580
And then they tell me their IRC or their Telegram or whatever.

30:53.580 --> 30:55.580
And then it's like, oh, I know you.

30:55.580 --> 30:56.580
Oh, hey.

30:56.580 --> 30:57.580
I got to meet Optimus Gray.

30:57.580 --> 30:58.580
Really?

30:58.580 --> 30:59.580
Yeah, that was great.

30:59.580 --> 31:01.580
And he's like, hi, I'm John.

31:01.580 --> 31:04.580
I'm like, OK.

31:04.580 --> 31:05.580
He's like, oh, Optimus Gray.

31:05.580 --> 31:09.580
I'm like, oh, hey, man.

31:09.580 --> 31:11.580
But my favorite moments on this one,

31:11.580 --> 31:14.580
because it kind of happened a few times,

31:14.580 --> 31:18.580
is I would meet somebody, and they would be very nice.

31:18.580 --> 31:20.580
And we'd have our exchanges.

31:20.580 --> 31:21.580
And I kind of have a series of questions

31:21.580 --> 31:24.580
that I've been asking people so I could kind of collect

31:24.580 --> 31:26.580
some anecdotal data in my head.

31:26.580 --> 31:28.580
And then after that gets all done,

31:28.580 --> 31:30.580
they say, have you seen Wes or have you seen Brent?

31:30.580 --> 31:32.580
And then I'd go over to one of them

31:32.580 --> 31:34.580
and be like, there's somebody over there

31:34.580 --> 31:35.580
who would like to see you.

31:35.580 --> 31:37.580
And it's so neat that people are like, I want to meet Brent.

31:37.580 --> 31:39.580
I want to meet Wes.

31:39.580 --> 31:41.580
And then I would come back like 15 minutes later,

31:41.580 --> 31:42.580
and Wes would still be talking to them.

31:42.580 --> 31:44.580
And I was like, wow, you really stuck there, Wes.

31:44.580 --> 31:47.580
Well, that's the thing is you just get trapped in a great way

31:47.580 --> 31:49.580
in these amazing conversations.

31:49.580 --> 31:53.580
And with 80 or 90 people, there's just too many to meet.

31:53.580 --> 31:55.580
I got to say, though, that really stands out to me

31:55.580 --> 31:57.580
because everyone is really respectful.

31:57.580 --> 31:59.580
People value that you're caught in a conversation

31:59.580 --> 32:01.580
and are really polite about coming up

32:01.580 --> 32:03.580
and also wanting to say hi.

32:03.580 --> 32:05.580
Yeah, indeed.

32:05.580 --> 32:06.580
I guess my favorite moment,

32:06.580 --> 32:08.580
and I think you guys are probably going to agree

32:08.580 --> 32:10.580
because it's really hard to top this,

32:10.580 --> 32:13.580
is Listener Jose came out.

32:13.580 --> 32:16.580
Listener Jose, which we're going to have more on him in the future.

32:16.580 --> 32:18.580
Brent did an interview with him.

32:18.580 --> 32:20.580
He has started a company that focuses

32:20.580 --> 32:23.580
on accessibility development for Linux.

32:23.580 --> 32:26.580
Yeah, his business is Blind Penguin,

32:26.580 --> 32:28.580
which I thought was kind of clever.

32:28.580 --> 32:32.580
And he's working really hard to try to make

32:32.580 --> 32:34.580
his own little dream possible,

32:34.580 --> 32:37.580
which is to improve accessibility on Linux,

32:37.580 --> 32:39.580
which for him is essential.

32:39.580 --> 32:44.580
And he flat out said is kind of in bad shape

32:44.580 --> 32:45.580
and needs a lot of attention.

32:45.580 --> 32:48.580
Yeah, and Jose himself is blind.

32:48.580 --> 32:52.580
And he flew up by himself from Puerto Rico to the meetup.

32:52.580 --> 32:54.580
He came to Denver for the meetup.

32:54.580 --> 32:55.580
I still can't believe that.

32:55.580 --> 32:56.580
That's amazing.

32:56.580 --> 32:57.580
Thank you, Jose.

32:57.580 --> 32:59.580
And so I'm glad we had a chance to chat with him.

32:59.580 --> 33:01.580
But the other thing that happened that was just perfect

33:01.580 --> 33:06.580
is that Linode brought three Raspberry 4 kind of kits

33:06.580 --> 33:09.580
that include everything from the case to the keyboard

33:09.580 --> 33:11.580
to the power, everything, right?

33:11.580 --> 33:13.580
And they had three to give away.

33:13.580 --> 33:17.580
And Jose won the first kit.

33:17.580 --> 33:19.580
And it was kind of a special moment

33:19.580 --> 33:22.580
because I think, Wes, you read it for him, didn't you?

33:22.580 --> 33:24.580
I didn't see it go down.

33:24.580 --> 33:27.580
But I think you were involved with Jose actually finding out

33:27.580 --> 33:29.580
that he was the winner because he couldn't tell

33:29.580 --> 33:30.580
because he couldn't read the ticket.

33:30.580 --> 33:33.580
Yeah, I had the privilege of already being, you know,

33:33.580 --> 33:35.580
chatting with Jose there when the raffle started.

33:35.580 --> 33:38.580
And yeah, it was absolutely my honor.

33:38.580 --> 33:40.580
Sure, I was a little disappointed I didn't win,

33:40.580 --> 33:42.580
but this is almost as good.

33:42.580 --> 33:44.580
How disappointed his cheese was.

33:44.580 --> 33:46.580
He was like one number off.

33:46.580 --> 33:50.580
But yeah, so Wes reads it for Jose.

33:50.580 --> 33:52.580
And yeah, sure enough, Jose won the first kit.

33:52.580 --> 33:53.580
So here he is.

33:53.580 --> 33:55.580
He travels from Puerto Rico.

33:55.580 --> 33:57.580
And he does it blind.

33:57.580 --> 33:59.580
I don't think I could do it myself.

33:59.580 --> 34:01.580
I mean, I would want like somebody to fly with me

34:01.580 --> 34:05.580
just for a companionship and managing that travel.

34:05.580 --> 34:06.580
Then he wins the Raspberry Pi.

34:06.580 --> 34:08.580
But then also what was really special

34:08.580 --> 34:11.580
is Emma hosted an after party for some of us.

34:11.580 --> 34:14.580
And Jose was invited to the after party.

34:14.580 --> 34:17.580
And he just really, he just kind of came to life there.

34:17.580 --> 34:19.580
And he became the life of the party.

34:19.580 --> 34:20.580
He was hilarious.

34:20.580 --> 34:24.580
He was making jokes in four different languages.

34:24.580 --> 34:26.580
I don't know if it was four, but it felt like four.

34:26.580 --> 34:27.580
And he was switching between them

34:27.580 --> 34:29.580
like a polished comedian.

34:29.580 --> 34:31.580
Such a wonderful guy.

34:31.580 --> 34:34.580
If everybody gets to meet him, I hope

34:34.580 --> 34:35.580
that you take the time to do so.

34:35.580 --> 34:36.580
He's just wonderful.

34:36.580 --> 34:38.580
And then did you guys make sure he got home?

34:38.580 --> 34:39.580
Is that how that went down?

34:39.580 --> 34:41.580
Well, Heather and I and Wes, we were all

34:41.580 --> 34:42.580
getting in the car together.

34:42.580 --> 34:44.580
And Jose got there with us.

34:44.580 --> 34:46.580
And we thought it only responsible to get him

34:46.580 --> 34:48.580
back to where he was going.

34:48.580 --> 34:51.580
And so we drove him back all the way downtown to his hotel

34:51.580 --> 34:54.580
and had some amazing conversations.

34:54.580 --> 34:56.580
I kind of, it was late night.

34:56.580 --> 34:57.580
But I didn't want that ride to end.

34:57.580 --> 34:58.580
Amen.

34:58.580 --> 35:01.580
So the meetup itself was fantastic.

35:01.580 --> 35:03.580
And we wanted to share a couple of conversations,

35:03.580 --> 35:04.580
just a couple.

35:04.580 --> 35:05.580
But there will be more in the future.

35:05.580 --> 35:07.580
We're going to have some content from the road.

35:07.580 --> 35:09.580
That'll be exclusive stuff we have soon.

35:09.580 --> 35:12.580
But in the meantime, I wanted to share two chats.

35:12.580 --> 35:16.580
The first is with Canonical's community manager.

35:16.580 --> 35:18.580
And Brent, you had a chance to pull her aside

35:18.580 --> 35:21.580
and chat with her about creating friendships for life.

35:21.580 --> 35:23.580
Yeah, this is Monica Madden.

35:23.580 --> 35:27.580
And she, well, I met her in our JB Telegram chat.

35:27.580 --> 35:29.580
And she's been in there for a long time.

35:29.580 --> 35:32.580
I know she's a massive foodie and a big, huge friend

35:32.580 --> 35:33.580
of many of ours.

35:33.580 --> 35:38.580
And I got to sort of meet her and have a conversation.

35:38.580 --> 35:41.580
We met at System 76 and shared like some glances.

35:41.580 --> 35:45.580
And then at the meetup, she was like, oh, your Brent.

35:45.580 --> 35:47.580
Giant hugs and everything, which was really great.

35:47.580 --> 35:50.580
But she was kind enough to get on the microphone with me.

35:50.580 --> 35:52.580
Well, hi, Monica.

35:52.580 --> 35:55.580
Here we are at the Jupiter Broadcasting meetup in Denver.

35:55.580 --> 35:59.580
And I know you've come quite a ways to be here.

35:59.580 --> 36:02.580
Tell me, well, first introduce yourself

36:02.580 --> 36:04.580
and tell us where you're from.

36:04.580 --> 36:07.580
I'm Monica Madden.

36:07.580 --> 36:10.580
In my day job, I'm the Ubuntu community representative

36:10.580 --> 36:12.580
at Canonical.

36:12.580 --> 36:17.580
And in everyday life, just a Linux fan,

36:17.580 --> 36:20.580
thanks to my husband, who is here with me,

36:20.580 --> 36:24.580
but is pool sharking the Linode guys as we speak.

36:24.580 --> 36:27.580
We came from Atlanta.

36:27.580 --> 36:29.580
We flew out to Kansas City, though,

36:29.580 --> 36:31.580
where we met up with Tyler Brown.

36:31.580 --> 36:35.580
And we had a rather epic road trip yesterday.

36:35.580 --> 36:38.580
Took us about eight hours to get here.

36:38.580 --> 36:42.580
But it's been an incredible day.

36:42.580 --> 36:46.580
And I got to meet one of my new coworkers at Canonical,

36:46.580 --> 36:50.580
who lives in the springs, and she drove up.

36:50.580 --> 36:55.580
So this has been my first Linux meetup in person.

36:55.580 --> 37:00.580
And the energy and the excitement

37:00.580 --> 37:03.580
and just the genuine friendship and care,

37:03.580 --> 37:08.580
I see why people miss these things so much and do them.

37:08.580 --> 37:13.580
Yeah, there's this real passion and care

37:13.580 --> 37:15.580
that you get out of everybody here.

37:15.580 --> 37:17.580
Everyone has this project they're passionate about

37:17.580 --> 37:19.580
or this community they're passionate about

37:19.580 --> 37:21.580
or some people they're passionate about meeting,

37:21.580 --> 37:24.580
which I find super contagious.

37:24.580 --> 37:27.580
And I have to say, I find your energy super contagious

37:27.580 --> 37:28.580
in terms of community stuff.

37:28.580 --> 37:30.580
So thank you for doing all of that.

37:30.580 --> 37:31.580
You're welcome.

37:31.580 --> 37:34.580
One thing I wanted to ask was,

37:34.580 --> 37:37.580
how is it meeting folks in person versus,

37:37.580 --> 37:40.580
because I know you've built these rich relationships online

37:40.580 --> 37:43.580
through Jupiter Broadcasting's Telegram, for instance.

37:43.580 --> 37:47.580
You've built these rich sort of relationships,

37:47.580 --> 37:51.580
and yet now you're getting to sort of blend those into faces.

37:51.580 --> 37:52.580
How's that?

37:52.580 --> 37:56.580
Well, I think a lot of the interactions we've had today

37:56.580 --> 38:01.580
have just shown that those relationships

38:01.580 --> 38:04.580
aren't just superficial and aren't just online.

38:04.580 --> 38:09.580
Today, she's invited us to System76 for a tour.

38:09.580 --> 38:12.580
And we walk in the building and everyone's like,

38:12.580 --> 38:16.580
okay, hi, and we're like, hey, we're here for cheese.

38:16.580 --> 38:20.580
And he came out and we just hugged like we had known each other

38:20.580 --> 38:25.580
in person for years instead of online for years.

38:25.580 --> 38:28.580
And when we were doing the tour,

38:28.580 --> 38:31.580
we went to the little beer garden area

38:31.580 --> 38:33.580
and there all of you were.

38:33.580 --> 38:36.580
And as soon as we heard your voices, it's like,

38:36.580 --> 38:40.580
and it's funny because I think I asked you all to talk

38:40.580 --> 38:43.580
so I could identify you by your voices.

38:43.580 --> 38:45.580
Like, I could tell Chris,

38:45.580 --> 38:47.580
you're exactly like I thought you would be.

38:47.580 --> 38:50.580
And I'm like, you know what, you and cheese are, and you,

38:50.580 --> 38:53.580
you're exactly what I thought you would be,

38:53.580 --> 38:55.580
unless you're living some duplicitous life

38:55.580 --> 38:57.580
and you're hiding it really well.

38:57.580 --> 38:59.580
Well, that's so wonderful to hear.

38:59.580 --> 39:02.580
And thank you so much for making the trek out here.

39:02.580 --> 39:04.580
It's been a real pleasure meeting you in person.

39:04.580 --> 39:06.580
And I'm sure all of these relationships

39:06.580 --> 39:08.580
will just continue and get richer.

39:08.580 --> 39:10.580
So thanks for being a part of all this.

39:10.580 --> 39:11.580
All right.

39:11.580 --> 39:12.580
Well, thank you.

39:12.580 --> 39:14.580
And thank you for putting this all together.

39:14.580 --> 39:15.580
It's wonderful.

39:15.580 --> 39:17.580
We're not even really done yet.

39:17.580 --> 39:20.580
We still have another micro meetup to do here in Colorado Springs.

39:20.580 --> 39:22.580
I'm curious how you bumped into Derek

39:22.580 --> 39:25.580
and discovered the little device you brought with him.

39:25.580 --> 39:28.580
Well, you know, I hadn't discovered that little device yet,

39:28.580 --> 39:29.580
but when I walked in,

39:29.580 --> 39:31.580
he was the guy with the biggest smile in the room.

39:31.580 --> 39:33.580
And so for me, that's like,

39:33.580 --> 39:36.580
oh, this person's got to be pretty interesting.

39:36.580 --> 39:39.580
So I walked up to him and had a great little conversation.

39:39.580 --> 39:41.580
I was like, wait, wait, wait, stop.

39:41.580 --> 39:43.580
We got to get this on the microphone.

39:43.580 --> 39:45.580
And it just so happened you were there too.

39:45.580 --> 39:47.580
So we are here at the meetup.

39:47.580 --> 39:49.580
Tell me your name and where you're from.

39:49.580 --> 39:50.580
I'm Derek Parks.

39:50.580 --> 39:52.580
I'm from Denver, Colorado.

39:52.580 --> 39:53.580
Great.

39:53.580 --> 39:56.580
And then I see you have this wonderful gadget in your hands

39:56.580 --> 39:58.580
that you're super excited to tell us about.

39:58.580 --> 39:59.580
Go ahead.

39:59.580 --> 40:00.580
Tell us all about it.

40:00.580 --> 40:03.580
So as part of the pandemic, you know, stuck at home,

40:03.580 --> 40:06.580
I've been working on my current sensor.

40:06.580 --> 40:12.580
So it's an ESP-01 and it runs ESP Home.

40:12.580 --> 40:15.580
It's got completely assembled boards.

40:15.580 --> 40:19.580
I have no affiliation with these fabs out of China,

40:19.580 --> 40:21.580
but it is amazing what they will make

40:21.580 --> 40:24.580
and send to your house in three weeks now.

40:24.580 --> 40:25.580
So I won't say their name,

40:25.580 --> 40:28.580
but I will post all of this at some point.

40:28.580 --> 40:30.580
And it's pretty crazy.

40:30.580 --> 40:33.580
So it has a clamp current sensor.

40:33.580 --> 40:35.580
I put it on the hot tub.

40:35.580 --> 40:38.580
I put it on the dryer and on my desktop.

40:38.580 --> 40:43.580
It all comes into Home Assistant and MQTT, all of that.

40:43.580 --> 40:45.580
So then you can like show the wife how much power

40:45.580 --> 40:47.580
that the hot tub is using.

40:47.580 --> 40:50.580
And she says it's worth it.

40:50.580 --> 40:52.580
So, Chris, I see you getting very excited about this.

40:52.580 --> 40:54.580
Tell me what's going through your head.

40:54.580 --> 40:55.580
I mean, what's going through my head

40:55.580 --> 40:56.580
is monitoring my solar generation

40:56.580 --> 40:58.580
using a clamp system like this.

40:58.580 --> 41:00.580
This is something Alex and I have been talking about for weeks.

41:00.580 --> 41:02.580
And I've been missing the piece of like

41:02.580 --> 41:05.580
what piece of technology to use to actually monitor it.

41:05.580 --> 41:07.580
I knew it would be a clamp of some form.

41:07.580 --> 41:09.580
And how long did it take you to kind of dream this up

41:09.580 --> 41:11.580
and make it all happen?

41:11.580 --> 41:14.580
So it's been, it was probably only actually a couple weeks,

41:14.580 --> 41:16.580
maybe a month of dev.

41:16.580 --> 41:19.580
I wrote a ton of software on my own,

41:19.580 --> 41:22.580
and then I was like, oh, ESPM does it way better

41:22.580 --> 41:25.580
than I ever did and everything.

41:25.580 --> 41:29.580
So that's kind of like the whole route or whatever.

41:29.580 --> 41:31.580
But yeah, I need to post it all

41:31.580 --> 41:34.580
and make it so that other people can use it.

41:34.580 --> 41:36.580
I told my wife, I was like, you need to sell these things.

41:36.580 --> 41:41.580
And I was like, I'll make tens of dollars.

41:41.580 --> 41:44.580
This must be a scratching your own itch kind of project.

41:44.580 --> 41:47.580
So what solution did you solve?

41:47.580 --> 41:49.580
So this was more just like trying to figure out,

41:49.580 --> 41:51.580
I have solar at home too,

41:51.580 --> 41:54.580
and trying to figure out where the power is going.

41:54.580 --> 41:58.580
And like, okay, you know, is it the hot tub or is it the AC?

41:58.580 --> 42:00.580
What are we doing?

42:00.580 --> 42:01.580
It's both, yes.

42:01.580 --> 42:04.580
It's all of the above.

42:04.580 --> 42:07.580
So yeah, it's very much scratching your own itch

42:07.580 --> 42:08.580
and also learning.

42:08.580 --> 42:10.580
So just like learning how to use KiCad,

42:10.580 --> 42:12.580
how to, KiCad, I don't know how to say it.

42:12.580 --> 42:13.580
Whatever one.

42:13.580 --> 42:17.580
Just like learning, you know, scratching your own itch

42:17.580 --> 42:20.580
and then learning how to get stuff made.

42:20.580 --> 42:22.580
And it's crazy what they will assemble

42:22.580 --> 42:24.580
and send to your home for you.

42:24.580 --> 42:28.580
And so if you had to sort of describe physically

42:28.580 --> 42:30.580
what we're looking at for the listeners, could you?

42:30.580 --> 42:34.580
Yeah, so it is an ESP-01,

42:34.580 --> 42:39.580
which is like a standard ESP-8266 board

42:39.580 --> 42:41.580
that you can get wherever.

42:41.580 --> 42:44.580
And it has headers coming out of it,

42:44.580 --> 42:47.580
going into a board that I had fabbed in China

42:47.580 --> 42:50.580
that has a USB header on it

42:50.580 --> 42:56.580
and an ADC thing

42:56.580 --> 42:59.580
and a clamp sensor plugged into it.

42:59.580 --> 43:02.580
And so tell me a little bit about what was the motivation

43:02.580 --> 43:05.580
to come here today, to the meetup,

43:05.580 --> 43:07.580
and what you're getting out of it.

43:07.580 --> 43:10.580
So I've been listening to Chris in my ears

43:10.580 --> 43:12.580
while I'm writing code for, I don't know,

43:12.580 --> 43:14.580
10 or 15 years now,

43:14.580 --> 43:18.580
and it was just like so weird and kind of crazy

43:18.580 --> 43:22.580
of like, oh, I've known this person in my ears for 15 years,

43:22.580 --> 43:24.580
and I feel like I know so much about him,

43:24.580 --> 43:26.580
but he's never met me before.

43:26.580 --> 43:27.580
It's kind of a weird feeling,

43:27.580 --> 43:29.580
but it's so nice to actually meet him in person,

43:29.580 --> 43:31.580
and he's such a great guy,

43:31.580 --> 43:34.580
so happy and lively in person.

43:34.580 --> 43:36.580
It is just a really great experience.

43:36.580 --> 43:38.580
Chris, you're blushing over here.

43:38.580 --> 43:42.580
Just saying it in front of my kid is embarrassing.

43:42.580 --> 43:44.580
And so I would imagine you're getting to meet

43:44.580 --> 43:46.580
a bunch of other great people as well.

43:46.580 --> 43:47.580
Is that feeling nice?

43:47.580 --> 43:50.580
Yeah, it's so great to just show up somewhere

43:50.580 --> 43:52.580
and get to meet people.

43:52.580 --> 43:54.580
I walked in a little bit early, and it was like,

43:54.580 --> 43:58.580
oh, okay, that person, I know that's a JB person.

43:58.580 --> 44:01.580
And just go up and you have kind of this shared background

44:01.580 --> 44:02.580
and relationship.

44:02.580 --> 44:04.580
You can just start a conversation with somebody,

44:04.580 --> 44:06.580
and it's really fun.

44:06.580 --> 44:10.580
Yeah, that to me feels like a relief

44:10.580 --> 44:12.580
for the last year or two that we've had.

44:12.580 --> 44:15.580
It's so nice to see people in person

44:15.580 --> 44:19.580
and be able to put faces to the names and voices.

44:19.580 --> 44:22.580
And so thank you so, so much for making your way out here.

44:22.580 --> 44:23.580
We really appreciate it.

44:23.580 --> 44:24.580
Cheers.

44:24.580 --> 44:27.580
It was really amazing to meet you too, Brent,

44:27.580 --> 44:28.580
and so fun.

44:28.580 --> 44:29.580
As we were listening to that,

44:29.580 --> 44:31.580
I was just reliving the whole thing.

44:31.580 --> 44:32.580
It was really nice.

44:32.580 --> 44:34.580
Yeah, you can hear the music going in the background.

44:34.580 --> 44:35.580
The band's there.

44:35.580 --> 44:37.580
There is a bunch of tables

44:37.580 --> 44:39.580
where people are just sitting and chatting, eating pizza

44:39.580 --> 44:41.580
or stuffing their faces with donuts.

44:41.580 --> 44:46.580
And then there was a glass balcony area up above,

44:46.580 --> 44:49.580
a rooftop area,

44:49.580 --> 44:52.580
and you could watch the freaking gorgeous sunset

44:52.580 --> 44:54.580
as it set behind the Rockies.

44:54.580 --> 44:55.580
I mean, it was like,

44:55.580 --> 44:56.580
just a lot of us had to go upstairs

44:56.580 --> 44:57.580
and just watch it for a bit.

44:57.580 --> 44:59.580
Yeah, Colorado certainly has some of those,

44:59.580 --> 45:01.580
and they're breathtaking.

45:01.580 --> 45:04.580
No camera ever makes it the same as just standing there,

45:04.580 --> 45:05.580
taking it in.

45:05.580 --> 45:06.580
Yep, for sure.

45:06.580 --> 45:08.580
And everybody was really great.

45:08.580 --> 45:09.580
Everybody was really nice.

45:09.580 --> 45:11.580
It was a great meetup,

45:11.580 --> 45:13.580
and the journey does continue.

45:15.580 --> 45:18.580
The Colony Tracker will stay up for a bit longer.

45:18.580 --> 45:20.580
In fact, I'm going to make my way down to Tucson,

45:20.580 --> 45:23.580
then back up to Colorado is the plan now for a bit,

45:23.580 --> 45:25.580
and then I'll start making my way home,

45:25.580 --> 45:26.580
and knowing me,

45:26.580 --> 45:28.580
I'll probably end up swinging through Montana

45:28.580 --> 45:29.580
because I just love it there.

45:29.580 --> 45:32.580
So the ColonyTracker.live is where you want to go.

45:32.580 --> 45:33.580
ColonyTracker.live,

45:33.580 --> 45:35.580
that's where you can find the map

45:35.580 --> 45:36.580
and the micro meetup link

45:36.580 --> 45:39.580
if you want to grab lunch, breakfast, or dinner at some point.

45:39.580 --> 45:41.580
I'm not exactly sure what I'll be doing while I'm in Tucson.

45:41.580 --> 45:43.580
I might, I don't know.

45:43.580 --> 45:44.580
I guess I'll have a car.

45:44.580 --> 45:45.580
I'll have a car, so you never know.

45:45.580 --> 45:47.580
I guess we could probably make something work.

45:47.580 --> 45:48.580
If you'd like to email the show,

45:48.580 --> 45:51.580
contact us at linuxunplug.com slash contact,

45:51.580 --> 45:53.580
and the conversation is always rolling

45:53.580 --> 45:56.580
at jupitabroadcasting.com slash Telegram.

45:56.580 --> 45:58.580
That is our Telegram community.

45:58.580 --> 45:59.580
You can go there, join us,

45:59.580 --> 46:00.580
and a lot of our hosts are in there,

46:00.580 --> 46:02.580
popping in all the time,

46:02.580 --> 46:04.580
and then don't forget about the love log.

46:04.580 --> 46:05.580
If you're feeling like you could use

46:05.580 --> 46:07.580
a community connection right now,

46:07.580 --> 46:09.580
this Sunday and every Sunday,

46:09.580 --> 46:11.580
noon Pacific in our Mumble Room.

46:11.580 --> 46:14.580
You can get details at linuxunplug.com slash mumble.

46:14.580 --> 46:15.580
It's the love log,

46:15.580 --> 46:17.580
and it happens every single Sunday,

46:17.580 --> 46:19.580
and it's a great way to connect with people,

46:19.580 --> 46:20.580
and then you never know,

46:20.580 --> 46:22.580
you may actually end up meeting them in person one day

46:22.580 --> 46:23.580
when I finally convince you

46:23.580 --> 46:25.580
to come out to one of these crazy meetups.

46:27.580 --> 46:30.580
Well, it's time for some feedback.

46:30.580 --> 46:34.580
Our friend Squirrely Dave is tiling plasma.

46:34.580 --> 46:35.580
Hey, Chris and Wes.

46:35.580 --> 46:37.580
I know Chris has occasionally mentioned

46:37.580 --> 46:39.580
that he does kind of like KDE Plasma

46:39.580 --> 46:41.580
as a desktop environment,

46:41.580 --> 46:43.580
you know, just from time to time.

46:43.580 --> 46:44.580
Who me?

46:44.580 --> 46:45.580
I'm with you, Chris.

46:45.580 --> 46:47.580
I do, however, wish Plasma

46:47.580 --> 46:50.580
had native tiling functions built in,

46:50.580 --> 46:52.580
just because I prefer using a single,

46:52.580 --> 46:55.580
very large display over multiple smaller ones.

46:55.580 --> 46:57.580
And I know Chris has mentioned something in the past

46:57.580 --> 46:59.580
that, you know, Papa Wes has really introduced

46:59.580 --> 47:02.580
this sort of casual, easy tiling.

47:02.580 --> 47:04.580
I'd like that on Plasma.

47:04.580 --> 47:06.580
Well, in my hunt for a solution,

47:06.580 --> 47:08.580
I came across a KWin script

47:08.580 --> 47:10.580
that allows for basic tiling.

47:10.580 --> 47:12.580
And while it's not as robust or comprehensive

47:12.580 --> 47:14.580
as something like Awesome or i3,

47:14.580 --> 47:16.580
it gets the job done

47:16.580 --> 47:18.580
and doesn't require giving up Plasma

47:18.580 --> 47:20.580
or breaking up all the nifty little things

47:20.580 --> 47:22.580
that work together to make Plasma

47:22.580 --> 47:24.580
such an awesome experience.

47:24.580 --> 47:25.580
I thought I'd share it with you,

47:25.580 --> 47:28.580
just in case you haven't come across it yet.

47:28.580 --> 47:32.580
It's over on GitHub under kwin-scripts at kwin-tiling.

47:32.580 --> 47:34.580
You know, these KWin scripts sometimes

47:34.580 --> 47:36.580
actually make their way into genuine features.

47:36.580 --> 47:38.580
Like we're seeing that happen right now

47:38.580 --> 47:40.580
with any overview functionality.

47:40.580 --> 47:41.580
So you never know.

47:41.580 --> 47:43.580
I actually checked this out back in 2019,

47:43.580 --> 47:45.580
and I didn't end up sticking with it.

47:45.580 --> 47:47.580
And I was looking at the GitHub,

47:47.580 --> 47:49.580
and it looks like the last release

47:49.580 --> 47:51.580
was on July 29, 2020.

47:51.580 --> 47:54.580
There were some commits eight months ago,

47:54.580 --> 47:55.580
but nothing too substantial.

47:55.580 --> 47:57.580
So I'm not sure how active it is anymore.

47:57.580 --> 47:59.580
But here's what I want, Wes.

47:59.580 --> 48:00.580
You ready?

48:00.580 --> 48:02.580
Because like Papa Wes got me so close.

48:02.580 --> 48:04.580
I've now, I have recognized

48:04.580 --> 48:07.580
there is a place in my life

48:07.580 --> 48:10.580
and in my heart for tiling.

48:10.580 --> 48:11.580
And maybe in your studio?

48:11.580 --> 48:12.580
Definitely.

48:12.580 --> 48:14.580
And definitely when I'm on the road too.

48:14.580 --> 48:15.580
I mean, I tell you what,

48:15.580 --> 48:17.580
on every single machine I use,

48:17.580 --> 48:20.580
if this one thing were possible,

48:20.580 --> 48:21.580
I got to have this one thing.

48:21.580 --> 48:22.580
I got to have it.

48:22.580 --> 48:23.580
And it's tiling,

48:23.580 --> 48:26.580
but on a specific virtual desktop.

48:26.580 --> 48:28.580
So desktop two and three have tiling,

48:28.580 --> 48:31.580
but desktop one and four are free floating.

48:31.580 --> 48:32.580
I got to have it that way.

48:32.580 --> 48:35.580
And if I could get tiling

48:35.580 --> 48:37.580
just on desktop like two and three or whatever,

48:37.580 --> 48:38.580
whatever it is,

48:38.580 --> 48:41.580
and have free floating on other windows,

48:41.580 --> 48:44.580
perfection.

48:44.580 --> 48:46.580
And I feel like it's going to happen on Plasma first,

48:46.580 --> 48:48.580
or I just say this over and over again

48:48.580 --> 48:50.580
that maybe the guys over at System76

48:50.580 --> 48:51.580
will just build it into their tiling.

48:51.580 --> 48:52.580
Yeah, you know,

48:52.580 --> 48:54.580
we need like a letter writing campaign or something.

48:54.580 --> 48:58.580
Yeah, like a save Star Trek style letter writing campaign

48:58.580 --> 49:01.580
to get tiling on one specific virtual desktop at a time

49:01.580 --> 49:02.580
or a couple at a time.

49:02.580 --> 49:04.580
I think you know some people there.

49:04.580 --> 49:07.580
Maybe you can like expedite some features.

49:07.580 --> 49:08.580
I'm just sending good vibes to Jeremy.

49:08.580 --> 49:10.580
I'm just sending good vibes.

49:10.580 --> 49:12.580
Look, I'll buy a whole bunch of launches

49:12.580 --> 49:14.580
if I can get this one feature.

49:14.580 --> 49:17.580
Oh, I can almost hear it now.

49:17.580 --> 49:19.580
Mini Mac, I bet you're going to tell me

49:19.580 --> 49:21.580
Enlightenment can do this, aren't you?

49:21.580 --> 49:24.580
As far as I know, Enlightenment can do it.

49:24.580 --> 49:25.580
I never tried it,

49:25.580 --> 49:27.580
but as far as I know, Enlightenment can do it.

49:27.580 --> 49:30.580
You can desktop and manipulate independent.

49:30.580 --> 49:33.580
You can decide which desktop,

49:33.580 --> 49:35.580
and that should work.

49:35.580 --> 49:37.580
And you can do it with the key press.

49:37.580 --> 49:38.580
You can do it.

49:38.580 --> 49:40.580
The answer is always Enlightenment with you.

49:40.580 --> 49:41.580
Yeah.

49:41.580 --> 49:42.580
Just give it a try.

49:42.580 --> 49:43.580
All right.

49:43.580 --> 49:45.580
I really should.

49:45.580 --> 49:48.580
If anybody else knows a way to do it with Plasma,

49:48.580 --> 49:50.580
do let me know.

49:50.580 --> 49:53.580
Otherwise, our next email comes in.

49:53.580 --> 49:55.580
Hey guys, seems the road show is going well.

49:55.580 --> 49:57.580
I'm writing from across the pond.

49:57.580 --> 49:59.580
I think his name was Chris, if I recall.

49:59.580 --> 50:01.580
And I wanted to acquire as to your thoughts

50:01.580 --> 50:04.580
on the topic of careers in Linux and cloud admin.

50:04.580 --> 50:06.580
Have you in the past or will you consider in the future

50:06.580 --> 50:09.580
making this a topic on a JV podcast?

50:09.580 --> 50:13.580
I'm specifically considering a rather late career change

50:13.580 --> 50:15.580
transitioning from mostly network telecom

50:15.580 --> 50:17.580
and project management

50:17.580 --> 50:19.580
over to Linux and cloud service administrations,

50:19.580 --> 50:21.580
aka maybe an SRE.

50:21.580 --> 50:25.580
I have some trepidation at 50 years plus making such a leap,

50:25.580 --> 50:28.580
but I need a change for nothing more than my own sanity.

50:28.580 --> 50:30.580
And I liked this question a lot

50:30.580 --> 50:34.580
because I think this is a really hard thing to do.

50:34.580 --> 50:38.580
I made the transition from my IT career in my 30s,

50:38.580 --> 50:42.580
and I can only imagine how stressful it must be

50:42.580 --> 50:44.580
to try to do it in your 50s.

50:44.580 --> 50:47.580
So I have a lot of respect for our listener attempting to do this.

50:47.580 --> 50:50.580
And Wes, I wanted to kind of bounce it to you

50:50.580 --> 50:53.580
because you, as a bit of a hobby,

50:53.580 --> 50:56.580
just are always kind of monitoring the job postings.

50:56.580 --> 50:59.580
You're always kind of looking at job requirements

50:59.580 --> 51:01.580
as just sort of a point of interest.

51:01.580 --> 51:03.580
And I'm curious what you think about

51:03.580 --> 51:05.580
where somebody might want to focus.

51:05.580 --> 51:07.580
If they've got some project management background,

51:07.580 --> 51:09.580
if they know a little bit of Linux,

51:09.580 --> 51:12.580
but they want to transition more into cloud services

51:12.580 --> 51:14.580
or maybe some sort of Linux job

51:14.580 --> 51:16.580
where they're doing site reliability stuff,

51:16.580 --> 51:18.580
do you have any tips from what you've been seeing

51:18.580 --> 51:20.580
in the postings and whatnots?

51:20.580 --> 51:22.580
You know, it is definitely tough.

51:22.580 --> 51:26.580
There is certainly some ageism in the tech community, right?

51:26.580 --> 51:29.580
If you're not in your 20s and willing to work 70 hours a week,

51:29.580 --> 51:31.580
there's this impression that it can be hard

51:31.580 --> 51:33.580
to get the right job out there.

51:33.580 --> 51:36.580
But I think our listener has a lot of things going for him.

51:36.580 --> 51:38.580
If you've got project management experience,

51:38.580 --> 51:41.580
you've got experience being able to manage yourself,

51:41.580 --> 51:43.580
you know how to run these things,

51:43.580 --> 51:45.580
which means you can get work done, maybe not day one,

51:45.580 --> 51:48.580
an independent operator, that's super useful.

51:48.580 --> 51:50.580
And in the era of the cloud,

51:50.580 --> 51:53.580
those networking skills are pretty much invaluable.

51:53.580 --> 51:55.580
I mean, you're going to be using a VPC.

51:55.580 --> 51:57.580
You're going to have to be dealing with load balancers

51:57.580 --> 52:00.580
and firewalls and IAM permissions.

52:00.580 --> 52:02.580
So, you know, pick some cloud technologies.

52:02.580 --> 52:04.580
Definitely get familiar with stuff like Terraform.

52:04.580 --> 52:06.580
Throw in something like Ansible

52:06.580 --> 52:08.580
if you're curious about configuration management.

52:08.580 --> 52:12.580
And then, yeah, just stress the skills that you do have now.

52:12.580 --> 52:15.580
You can pick up all the little Linux details as you go.

52:15.580 --> 52:16.580
Yeah, I agree.

52:16.580 --> 52:19.580
I think there's a differentiator between somebody,

52:19.580 --> 52:21.580
if you primarily are working with cloud services,

52:21.580 --> 52:23.580
there's differentiator between somebody

52:23.580 --> 52:26.580
who understands and appreciates the Linux fundamentals

52:26.580 --> 52:27.580
and doesn't.

52:27.580 --> 52:29.580
Like, that's one of the things I really like about Wes

52:29.580 --> 52:31.580
is he's very current on what a lot of the cloud platforms

52:31.580 --> 52:33.580
are doing and how to interact with them

52:33.580 --> 52:35.580
and how to build services on top of them.

52:35.580 --> 52:37.580
But Wes also has a deep understanding

52:37.580 --> 52:38.580
of the Linux fundamentals.

52:38.580 --> 52:43.580
And so that kind of makes him a special kind of unicorn

52:43.580 --> 52:45.580
because he's kind of more rounded.

52:45.580 --> 52:48.580
But I think what you have to do is,

52:48.580 --> 52:49.580
and I sent you an email in this regard,

52:49.580 --> 52:52.580
is I think you need to focus on some certain areas in training

52:52.580 --> 52:55.580
which you and I already talked about via email

52:55.580 --> 52:56.580
and pursue those.

52:56.580 --> 52:59.580
And then, like Wes said, fill in those details.

52:59.580 --> 53:01.580
Like, listen to the show when we talk about something

53:01.580 --> 53:03.580
like WireGuard or when we talk about Nebula soon.

53:03.580 --> 53:06.580
Tune into that kind of stuff and build something off of that

53:06.580 --> 53:07.580
and go use that as a learning opportunity.

53:07.580 --> 53:09.580
We're kind of there with you to do it, right?

53:09.580 --> 53:11.580
You can kind of write in and tell us about your experience,

53:11.580 --> 53:14.580
and we can be there to kind of cheer you along.

53:14.580 --> 53:16.580
So consider that as well.

53:16.580 --> 53:17.580
It's a great way to learn.

53:17.580 --> 53:19.580
And maybe if you come up with some ideas,

53:19.580 --> 53:20.580
some areas you want to play with

53:20.580 --> 53:21.580
that you haven't heard us talk about,

53:21.580 --> 53:23.580
well, suggest it and maybe we'll feature it

53:23.580 --> 53:24.580
on an upcoming show.

53:24.580 --> 53:25.580
You never know.

53:25.580 --> 53:27.580
Yeah, very much so, very much so.

53:27.580 --> 53:29.580
I just wanted to mention we do have stickers up

53:29.580 --> 53:31.580
on the JupiterGarage.com.

53:31.580 --> 53:34.580
We made stickers from the, what do you call it?

53:34.580 --> 53:36.580
What is that high-resolution vector stuff called?

53:36.580 --> 53:37.580
SVG.

53:37.580 --> 53:38.580
That.

53:38.580 --> 53:39.580
I thought Brett would know.

53:39.580 --> 53:40.580
He's a graphics guy after all.

53:40.580 --> 53:42.580
Well, photo guy.

53:42.580 --> 53:44.580
It's rasters versus vectors here.

53:44.580 --> 53:45.580
Come on.

53:45.580 --> 53:46.580
Well, we took them vectors and we said,

53:46.580 --> 53:47.580
hey, you know what we could do

53:47.580 --> 53:49.580
is we could make some real nice stickers with them.

53:49.580 --> 53:51.580
And so we took the album art for the shows

53:51.580 --> 53:54.580
and we went and made stickers up at JupiterGarage.com,

53:54.580 --> 53:56.580
and it's great.

53:56.580 --> 53:58.580
I at first was like, no, that's dumb.

53:58.580 --> 53:59.580
We shouldn't do that.

53:59.580 --> 54:00.580
We should come up with brand new stickers,

54:00.580 --> 54:01.580
which we still will.

54:01.580 --> 54:03.580
But then I thought, well, why not?

54:03.580 --> 54:05.580
I mean, this has been published on every episode.

54:05.580 --> 54:06.580
Now you can have a sticker of it.

54:06.580 --> 54:07.580
It's a pretty great way to go.

54:07.580 --> 54:09.580
JupiterGarage.com.

54:09.580 --> 54:10.580
You can find our friends.

54:10.580 --> 54:12.580
We're at a Cloud Guru on social media.

54:12.580 --> 54:17.580
They're pretty much just slash a Cloud Guru anywhere,

54:17.580 --> 54:19.580
like the YouTubes, the Twitters, the Facebooks.

54:19.580 --> 54:21.580
If it's a social platform, they're probably there.

54:21.580 --> 54:22.580
It's slash a Cloud Guru.

54:22.580 --> 54:23.580
You can go find them there.

54:23.580 --> 54:25.580
Brent, where would you like people to find you?

54:25.580 --> 54:27.580
Oh, I think Twitter is a good place to find me.

54:27.580 --> 54:29.580
I'm at Brent Jervais.

54:29.580 --> 54:31.580
And what about you, Wes Payne?

54:31.580 --> 54:32.580
I'm at Wes Payne.

54:32.580 --> 54:34.580
Don't worry if you can't spell Brent's last name.

54:34.580 --> 54:36.580
We'll have a link in the show notes.

54:36.580 --> 54:37.580
That's true.

54:37.580 --> 54:38.580
That is true.

54:38.580 --> 54:39.580
I'm over there.

54:39.580 --> 54:40.580
I'm at Chris LAS.

54:40.580 --> 54:42.580
Mostly, I just tweet sparingly.

54:42.580 --> 54:44.580
I'm not going to muck your timeline up,

54:44.580 --> 54:46.580
but I'm also not just 100% AFK.

54:46.580 --> 54:48.580
You know, you tweet at me.

54:48.580 --> 54:50.580
I might do you the honor of a reply.

54:50.580 --> 54:52.580
Especially if it's a Rust pick.

54:52.580 --> 54:55.580
Boy, they're all over me these days with the Rust picks.

54:55.580 --> 54:56.580
I tell you what.

54:56.580 --> 54:57.580
No, I love them, actually.

54:57.580 --> 54:58.580
It's a great way to send them in,

54:58.580 --> 54:59.580
because then I can sneak them to Wes.

54:59.580 --> 55:01.580
Although, he often reads my Twitter feed,

55:01.580 --> 55:03.580
so I can't always sneak it past him.

55:03.580 --> 55:04.580
You never know.

55:04.580 --> 55:05.580
I might be able to sneak it past him

55:05.580 --> 55:07.580
if you send it to me at Chris LAS.

55:07.580 --> 55:09.580
The network is at Jupiter Signal,

55:09.580 --> 55:12.580
and this here podcast is at Linux Unplugged.

55:12.580 --> 55:14.580
But I got a pro tip for you.

55:14.580 --> 55:15.580
You could join us live.

55:15.580 --> 55:19.580
We do this show on Tuesdays at noon Pacific, 3 p.m. Eastern.

55:19.580 --> 55:20.580
See you next week.

55:20.580 --> 55:23.580
Same bat time, same bat station.

55:23.580 --> 55:24.580
And man, here's the thing.

55:24.580 --> 55:25.580
Here's the thing.

55:25.580 --> 55:27.580
If you're not catching Linux action news,

55:27.580 --> 55:28.580
you're missing.

55:28.580 --> 55:30.580
You're missing what's going on.

55:30.580 --> 55:31.580
You're missing on the news.

55:31.580 --> 55:34.580
You're missing out on stuff that impacts your gerb.

55:34.580 --> 55:35.580
Come on, stay informed.

55:35.580 --> 55:37.580
Jeez.

55:37.580 --> 55:39.580
LinuxActionNews.com for that.

55:39.580 --> 55:41.580
But as for us, LinuxUnplugged.com is where you can find links

55:41.580 --> 55:42.580
to what we talked about today.

55:42.580 --> 55:45.580
This is episode 420.

55:45.580 --> 55:47.580
You can also find our subscribe link over there,

55:47.580 --> 55:48.580
that contact page.

55:48.580 --> 55:49.580
We'd love to hear from you.

55:49.580 --> 55:51.580
And our Matrix server info.

55:51.580 --> 55:52.580
I don't mention that enough,

55:52.580 --> 55:54.580
but the community is still growing over on our Matrix,

55:54.580 --> 55:56.580
and we'd love to have you there.

55:56.580 --> 55:58.580
Seems like elements going in a good direction.

55:58.580 --> 55:59.580
Why not come join the party?

55:59.580 --> 56:01.580
Maybe leave a voice message.

56:01.580 --> 56:02.580
Maybe.

56:02.580 --> 56:04.580
Eh, maybe not.

56:04.580 --> 56:33.580
Either way, see you back here next Tuesday!

56:34.580 --> 56:49.580
I don't want to tear down my setup.

56:49.580 --> 56:53.580
You know, cause like every time I record on this road trip,

56:53.580 --> 56:55.580
we've been moving and the kids need to sleep here.

56:55.580 --> 57:00.580
And so I've had to tear down my setup after every single episode.

57:00.580 --> 57:03.580
And so yesterday's coder was the first time I did a show

57:03.580 --> 57:04.580
and didn't have to tear down afterwards.

57:04.580 --> 57:08.580
And now I have to tear down again because we're moving on soon.

57:08.580 --> 57:12.580
And I don't want to, I want to build a permanent setup

57:12.580 --> 57:15.580
in the RV for podcasting so bad.

57:15.580 --> 57:17.580
You know, I hear Brent's pretty handy.

57:17.580 --> 57:18.580
That's true.

57:18.580 --> 57:20.580
You can take advantage of me for another two weeks.

57:20.580 --> 57:21.580
Yeah, yeah.

57:21.580 --> 57:23.580
I did hear when you were at System 76,

57:23.580 --> 57:25.580
you were starting to dream a little bit.

57:25.580 --> 57:26.580
Some possibilities.

57:26.580 --> 57:28.580
I actually think one of my genuine mistakes

57:28.580 --> 57:30.580
on this road trip was I should have ordered

57:30.580 --> 57:32.580
one of their little BB Thalios,

57:32.580 --> 57:34.580
you know, those tiny little Thalios.

57:34.580 --> 57:35.580
I should have ordered one of those,

57:35.580 --> 57:37.580
like when we were days out at Denver

57:37.580 --> 57:39.580
and then on the last day, see if they could have given it to me.

57:39.580 --> 57:40.580
Like if they could have,

57:40.580 --> 57:41.580
if they could have built it that fast,

57:41.580 --> 57:42.580
I'm not saying they could have,

57:42.580 --> 57:44.580
but if they could have, I could have just taken it with me.

57:44.580 --> 57:46.580
What I really kind of want those,

57:46.580 --> 57:48.580
I want something I can mount to the wall.

57:48.580 --> 57:50.580
So it has to be really kind of probably even smaller

57:50.580 --> 57:51.580
than the baby Thalio.

57:51.580 --> 57:53.580
And then I want a screen that folds down

57:53.580 --> 57:56.580
and I want a mounting spot for a microphone

57:56.580 --> 57:57.580
and I don't ever want to have to tear down

57:57.580 --> 57:59.580
and set up a laptop and a mixer

57:59.580 --> 58:01.580
and the tablet screen and the microphone stand

58:01.580 --> 58:02.580
and all the cables.

58:02.580 --> 58:04.580
I feel like you also need one of those, you know,

58:04.580 --> 58:05.580
feeders they have in like a rat cage,

58:05.580 --> 58:32.580
but there's just beer in it.
