1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,680
Wes, you're always trying to find new and fun things to do with good old DNS.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,360
What'd you find this week?

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:06,360
DNS.toys.

4
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:11,360
I mean, you're familiar with the tools that let you get the weather in your terminal,

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,360
right?

6
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,360
Yeah, okay.

7
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,960
But that's like calling an HTTP API.

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:15,960
It's so wasteful.

9
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:16,960
Boring.

10
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:17,960
Yeah.

11
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,640
With DNS.toys, you can get the weather over DNS.

12
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,640
Excuse me?

13
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:29,360
Yeah, just dig Seattle.weather at DNS.toys and there you go.

14
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,040
You can get different times, world times and time zones.

15
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:37,840
You can do your unit and currency conversion and you can even print the digits of pi.

16
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,840
That's pretty great.

17
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:43,600
And you know, this just puts us one step closer to that all command line, all the time lifestyle.

18
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,600
We'll get there.

19
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:49,600
I knew it.

20
00:00:49,600 --> 00:01:00,160
Hello friends and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

21
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,160
My name is Chris.

22
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,160
My name is Wes.

23
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,160
And my name is Brent.

24
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,920
Hello gentlemen.

25
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,080
Welcome into a very special episode of the unplugged program.

26
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:13,080
We're going to have a really unique guest.

27
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,680
He helped co-invent the webcam, the VNC protocol and so many other things.

28
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,760
He'll be joining us in just a little bit to share some of his memories of the early days

29
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:25,880
of the web, computing and so many of the standards and protocols that we use today.

30
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,000
It's just going to be a great opportunity, but first we do have a couple of items we

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,040
want to update you on, then we'll round out the show with some boosts and some picks and

32
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,040
a lot more.

33
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,000
So before we go any further, let's do the right thing and bring our virtual log in time

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,640
appropriate greetings, mumble room.

35
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,640
Hello, hello.

36
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,640
Good evening.

37
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,640
Hello Chris.

38
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,360
Hey Wes and hey Brent.

39
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,720
I am very glad you could be here for the special prerecord this week.

40
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,560
We don't always get the mumble room when we do a prerecord.

41
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,560
It means a lot.

42
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:59,980
Otherwise it's just a little lonely, quiet, too much, I mean, hey now, well, hey, before

43
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:04,120
we go too far, should we do a meetup for folks that are going to be attending the Jupiter

44
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,840
broadcasting London meetup in August?

45
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,840
Yeah.

46
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,680
I'm not sure if we have an update this week, but I think it was very important to just

47
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:21,480
keep mentioning that Alex will be in London and he's planning a Jupiter broadcasting meetup

48
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:27,480
that is tentatively planned for August 5th at around 6pm GMT.

49
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:32,760
Now don't be confused because the meetup page tends to give all the times in JB time, which

50
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,480
is Pacific, which would not really work out very well locally in London.

51
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,360
So have a look at the meetup page.

52
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,760
I think there are about 80 to 90 people signed up so far.

53
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,320
It seems every week we get another 10 or 20, which is really great.

54
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:49,680
And look for some updates on location maybe in the next few weeks.

55
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,680
I really wish I could make that one.

56
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,680
Hmm.

57
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,680
Boy, oh boy.

58
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,480
I'm really glad though that it's coming together.

59
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,480
Jealous.

60
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,640
Build a community over there.

61
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,160
Maybe this is the way to do it, right?

62
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,160
We start getting an idea of how many folks are there, what works and doesn't work, and

63
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,160
then...

64
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,840
Alex is going to scout out some locations this time around, right?

65
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,600
So we'll have some ideas there too.

66
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,600
Maybe this is how it happens.

67
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,840
We send the pre-crew and then we'll get there, you know, next time.

68
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,200
Like the rock stars we are.

69
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,200
Oh wait.

70
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,200
I just got really excited there.

71
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,200
Like true VIPs.

72
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,200
Yeah.

73
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,200
Oh boy.

74
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,200
Let's move on.

75
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,200
For goodness sakes.

76
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,640
Meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting for the details on that.

77
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,760
Do follow it there because details could change.

78
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,080
Flights could change.

79
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,180
That kind of stuff.

80
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:30,720
It's been a minute since we've talked about the Linux Copter flying on Mars.

81
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,540
We do updates occasionally in Linux Action News.

82
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:38,880
But this week it seems that there's been a little software update that we want to talk

83
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,880
about.

84
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,080
I'm just recovering this has been out there for a little bit.

85
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,240
But as you guys will recall, Ingenuity arrived on Mars in February 2021.

86
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:51,080
And along with the rover, this little helicopter we thought, well, we'd see, I don't know,

87
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,800
I don't remember with how many flights we saw, I thought originally it was such a small

88
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,800
number.

89
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,320
I mean, it's just a proof of concept.

90
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:00,720
But now it's turned out it's flown 21 times and it's actually provided critical data for

91
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,720
the rover.

92
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:05,800
So much so that NASA is going to continue to use these Linux Copters in the future.

93
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:10,000
And for us, it just felt like such a historic milestone for Linux.

94
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,720
And then we had an opportunity to connect with some of the folks from JPL and that was

95
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,860
such a cool treat.

96
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:18,560
And so it's neat to see software updates are going out.

97
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,620
I guess I didn't really have anything other than I just wanted to have an excuse to talk

98
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,320
about this little guy.

99
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:27,520
They've done some upgrades to reduce navigation errors during flight.

100
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,000
And they're now letting it fly higher than 15 meters too.

101
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,480
It's just getting more and more capable and it keeps working.

102
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:37,580
And remember, like before this thing flew, we weren't even 100% sure that the whole flying

103
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,680
on Mars thing was going to work properly.

104
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:46,800
Yeah, they said that they flew over to this Delta on Mars and they used the helicopter

105
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,080
to determine which of the dry river channels that the copter should drive in or that the

106
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,880
rover I should say should drive into.

107
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,240
It's a neat idea.

108
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:59,440
This patch is kind of cool too because they're inserting a small little code snippet on the

109
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,480
flight computer that intercepts incoming garbage packets from like some faulty sensor stuff

110
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:09,960
and then uses other data to reconstruct replacement packets that get like inserted into the stream.

111
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,400
So then like downstream components just get the data that they were expecting.

112
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,400
I can't even imagine.

113
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:19,400
So not only do you come up with that patch, but then you apply the patch on Mars.

114
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,760
Hopefully they've got that new system DAB updates thing.

115
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:26,920
Actually didn't they say there was some kind of AB system they had on there?

116
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,920
They did say that.

117
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,920
Yeah, there is that.

118
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,920
Hopefully they have that kind of.

119
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,920
Hopefully an ABC system.

120
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:38,360
You know, I'd love to know more about it because you got to imagine there is an identical unit

121
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:44,280
on the ground at JPL, but then are they like, are they doing like a series of QA tests on

122
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,280
this thing?

123
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,920
Are they doing like flight tests and imaging tests?

124
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:52,360
Like are they like doing software updates and then do they have some sort of facility

125
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,480
where this thing flies inside where it's the atmosphere of Mars and then they do a bunch

126
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,480
of testing?

127
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,480
That's a good question.

128
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,480
Are they putting dust on it and stuff?

129
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,480
Right?

130
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,560
Like are they diminishing like the solar panels capacity?

131
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,640
Or is it kind of just a YOLO thing where they're like, well, we can only test so much.

132
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,640
Upload.

133
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:10,040
I'd love to get the answer to that, but it's pretty great to follow this and it's great

134
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,400
to see that they're continuing to update.

135
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,760
It's been several updates just even kind of recently on the on the 7th.

136
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,240
I think there was a report.

137
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,040
Go Ingenuity go.

138
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,040
Yeah.

139
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,040
Yeah.

140
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,040
So neat.

141
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:24,160
And even though we haven't really touched on it in a bit, we're still following it.

142
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,440
And when there is kind of like a mission update or something like that, we do try to include

143
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,320
that in Linux action news as well.

144
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:34,960
And then I wanted to follow up on a project called Umbral.

145
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:41,320
We talked about Umbral a month or two ago, and it sells itself as a personal server OS

146
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,320
for self hosting.

147
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,680
And I'd say that's pretty accurate.

148
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:48,640
It's really seen some major updates since we talked about it last on the show.

149
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:53,360
And one of those updates is to break out the Bitcoin node and the lightning node as their

150
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,220
own separate apps.

151
00:06:55,220 --> 00:07:00,720
So if you weren't interested in the Bitcoin aspect of this, but maybe you were interested

152
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,840
in running Nextcloud or a Google Photos replacement like Photo Prism or Sync Thing or Synapse

153
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,640
to run your own matrix server, or maybe you wanted to run Vault Warden or Fulcrum.

154
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,440
I do want to run those things.

155
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,440
Yeah.

156
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,220
And you didn't necessarily want to dedicate 500 gigs to the blockchain.

157
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,340
I don't know.

158
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,500
That seems pretty reasonable.

159
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:22,160
They've now broken all of that out along with a brand new UI.

160
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:27,120
And because people are having such a hard time getting their hands on a Raspberry Pi,

161
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:33,320
they've now created a couple of really easy one liner type installs to get Umbral up and

162
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,440
running on any Debian or Ubuntu box.

163
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,640
Oh, that's great.

164
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,680
Making that really, really straightforward.

165
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,840
If you missed our first coverage, that's Linux Unplugged 4.47 for more.

166
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:47,080
But speaking of Raspberry Pis, I actually have a little bit of good news.

167
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,200
You've been hoarding them and you're willing to sell some of your supply to the audience?

168
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,280
I'm waiting for the prices to go up just a little bit longer.

169
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,280
I'm still hedging.

170
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:59,320
You know, but you and I have been talking about doing a Raspberry Pi based router.

171
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,800
Were you thinking for yourself or were you thinking for your folks or both?

172
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,800
I can't remember.

173
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,360
I mean, some combination of I need a new router set up.

174
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,360
My folks need one.

175
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,360
The studio needs one.

176
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,360
And the studio needs one.

177
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,360
So there's like a lot of things.

178
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,360
Yeah.

179
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,360
Tell the time for a shortage.

180
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,360
Oh, yeah.

181
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,360
I mean, you do.

182
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,360
Brent.

183
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,360
Yeah.

184
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,360
That's before we even get to Brent.

185
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,360
We all know this.

186
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,360
I don't even have to mention it.

187
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,360
But you just got a laptop.

188
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,360
All right.

189
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,680
I can only give away so many things in an episode.

190
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,800
So this week, I actually have really great news for Wes.

191
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:31,620
Listener Maximilian contacted me on Matrix recently and said, hey, I've got a Raspberry

192
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,900
Pi for eight gigabytes.

193
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:34,900
Could you use it?

194
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,180
I haven't been using it for anything.

195
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:38,480
And I said, you know, I think that Wes Payne could use it.

196
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,080
He's looking to build a router.

197
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:48,080
So Maximilian is shipping a Raspberry Pi for eight gigabytes for Wes Payne to the studio.

198
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,120
So it'll probably arrive while I'm in Montana.

199
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,120
That's usually how these things work out.

200
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,400
That's just kind of typical, I suppose.

201
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,600
Well, that way, it's something to tempt you back.

202
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,600
Yeah, right.

203
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,600
Well, no, it'll be for you.

204
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,360
And then we can and I'll use my Compute Module 4 that I have set aside.

205
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,880
I have one set aside.

206
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,360
And you won't have to worry about a carrier board because this is a full unit.

207
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,680
And we can get maybe that router project kicked off now.

208
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,800
So that'll be pretty cool.

209
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,460
And I think we were talking about it, although I don't know for sure about it.

210
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:18,520
But I think we're tempted to try to build it around Nix OS and create a Linux based

211
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,960
firewall and router.

212
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,740
We're not opposed to things like PFSense or any of that kind of stuff.

213
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:27,420
But we thought it might be fun to see what it'd be like to just build a minimum viable

214
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:32,720
Linux router project that is a super tightly controlled OS.

215
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,480
I don't know what we'll use for everything.

216
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,480
We haven't quite discussed it.

217
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:39,080
I'm sure we have a few ideas, but indeed, we don't want to spoil all the fun.

218
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:43,080
Yeah, but, you know, we'll get a little reckless with it because that's what we do here.

219
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,560
So that's cool, and I wanted to say thank you to Listener Maximillian.

220
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,560
That's pretty great.

221
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,560
Thank you for enabling our shenanigans.

222
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,560
Yeah.

223
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,160
And if you've got a Raspberry Pi or an Ubuntu and Debian box and you want to try out the

224
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,600
new Umbral, it is pretty cool.

225
00:09:54,600 --> 00:10:00,400
It is a really slick way to load up a bunch of great apps on your own LAN.

226
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:04,160
They write on their release announcement, this release has brought a massive underlying

227
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,840
architectural change to Umbral's source code.

228
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:10,880
One of those changes is the migration of the Umbral app store to its own dedicated GitHub

229
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,800
repository along with a new way to easily test package and ship apps for Umbral.

230
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:20,760
So the other big update, if you're already using Umbral, is they'll now have separate

231
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,920
updates for these components outside of the overall OS updates.

232
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:29,720
So you can get mid-stream app updates now, which is going to be really nice.

233
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,800
And I like Umbral.

234
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,800
It is still in beta.

235
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,800
It is still early.

236
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,800
There's always these caveats with these one-click do-it-all things, but I do think it's a pretty

237
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,800
good project.

238
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,800
Now, Chris, you've been running Umbral at the studio since about January when I was

239
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,800
there last.

240
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:48,760
And I was curious, I guess, how it's been going and whether or not you've updated yet

241
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,200
or you plan too soon to this new version.

242
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,960
I've not gone to this new version yet, but I have done every update.

243
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,360
I'm going to do the new version when I get back.

244
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,760
I just don't want anything to go sideways before I travel.

245
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,760
Wow.

246
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,000
You're being uncharacteristically responsible.

247
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I love the boosts.

248
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Are you feeling okay?

249
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,120
The boosts are like my little bit of sunshine every single day.

250
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,360
So anything to protect the boosts.

251
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,360
Yeah.

252
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,360
On a cloudy day.

253
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,160
So on my side, when somebody sends in a boost, a helipad makes a great little sound, a little

254
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,160
boost sound effect.

255
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,800
And then there's also a confetti explosion all over it.

256
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,800
And it's a live update.

257
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,120
It comes right in in real time.

258
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,040
And I tell you what, it is the best mood booster ever.

259
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:27,400
And so I didn't want to break that because I'll probably, you know, if I'm frustrated

260
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:31,500
or something at some point, I'll pull up tail scale on my phone and I bring up the boosts.

261
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,500
Bad traffic.

262
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,500
Check for the boost.

263
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,460
Well, maybe not while I'm driving, but literally I'll be having like a bad day or I'll be frustrated

264
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:41,000
and I'll just tail scale up and I'll bring, oh yeah, look at these boosts.

265
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Okay.

266
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I feel better now.

267
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,800
So I don't want to break it before I go, but it has been really super solid since January.

268
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,120
I've done every update since then.

269
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,520
And it does make it pretty easy to back up and get out.

270
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:57,080
I mean, really under the hood, all it's doing is like updating Docker containers.

271
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,080
It's a pretty established system.

272
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,760
So it's pretty safe.

273
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,480
There is of course things to consider.

274
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,200
It is in beta.

275
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:10,660
It's a 0.5 release and this is a major new version, but we've heard from several folks

276
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:15,400
in our Bitcoin matrix channel that the update has gone really smooth for them.

277
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,400
So nice.

278
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,400
Yeah.

279
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,400
Yeah.

280
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,400
A big test for the project.

281
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,400
So hopefully it keeps going well.

282
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,140
lino.com slash unplugged.

283
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:28,840
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account and you go there to support the

284
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,840
show.

285
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,840
So it's lino.com slash unplugged and that's it.

286
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:38,440
It's simple as that to get that $100 MVME storage, super fast CPUs, 11 data centers

287
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,800
around the world, best support in the biz.

288
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,520
I mean, I could go on and on.

289
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,520
In fact, I often do.

290
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,520
And you know what?

291
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:50,040
It's still to this day, two and a half years later when I need to deploy something, I go

292
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,080
to Linode.

293
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,120
I go to Linode because I've had a great experience.

294
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:58,000
Honestly, the performance, it matters to me, but they're also just great citizens in the

295
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,420
Linux community.

296
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,600
That's actually how I found Linode originally.

297
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,280
I was at Texas Linux Fest, which feels like a hundred years ago.

298
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:09,960
Texas Linux Fest was having a bit of a rough year and most of the vendors just weren't

299
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:15,800
even really trying, but Linode was there with a smile on their face and the best booth making

300
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:20,660
what turned out to be one of the most influential Linux Fest in my lifetime possible.

301
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:21,920
And I made a mental note.

302
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:27,680
I wasn't even looking for sponsors back then, but I made a mental note that when it came

303
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,720
time, I was going to look up Linode.

304
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,720
And while I waited, I tried them out as a customer.

305
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,280
I became a customer first.

306
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,280
And I was so damn impressed.

307
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,240
You know, they've been doing this for nearly 19 years.

308
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:41,040
So it makes sense that you get it right, but that doesn't mean every company does that.

309
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,960
And there's a lot of places you can host things, but no place quite does it like Linode with

310
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:49,020
the performance, the support, and just the continuous improvement.

311
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:54,800
They just expanded their managed database offering, which was just MySQL back in May.

312
00:13:54,800 --> 00:14:00,000
Well now they're offering Postgres and MongoDB, which is huge for us.

313
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,920
I'm probably going to move our matrix Postgres database over to this.

314
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,360
I mean, why not?

315
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:10,360
Why not take advantage of the expertise that is Linode's staff and their infrastructure

316
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,860
to run the database?

317
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:15,680
The part of running a matrix server I kind of don't like anyways.

318
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,600
I think it's pretty great.

319
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,480
And I'd do it too if I was using MongoDB or MySQL.

320
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,480
I'm ready to jump in though.

321
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,480
I tell you what.

322
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,800
We've also released a new e-book, which you can get for free, which helps give you a high

323
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,960
level understanding of database and database architectures and different deployment methods

324
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:34,840
and what methods might work best in the cloud possibly.

325
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:40,080
Or when you're working with their crazy fast storage or their AMD epic processors, AMD

326
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:43,000
really has some great CPUs and you know what?

327
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Linode was down.

328
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
They were down.

329
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
They put them in some of their high-end.

330
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,840
We've got a system with AMD epic processors in it.

331
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,840
I love it.

332
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,840
I love the flexibility.

333
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,840
I love the solution choice.

334
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,120
I love the support and all of it.

335
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:58,520
Plus, it's a great way for you to try something, for you to learn something, to get that $100

336
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,520
and support the show.

337
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,540
So just head right over to linode.com slash unplugged.

338
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:07,360
Get that $100 for 60 days on a new account, kick the tires for yourself and support the

339
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,360
show.

340
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:14,080
Linode.com slash unplugged.

341
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:19,120
You know, gentlemen, I was lucky enough to be able to have a brunch with Brent style

342
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:26,320
conversation with a listener of ours who is a very avid listener of self-hosted and other

343
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,920
programs here on Jupiter broadcasting.

344
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:35,520
And this gentleman's name, Quinton Stafford Frazier, or Dr. Quinton, it should be, turns

345
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:39,880
out is a fabulously interesting individual.

346
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:45,480
I was introduced to him by Alex because they had a little exchange and Alex was like, oh,

347
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,880
this guy's got to be a great brunch guest.

348
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,920
So we went ahead and did that recently.

349
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:57,660
Quinton is a computer scientist, an entrepreneur, part-time academic, full-time gadget enthusiast.

350
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:02,280
So lots of home assistance stuff going on here based in Cambridge, England.

351
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:09,280
And he is credited with inventing the webcam, which he claims is not entirely justified,

352
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,320
but turns out the media thinks he should be.

353
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,320
Oh, good.

354
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,320
We have someone to blame.

355
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,320
Right.

356
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:19,000
So he's authored dozens of patents over the years that have mostly been owned by Google

357
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
now.

358
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,720
His PhD is on augmented reality, which I think sounds pretty fascinating.

359
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:33,640
He also ran the very first web server in Cambridge University back then when the newfangled worldwide

360
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,660
web thing was happening.

361
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:41,040
He also teased with me that he may have had something to do with inventing the very first

362
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:46,040
AVNC client, which I think maybe we'll have to have a conversation about.

363
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:51,360
But he describes a great deal more on his personal website, which we will link to.

364
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,640
And in our conversation, he was pretty humble about how long that list of accomplishments

365
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,640
was.

366
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,600
I actually have quite a substantial personal website.

367
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,880
And it's not that I think I'm deserving of this great monument to myself.

368
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:07,940
It's just that I keep adding bits and I never get around to deleting stuff.

369
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:13,600
And that's what I gathered, because some of the things, which I didn't read, mentioned

370
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,600
like, you can hear me say hello here.

371
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:21,440
And in parentheses, you state, at the time that I wrote this, that wasn't possible for

372
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,680
all computers and all browsers.

373
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,840
So it's neat how you've just sort of added things as you go.

374
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,320
And I think that's actually really nice.

375
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:32,800
Well, I think that that recording of me saying hello, which just says something like, hello,

376
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:38,600
I'm Quentin, pleased to meet you, is probably in an audio format that it's remarkable still

377
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,920
plays on most browsers.

378
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:45,320
Because I think I recorded it on my spark station back in about, you know, certainly

379
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:48,120
not this millennium anyway.

380
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,760
Back when not all browsers could play audio.

381
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:54,880
And if you actually had one that could, then you could hear me say hello.

382
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,300
Pretty exciting.

383
00:17:56,300 --> 00:18:01,720
That I think gives a sense that you've, let's just say, you've been around, you've seen

384
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,720
some history.

385
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,720
That's pretty interesting.

386
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,720
I'm really old.

387
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,720
That's a nice way of saying yes.

388
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,480
Seasoned, perhaps is a nice way to put it.

389
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,480
That's good.

390
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,480
I like that.

391
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,440
But the early web, you know, for me, I'm slightly younger than you.

392
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:20,360
For me, the early web, in my perspective, was dial up internet and the pains and beauties

393
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:24,800
of that, you know, having a home PC was a big thing.

394
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:30,340
Actually, the first computer I used was Commodore 64 that my father purchased that was quite

395
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,340
old at the time.

396
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:36,360
And, you know, he forced us to use the spreadsheet there for he would give us an allowance and

397
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,360
we would tabulate.

398
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,320
A man with foresight, clearly.

399
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,320
Yeah.

400
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,320
Yeah.

401
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,480
So that's, you know, my early history of, you know, five and a half inch floppy disks.

402
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:49,040
But you've seen a little bit before that, which really fascinates me.

403
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,080
Well, yeah, yeah, a little bit.

404
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:57,800
I mean, I do think that you and I have been very fortunate to grow up when we did, right?

405
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:01,480
I think and be interested in technology.

406
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:06,000
It's like, you know, growing up and being interested in cars at around the time of Henry

407
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,520
Ford or whatever.

408
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:12,600
But computing has happened so fast, and there's been all of these changes within a lifetime.

409
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:19,080
I really did have to sort of solder my first computer together and I've gone from that

410
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:23,120
in a very short period of time to something like, you know, the iPhones and iPads sitting

411
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,200
on my desk are just so far away from that.

412
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:30,200
And, you know, there aren't many fields, I think, in which you could have that exciting

413
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,960
a change during your professional life.

414
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:37,440
And so that being said, I'm curious, what was it about the computers?

415
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,920
You know, you mentioned you soldered your own, yeah, maybe some pieces together.

416
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,040
And some of us still do that these days, just for fun.

417
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,040
Yeah, yeah.

418
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:48,880
But you do it for fun, not necessarily, not because of necessity, though.

419
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,880
Right.

420
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,880
Not through necessity.

421
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,880
Exactly.

422
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:55,760
But I'm curious, what was it, you know, as a young Quentin, what was it that really grabbed

423
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,600
you about this, this relatively new world?

424
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,720
Oh, that's a really interesting question.

425
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:08,720
I think, I mean, computers weren't new when I was young, in the sense that, you know,

426
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:14,200
you saw them on television programs and things you saw, you may see them on the, the, you

427
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,280
know, the deck of the Star, Starship Enterprise, but

428
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,280
As you should.

429
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,280
That's right.

430
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:23,280
But, you know, I grew up just at the point where suddenly this was something my parents

431
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,280
could afford.

432
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,480
They could save up, but they could afford to give me one.

433
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:31,600
And only a few years before that, I had used a computer, but it had been in a museum in

434
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,960
London, you know, the Science Museum in London, not because it was an old thing, but the Science

435
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,240
Museum in London has a lot of new stuff, as well as old stuff.

436
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,000
And I remember when I first got my hands, actually, I was able to type at a keyboard

437
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,640
and give an instruction to a computer, which was one of these things you'd only seen, you

438
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,080
know, in sort of Hollywood movies up till then.

439
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:54,360
And so that sudden shift to being something that you could sit in front of on the, you

440
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:59,400
know, floor of your sitting room at home, and the only display we had was the television,

441
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,640
we only had one television in the house, so nobody could watch TV while I was using my

442
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,640
computer kind of thing.

443
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,800
Again, it was all of a sudden this unknown world.

444
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:13,160
I don't want to wax lyrical too early in this conversation, but I think that I've often

445
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:20,800
thought that computer science, in some senses is almost the most creative subject, the most

446
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:27,080
creative, almost art form, as it may be pushing it a bit, but you start when you're trying

447
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:33,840
to solve something using computers, you start often just with a thought, you have a problem

448
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:39,800
you want to solve, you have thoughts about how to do it, and you turn those thoughts

449
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:45,240
into a solution to a problem, or maybe a game or maybe something beautiful, or maybe some

450
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:52,440
but but in general, it's it's thought matter translated into something tangible, with possibly

451
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:59,680
less sort of intervening stuff than than almost any other any other activity, I think it really

452
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,920
is capturing thoughts.

453
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:07,160
And anyway, that's what it felt like to me at the start, you know, they're just simple

454
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:12,120
things like, I don't know, you want to make a picture of a cube rotate on the screen in

455
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:16,040
front of you, you had to think about Oh, okay, so hang on, what's the coordinates of that

456
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,040
going to be?

457
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:21,560
Well, you want it rotated by this angle, so you have to work out the cosine of this angle

458
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:27,120
and you know, and work out where the appropriate coordinates of this cube are going to be.

459
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,240
And then it looks a bit funny, and you realise that's because you didn't include perspective.

460
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,400
So you say, Oh, hang on, how does perspective work?

461
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:37,060
And you know, it really was you built everything from scratch there, because when you turned

462
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:41,280
your computer on, all you got was a flashing prompt at which you would have to type code.

463
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:45,920
And so if you wanted this thing to do anything, you had to start being creative from the word

464
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,920
go.

465
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:51,120
And that's something, you know, that we've not largely lost in computers, we turn them

466
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,280
on as a as a tool to do something.

467
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:58,680
But you weren't forced to be creative the moment you turn it on, as you were in the

468
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,680
past.

469
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:02,800
And that's partly what the Raspberry Pi and things like that have tried to recapture,

470
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,800
of course.

471
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:10,640
Yeah, yeah, that that conversion from imagination into reality, and then just kind of exploring

472
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,360
from there and seeing what's possible, right?

473
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,360
Yes.

474
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:18,240
And and, you know, in the past, if you wanted your computer to be able to interact with

475
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,960
the real world, you did often have to plug things into the back and solder things together

476
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,640
and make up the circuit boards yourself, and so on.

477
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:30,560
And you know, the Raspberry Pi was started by friends of mine who felt that the computer

478
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:34,200
science students that we were getting in the University at Cambridge, they were coming

479
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:38,400
in with actually much less experience now than they had had in the past, because in

480
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:43,600
the past, you to use computers, you sort of had to be an enthusiast.

481
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,440
Whereas now people were coming in just thinking, oh, computers might be interesting to learn

482
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:52,780
about, but they hadn't gone through that process of having to understand it so much before

483
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,240
you could even use it.

484
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:59,760
And so the idea of the Raspberry Pi was actually to give you a much more basic computer that

485
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:04,360
really didn't do very much for you out of the you know, when you plugged it in and turned

486
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,360
it on.

487
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,080
And you had to understand a bit more about it to accomplish anything.

488
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,840
And that was quite deliberate.

489
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:14,320
The hardware is quite capable of running all sorts of stuff, and they could have provided

490
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,480
you with a very slick experience out of the box.

491
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,880
But part of the idea was no, actually, you need to understand that how power supplies

492
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:25,840
work, and how to write code and so on, and how operating systems boot up and so on to

493
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,200
a much greater degree to be able to use one of them.

494
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,520
And I think that's part of why it's been such a success.

495
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:35,000
You know, you mentioned you had to be an enthusiast previously to really get into computers.

496
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,420
It seems almost the opposite these days, in that we all use computers in our everyday

497
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:44,440
lives from phones to, you know, everything else, really, to your car even.

498
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:50,640
And yet, the enthusiasts are the one going to these simpler machines like Raspberry Pis

499
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,480
and the single board computers and such.

500
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,680
And so it's almost feels like a reversal to me, which is really fascinating.

501
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,400
Yes, I think that's probably right.

502
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,840
It's almost more like, you know, everybody drives a car.

503
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:03,640
So if you're an enthusiast, you get a classic car, or you build a car yourself, or you,

504
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:08,760
you know, put beds in your car, and you have a camper van or whatever it may be, right?

505
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:13,400
When something becomes a commodity, then you need to find a new spin on it.

506
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:18,120
And that may be using computers to automate your home, or it may be, you know, just actually

507
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:24,760
turning on a computer and, you know, sending an email with it is not something that, well,

508
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:27,080
it's less of an adventure than it used to be.

509
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,920
So we find other things to do, right?

510
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,920
For sure.

511
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,920
Right.

512
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,920
And because everybody does it, right?

513
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:36,320
You want to find your own niche, or you want to, you want to, if you want to make a difference

514
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:40,440
to the world, or even just a difference to your local bit of the world, you have to do

515
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,600
something different from what everybody else is doing.

516
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,760
So I think that's part of part of the appeal.

517
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:51,720
You know, part of what has worried me in the past has been exploring the idea that maybe

518
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:55,680
we've gotten to the point where computers have done all the things that humanity needs

519
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,040
them to do.

520
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:01,360
And yet, when I reflect on that, just slightly more, especially in the context of you mentioning

521
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:07,520
it as quite an art form, I think, well, no, we're, we're really just started, aren't we?

522
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:11,640
Like, certainly, computers have taken us to the moon, and there's all sorts of things

523
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,680
on other planets now.

524
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:17,840
And yet, I think in some ways, we're just started, like, there's, do you feel like there's

525
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:21,200
a lot more possibility there in this this realm?

526
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,680
Yes, I think I think there is a great deal more.

527
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:31,260
But I think, I think the rapid acceleration at the start of computing has it sort of tails

528
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,720
off for a while.

529
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:38,080
I think actually, the analogy with cars is is kind of interesting here, because between

530
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:43,320
school and college, I worked for a car firm, you know, just for a year and a half for Austin

531
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:46,480
Rover cars, as they were then.

532
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:52,000
And it was, you know, it was a useful experience of industry, but it wasn't at all sexy.

533
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,360
There was nothing about, you know, nothing about it that made me want to carry on doing

534
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,480
this after I finished as a student and so on.

535
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:02,280
I thought that, you know, essentially, cars had become dull, and, you know, nothing really

536
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:08,440
new was happening with them, and hadn't really happened for, you know, 50 or 100 years.

537
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:12,960
And then all of a sudden, you know, a few years ago, I got into doing stuff related

538
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:19,480
to cars again, because you had this combination of electric vehicles, which were completely

539
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:24,800
changing how cars were and could be built, and what they were like to drive, and so on.

540
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:30,800
And you had this whole idea of autonomous vehicles, self driving cars, which, again,

541
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:36,760
was very interesting technologically, car companies were having to become, you know,

542
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,760
software companies.

543
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:44,140
But also, you know, the whole shape of a vehicle, what does it what does a car look like?

544
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,140
Does it have to be?

545
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:49,760
Do you have to have everybody facing forwards, you know, if the car can drive itself?

546
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:54,440
And all of these sort of things are thrown open for innovation again.

547
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:59,040
We have vehicles that are bigger and smaller and quieter and, you know, different shapes

548
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:05,640
and so on in a way that so much has been defined in the past by the basic shape of an internal

549
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:10,240
combustion engine and four wheels and a gearbox and so on.

550
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:15,280
And I think we're at a very exciting time now to be in the automobile industry, which,

551
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:20,160
again, we haven't really had, I don't think I mean, what's changed before before this

552
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,720
advent of electric vehicles?

553
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,320
What's changed in the last five decades?

554
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,560
You know, very, very little.

555
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:31,520
Yeah, I think four wheel drive or all wheel drive in rally racing was really a huge innovation.

556
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,960
But even that's quite mechanical, right?

557
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,040
But it didn't it didn't fundamentally change the shape of cars.

558
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:43,780
I mean, I guess you could say automatic automatic gearboxes, sure, sure, you know, which some

559
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:48,880
people still aren't keen on, you know, so there have been various small innovations.

560
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:54,320
But I still don't know how much I buy the dream of fully self driving vehicles.

561
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:59,440
But it seems to me that if we even get close to that, then the way we think of and use

562
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,200
cars could be completely different.

563
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,160
And I have some examples I like giving of this.

564
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,320
I mean, the thing I'm almost most exciting.

565
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:13,560
I know you've done a lot of stuff with RVs in Jupiter, and, or camper vans.

566
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:18,720
And I've always thought that what I really want is a self driving camper van or motor

567
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:25,400
home RV, one where in the evening I could, you know, I don't have enough space to, to

568
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:29,880
park it here, but I could summon it from its out of town parking area.

569
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:33,680
And it would turn up at the doorstep and I would get in with my dog and my wife and a

570
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,840
nice bottle of wine and a good movie.

571
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:42,080
And I would say, Oh, Chamonix, please Chamonix being in the French Alps, and we'd wake up

572
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:46,480
in the morning, you know, hundreds of miles away, you might not want to drive a big RV

573
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,320
around when you when you got there, but that's all right, because you could just tell your

574
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:52,120
car to follow you.

575
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:55,940
And so you could wake up the following morning and take your dog for a walk in a different

576
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:59,920
country having slept through the travel process.

577
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:06,680
Or another example I like to give is, I'd really like a self driving car for when I'm

578
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,680
walking.

579
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,560
Tell me more.

580
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,040
So I like hiking, right?

581
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:18,040
And so much of certainly here, so much of going for a walk involves finding a nice place

582
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:23,760
to park and doing a circular route, which brings you back to your car again.

583
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:29,480
And what about if you're driving along a road and you see a beautiful view and you say,

584
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,480
Hey, car stop here, let me out.

585
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,560
And you just get out and the car carries on and you walk over the fields and you walk

586
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:41,340
over the hills and you cross the rivers and at some point, which you don't have to decide

587
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:45,680
in advance when you get tired, you meet up with your car again, and you have a comfy

588
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,040
chair to take you home.

589
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:51,960
But you know, the fact that you leave your car in one place and have to return to it

590
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:55,840
in the same place again is something that you know, is perhaps an artifact of the past.

591
00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:00,080
And maybe in the future, people will say, what, you always had to do sort of circular

592
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,940
walks to get back to your transport?

593
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:04,440
That's crazy.

594
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:10,160
And so yeah, it'll be really interesting to see in, I think, in, you know, five decades

595
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:15,560
time, people may have a very different view of transport from what we have compared to

596
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:18,040
the five decades, you know, ago, right?

597
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,400
What was happening in the 60s?

598
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:25,680
Well, you know, the cars weren't really fundamentally that, not in that kind of way, but that different

599
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,680
from much the same, right?

600
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,680
Yeah.

601
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,680
Yeah.

602
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:36,160
Bitwarden.com slash Linux, get started with a free trial of teams or enterprise plans

603
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:41,160
at Bitwarden.com slash Linux, or try it for free as an individual user.

604
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:44,600
Bitwarden is just the easiest way for an individual or for a business to store, share and sync

605
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,600
sensitive data.

606
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,180
Bitwarden is fully open source, trusted by millions of users.

607
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:50,180
You know, we trust it.

608
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,780
You guys know we use it as our password manager.

609
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:55,600
You know that part of what made me choose that is Bitwarden's open source is what Weston

610
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:59,440
I used to manage our passwords, our two factor codes and other sensitive data.

611
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,980
And we're finally getting Brent on board, too.

612
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:03,940
You know, we've achieved something there.

613
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:06,420
And I love the support that Bitwarden offers.

614
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:09,720
If you get stuck, if you have a family member or friend that you recommended to Bitwarden,

615
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,960
they got you covered there.

616
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,360
On top of that, they're always rolling out new features.

617
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,160
They just added a new quick account switcher to Android.

618
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,960
This is absolute fire, you guys.

619
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:21,360
You're sitting there trying to fill out a password, oh crap, that's a business log in,

620
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,360
not a personal log in.

621
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,360
Oh, you know what?

622
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,640
Tap an icon, switch over to the other account.

623
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,640
Boom.

624
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,640
Now you're filling that out.

625
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,560
They've recently introduced a new username generator.

626
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:32,120
So that way you're using a unique username and a unique password when you're signing

627
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,480
up for a site or a service.

628
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,980
Man, is that not super great?

629
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:42,680
And they've also now begun working with certain email relay services like Firefox Relay or

630
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,740
a non Addy or simple login or more.

631
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:47,140
You can just put in your API key.

632
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:50,560
And then when you go create an account now to service, you know, like an app or a website

633
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:53,340
or whatever, it'll generate the password.

634
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:56,800
It'll generate the username and it'll give them a unique email address and it makes sure

635
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,800
you get all that stuff.

636
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:01,160
You keep track of all that stuff and it all still gets back to you.

637
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:04,140
That right there, killer feature right there.

638
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:08,940
And you guys know this, but maybe someone you know, maybe a family, a friend, maybe

639
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:14,240
the place you work, maybe they really haven't gotten the religion of good password hygiene.

640
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:19,180
And I just, I got to just say, like, there are so many things you could do, but there's

641
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:23,300
really one thing you must do to protect yourself online and that is using a unique password

642
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:26,300
at every website, every service, every app.

643
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:29,980
And now you can combine that with a unique username and a unique email address and keep

644
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:33,040
it all in Bitwarden and get access to it super quick.

645
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,360
On my iPhone, I have it set up with face ID.

646
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,900
So when it's time to fill out a password, I pull my phone up, it scans my damn face,

647
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:39,900
puts it right in there.

648
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:40,900
Boom.

649
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:41,900
You know what?

650
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:42,900
Next thing you know, I've unlocked the site or whatever.

651
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:43,900
It's so easy.

652
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:44,900
I can't believe people aren't doing it all the time.

653
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:49,500
I feel like I want to like parachute down and give people Bitwarden to save them from

654
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:52,620
some password mess they're probably living in.

655
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:55,380
Maybe it'd just be easier if everybody went to Bitwarden.com slash Linux and tried it

656
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:57,900
out for themselves or your business.

657
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:01,840
You know, maybe you got an open source team that could use some good password hygiene.

658
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:06,220
Any of that, go try it out, share it with a friend, tell somebody about it and support

659
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:07,220
the show.

660
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:10,220
Bitwarden.com slash Linux.

661
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:15,940
I'd like to say thank you so much to Quentin.

662
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:17,300
We had a great chat.

663
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:23,340
He joined me on a Friday evening with some sherry in hand, and as you might imagine,

664
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:27,180
that ended up going to a bunch of fascinating topics together.

665
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:33,500
A topic we touched on was how the patent system compares to the open source approach, which

666
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,560
was really great exploration.

667
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:40,260
The origins of the T9 mobile phone keyboard system, which his friend Martin basically

668
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:46,100
invented, and they co-founded another business together because of that.

669
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:51,420
We talk about how keyboards are archaic and how that tech just won't let go, and some

670
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:52,780
early computer vision stuff.

671
00:34:52,780 --> 00:35:00,740
So if you want to have a listen to more than just that excerpt, please go to extras.show.

672
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:06,160
There's a Brunch with Brent with Quentin there, and there may even be more coming in the future.

673
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,160
Quite the tease.

674
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:12,900
Now, Chris, we did get a lot of feedback on the Intel situation, which I think we should

675
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,020
recap here.

676
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:18,220
So could you give us a little brief recap, and then we'll jump into some great ideas

677
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:19,220
around our feedback?

678
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:20,220
Yeah.

679
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:25,140
So on a recent episode of Linux Unplugged and Linux Action News, we talked about the

680
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:32,300
upcoming Intel's software-defined CPUs and the fact that support for licensing and enabling

681
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:37,500
the software-defined features in a CPU landed in Linux 5.18, and we kind of had a discussion

682
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:43,740
if we thought that was how we felt about the idea that you'd buy a CPU and it has all these

683
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:46,820
features, but perhaps they're locked behind a license file.

684
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:51,980
And in there, we discussed that in terms of implementation, there's essentially two new

685
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:58,260
devices or spots on the file system that get created by this, one that defines the features

686
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:03,460
and one that defines the license that enables them or not, roughly speaking.

687
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:07,520
This has provoked a lot of discussion with our audience, and I think we have continued

688
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:12,020
to get feedback about that, and so we just wanted to cover some of it and just recap

689
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:15,460
so that way everybody knew what we were talking about since it's been a few weeks now.

690
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:22,260
Yeah, Jan wrote in with some great insights into current licensing practices of Intel.

691
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:27,660
Jan writes, just listen to episode 4.6.0 of Linux Unplugged and want to let you know some

692
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:30,020
stuff about CPU licensing.

693
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:36,260
Intel has done this in the past with its Itanium lineup, which has died meanwhile.

694
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:43,060
It's also a very common thing on IBM's ZOS mainframes, where you basically buy CPU time,

695
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:48,240
even though you might have more CPUs installed physically in your box to run them on.

696
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,540
This does allow certain features.

697
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:56,020
You only pay X, and if you really do need the extra performance, say for a month, you

698
00:36:56,020 --> 00:37:00,420
can get a temporary license, run the extra workload, and switch it off again for the

699
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:01,420
old price point.

700
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:07,500
I see a valid user case in the enterprise world, but for consumers, I do hope it doesn't

701
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,140
come to bite us in the butt.

702
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:12,940
Yeah, I think the most compelling argument I have heard has been, how does it affect

703
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:13,940
resale?

704
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:18,540
And we've been trying to figure out how that would work, like if you wipe an OS.

705
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:23,980
The insight that I kind of noticed here in James's email is, it does seem like the customer

706
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:28,500
activates it somehow with Intel servers in the previous system.

707
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:31,940
So maybe that exact infrastructure would be used.

708
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:35,940
Something similar, same infrastructure, same plan of attack.

709
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:39,340
I have been surprised the way they're handling all of this.

710
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:45,140
In terms of a company that is getting eaten on both ends by both AMD and by Apple right

711
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:48,420
now, you'd think they'd be on their messaging game.

712
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:49,420
You'd think they'd be out there.

713
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:52,420
I can't even really tell you the benefits of the 12th gen Intel.

714
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:56,040
I know they're more power efficient, but I can't really articulate them.

715
00:37:56,040 --> 00:38:02,060
I don't know what their reasoning is, or positioning is, or what they claim the use case is for

716
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:03,220
the software defined features.

717
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:04,220
I mean, I've heard some of it.

718
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:08,520
If we didn't follow mailing list news about the kernel, we probably wouldn't even be talking

719
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,520
about this right now.

720
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,700
That's just it, right?

721
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:11,980
It's really weird.

722
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:17,780
I know we have listeners at Intel, and they're not trying to get us the download information

723
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:18,780
or nothing like that.

724
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:24,460
It's like they're just not talking about it, other than the very manufactured bits of information

725
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:25,460
we have gotten so far.

726
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:26,460
Small blurbs and such.

727
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:27,460
Yeah.

728
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:28,460
But we'll follow it.

729
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:30,620
And I think we'll keep reading your feedback on it.

730
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:36,900
So do keep sending it to linuxunplug.com contact because I think it's going to be a big deal,

731
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:37,900
but it's just not there yet.

732
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,660
And I think we have a little bit of time.

733
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:44,100
So I'd love to understand it before it actually arrives.

734
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:47,540
And now it is time for the boost.

735
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:50,860
Now for Chris's favorite part of the show, where he gets to wake up in the morning and

736
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:52,220
read all your boosts.

737
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:56,300
Marcel wrote in again five days ago with 1,969 sats.

738
00:38:56,300 --> 00:39:00,940
Chris, have you figured this one out yet?

739
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:01,940
1969.

740
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,420
Well, the message gives this one away.

741
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:08,140
I was thinking of the year, but actually I picked this number because of the song.

742
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:10,420
Mostly I just like picking random numbers to hear Chris guess.

743
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:11,660
I love making you guess too.

744
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:12,660
I'm down for that actually.

745
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:13,700
I do enjoy it.

746
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:14,700
It's actually-

747
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,700
That's what you get for your boost fee.

748
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:18,320
I do actually like it.

749
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:21,220
I think you might have to guess some more down the line here.

750
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:23,040
Yeah, it looks like it.

751
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,220
We did get a boost in from Koss Peeland.

752
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:30,580
You know, also just aside, Koss has been supporting a lot of podcasting 2.0 compatible that take

753
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:31,580
the boosts.

754
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:36,060
And that's one of the really cool things about this community is sometimes I'm listening

755
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:39,620
to a completely different podcast and a totally different genre.

756
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:42,980
And I hear some of these same names come up and you guys are really the rock stars out

757
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:43,980
there.

758
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:44,980
So thank you so much.

759
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:47,780
So Koss writes in there, thanks for the show and the Seuss adventures.

760
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:50,020
Brent, why don't you give us an update?

761
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:51,140
How did the Seuss stuff go?

762
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:52,900
Did you end up sticking with Seuss?

763
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,100
Did you do something different?

764
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,100
What's the story?

765
00:39:55,100 --> 00:40:00,620
Well, I ended up deciding to keep it on this podcasting appliance laptop that I have here

766
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:04,540
because I'm just curious how it's going to go even more long term.

767
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:09,940
I know that I gave you sort of the six month update or maybe that was more like eight months.

768
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:12,620
And I think we should give it another six months.

769
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:14,220
So far, so good.

770
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:16,660
Things look like they've improved for me.

771
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:19,220
The applications that weren't working are working just fine.

772
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:24,240
There is one little lingering package that hasn't solved itself, but maybe I'll get inspired

773
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,540
and fix that or maybe it'll just vanish.

774
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:27,540
We'll see.

775
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:30,220
Is this the machine I'm seeing you on or is this the machine I'm hearing you on?

776
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:32,500
Yeah, the one right in front of you.

777
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:36,860
So the one I'm hearing you on, though, that is a new Fedora install that's using pipewire

778
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:37,860
now.

779
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:43,680
Yeah, just recently I threw Fedora on there because you almost didn't give me a choice

780
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:50,380
and we wanted to try pipewire in the in our whole audio sort of pipeline.

781
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:52,020
Maybe that's the appropriate way to say it.

782
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:54,100
And so far, it's been working great.

783
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:56,460
We haven't had the hiccups that we've had previously.

784
00:40:56,460 --> 00:41:01,540
I think pulse was just getting tired on my previous install and I think it's going to

785
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:04,100
enable us to do a bunch of really fancy stuff.

786
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:08,140
So I would love to hear from you guys what I should be throwing at really.

787
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:11,940
Well, can I just say that this is one of the things I love about Linux and a lot of times

788
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:15,620
we get pretty worked up about fragmentation and too much choice.

789
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:22,420
But here you were with a pretty solid long time to install and you were having I mean

790
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:27,940
during office hours, I think pulse crashed on you six times in that like two hour stream.

791
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:33,120
You having problems, which, to be fair, was a relatively new behavior, right?

792
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:35,380
Why it was happening, we didn't discover.

793
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:40,900
But I proposed that it was possible because it was a new behavior and because it was happening

794
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:45,280
more and more and more, I thought it was possible this was a hardware issue.

795
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:49,300
And so I said, you know, I just want you to be prepared for you may switch distros and

796
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,940
still have a problem.

797
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:56,340
However, we have been live for three hours and 20 minutes at this point right now and

798
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:59,220
you have not had a single audio server crash, right?

799
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:00,220
Yeah, it's true.

800
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:05,220
There was a moment earlier when you guys just weren't hearing me, but it turns out you had

801
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:07,620
me muted and it wasn't anything on my end.

802
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:11,900
So I got afraid there for a moment, but it turns out everything's fine.

803
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:13,020
It's been really solid.

804
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:20,260
And I you know, we've mentioned this before, pipeline has been sort of a dream of finding

805
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:23,260
stability pretty quickly in a relatively new stack.

806
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:28,740
And this is sort of proof in the pudding feels like we'll we'll see.

807
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:31,620
I'll run it for a few more weeks and really battle test it.

808
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:34,100
But I'm feeling pretty hopeful on this one.

809
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:40,460
B O O S T crimson rabbit boosted in three days ago with 5000 sats.

810
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:44,100
Is there any chance for Chris to come to London?

811
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:46,620
I would donate more sats to the cause.

812
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:47,620
Everyone else should too.

813
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:48,620
Oh, man.

814
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:50,980
We've all been called out by the rabbit over here.

815
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:51,980
So

816
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:52,980
Wow.

817
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:53,980
Yeah.

818
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:54,980
Okay.

819
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:55,980
How do I how do I?

820
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:56,980
Okay.

821
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:57,980
I really want this to happen.

822
00:42:57,980 --> 00:42:58,980
I really do.

823
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:01,120
But I would really like it if if it wasn't just me if it was also you guys.

824
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,700
So there's that that that adds a layer of complexity.

825
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:05,540
I acknowledge.

826
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:09,380
But could you imagine if the three of us can all go to London together how fun that would

827
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:10,380
be?

828
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:11,380
Yeah, that would be fabulous.

829
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,380
Really?

830
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:13,380
Isn't that the way to do it?

831
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:14,380
I've never been.

832
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:15,380
Have you guys been?

833
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:16,380
No.

834
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:17,380
I've had I've had a layover in Heathrow.

835
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:18,380
And that's about it.

836
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:20,140
Yeah, I've been through Heathrow on my way to the Netherlands once.

837
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:22,660
And that's not enough of London.

838
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:25,100
I will admit I've never even been on a flight that long.

839
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:27,540
That is I think I could rock it though, because I just did it.

840
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:30,460
I did a six hour when I went to go visit Alex.

841
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:31,460
Fine, man.

842
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:32,460
Yeah.

843
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:35,020
So I honestly will booze you up.

844
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:36,020
We'll get you some good headphones.

845
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:37,020
You'll be fine.

846
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:39,900
One of my core skill sets is sitting on my ass all day.

847
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:42,260
And like it turns out I can do that in front of a computer.

848
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:43,260
I can do it on an airplane.

849
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:45,980
So you know, like I was good.

850
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:51,580
You know, Chris, the transcontinental airline experience is a whole upgrade compared to

851
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:52,800
this domestic stuff.

852
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:57,300
So I feel I feel like you're in for a treat.

853
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:58,520
I need the experience.

854
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:01,700
Like I feel like that's a box check for sure make Brent meet us here, right?

855
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:03,940
So then we could just like get the whole road to ourselves.

856
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:04,940
Yeah.

857
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:05,940
Oh, yeah.

858
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:06,940
This year is not going to work for me.

859
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:10,060
Just like, you know, costs are super high at the moment.

860
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:13,300
We have a road trip planned for like mid September.

861
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:14,780
We got a couple other things planned.

862
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:17,940
And so like, I budgeted right and I really can't go beyond that this year.

863
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:19,580
I really have to be careful.

864
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:25,260
But I would very, very, very much like to try to make this happen in 2023.

865
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:29,580
And the fact that we're going to have a meet up in August.

866
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:32,540
It's right now it's about 80 people, but I'm sure it'll be 100 by the time the meet

867
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:33,540
early.

868
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:34,540
Yeah.

869
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:35,620
That is great.

870
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:38,760
Because I want to try to do North Carolina more often, too.

871
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:43,180
We went down to North Carolina and I realized we had, you know, 200 person crew down there

872
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:47,360
that is willing to do meet ups with us and they were awesome indeed.

873
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:50,740
So I think we may get that signal from this London meet up too.

874
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:54,840
And then we can kind of start to plan and it's funny, you know, it's one of those things

875
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:57,420
where it just kind of builds incrementally.

876
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:00,860
And a lot of times it starts with the community as far as I know.

877
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:05,220
This started as a conversation in Discord between Alex and self-hosted community members.

878
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:06,220
That's great.

879
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:07,220
It really is.

880
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:11,500
You know, Chris, for this year, are you willing to ship a cardboard cutout of yourself with

881
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:14,780
maybe a Raspberry Pi with a speaker and a microphone?

882
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:15,780
I like that.

883
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:16,780
That's a nice.

884
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:17,780
Good work.

885
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:18,780
I like the whole Raspberry Pi aspect to it.

886
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:20,780
That that would be a fun project for the show.

887
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:21,780
Let's be honest.

888
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:22,780
Come on.

889
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:23,780
A little speaker right in my mouth.

890
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:24,780
I'll just like, you know.

891
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:27,040
I mean, we're about to have one.

892
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,040
That's true.

893
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:29,140
That is true.

894
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:31,240
User seventy four twenty three boosted in.

895
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:33,540
That's usually when they're when it's like a number like that.

896
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:36,420
It's just they haven't set their profile in Fountain.

897
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:37,940
They boosted with a thousand sats.

898
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:41,400
Hey, have you guys checked out the Nix Bitcoin node?

899
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,340
And also you guys are the best, Jimmy.

900
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:45,080
I had no idea this was a thing.

901
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:46,080
Please inform us.

902
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:51,900
I think Wes knows this, but this is how we started talking about Nix again.

903
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:55,860
Wes and I were trying to figure out when to do our next Nix segment.

904
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:57,340
What do you think, Wes?

905
00:45:57,340 --> 00:45:58,340
Five years?

906
00:45:58,340 --> 00:45:59,340
It's been a long time.

907
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:00,940
I mean, four or five years.

908
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:03,700
Yeah, at least we've been trying to figure out when we're going to do Nix.

909
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:06,500
I know it was before the Linux Academy acquisition.

910
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:09,700
Yeah, it's been a really definitely during that time.

911
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:10,700
Yeah.

912
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:11,700
During that time.

913
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:12,700
And now after.

914
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:15,340
And it's like how all this stuff works, right?

915
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:18,100
It's not until you have a project.

916
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:19,100
And you actually try it.

917
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:20,100
It's like Reaper, right?

918
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:21,100
Some stakes on the line.

919
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:22,100
Right.

920
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:23,100
It's like switching audio editors.

921
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:27,220
We couldn't really take Reaper seriously until we had a new project where we could just try

922
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:28,980
starting from scratch in Reaper.

923
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:37,620
Well, this is how I came to Nix is the Bitcoin node stuff, because I am a huge nerd for decentralized

924
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:38,620
computing.

925
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:39,760
Just frickin love it.

926
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:45,320
And they have a really good like Nix Bitcoin node package that you can just get going.

927
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:46,720
And it's solid.

928
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:50,940
And now that I'm really into the boost and all this stuff, I kind of think maybe I should

929
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:52,320
have gone that route.

930
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:55,260
But I ended up going Umbral just because I was trying a bunch of different stuff and

931
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:56,740
Umbral got me going so fast.

932
00:46:56,740 --> 00:46:58,320
That's just what we stuck with.

933
00:46:58,320 --> 00:46:59,320
But it's a pretty cool project.

934
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:00,320
Yeah.

935
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:01,320
You know, you can see something.

936
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:04,980
Maybe if you redid some stuff or wanted a little more robust of a setup or something

937
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:07,640
for the long term, more minimal could be a great option.

938
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:11,980
That's kind of what I think is there probably will be a point, maybe not.

939
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:12,980
Maybe I won't ever need to.

940
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:19,060
But there may be a point where I migrate to a more robust Nix based Bitcoin node, maybe

941
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:23,780
on, you know, more robust hardware and stuff like that, because this is this is running

942
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:30,300
on a older Dell, but it's a really nice high end like Xeon ECC memory, older Dell.

943
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:33,120
And it's running on Ubuntu 20.04.

944
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:34,120
And those are all fine.

945
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:35,120
Right.

946
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:37,940
Those are all fine things, but not really how I would probably do it today.

947
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:39,940
So it's in the back of my mind.

948
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:41,860
I have a follow up question there.

949
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:44,940
I'm curious if you know what it's doing under the hood.

950
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:50,420
Is this some Docker containers, the same kind of ideas Umbral under the hood, or is it just

951
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:51,420
doing it natively?

952
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:52,420
Wes, have you dug into this?

953
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:53,420
That's a great question.

954
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:54,860
No, I haven't actually looked at the implementation.

955
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:58,660
I seem to recall it's Podman when it does use containers.

956
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:01,740
But typically with these next stuff, there's really, you know, the beautiful thing is you

957
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:02,740
don't really need a container.

958
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:03,740
Right.

959
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:04,940
And that was the route I was going.

960
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:10,140
I was really trying to I was I have been thinking more and more about container free infrastructure.

961
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:12,500
And I think that's how I ended up at the next node stuff.

962
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:17,100
Yeah, it does look like a lot of just stuff all packaged up some extra modules and options

963
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:18,100
in here.

964
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:21,620
Well, Brent, I think maybe you'll just have to try it and play with it.

965
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:23,380
I might be the best way to find out.

966
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:24,860
Oh, I saw that coming.

967
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:25,860
I saw that.

968
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:28,420
Sounds like I'll have some extra laptops laying around.

969
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:30,420
I could just throw this on.

970
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:31,420
We'll see.

971
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:32,420
All right.

972
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:36,900
We have a special pick this week because it's a news relevant pick.

973
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:42,220
This is a release, one of those special releases that's been in the works for a year.

974
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:50,140
Jellyfin 10.8.0 has been released, a unusually long development cycle for Jellyfin, a bunch

975
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:51,700
of GPU acceleration stuff.

976
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:52,700
Yeah.

977
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:55,460
I know you've been over there trying to get your personal Jellyfin server upgraded.

978
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:56,460
How'd it go?

979
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:57,460
Just fine.

980
00:48:57,460 --> 00:49:01,060
Back up and operational, pulled down the new Docker image, restarted it.

981
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:03,300
And yeah, now I'm back to watching TV.

982
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:07,580
And it's exciting because a while ago we tried out that new like watch together sync play

983
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:08,580
stuff.

984
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:09,740
That's seen a lot of fixes in this.

985
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:13,860
If you use DLNA, that's got a bunch of nice fixes, all kinds of streaming fixes.

986
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:17,860
And then yeah, as you mentioned, the hardware acceleration story just gets better and better.

987
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:22,060
Plus if you have it like trying to read from like a plain folder setup or you got info

988
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:25,420
files, that's a whole bunch better for parsing and integrating with that better subtitle

989
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:28,500
stuff all around a lot of nice things to see.

990
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,460
And yeah, it shouldn't be a big issue to upgrade.

991
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:32,580
I think you'd probably agree with this statement.

992
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:38,140
So you know, who knows, but I feel like we've reached that inflection point where the trend

993
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:44,340
line on Jellyfin and its rate of improvement is like greater than Plexus, right?

994
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:47,180
And Plexus is kind of on a little bit of the decline.

995
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:52,500
I say that with a lot of respect for Plex, but I think as they try to establish a business

996
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:55,980
model around streaming a little bit more and they have to focus on that stuff, they're

997
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:59,380
never really going to, they're not really going to get any more open, right?

998
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:01,940
They're not going to really get any more focused on your local stuff.

999
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:02,940
Yeah, yeah, you're right.

1000
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:05,700
Like there's definitely still a lot to like about Plex obviously, and there's doing some

1001
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:09,940
things that Jellyfin probably may never be able to compete with it in some regards.

1002
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:15,580
But if you are focused on your local collection, you want free software, Jellyfin has been

1003
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:16,840
getting really nice lately.

1004
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:21,420
So 10.8.0, we'll have a link in the show notes, go check it out.

1005
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:24,740
There's a post in there specifically to highlight all the new features.

1006
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:27,460
I of course saw the GPU stuff and that's what I got excited about.

1007
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:30,000
But I know there's a lot of other things in there too, including just nice performance

1008
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,860
and bug fixes and all that kind of stuff.

1009
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:35,260
Gentlemen, we did it.

1010
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:36,900
This brings us right here to the end.

1011
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:37,900
We did it.

1012
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:38,900
Congratulations guys.

1013
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:40,800
So we just recorded two episodes back to back.

1014
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:46,140
In theory, I'll be back from Montana and we'll have a regular live stream next Sunday.

1015
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:50,180
So I get to actually officially say, see you next week.

1016
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:53,420
Same bat time, same bat station.

1017
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:54,420
That's right.

1018
00:50:54,420 --> 00:51:00,980
JBlive.tv or of course all their live productions now at Jupiter.tube on our own PeerTube instance

1019
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:05,540
in the federated universe where you can use a free software stack to watch your favorite

1020
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:06,540
Linux content.

1021
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:08,280
How great is that?

There's a lot going on every single week.

1027
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:23,100
It's the companion right here and links to what we talked about linuxunplug.com slash

1028
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:25,100
four six three.

1029
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:28,920
Alright everyone, thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode of the unplugged

1030
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:56,220
program and we'll see you right back here next Sunday.

1031
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:10,340
Brian, that was such a great conversation.

1032
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:11,660
Thank you for sharing that with us.

1033
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:12,660
You're welcome.

1034
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:19,000
I think I unfortunately realized when I was listening back that we hardly touched on any

1035
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:23,540
of his deep breadth of, you know, experience because he has so much.

1036
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:27,660
We kind of like picked one or two and then went into these really amazing philosophical

1037
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:32,460
discussions around technology and how humans should interact with technology and stuff.

1038
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:36,280
So I think we should probably have him back for another conversation at some point.

1039
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:37,280
You're probably right.

1040
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:40,860
Although I will say that some of the some of the topics I love on brunch the most.

1041
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:41,860
So sorry.

1042
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:42,860
Now where it's going to go.

1043
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:45,880
Yeah, as far as a brunch chat goes, there's no menu.

1044
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:48,260
It's just whatever the chef feels like cooking that day.

1045
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:50,520
That's right choice.

1046
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:54,380
We should say for sure, like the whole chat going to be worth listening to.

1047
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:58,240
And if the timing works out, I get to listen to it on the way back, I think, right on my

1048
00:52:58,240 --> 00:52:59,240
drive back.

1049
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:00,240
Oh, nice.

1050
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:02,780
Oh, you plan this well for yourself.

1051
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:03,780
Well done.

1052
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:05,820
That'll be that'll be nice.

1053
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:06,820
Yeah.

1054
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:28,100
You can go to brunch.show for that.
