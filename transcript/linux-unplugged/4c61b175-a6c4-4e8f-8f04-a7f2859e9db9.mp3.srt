1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,200
It sounded like you inherited this fancy shaving kit from family.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,160
I got the handle.

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,960
It was my grandmother's dad's.

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:09,960
She was going to toss it out.

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:10,960
She was going to goodwill it.

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,800
And I was like, I'll take that.

7
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,800
And then I bought the, there was a little brush and cup set at Target for like 20 bucks

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,800
or something like that.

9
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:18,800
It was like super cheap.

10
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,800
Awesome.

11
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:20,800
Yeah.

12
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,400
And then the stand I did get on Amazon.

13
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,720
So it all started with the handle.

14
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,440
That does look like a nice weighty handle.

15
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,720
Like it's got a good feel to it, a good heft.

16
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:28,720
And it's long too.

17
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,200
Like a lot of the ones that I've seen online, I've looked at different ones, they're really

18
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,720
short and I like the longer handle.

19
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:34,720
It feels better in my hand.

20
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:35,720
There you go.

21
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,360
Go get yourself a good wet shave before the show starts.

22
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,160
That's making me want a nice stand like that.

23
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,160
That's the piece I'm missing right now.

24
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,240
You need the mug too.

25
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,920
And then of course, is that, what animal hair is that?

26
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:45,920
Cause you got to get, what is it?

27
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,920
Oh, it's probably plastic.

28
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:47,920
Oh, it's not badger hair or something.

29
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,800
I thought like, I thought you had to have like badger hair or something to help.

30
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,800
There's a bunch of different ones.

31
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,200
I didn't buy a good one.

32
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,200
What is it?

33
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,200
It's not badger hair.

34
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,200
Badger the hair of my enemies.

35
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,200
Yeah, they say badger.

36
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,200
Is it?

37
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,200
Oh, okay.

38
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,200
Badger, horse.

39
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,200
There's like badger.

40
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,200
There's horse.

41
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,200
There's like four different kinds.

42
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,600
And then depending on whether you're using a soap or a cream, depends which one you're

43
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,600
supposed to use.

44
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,600
Right.

45
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,440
There's this whole crazy methodology behind it.

46
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,440
Hmm.

47
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,480
Well, maybe I should get in the badger industry.

48
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:33,600
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 235 for February 6th, 2018.

49
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,800
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that is prepared for the atomic

50
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,960
revolution.

51
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,960
My name is Chris.

52
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,960
My name is Wes.

53
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,960
Hello, Wes.

54
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:42,960
Hello.

55
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,660
We have quite the show coming up this week.

56
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:47,920
So we're going to get into a couple of follow-up items from last week right off the top, but

57
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,760
then we'll get into some community news, and then not one, but two different individuals

58
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:57,200
from Project Atomic and Fedora Atomic will be joining us to tell us what is the Atomic

59
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,120
project, what is Fedora's role in all of this, and can I one day run this as the ultimate

60
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,800
development workstation.

61
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,840
I really hope so, because it's pretty cool technology.

62
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,480
We'll talk about that, plus somehow I got a wild bug up my butt again.

63
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:15,340
Last week you heard about it here on the show, and I've, in the span of one week, reloaded

64
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,340
all of my systems.

65
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,340
It's infected everything.

66
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,340
We've launched a new challenge.

67
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:22,400
I've gotten Wes to reload his system, I've gotten Popey to reload his system, and a whole

68
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:30,040
crew of people are trying out KDE Neon as the new release of Plasma 5.12 releases today.

69
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:35,680
It's a new LTS of the Plasma desktop, and it's better than ever, and a huge number of

70
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,380
us have been trying it out, and we're kicking it off this week and inviting you to participate

71
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,380
with us.

72
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:43,440
We'll give you the details, give you a little status update and how it's going, and all

73
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,600
of that, that's coming up towards the end of the show, plus our friends over at Elementary

74
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:52,300
OS are trying something big in their app center that we've talked a lot about, and Wimpy's

75
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:57,320
here to tell us about something very exciting coming to the 1804 version of Ubuntu Mate,

76
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:02,400
which is gonna be really good stuff, and Wes, on top of all of that, we have our standard

77
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,920
community updates.

78
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,000
Holy smokes, huge show this week, so let's kick it off by bringing in the Mumble Room

79
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,380
time appropriate greetings, time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room, hello virtual lug,

80
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,760
it is good to have you guys.

81
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,760
There it is.

82
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,760
Hello.

83
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,760
Hey.

84
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,840
Oh, I love that sound.

85
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:23,260
Back in the studio again, Popey Wimpy, how are you guys doing, you all right, you over

86
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,260
the jet lag?

87
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,260
You doing okay?

88
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,260
Yawn.

89
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:29,160
Sounds about right.

90
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:35,120
Yeah, well, I guess sort of just to pick up really, just really quick off the top of the

91
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:42,240
show here from last week's episode, episode 234, we were live from the canonical January

92
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:47,240
Snap Sprint down at the Hilton in Seattle, and the big news kinda out of that event that

93
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:54,040
came out just recently is Skype announced shortly after our show that they are packaging

94
00:03:54,040 --> 00:04:00,120
up the Skype application for Linux as a Snap, which is huge news, and that was part of the

95
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,680
work that was conducted there, and I think we're gonna be hearing more coming from that

96
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,560
whole channel too, so that's sort of big, it's good, you know, I went over and reviewed

97
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,880
my audio, I got a couple of secret things that I'll just release here and there, I'll

98
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,480
link it to the media, you know, no, I'm just kidding.

99
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,880
It was a good event, and man, you guys really work hard at those things.

100
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,680
That felt like that was a real serious work session because here's something that you

101
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,300
can tell when people are seriously working is when the end of the day is scheduled every

102
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:31,920
day at 6 PM and people aren't walking out of the room until 6.15, 6.20, or even later,

103
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:36,680
you guys really, I mean, down to the, down to the, every hour just working to the grindstone,

104
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:40,280
so it was interesting to see you guys in your natural habitat, it was good to see you there,

105
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,280
and I'm glad to hear you're making it.

106
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,280
So stay around.

107
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,280
That's a good reason for that though, Chris.

108
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,280
Yep.

109
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,280
We enjoy doing it, that's why.

110
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,280
Oh, Popey.

111
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,280
That's the best.

112
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,680
And you know what, I enjoy getting an opportunity to hang out with you guys, so I'm always happy.

113
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,680
Heck yeah.

114
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,680
It was great pizza, yeah.

115
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,200
You know what I learned?

116
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:59,160
I didn't know this, but our friends from across the pond taught me, and you were there, I

117
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,000
didn't know, did you know this before we had dinner with them, that they don't have the

118
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
greatest pizza over there?

119
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,160
I had no idea.

120
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:09,440
So we took them to America's fastest growing pizza, fast, fast, fast, mod pizza, which

121
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,420
apparently was the first mod pizza, and I guess they said something crazy, like they're

122
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:18,120
opening up 500 stores a month, which sounds impossible, and so we took Popey and Wimpy

123
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:22,440
over there and had pizza with them, and Popey said, this is pretty good pizza, and we all

124
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,360
kind of look at each other like, this is fast food pizza?

125
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,320
And my first thought is, oh Popey, I could show you a world of pizza, I could just swoop

126
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,760
you away from Seattle and show you a world of pizza.

127
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:37,480
Actually I went back in there and the girl behind the camera said, hey, are you English?

128
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,900
And I said, yes, I am.

129
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:42,600
And she said, did you know we've got these restaurants in the UK?

130
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,880
And she listed all the cities where they have them, so I'm going to make it a mission to

131
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,360
go and find them in the UK as well.

132
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,360
That's great news.

133
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,360
That does make sense.

134
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,360
I can show you the world.

135
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,360
Yeah, exactly.

136
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,720
That was a lot of fun.

137
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,920
And that's sometimes where the best conversations happen, really, is when you're just sitting

138
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,360
around talking about stuff.

139
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,520
I wanted to also just do a quick update on a project that I personally love to follow

140
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:10,360
because as a longtime desktop Linux user, one of the projects that makes Linux feel

141
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:17,120
like a first class citizen is the firmware update project, the LVFS project.

142
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:23,200
And when I'm on my XPS 13 and I get microcode updates and firmware updates coming through

143
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,480
GNOME software, I tell you what.

144
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,480
It feels first class.

145
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,480
It's beautiful.

146
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:33,760
And so we actually have some really interesting data from the Linux vendor firmware project

147
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,080
because they've recently been introducing telemetry, which I'll tell you more about

148
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,120
here in a moment.

149
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,120
Don't freak out.

150
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,120
It's not that bad.

151
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,240
But we now have an interesting nugget of information.

152
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:48,180
The Linux vendor firmware project has shipped nearly 1.2 million firmware updates out to

153
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:51,000
Linux users since they started the project.

154
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,720
1.2 million firmware updates that in the past you may have had to reboot into DOS, a free

155
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,560
DOS or Windows to make that happen.

156
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,160
Remarkable.

157
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,480
This is a remarkable achievement.

158
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,640
Just that right there deserves a moment of recognition.

159
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,240
I want to talk about the telemetry just so you guys are aware of what's going on.

160
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,200
I have more information linked in the show notes.

161
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,200
But here are some key points.

162
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:14,520
They're not sharing your IP address with any vendors, not even saved in their database.

163
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,120
They generate a machine ID.

164
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:20,600
It's a salted hash of your actual Etsy machine dash ID.

165
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,560
And so then they store it based on hash off of that.

166
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:28,220
LVFS doesn't store reports for firmware that it didn't sign itself.

167
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:32,360
So if you've been locally building firmwares, you're trying to hack something, you're trying

168
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:36,960
to mod something, it completely ignores that and does not ever report it up to the vendor.

169
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:43,360
You can also disable all of the telemetry reporting functionality by editing the fwupdremotes.dcomp

170
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,360
files.

171
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,800
And they've documented all of this.

172
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,800
It's all kind of a...

173
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,120
It's in the early stages, but it seems pretty sane.

174
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:54,200
It seems like a good mix of giving the vendors metrics that they need without compromising

175
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,680
people's identities.

176
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,720
And I really like the part where it ignores like local stuff that you've been building

177
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,720
yourself.

178
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:03,120
It seems like they put thought into that from the get-go, and that should make it a lot

179
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,120
more successful.

180
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,120
Yeah.

181
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,120
Yeah.

182
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:11,600
And I used this when I was in Seattle last week with my Dell XPS 15.

183
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,600
Oh, really?

184
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,600
Nice.

185
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,600
Yeah.

186
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:23,600
And it's a simple thing, but it's very satisfying when you just say fwmgr update, and it says,

187
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,100
oh, there are these six firmware updates that need to be applied to your machine.

188
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:33,760
And it says, right, queued, and the next reboot, you just watch your firmware update, and off

189
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,760
you go.

190
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:39,600
And this updated things in the past, I've had to install Windows and other things in

191
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,040
order to install these updates.

192
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,700
So this was just wonderful.

193
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,760
And you were doing that with the command line?

194
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,760
Yeah.

195
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,760
Yeah.

196
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:52,000
I think it's fwupdate manager or something, and just it did it all for me.

197
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
It was brilliant.

198
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Nice.

199
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
That is really great.

200
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
We have the world of tomorrow.

201
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Don't even need.

202
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,240
I figured I knew there must have been a way to do it outside of GNOME software, but I'd

203
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,200
never done it outside of GNOME software.

204
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,640
Because also the nice thing about GNOME software is that it exposes the fact that they're even

205
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,640
available.

206
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,640
I don't even think to check.

207
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,640
Right.

208
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,120
Unless I know about Meltdown and Spectre, then I think to check.

209
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,900
All right, Wes, I want to play a game with you.

210
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,640
Let's see if you can guess the release I'm talking about.

211
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,440
I'm going to give you a few hints and you try to name it.

212
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,440
Okay?

213
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,440
Okay.

214
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,440
All right.

215
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,960
So your first hint is, it's the latest update in their continuous innovation stream that

216
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,640
delivers many new features and enhancements to secure data.

217
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,640
Okay, that's hint number one.

218
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,080
That's pretty broad, though, so I'll give you another one.

219
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,880
Is it Windows Server, maybe?

220
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,360
Okay, here's your next hint, okay?

221
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,640
It's engineered for security at the entry level, allowing you to spend time innovating

222
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,120
while reducing risk.

223
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,160
I do hate risks, so I'm intrigued.

224
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,840
Yeah, and you do love to innovate.

225
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,840
Of course I do.

226
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:49,200
It has new sandboxing capabilities that allow you to control exactly what applications can

227
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,320
see.

228
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,640
It ships with the GNOME desktop as default.

229
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,360
The GNOME desktop, you say?

230
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,360
Mm-hmm.

231
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,360
Am I narrowing this down at all enough for you?

232
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,360
A little bit.

233
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:02,160
Okay, it has support for ZFS.

234
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,640
Not Open ZFS, but ZFS.

235
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,640
That's your big hint right there.

236
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,640
This can't be.

237
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,640
I thought it was dead.

238
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,000
No, Wes, it's true.

239
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
It's true.

240
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Solaris lives.

241
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,520
Oracle Solaris 11.4 Open Beta has been released.

242
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,520
Celebrate, everybody!

243
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,520
Woo-hoo!

244
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,520
Yeah, that's right.

245
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,520
It's here.

246
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,520
Solaris 11.4 is here.

247
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,920
You can go grab it right now.

248
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:25,440
It runs on Spark architectures as well, which who doesn't want that, right?

249
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,120
Everybody wants that.

250
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,400
Yeah, check it out.

251
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,400
Check it out.

252
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:36,240
Dusty, you might want to check your MumbleTalk key, because it's triggering every now and

253
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,680
then, like when you're typing or something, heads up on that.

254
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,160
Oh, it looks like they got Go now.

255
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,160
They got Golang.

256
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,160
Yeah.

257
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,160
That's exciting news.

258
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:46,560
Anybody in the MumbleRoom have any interest in trying this out?

259
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,720
Nobody does, right?

260
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,720
Nobody does.

261
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,000
It's adorable that Oracle's still shipping this, though.

262
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,280
I really like it, and it's nice to know that some people that have had some jobs still

263
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,280
have some jobs.

264
00:10:55,280 --> 00:11:01,000
That stuff's really nice, but to hear Oracle pitch this, it's like, I don't know, engineered

265
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,560
for security at every level, because nothing else is, allowing you to spend time innovating

266
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,760
while reducing risk.

267
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,760
Okay.

268
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,760
I'm looking forward to that.

269
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,240
I'll get right on top of that.

270
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:17,360
Anyways, I make fun, but it is sort of amazing to see, like Wes was saying, it's almost unbelievable

271
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,640
that Solaris continues to chug on.

272
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:23,240
Solaris Open Beta has been released, and you can go get an ISO of it.

273
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,280
When you go try to download it, the first thing, it's obviously just a cloud pitch,

274
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,280
right?

275
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,640
Streamline your journey to the cloud.

276
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,480
No, let's try this.

277
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,480
You're right.

278
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,480
Oh, no.

279
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,800
This is, okay, okay.

280
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:38,800
So the, oh, so they're also offering you to spin it up on the Oracle cloud.

281
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,800
Interesting.

282
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,240
And then you can download the USB installer, which is 1.1 gigs.

283
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,840
Oh, I have to first accept the license agreement for it.

284
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,840
Well, come on.

285
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,840
I mean, what website are you at here, Chris?

286
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,840
There you go.

287
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,840
Good old Oracle.

288
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,600
That and unbreakable Linux.

289
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,920
They're unstoppable these days.

290
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,480
They're just unstoppable.

291
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,460
So Red Hat actually is a bit unstoppable.

292
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:01,640
We're going to talk a lot about Red Hat today, so let's kick it off with something that's

293
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,640
kind of neat.

294
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,160
I think it was Alex that pinged me about this.

295
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:09,520
This is an initiative that Red Hat's taking to the community to help design the next Red

296
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,520
Hat logo.

297
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,520
Oh.

298
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:16,000
Yeah, they're essentially taking input from everybody, and it's funny to hear them talk

299
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
about this.

300
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
They say, we need your ideas.

301
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,660
The more feedback we get, the more likely we are to make the best decision.

302
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:28,000
And it's sort of, they talk about how their icon, how their logo sucks as an icon is one

303
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,520
of the things they really don't like about it.

304
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,520
Really?

305
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:35,840
It's a 17 years is a long time for a logo, and when we made this logo, we weren't really

306
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,240
thinking about what it was going to be used for.

307
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,680
We were like sort of secret agents of change, but that's kind of different now, and it does

308
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,680
suck as an icon.

309
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,640
Anyways, I think they're early in the stages, so I wanted to let you guys know about it

310
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,640
right now.

311
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,320
You know, I know we do have a few graphic artists in the audience that might actually

312
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,400
care about this, so you'll find a link in the show notes.

313
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:58,040
Go to Jupiterbroadcasting.com, look for Linux Unplugged 235, or just go to redhat.com and

314
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,080
look around on the About Red Hat section of the site.

315
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,520
That's where they have this going on.

316
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,520
Neat idea.

317
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,520
It is a neat idea.

318
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,240
And it's a change of pace from Red Hat on this kind of stuff.

319
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,280
I don't think I've ever seen them do something like this before.

320
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,680
Interesting community aspect.

321
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,440
We do have much to get into.

322
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:16,040
We have two gentlemen from Red Hat here today to talk to us about Project Atomic, which

323
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:21,880
we've got into a little bit on the show before, but I recently had a change of framing for

324
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:26,720
Project Atomic, and I went from thinking about it as a way to deploy Fedora on servers, and

325
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:33,160
I went to thinking, well, what about a bulletproof workstation, which is actually a bigger project

326
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:38,200
that I'm working on, and a bigger topic that we're actually going to get into today is

327
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:44,760
I'm still working towards the most reliable, bulletproof, as close to appliance, assuming

328
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,040
the hardware is functional.

329
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,680
I would like the software to be as close to reliable, immutable infrastructure, as they

330
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,680
say.

331
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,360
I want an immutable workstation, Wes.

332
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:58,800
And we'll pick Dusty and Ian's brain here in a moment and see if that's possible.

333
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,040
But before we go any further, let's start right now by thanking Ting for making this

334
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,320
here show possible.

335
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,660
Now years into it, I've never been a happier Ting customer.

336
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,800
Start by going to linux.ting.com.

337
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,040
Ting is mobile that makes sense.

338
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,040
Here's what's great about it.

339
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,720
You only pay for what you use.

340
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,280
So if you don't use the phone a lot, or you don't use a ton of data, or you don't send

341
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:19,140
text messages, you don't pay for that functionality.

342
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:25,080
I do everything either over, well, almost everything over Telegram and a couple of other

343
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,380
messaging services.

344
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:30,920
The only thing I use text messages for is when I log into Twitter and they two-factor

345
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,720
me over SMS.

346
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,160
So like why pay for 300 text messages when I maybe use three a month?

347
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,160
There's no reason.

348
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,400
There's just no, except that you pretty much every other carrier, you just have to.

349
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,400
You just have to.

350
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,400
Ting is different.

351
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,960
It's a fair price for however much you talk, text, and data you use.

352
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:52,680
With nationwide coverage, GSM and CDMA, no contracts, no quote unquote agreements, nothing

353
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,680
like that.

354
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,160
And they have a beautiful control panel to let you control all of it.

355
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,540
You check your usage, take complete control of your account, turn services on and off.

356
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:04,340
They have great devices you can buy directly or bring your own.

357
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,040
And it is Ting's birthday right now.

358
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,040
So what else?

359
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,040
They're doing a giveaway.

360
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:12,440
The first hundred Ting customers are getting a shirt just automatically, but you still

361
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,300
have a chance, even if you just recently become a Ting customer, or maybe you're not even

362
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:19,160
one yet, to get in and get some free Ting swag.

363
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,080
Start by going to linux.ting.com.

364
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:25,440
That gives you the $25 discount on service or off a device, and it lets them know you

365
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,440
heard about it here.

366
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,640
And then you can browse over the blog, check them out.

367
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,700
There's some really incredible devices.

368
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:35,960
They have the full range of Moto devices that are almost just vanilla Android with a couple

369
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:42,320
of improvements, and then big batteries, expandable storage, multi-network chipsets.

370
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,640
It's really great value for the Motorola devices.

371
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,800
You can buy them directly from Ting.

372
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,980
Buy any device from Ting or bring your own.

373
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,920
Just get started by going to linux.ting.com.

374
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,580
They have a savings calculator.

375
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:55,520
You can plug your information in there, see how much you would save, and see if it's a

376
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,520
great fit.

377
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:00,640
And something tells me it probably is, linux.ting.com.

378
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,640
Big thanks to Ting for sponsoring the show, linux.ting.com.

379
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:08,980
Well, I want to say a big welcome to Dusty and Ian from the show.

380
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,460
We've been planning this for a little while.

381
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:12,840
You guys are pretty busy traveling the world.

382
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:18,320
I would imagine preaching the good news about Project Atomic and whatnot.

383
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,520
So guys, welcome to the show.

384
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,520
Thanks for making it.

385
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,920
I really appreciate it.

386
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:23,920
Thanks for having us.

387
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,920
Indeed, thank you.

388
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:29,740
Now, I've roughly talked about Project Atomic on the show before, and I kind of feel like

389
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:34,520
before we get into Fedora Atomic, it would be sort of great to just sort of establish

390
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:39,760
what Project Atomic it is, what it is itself, because I think that's kind of like essential

391
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,960
first bits of information.

392
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:46,280
Dusty, do you want to take that to sort of the elevator pitch on Project Atomic and what

393
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,560
problem it solves?

394
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,720
Yeah, I can try to do that.

395
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:54,360
So Project Atomic is essentially, it's like an umbrella project for a lot of different

396
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:59,360
technologies related to next generation container technology.

397
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:04,980
So for example, Atomic Host, which is kind of what we're here to talk about today, was

398
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:07,620
one of the first initiatives out of that.

399
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:13,680
Some of the changes that we've made to Docker live in upstream repos under Project Atomic.

400
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:17,840
Pretty much any discussion that we have related to things that we want to do in the container

401
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:21,920
landscape go on under that umbrella upstream.

402
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,920
Okay.

403
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:29,120
And so the key phrase you said in there was the host aspect of Project Atomic, and that

404
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:35,140
is essentially either Fedora or CentOS or perhaps, correct me if I'm wrong, but maybe

405
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:40,240
even Red Hat Enterprise Linux itself, there are atomic versions of those different Linux

406
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,240
distributions?

407
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,240
That's correct.

408
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:47,120
Yeah, we have Fedora Atomic Host, which is something that we build continuously pretty

409
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,160
much but we only deliver every two weeks.

410
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,720
We don't believe that people want an update every night.

411
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,580
However, if they do want an update every night, they can access those if they want them.

412
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:02,080
We also have Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host, which is something that we build from

413
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,960
rel bits and deliver every six weeks.

414
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,320
And there's also the CentOS Atomic Host, which follows from that.

415
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,320
Okay.

416
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,320
All right.

417
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,320
So that's all pretty understandable.

418
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:17,980
And am I correct in my understanding that one of the core benefits of an atomic host

419
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:25,040
is that the host itself, the core OS is updated via like OS tree snapshots, which is essentially

420
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:28,520
sort of disconnected from the data and the containers that might be running on the host.

421
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:34,640
So you can you can update your host operating system via OS tree and then it just reboots

422
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,600
and then reconnects to the containers and the applications of the data move on like

423
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,760
nothing changed, correct?

424
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,760
That's right.

425
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:41,760
Yeah.

426
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:46,480
So for example, the user file system is read only and there are two file systems that are

427
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,020
read write.

428
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:51,560
One of them is the slash etc or slash etc directory.

429
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:57,740
So that's read write and it's also tracked, which means that whenever you want to go back

430
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:03,320
to the previous deployment, say you do an upgrade and you don't like it, it also means

431
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:09,920
that all of your configuration data in Etsy gets reverted back to that state from before.

432
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:15,800
So the rollbacks are a big part of this and is it all or nothing type of rollback?

433
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:24,120
So mostly at least for the data that's delivered in the OS tree that gets rolled back and then

434
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:30,360
anything in Etsy gets rolled back, but slash var that that stays the same.

435
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,360
Okay.

436
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:35,600
And the other thing that sort of jumps out at me about this is you guys in the slides

437
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,680
that you sent me, you sort of go out of your way to say this is not a disk image.

438
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,200
This is a tree.

439
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:44,520
What's the difference and what's the benefit between shipping your base image of your OS

440
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:47,800
as an image versus a OS tree?

441
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:53,820
So there are some trade offs, but more or less OS trees kind of like a file system layer

442
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,400
technology.

443
00:19:55,400 --> 00:20:00,160
So it knows about all of the different files that are at a part of the tree, which also

444
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:08,240
means that it can dedupe any files that are common between say one update to the next.

445
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:14,800
And it also knows about all of the packages that are included in the tree.

446
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:18,920
So it's kind of a little bit of a higher level.

447
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,960
Is that using RPM to keep track of the packages?

448
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:22,960
It does.

449
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,440
It uses RPM to keep track of the packages.

450
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:29,600
And we kind of decided to do that more or less because it was a natural flow from what

451
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,600
we already do.

452
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:35,080
It complements kind of what's going on in Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

453
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:38,880
We can just pick up what's going on there, all the hard work that's going in there and

454
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,440
just build it a different way.

455
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,440
Okay.

456
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,440
Fair enough.

457
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:50,240
And I would imagine in a Fedora atomic host or a CentOS atomic host, my base atomic system

458
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,640
is probably pretty minimal.

459
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:57,760
I'm not installing MySQL and Apache on the atomic host, I'm loading that into containers.

460
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:02,920
So it's a simpler system in a sense to update and manage, correct?

461
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,920
That's right.

462
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:09,240
So typically we do want people to use containers for their application software.

463
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:15,760
However, we have added some technology later from when we first came out with atomic host

464
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:20,980
to enable people to package layer things, which essentially means they can install RPMs

465
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,720
if they want to.

466
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,800
But generally what we prefer people to do is only package layer things that are hard

467
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,400
to containerize.

468
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:34,240
Like for example, if you want like a system daemon running on your system, like for example

469
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:40,520
Firewall D or any really low level thing that would be hard to containerize because it would

470
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:45,640
have to be like a really privileged container or access parts of the host operating system.

471
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:49,040
We prefer that you probably package layer that.

472
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:54,200
But like anything that's really easy to containerize, like an Apache daemon or a database or something

473
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:58,040
like that, we would much rather you pull that from a registry.

474
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,040
Awesome.

475
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,920
That makes it actually, that just seems like the way of the future too.

476
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:05,720
Ian, honestly, if I've glossed over anything that you think we should touch on, feel free

477
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,720
to jump in.

478
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,160
I'm kind of new to all of this, so I'm likely to miss something and you are welcome to catch

479
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,160
me.

480
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,520
But I did have a kind of a clarification question.

481
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:18,560
I'm not sure who might be the better person to ask, but just so I can conceptualize it,

482
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:23,120
as an old sysadmin, what does it look like, say I want to go from Fedora, and I'm probably

483
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:30,940
getting the vernacular wrong, but say I want to go from an atomic Fedora host 26 to 27,

484
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,760
what functionally do I do?

485
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:39,780
What do I have to actually functionally do to bring a Fedora atomic 26 to 27?

486
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:43,160
So I'll take that one.

487
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:47,200
Essentially what we have right now is, I don't know if I actually mentioned this before,

488
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:53,520
but I like to pitch the technology behind atomic host and atomic host itself as like

489
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,600
Git for your operating system.

490
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:02,600
So essentially what you have whenever you create a new OS tree commit is you feed it

491
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:08,440
a list of RPMs and maybe some scripts to run, and it basically creates a new repo for you

492
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:13,120
that's like a Git repo, but with just all the files hashed and compressed and everything.

493
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:17,360
Oh, okay, is that something that Fedora Project does for each release?

494
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:22,760
Yes, so every time we get new package updates, we essentially make a new commit in the server

495
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:30,480
repository and that can be served over just plain HTTP slash HTTPS.

496
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:38,320
But to answer your question, so right now for Fedora 26, we have one repo that's like

497
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:42,160
a Git repo, and for Fedora 27, we have a different one.

498
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:46,080
So essentially what you would do if you want to move from one to the other is you just

499
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:51,960
run a RPM OS tree rebase command that will rebase from one of the upstream repos to the

500
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:52,960
other one.

501
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,840
It'll pull in all the new software and you're off to the races.

502
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,680
Ah, the rebase command, I see.

503
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,680
Fascinating.

504
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:07,840
And is there any discussion right now of how frequently atomic users are expected to upgrade

505
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,840
to the next release?

506
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:13,920
I know 27 came out for atomic, came out like November-ish, right?

507
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:18,160
Which was after the official 27 release, the standard 27 release, is there an expectation

508
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:21,840
that users do an immediate upgrade or how does that work?

509
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,280
How do you decide how long something like that gets supported?

510
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:28,620
I'm sure it'll be different for each project, but in regards of Fedora, how does that work?

511
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:35,460
So in Fedora, obviously we're trying to minimize the maintenance burden there.

512
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:40,600
So since we actually do a decent amount of testing on each one of the releases that we

513
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:45,040
do, we've tried to automate that as much as possible and we're getting better about that.

514
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:48,960
But we've tried to focus on just the latest release.

515
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:54,960
So for example, because we're doing testing, we really recommend people to update as soon

516
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,120
as possible.

517
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:03,080
And Fedora 27 Atomic Coast did ship at the same time Fedora 27 did, which is good.

518
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:08,840
But if somebody wanted to stay on Fedora 26, we essentially have something we call life

519
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:14,720
support, which basically means all of the automated building and testing still happens.

520
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,240
It's just not necessarily our priority to get it fixed.

521
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,160
So Fedora 27 is our priority right now.

522
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:28,400
And that seems like a much more manageable position for administrators to be in when

523
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:36,300
your data is isolated off, your applications are in containers, and the updates are transactional.

524
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:40,520
So the risk of upgrading, it's a totally different set of risks than it used to be.

525
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,520
It's a whole new beast.

526
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,520
It's not the same.

527
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:45,060
It's not your dad's Fedora upgrade.

528
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,060
It's a whole new thing.

529
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,060
So what's the downside?

530
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,360
Because it can't all be rainbows, right?

531
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:54,280
There has to be things that are not as flexible or things that perhaps maybe might make it

532
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:57,000
not as ideal for certain types of use cases.

533
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,760
Right.

534
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:04,120
So there are definitely corner cases that are tricky for us right now.

535
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:11,600
We try to support pretty much being able to package layer every RPM that exists, but obviously

536
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:16,840
there are corner cases where, for example, an RPM might install something into slash

537
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,060
opt.

538
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:22,820
And by default, we kind of want that to be a writable file system so that people can

539
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:25,880
put software there if they want to.

540
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:32,400
So if we have a particular directory that's covered under the tree, we want to make sure

541
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,480
that that's read only.

542
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:42,560
So there are small issues that we're tracking down and trying to make fully compatible.

543
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:47,380
But it's one of those things that takes a little bit of getting used to, but as soon

544
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:53,200
as you are in a world where you've got most things containerized, this type of operating

545
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,400
system really makes sense.

546
00:26:55,400 --> 00:27:01,980
And to me, the most valuable thing is the fact that you can essentially look at the

547
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:09,240
status on Atomic Host and you can see exactly what commit and corresponding version you're

548
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,920
booted into.

549
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:14,540
And you can go and say, hey, I'm seeing this bug.

550
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:16,280
Can you guys reproduce this?

551
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:21,600
And somebody can go deploy that exact commit and version and see if they have the same

552
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,600
problem.

553
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:28,160
And that also means that we essentially have a base operating system that is a base test

554
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:31,280
line for CI in the future.

555
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,280
Okay.

556
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,960
Boy, that is a great point about being able to go to that specific version.

557
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:39,760
I was messing around with it a little bit and I couldn't actually quite grok how it

558
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:43,760
would work as a workstation, but people have been suggesting this to me.

559
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,920
I've been getting emails into the show where people have said it's early days, but have

560
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:51,240
you considered an Atomic Fedora workstation?

561
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:56,760
Is this possible in this setup where applications are containerized and the base OS is supposed

562
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,760
to be minimal?

563
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:02,760
Is that even a possibility or is that somewhere where Fedora could go someday?

564
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:06,960
I've seen the Fedora, I think there's an Atomic workstation testing image, correct?

565
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:07,960
Yeah.

566
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:14,160
So it's actually, sorry, it's something that's been around for a while, but it's been something

567
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:17,580
that's kind of been a real side project for a while.

568
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:23,120
For a long time, it wasn't necessarily getting proper updates because something would break.

569
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:27,760
But now with Fedora 27, we officially came out and said, hey, we're going to ship updates

570
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,840
every night.

571
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:34,520
And so it's something that people can try out as a daily driver if they want to.

572
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,080
It's still a little rough around the edges.

573
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:41,480
For example, some of the integrations with GNOME software, for example, package layering

574
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,800
packages don't exist.

575
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:48,920
However, for flat packs, GNOME software does have integration for that.

576
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:54,560
So anything that you want to install as a flat pack works great on Atomic workstation.

577
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,960
We also just put out a blog post today.

578
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:02,840
I linked to it in the IRC channel about Atomic workstation.

579
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:09,160
And so if we want to link that to users that are listening today, they can check it out.

580
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:12,080
You might be able to give it a spin and see what you think.

581
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,480
So yeah, we're interested in having more people use it.

582
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:20,400
It uses the same underlying technology as Atomic host, which basically means the more

583
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:24,140
people we get hammering on it and using it, the better it'll be over time.

584
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:26,120
Are the applications containerized?

585
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:29,120
Are they part of the base OS tree?

586
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,020
How does it work with the workstation?

587
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:36,520
So with the workstation, it's essentially a different set of packages from Atomic host.

588
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:40,480
So it's basically like Atomic host plus plus, right?

589
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:46,380
So it's got Firefox installed as an RPM by default in the base OS tree, right?

590
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:48,480
So that's delivered with the tree.

591
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,400
It's got your full desktop environment that you might want.

592
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:58,920
So it's basically Atomic host, but with extra RPMs on top that somebody would want on their

593
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,920
laptop.

594
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,920
Okay.

595
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:07,280
And the intention is so far when 28 comes out to have a release of Atomic workstation

596
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,800
28?

597
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,800
That's right.

598
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:13,040
Being able to rebase just the same.

599
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,520
That's exciting.

600
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:22,000
Do you feel like that this maybe puts Fedora back into a different category that traditionally

601
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:29,280
CentOS and Ubuntu LTSs and distributions that had multi-year support cycles tended to hold?

602
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:33,440
Because I would tell you, when you combine what you guys are working on with Project

603
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:40,840
Atomic and cockpit and the server and cloud spins of Fedora that are super simple to spin

604
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:45,560
up on a digital ocean droplet and then you load cockpit on top of that and in minutes

605
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:49,680
you've got a graphical management system to Docker images where you're loading up Next

606
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,880
Cloud and BitTorrent sync like nobody's business.

607
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,880
I've done it.

608
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:54,880
It's amazing.

609
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:59,720
And the only thing that stops me is I know in about eight months or so I'm going to be

610
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:05,460
upgrading that sucker to the next release of Fedora and even though for the last three

611
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:07,840
or four releases it's been solid, it still gives me pause.

612
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:12,560
I just want to set it and forget it like a toaster oven.

613
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,720
Is that the intention with Atomic?

614
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,360
Yeah, I believe so.

615
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:24,320
People have always approached upgrades with pause for good reason and this transactional

616
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,880
based approach will obviously help us do that.

617
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:33,260
Another thing is if you're not necessarily on the workstation, if you have maybe some

618
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:41,400
servers that you don't want to keep down for very long, the way it works for the updates

619
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,080
are they kind of get pulled down in the background, right?

620
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:50,880
So none of the software gets updated and is in a half updated state at any point and then

621
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,580
on reboot you're basically into the new system.

622
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:57,600
That would maybe be the only downside really is that you have to do the reboot to switch

623
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,600
over.

624
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,200
Yep, that's true.

625
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:08,480
It's something that we've actually considered how we could possibly work around that fact.

626
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:14,640
There are parts for example now when you package layer by default you need to reboot to get

627
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:21,760
into the new tree but we have an experimental live FS feature which basically says if I've

628
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:27,260
only installed new software then there's no chance that any software that exists is in

629
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:31,440
a half-upgraded state so I'll just go ahead and apply that live to the tree, right?

630
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,440
That's clever.

631
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,440
Okay.

632
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,440
Kind of bridged the gap a little bit there.

633
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,000
It's interesting trying to do that between the, you know, it seems like a lot of that

634
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,060
would work super well on the server side of things where you have maybe perhaps more automation

635
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:44,600
and things and then trying to bridge that to the desktop world.

636
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,600
Right.

637
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,880
Yeah, needless to say I work with some really smart people.

638
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:48,880
I'm very lucky.

639
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:55,900
Well, I've been really kind of pondering where this is going because it seems like a really

640
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:58,920
solid solution but what's next?

641
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:05,480
What's next for Project Atomic and maybe specifically what's next for Fedora users?

642
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:08,680
So I think what's next for Project Atomic.

643
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:13,560
Obviously we have a lot of those corner cases that I mentioned before.

644
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:16,840
Live FS is still experimental.

645
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:25,800
There is actually a proposal by Colin who wrote OS tree and RPM OS tree to offer a different

646
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,200
method for distribution.

647
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:32,120
So for example, there are a decent number of people who mirror everything around in

648
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:37,300
their infrastructures via like using RPMs, right?

649
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:40,560
We've kind of got them in this model where all they need to do to deliver software is

650
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,960
deliver RPMs everywhere, mirror those around.

651
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:47,520
And then obviously now container images as well, right?

652
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:50,080
So they've got RPMs to deal with.

653
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,780
They've got container images to deal with.

654
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:57,420
They don't need a third artifact to move around, which is OS trees, right?

655
00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:04,400
So there's a new effort by Colin to try to basically ship or transport part of this OS

656
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:10,800
tree in an RPM too as just an alternative way to get it around and mirror things like

657
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:16,640
for example, if you're in an environment that's not connected to the internet or something.

658
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:17,640
That makes sense.

659
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:20,720
I guess really, you know, I'm sure the Mumble Room may have some questions.

660
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:24,280
So Mumble Room, if anybody has anything, just ping me in Discord if you want to ask.

661
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:29,840
I guess sort of in the news, I would ask, what do you think the main contrast between

662
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:34,680
Core OS's implementation for transactional updates and Project Atomic?

663
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:39,600
As somebody who's just sort of aware that they both have a solution, can you clarify

664
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,560
what the differences are for me?

665
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,560
Yeah.

666
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:51,760
Yeah, so I think at the highest level, what Core OS uses for container Linux is the update

667
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,760
engine technology from Chrome OS.

668
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,760
Oh, okay.

669
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,760
That's right.

670
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,760
Yeah, that's right.

671
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:03,080
Yeah, that's basically like a block device level approach, whereas this is more of like

672
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,200
a file system level approach.

673
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,200
And there's benefits and negatives to each one.

674
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,200
That's right.

675
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,760
I forgot about that.

676
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:13,280
In fact, I forgot about that whole connection.

677
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:18,480
Well, guys, I know that we've been kicking this around for a while, so I really appreciate

678
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,480
you making the time.

679
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:22,300
People also don't know, but Dusty went above and beyond.

680
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:23,300
He joined me.

681
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:26,240
What time was it, local time, where you were at last night, Dusty, when we were chatting?

682
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,240
It was only 11, not too late.

683
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,240
Oh, yeah.

684
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,240
Okay, sure.

685
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:33,880
Yeah, so he joined me at 11 o'clock last night to just do audio setup and all of that kind

686
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:34,880
of stuff.

687
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:35,880
So I really appreciate it.

688
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,800
I may pick your guys' brains in the future, but is there any other knowledge or tidbits

689
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,640
you want to impart on the audience before we move on?

690
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:49,520
Yeah, so I'm going to post a link to a lab that I did for a conference last year, which

691
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:57,400
basically has fully encapsulated like a lab environment for you to run on your local laptop

692
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:03,120
or desktop or whatever that will really let you go through and learn all the features

693
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:06,300
of Atomic Host and what it's capable of.

694
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,840
So I'll post that in the IRC channel.

695
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:11,720
I'm not sure if you can grab that and put that in the show notes, but that would be

696
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:12,720
really good.

697
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,720
You bet.

698
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:14,720
I'll definitely put that in the show notes.

699
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:21,200
I'll also put in the show notes a link to devconf.us, DevConf US 2018, the first annual

700
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:24,600
free Red Hat-sponsored technology conference, and it's in Boston.

701
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:29,120
It's for projects, for project people, professional people, people that contribute to open source.

702
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,160
They're in the Boston University area.

703
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:35,120
It's going to be August 17th, which is a Saturday, and it'll run until the 19th.

704
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,840
Sounds like a good time.

705
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,840
Yeah.

706
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:43,800
And this is a conference that we've had DevConf, but it's always been in the Czech Republic,

707
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,080
close to one of our offices there.

708
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,960
And it's been a really big success for us.

709
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:53,600
A lot of people come from all over Europe to come and present on their open source project.

710
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:57,440
So we decided to bring it over to the US and see how it runs there.

711
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:03,040
It's not quite as big as something like FOSDEM, but it's definitely a significant conference.

712
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,160
That's pretty nice.

713
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,400
And I'd love to go to Boston.

714
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:10,320
Boy, I have all these fantasies of just traveling around the world for a year and just visiting

715
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,320
all these different events.

716
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,660
And this would be one on my list.

717
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:16,440
So it's in Boston if you're in that area, August 17th and the 19th of 2018.

718
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,720
Check it out, DevConf.

719
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:22,400
It's actually technically devconf.cz.us, but I assume devconf.us will take you there, I

720
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,400
think.

721
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,400
Anyways, we have a link in the show notes.

722
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,400
It doesn't really matter.

723
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,120
I think it does redirect there, yeah.

724
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,880
It's not just for people to attend.

725
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:35,040
There's a CFP, anybody can submit a talk to get accepted.

726
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,560
So submit your talks.

727
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,560
Very good.

728
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,560
Very good.

729
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,640
And Ian and Dusty, you guys are welcome to join us anytime you have an update on the

730
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,600
project or anything you want to chat about here on the show.

731
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,120
The Mumble Room is always open to you.

732
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:48,320
So you're welcome to come back and you're welcome to hang out just for the rest of the

733
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,320
show too.

734
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:52,880
We'll keep chugging along here and you're free to chime in.

735
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:53,880
Thanks, guys.

736
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:54,880
Thank you.

737
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,200
Ian, I'm sorry you didn't get a chance, but I'm glad you made it.

738
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,320
I'm sure we'll chat more.

739
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,320
If you stick around, I'm sure we'll get a chance.

740
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,320
Dusty killed it.

741
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,320
He did, didn't he?

742
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,320
He sure did.

743
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,320
Yeah.

744
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,320
You were good support, though.

745
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,800
I knew you were there like gnawing along like, that's right.

746
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,800
That's right.

747
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,800
That's what...

748
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,800
It's a team effort.

749
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,800
All right.

750
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,120
Well, speaking of a team effort, I'll tell you what they would place it as an incredible

751
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,320
team behind them.

752
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,320
And that's DigitalOcean.

753
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:18,580
Go over to digitalocean.com and use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

754
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:20,640
One word, you get a $10 credit.

755
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,940
This is really something.

756
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:24,180
This is amazing at scale right here.

757
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:26,720
You want to feel like one of the big players.

758
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:30,400
You want to feel like you've got one of the big data centers, go spin up a droplet in

759
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,400
less than 55 seconds.

760
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,080
DigitalOcean.com, use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

761
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,080
It's one word.

762
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,080
You get a $10 credit.

763
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:41,200
Now, my favorite system is three cents an hour, okay?

764
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,200
Three cents an hour.

765
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,800
You get a $10 credit.

766
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:44,800
So that's great.

767
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,520
If they got a $5 rig, and that $5 rig you can run two months for free, and they've just

768
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:52,080
recently revamped their pricing, they're even more competitive than ever.

769
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,080
You get...

770
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:56,040
My favorite machine, I get four gigs of RAM now.

771
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,040
Four gigs of RAM.

772
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,040
What are you doing with that?

773
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,040
You're just so wasteful.

774
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,480
I actually don't really do anything with it.

775
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,480
I don't even need it.

776
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:06,200
But you know, it doesn't matter because it's so darn affordable.

777
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:10,440
Right after they rolled out the upgrades, you go into your droplets, you turn them off.

778
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:16,040
You can resize the disk, and they will automatically and dynamically resize the file system too.

779
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:19,020
Or you can just say, just the memory, or you can choose.

780
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:20,320
It's so cool.

781
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,320
So what were we doing?

782
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,320
Why did I have to do that?

783
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:25,680
You know, you were doing some super-zigguratemic snap research.

784
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,680
That's right.

785
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:27,680
We were trying to...

786
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,680
Wow.

787
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:31,440
I probably should not say what we were doing now that I think about that, but it's another

788
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,760
great use case for DigitalOcean, and if you listen to TechSnap, you might know what I'm

789
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,760
talking about.

790
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,980
Oh yeah, that's right.

791
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:38,160
So we needed to upgrade the rig.

792
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,160
We did, yes, we did.

793
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,160
And that was great.

794
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,160
It just, the timing worked out perfectly.

795
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,160
It worked beautifully.

796
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,320
Yeah, they also have new flexible droplets.

797
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:47,240
So for $15, you can just mix and match the resources that are just most appropriate for

798
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,240
your setup.

799
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,240
That's nice too.

800
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,240
So you can just...

801
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,560
More memory here, less disk there, or vice versa, whatever.

802
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,000
And now they have CPU-optimized droplets.

803
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,080
Yeah, CPU-optimized droplets, which means basically you're just closer to the metal.

804
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,080
You're right on there.

805
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:02,360
They're great for highly active front-end servers.

806
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:05,460
If you're seeing like strong adoption for developers signing up for like an application

807
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:09,500
you're working on, you want to spin up workplace projects and you want to have a great performance,

808
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:10,540
it's perfect for that.

809
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:16,600
They also have really, really large memory systems, hundreds of gigs of RAM.

810
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,880
It's a great setup.

811
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:21,740
And again, just three cents an hour too, if you just want something that's pretty great.

812
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:26,720
They have a beautiful interface, tons of different distributions, including Fedora and CoreOS,

813
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:30,040
FreeBSD, Ubuntu, Debian, and more.

814
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:34,760
And we even have a pretty fancy new URL you can go to where everything's just preloaded.

815
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:37,080
You don't have to worry about promo codes or nothing.

816
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:42,160
Just go to do.co.plugged, do.co.plugged.

817
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:48,200
And a big thank you to DigitalOcean, do.co.plugged, or use our promo code, coder, or not coder,

818
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,600
that's not the other show, that's do.plugged.

819
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,600
It's pretty cool.

820
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:57,040
I got to say, those CPU-optimized systems are pretty nuts.

821
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:00,560
The thing is, the mix and match is probably the way I'll go from now on.

822
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,560
It just seems so handy.

823
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:06,040
Because it's slightly less than what I end up paying for the system, my most common system,

824
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:09,720
and the mix and match is perfect because I don't need a lot of local disk, but I generally

825
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,680
want either more RAM or more CPU.

826
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,880
It was more RAM that we needed during the TechSnap experiment.

827
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:14,880
Yeah, exactly.

828
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:18,040
So that's just a really, it's really nice to have that flexibility, and plus they just

829
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:21,960
lowered their pricing on stuff, and they keep adding new features, it just gets better and

830
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:22,960
better.

831
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,880
There's always new stuff for me to talk about with DigitalOcean.

832
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:25,960
I freaking love that.

833
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:26,960
You guys will love it too.

834
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:33,200
DigitalOcean.com, use our promo code, do.unplugged, or, I mean, go to their new fancy URL, do.co.plugged.

835
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,400
I mean, it's kind of fun to say.

836
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,400
It is fun to say.

837
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,400
I'm enjoying it.

838
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,400
The whole thing is fun.

839
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,400
Do.co.plugged.

840
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,240
They also have a really cool command line.

841
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:44,320
All right, let's talk about other cool things.

842
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:49,920
Mr. Martin Wimpress, you are really on my list of people that need a nice Christmas

843
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:50,920
gift this year.

844
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:55,760
I got to say, if 1804 turns out to be half as good, if the Ubuntu MATE 1804 release turns

845
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:59,040
out to be half as good as I think it's going to be, I'm going to need to send you a Christmas

846
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,240
card because this is looking fantastic now.

847
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,100
There will be an official post tomorrow.

848
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:04,820
This is a little bit early.

849
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:09,400
We don't have all the details yet, but rumor has it that when you decided to implement

850
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:12,600
high DPI support in Ubuntu MATE, you went all in.

851
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,960
That's the rumor.

852
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:21,040
The rumors are true.

853
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:25,040
I've not been doing much of the coding on this.

854
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:30,580
I did some of the groundwork and actually roped in people from the community.

855
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:33,160
This has been sort of a two-year journey.

856
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:39,280
First of all, there's the whole migration to GTK 3, and then there's the upgrading all

857
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:45,080
of the themes to support the latest versions of GTK 3, and then there's going through every

858
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:50,760
asset in all of those themes and making sure that there are scaled and non-scaled variants

859
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:56,560
of all of the assets that are used throughout those themes, which is no insignificant amount

860
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:57,560
of work.

861
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:59,720
And we had had help from...

862
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:03,760
Significant technical work, but I think also just I wanted to say significant political

863
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:04,760
work.

864
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:08,120
There is a certain amount of communication that you've had to do or other people have

865
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:09,120
had to do.

866
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,120
There's greasing the wheels.

867
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:14,320
There's certain amounts of funding that's had to happen here to make all of this happen.

868
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:22,520
You're rattling these off, but each one of these was a huge amount of work in of themselves.

869
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:28,760
Each of these items is a multi-month effort, and each of them has been funded through the

870
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:31,740
Ubuntu MATE crowdfunding.

871
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:36,800
And then more recently, we've got to the actual meat and potatoes of this, which is to turn

872
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:42,020
on the scaling within the MATE desktop itself.

873
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:46,440
And I've spoken about that, I think this is the third time in five weeks we've spoken

874
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:47,440
about this.

875
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:51,120
I promise this will be the last time for some time now, because I'm sure some of the listeners

876
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:52,880
are bored of hearing about it.

877
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:59,560
But the big change now is today we've landed the fixes that mean that the high DPI scaling

878
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:03,040
is completely dynamic.

879
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:06,920
In other words, to say it automatically detects it and scales itself?

880
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:07,920
Correct.

881
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:10,680
See, I think we're not going to be talking about it because we'll be playing with these

882
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:12,120
fancy new features.

883
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:14,040
That is great.

884
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:15,820
That is a big win.

885
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:23,080
So from the Greta, that auto scales and then the desktop itself now detects if it's got

886
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:27,000
a high DPI display, dynamically scales.

887
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:32,680
That's the default, will dynamically scale to fit for high DPI.

888
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:36,640
And then we've also been able to preserve, we've added, or rather Victor has added a

889
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:44,160
new prioritization system to the settings daemon so that we can push environment variables

890
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:47,680
into the session really early on.

891
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:51,600
And the environment variables that we're interested in here are the ones that provide the high

892
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:54,880
DPI hints to Qt applications.

893
00:44:54,880 --> 00:45:02,060
So the MATE desktop in GTK is detecting that this is a high DPI environment.

894
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:06,360
It sets up GTK, but then it provides the hints to Qt.

895
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:12,200
And that means when you run things like VLC or Kdenlive or whatever your Qt application

896
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:18,640
is under the MATE desktop, that gets the right font and toolkit scaling hints.

897
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:21,480
Alls I can say is a round of applause to that.

898
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:25,780
So Qt applications will feel like first class citizens on the MATE desktop.

899
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:27,800
That's as best as we can.

900
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:30,720
Yeah, that's great.

901
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:36,920
And getting it at the greater level too is a very smooth experience.

902
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:38,120
That's top notch stuff there.

903
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:43,600
I mean, this is like the MATE desktop is bringing full top notch high DPI support.

904
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:47,200
This is as good as it gets on the Linux desktop.

905
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:50,920
Yeah, it's as good as we can do at this stage.

906
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:53,800
We can refine it a little bit in the future.

907
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:58,080
I mean, if you're one of these people that really values all of those millions of pixels

908
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:04,280
that you've got on your high DPI laptop, suppose you're Linus Torvalds, and you see this scaling

909
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:09,680
happen, and you don't want that, then you can toggle a setting to change it between

910
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:15,840
auto scale, a fixed one to one mapping or a fixed scale always.

911
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:19,200
And if you toggle those settings, then the whole desktop will scale dynamically.

912
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,000
So you don't need to log out or log in.

913
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,920
You can actually flip those settings around in the session and it will just respond instantly.

914
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:28,880
And this is all going upstream to MATE itself?

915
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:31,200
This is all being done in MATE desktop.

916
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,880
It's all an upstream project.

917
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:38,800
It's all landed today, and we've just tagged the MATE 120 release, and that'll be coming

918
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,280
out tomorrow.

919
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:41,280
Hot dang.

920
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,280
Wow.

921
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:43,280
So what about the artwork?

922
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:47,280
So once you get everything scaled up, then you also have the problem that all of your

923
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:51,160
icons and your graphics also have to be higher resolution.

924
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:56,400
Yeah, so this is what I was referring to with the work we've done on the theme assets, which

925
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:03,200
we did about a year ago, and Michael Tunnell helped with that, and Daniel Foray helped

926
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:04,200
with that.

927
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:05,200
Oh, you guys.

928
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,600
You guys are great.

929
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:08,600
I love it.

930
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:12,120
So the assets are already high DPI ready?

931
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:16,960
All of the assets that we need to be high DPI are high DPI.

932
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:24,360
There are a few instances in the code where we're using bitmaps rather than SVGs.

933
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:29,560
So we haven't clobbered all of those yet, but we'll get to those in due course.

934
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:32,280
But by and large, it's all done.

935
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:40,200
And we've also been able to preserve the font DPI scaling, which I've mentioned before.

936
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:42,320
And this gives us a nice halfway house.

937
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:49,120
While fractional scaling isn't a thing, being able to scale the fonts independently of the

938
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:58,200
DPI scaling of the toolkit means that if you've got, say, an XPS 13, you can turn on double

939
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:02,760
scaling but scale down the font slightly and it gives you a nice halfway house while we

940
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:04,080
wait for fractional scaling.

941
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:05,080
Thank you.

942
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:08,120
Thank you very much for that as an XPS 13 owner.

943
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:09,120
Thank you.

944
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:10,120
Wow.

945
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:15,280
And I am very excited about all of this and this should all be landing for the 18.04 release

946
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:17,240
of the Ubuntu MATE desktop?

947
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:18,240
Yeah.

948
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:25,960
So for Ubuntu MATE 18.04, all of this landed today as patch sets in our snapshot development

949
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:32,840
packages and MATE 1.20 will come out tomorrow and some point over the weekend, those packages

950
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:41,040
should hit the Ubuntu 18.04 archive, hopefully in time for Ubuntu MATE 18.04 Alpha 2, which

951
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,600
is next week.

952
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:43,600
Dang.

953
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:46,720
Great, great, great work by everybody.

954
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,320
That sounds like...

955
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:51,000
That's so great that all of this is landing for the LTS.

956
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,080
It's so good because that's the distro that you're going to be strapped with for the next

957
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:56,080
five years.

958
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:57,080
Exactly.

959
00:48:57,080 --> 00:49:03,000
And this was something that I really, really wanted to see happen for this LTS because

960
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,280
as you know, they're long lived.

961
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:09,720
And I felt that if we didn't get there with high DPI, because we're playing catch up,

962
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:15,140
there's a number of the other desktops that have already got high DPI implementations.

963
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:19,080
And I felt that if we didn't get there for this release, then we run the risk of losing

964
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:25,640
users to other development environments, which in of itself is no big deal.

965
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:30,520
But when you lose users, you lose developers and that's the thing we really wanted to retain.

966
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:31,520
Good insight.

967
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:33,280
I completely agree with you.

968
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:35,920
So let's talk about retaining developers.

969
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:42,400
And speaking of Mr. Daniel Foray, Dan, you posted a update about App Center payments.

970
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:47,860
And if I understand it, the kicker here is that security updates, system updates, those

971
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:52,120
are continuing to be distributed as they always have been in elementary OS.

972
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:57,240
But now, applications that people have deferred payment on, like they bought for free, they'll

973
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:03,280
pend in the update section while users have the option to pay for it or put in zero dollars

974
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:04,880
and get the update for free.

975
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,080
It's a pretty big post.

976
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:10,500
In fact, you even subtitled it hashtag clickbait.

977
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:11,500
How are you doing today, Dan?

978
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:13,200
Are you doing okay?

979
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:14,680
I'm doing great, man.

980
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:15,680
I'm doing great.

981
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:16,680
Glad to hear it.

982
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:19,920
I mean, I've seen a wide range of reaction about this.

983
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:24,040
I think understandably, when people hear that you're going to withhold updates and prompt

984
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:29,720
people for payment, there is a visceral reaction that that's insane and you're money-grubbing.

985
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:30,720
What's your response to that?

986
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:31,720
Yeah.

987
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:35,000
I mean, I got to follow Wimpy here, Santa Claus, followed by the Grinch.

988
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,840
So, okay, so here's the problem.

989
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:43,200
Let me frame the problem to get, like, this is where we're coming from.

990
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:46,640
We set out to build out this App Center thing, right?

991
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:50,980
And one of the goals that we wanted to do when we did that was we want to give third

992
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:55,440
party developers, so developers that are not elementary, developers that are just like

993
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:59,580
regular people writing their little open source apps, we want to give them a path to be able

994
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:02,120
to make a living writing open source software.

995
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:05,800
Because right now, if you want to write open source software for a living, you got to get

996
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:11,560
lucky to be hired by like a handful of big corporations and that sucks.

997
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:18,640
So we were seeking to kind of shift the paradigm and allow anyone to make a living writing

998
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:21,120
open source software.

999
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:22,760
But we're not quite there yet.

1000
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:28,040
And so we launched this store like a little over eight months ago, I think.

1001
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:32,240
And where we're at right now is that we have some developers who have made a few hundred

1002
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:37,120
dollars selling their apps, which is more than zero, but it's not enough for them to

1003
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:38,400
live.

1004
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:44,600
And looking at the data we have, it's that about 1% of people that are downloading these

1005
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:48,960
apps are actually paying for them, but it's a really small amount.

1006
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:51,080
And we wondered like, why is that, right?

1007
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:53,160
Like why is it so small?

1008
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:57,600
So we went and asked our users and they said a couple of things.

1009
00:51:57,600 --> 00:52:02,080
One of the things they said is that a lot of them will skip paying upfront for an app

1010
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:07,200
because they've never used it or never heard of it before and they want to try it out first.

1011
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:11,700
And then they said that after they've downloaded the app and tried it out, if they did want

1012
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:15,580
to pay for it, now suddenly there wasn't really a way for them to go back.

1013
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:19,800
There wasn't a way for them to keep track of which apps they'd pay for or not.

1014
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,280
And there was no reminder.

1015
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:25,820
So even if they, yeah, they didn't think about it or they don't know which apps they've paid

1016
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:26,820
for.

1017
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:29,960
It's like the system wasn't catering for that workflow at all.

1018
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:37,880
So why not build in a limited five-day trial system versus withholding updates?

1019
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:44,060
So we definitely wanted to stay away from things like trials or like time bombs or things

1020
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:47,400
that are going to like get in your way, nag you while you're working.

1021
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:48,400
Yeah.

1022
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,800
Like that's the one thing we don't want to do is get in your way while you're trying

1023
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,140
to work or play.

1024
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:54,840
Like we don't want to be intrusive.

1025
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:58,760
So we're trying to find a compromise between what's a great user experience and what's

1026
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:00,480
going to help our developers make a living.

1027
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:01,480
Yeah.

1028
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:05,920
In fact, I think I really, really, really appreciate the respect you guys put in the

1029
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:10,160
decision process of what the cost is for interrupting the user's workflow.

1030
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:14,440
I know that was kind of a key thing that you guys thought about and holy crap, do I really

1031
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:15,440
appreciate that.

1032
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:20,000
I really, really hate it when I'm in the middle of trying to do a thought dump into a note

1033
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,960
document and all of a sudden a pop-up comes up and interrupts what I'm doing or a new

1034
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:28,100
Chrome extension gets updated and it opens up a new tab and it steals the input.

1035
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:29,760
It is the worst experience.

1036
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:34,880
And so I would never, ever be in a mood to want to pay money towards something when I

1037
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:35,960
got nagged like that.

1038
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:38,140
Like I'm just not in the buying mood.

1039
00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:40,520
On the update screen, that's more interesting, right?

1040
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:44,760
Because I'm already going into the app center, I'm launching it and I'm clicking on the updates

1041
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:45,760
tab.

1042
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:48,560
I'm already kind of like dedicating myself to this task.

1043
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:50,100
So how did you strike the balance here?

1044
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:55,720
Like does it just default to like $10 for an app and I just click update and it charges

1045
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:56,720
me?

1046
00:53:56,720 --> 00:54:01,360
Or is there a process like once I've decided I'm going to do updates?

1047
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:06,000
Developers who publish their apps in app center get to choose how much they're suggested prices.

1048
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:11,840
So for a given app, it could be $1, $3, $5, $10, it depends on what that developer sets.

1049
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:16,080
And what happens is you go into your updates view and you see all your apps listed.

1050
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:20,560
And if you hit the update all button, all the apps that you've paid for or any free

1051
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:23,400
apps or any system updates will get installed.

1052
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:28,180
But the ones that you haven't paid for will get kind of skipped by that process and they'll

1053
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:33,520
hang out with the regular, the little button that you get like you get on the install page

1054
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:37,920
where it shows the suggested price and then it has the dropdown where you can choose either

1055
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:39,440
a different price or zero.

1056
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:40,440
Right.

1057
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:45,840
So to be clear, these aren't packages from the upstream repo like LibreOffice.

1058
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:50,320
These are applications the developers have independently developed and published to the

1059
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:52,080
app center themselves.

1060
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:56,440
And then when the updates come out, those are suggesting whatever the developer says

1061
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:57,440
that you pay.

1062
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:01,640
But as an end user, you could blank it out and put zero in and hit the update button.

1063
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:02,640
Right.

1064
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:05,000
And you can put in zero indefinitely if you want.

1065
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,760
You can go in every time and never pay for the app.

1066
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:09,440
That's totally up to you.

1067
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:10,560
I like the implementation.

1068
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:11,560
It seems pretty clean.

1069
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:12,560
It just sort of fits in.

1070
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:16,600
And I'm curious on the back end, like at the code level, do you guys actually call this

1071
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:18,120
thing the humble button?

1072
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:19,480
Is that what you call it internally?

1073
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:20,480
The humble button?

1074
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:22,280
That's what the class name is.

1075
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:23,280
That's a good name for it.

1076
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:24,280
Because that's what it is.

1077
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:25,280
It reminds me of the humble bundle.

1078
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:27,240
It's sort of based around that idea.

1079
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:30,120
You pay what you think it's worth.

1080
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:33,800
Do you have any kind of early data on if people are actually doing this?

1081
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:36,100
Or is this even shipped yet?

1082
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:38,040
So this hasn't shipped yet.

1083
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:40,280
We wanted to post and talk about it.

1084
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:41,920
We merged the code into master.

1085
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:43,660
So we're testing it.

1086
00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:48,040
And we wanted to kind of start the conversation and say, hey, this is what we're planning

1087
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:51,080
to do in the upcoming release.

1088
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:52,920
Let's hear some feedback.

1089
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:54,240
Let's hear some concerns.

1090
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:55,740
Let's answer some questions.

1091
00:55:55,740 --> 00:55:59,800
And we've got great feedback from people already that are wondering about things like security

1092
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:00,800
updates.

1093
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:01,880
And so we've gone back in.

1094
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:06,680
And we've made sure that security updates always are included when you hit Update All.

1095
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:08,480
We don't ever withhold security updates.

1096
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:13,120
So that was one thing that user feedback made us go, oh, yes, this is an important case

1097
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:14,120
to cover.

1098
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:20,360
Well, Dan, I did see the typical responses when you do something kind of like this.

1099
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:26,100
But I think the positive thing that I saw was I saw more people coming to the defense

1100
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:31,040
of elementary OS than I've ever seen and more people calling out people that just go with

1101
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:36,800
the standard narrative, that just go with the sort of pre-baked opinion on R Linux.

1102
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:39,120
And more and more people were saying, no, that's wrong.

1103
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:41,480
You need to realize what this project is doing.

1104
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:45,320
There is a change in public opinion.

1105
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:48,480
There's like a wave of change that I see happening for your project.

1106
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:54,360
And I think the risks you're taking with the App Center have directly contributed to the

1107
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:55,540
momentum there.

1108
00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:59,480
And I know this one's probably the riskiest change.

1109
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:03,200
This is almost riskier than the App Center itself in a weird way.

1110
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:09,080
But at the same time, I think it's you, the project, doing this is the very thing that's

1111
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:12,880
starting to change the tide of momentum that I've seen just an incredible amount of people

1112
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:17,840
saying, I really need to try that elementary OS or you don't understand what they're doing.

1113
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:20,200
This is their thought process.

1114
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:24,360
In the past, say like last year, say a year ago, I just basically see a bunch of assholes

1115
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:26,160
tearing down the project.

1116
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:32,280
Now I see a handful of assholes tearing down the project and way more people coming to

1117
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:36,800
the defense of the project and way more people saying, hmm, I ought to try that.

1118
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:39,800
So you guys are doing something right.

1119
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:43,880
And I really like that you're kind of collecting the feedback now before this ships.

1120
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:46,680
So what is the expectation here as an end user?

1121
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:47,920
When do I see this land?

1122
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:50,680
When do I expect my updates to start prompting me to pay?

1123
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:51,720
Is it the next release?

1124
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:53,080
Is it going to happen in the current version?

1125
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:55,480
Like what should users expect?

1126
00:57:55,480 --> 00:58:00,400
At the moment, the plan is that this update doesn't happen until our next major release,

1127
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:03,640
the code name Juno elementary OS release.

1128
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:08,460
We are kind of toying around with the idea of some users have brought up to us, well,

1129
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:13,600
if I do an upgrade or if I have multiple installs or things like that, like how is this going

1130
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:19,840
to keep track of applications that I've already paid for on my current Loki release?

1131
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:24,100
And so there's some things to think through there about if we need to push out a release

1132
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:28,320
that includes some kind of online account or some kind of importer or exporter or some

1133
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:30,880
way that we can.

1134
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:34,960
There's some other concerns that our users have brought up to us.

1135
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:36,780
That's a challenging problem to solve, right?

1136
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:43,480
Because you don't really want to be in the business of storing user credentials, right?

1137
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:45,120
So there's a lot to talk about there.

1138
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:49,960
And there's some secure ways that we think that we can leverage like native features

1139
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:57,160
of Stripe that we'd be able to store it encrypted on their servers.

1140
00:58:57,160 --> 00:59:01,360
But there's definitely a lot of discussion happening there, and like I said, that's the

1141
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:05,080
reason we put this out early, so we can get the user feedback and have them go, hey, well,

1142
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:06,080
what about this?

1143
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:07,080
It's funny.

1144
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:12,120
So Wes and I before this episode of Linux Unplugged just recorded TechSnap episode 355,

1145
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:16,500
and in there we talk about things to think about when you're building a user-based system

1146
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:19,740
like this where you're going to authenticate users and have user identities, sort of perfect

1147
00:59:19,740 --> 00:59:23,840
timing because it is a very unique challenge, and I could kind of see why users would want

1148
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:24,840
that.

1149
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:28,760
You know, and Dan, I'll tell you this, and I'm probably unique, so it's not worth it,

1150
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:36,360
but if I knew that if I paid $30 that it would be saved forever wherever I went that I paid

1151
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:40,240
that $30, I'd be more inclined, whereas if I thought I'm going to have to redo it on

1152
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:43,280
every system, I'm going to pay $3 or $5.

1153
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:45,120
So there's something to it.

1154
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:50,360
Like if I knew it was a persistent payment that would benefit me across multiple elementary

1155
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:54,040
installs, I'd be more inclined to pay more, but I might be unique in that way.

1156
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:55,040
Yeah.

1157
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:56,040
But that sounds interesting.

1158
00:59:56,040 --> 01:00:01,240
I'm really glad you guys are talking about this right now, and are you feeling like the

1159
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:05,240
course is correct, you're going to continue down this path, you haven't been scared away

1160
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:06,240
from it?

1161
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:10,360
No, I think the feedback that we've gotten is super awesome.

1162
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:16,000
You know, the people that are going to be upset, we're still upset, you know, but from

1163
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:20,680
the majority of the developers and the users that are using elementary OS, the familiar

1164
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:25,760
faces that we've actively engaged with, it seems like people are excited about this change

1165
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:29,600
and they think that it solves the problem in a fair way, and they're willing to try

1166
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:30,720
it out.

1167
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:33,500
And I think that it should turn out good.

1168
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:38,280
And if it turns out that we did some wrong things, we'll take more feedback and judge

1169
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:40,600
us the system and roll out a new one.

1170
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:44,600
Producer Michael, you have a question slash suggestion, maybe like a user preference type

1171
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:45,600
setting?

1172
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:48,200
Yeah, I was just curious if it was going to be possible in the future.

1173
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:52,760
You said that you'd have to manually choose to do the zero dollars every single time.

1174
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:57,200
And I was wondering if you have any thoughts on maybe in the future setting it so that

1175
01:00:57,200 --> 01:01:01,320
if you, I don't know, manually choose it for five times that it would automatically give

1176
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:06,080
you an option to say, hey, would you like to set this permanent so it's, you know, continue

1177
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:09,720
to update it but in the free or would it be like a manual every time?

1178
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:15,000
I think at the moment we want to try the manual every time because kind of the idea of it

1179
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,480
is that it's not as convenient.

1180
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:21,760
You know, we want to go, hey, like, you're still using this, the developer is still giving

1181
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:25,720
you value, like, maybe you should consider throwing a dollar at him, you know?

1182
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:28,320
Yeah, that kind of makes sense to me.

1183
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:29,320
And it seems sustainable.

1184
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:33,800
I hope that like, you know, this being risky and getting so much attention, I'm sure you

1185
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:34,800
might lose people.

1186
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:40,680
But if the people who stay are down to help build this Linux paradise of, you know, a

1187
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:44,360
supportable Linux ecosystem, it could be great.

1188
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:45,720
There's two different audiences too.

1189
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:46,720
Go ahead.

1190
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:48,680
I can save my point.

1191
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:56,600
I'd still consider Rotten's suggestion on the basis of if it's a charitable organization

1192
01:01:56,600 --> 01:02:00,560
where they're using your system because it's convenient, it does help somebody.

1193
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:07,640
At that point, you know, that option is definitely something that does cost cuts on their maintenance.

1194
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:10,240
Yeah, it makes that experience more smooth.

1195
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:13,840
I think there are other ways to get the updates outside of the App Center too.

1196
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:20,320
But I think the idea is sort of worth trying, like, hey, this is the third or fourth time

1197
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:23,740
you've skipped paying for this, but you're still choosing to update it.

1198
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:25,320
Maybe that means there is some value there.

1199
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:28,320
I see why you want to experiment with that.

1200
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:34,360
I guess moving after, well, the thing that I was going to mention before, just a second

1201
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:36,620
ago, was there's two audiences here to this.

1202
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:41,800
The one audience obviously is the users, but the other audience is the developers.

1203
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:45,560
And you're essentially, Dan, messaging to the developers, we're really trying to work

1204
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:49,800
something out for you that's going to make this profitable.

1205
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:54,760
In a way, it's sort of free advertising to developers about elementary OS.

1206
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:59,440
I know that's not the intention, but if I was a developer looking at monetizing my application

1207
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:03,560
on the Linux desktop, I'd be watching this going, these guys get it.

1208
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:06,520
These guys get that I need to actually eat food.

1209
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:10,920
Yeah, we definitely want to be in the corner of our developers here and fighting for them.

1210
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:17,120
And we know objectively that there are developers of popular applications on other platforms

1211
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:20,960
that have said, hey, we're not going to write for Linux because we can't make a living there.

1212
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:22,920
And we want to remove that reason.

1213
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:25,280
We don't want anybody to be able to say that.

1214
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:28,600
Yeah, I've really seen that a lot.

1215
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:33,000
On the Coder Radio program, we get these emails that come in, and it's these exasperated developers

1216
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:37,200
who are writing me these basically rage quits.

1217
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:41,080
They're rage quitting the Linux community because they've tried to make an application

1218
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:44,940
and they tried to sell it on Linux and it just blew up in their face and it was nothing

1219
01:03:44,940 --> 01:03:47,520
but criticism.

1220
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:53,520
It really is, in a way, I can kind of understand where they went wrong and I can kind of see

1221
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:54,960
it from their perspective.

1222
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:58,500
But it's just not all the pieces are there yet when you compare it to other platforms.

1223
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:03,240
And elementary OS is getting as close as I think anybody has to really just putting all

1224
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:06,920
of the pieces in there that make it easier for developers to ship and understand there'll

1225
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:08,680
be a sustainable revenue model.

1226
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:13,080
A cohesive experience, a target to develop for, and a place to get revenue.

1227
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:16,040
And here's what I would say to people that are like, this isn't for me.

1228
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:18,560
This isn't anything I'm ever interested in.

1229
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:22,880
It's good that somebody's trying it because one of the things that I really have learned

1230
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:28,400
to appreciate recently about the open source world is that all of these different efforts

1231
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:32,800
that are happening in the open are free R&D for all of us.

1232
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:38,240
So we all get to sit back and watch elementary OS try this crazy ass experiment of trying

1233
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:43,880
to monetize applications and help people monetize their programs when people are upgrading and

1234
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:45,160
see how it goes.

1235
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:49,280
And it doesn't cost me a thing, unless I buy an app.

1236
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:51,200
It doesn't cost me anything.

1237
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:52,580
And I get to watch them try this.

1238
01:04:52,580 --> 01:04:57,280
And so I really appreciate that you guys are doing this because somebody needs to.

1239
01:04:57,280 --> 01:04:59,240
And I can't think of a better project.

1240
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:03,120
So good luck, Dan, and I will definitely be trying it out when Juno ships.

1241
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:05,120
I'll 100% give it a go.

1242
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:06,880
I think it's worth giving it a go.

1243
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:10,560
And I'm happy to throw a couple of bucks to developers that are making native Linux applications

1244
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:12,120
any day of the week.

1245
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:13,120
You know?

1246
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:17,880
And I'll pay for those upgrades because I want to see more of that.

1247
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:22,000
That's why I buy every damn release of Crossover Office for like the last decade.

1248
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,680
I don't even use the damn thing more than a couple times a year.

1249
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:28,080
But I'm just so thankful that somebody's making native applications and contributing code

1250
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:29,680
upstream.

1251
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:30,680
Just go for it, Dan.

1252
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:32,120
So good on you.

1253
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:33,440
And keep us updated, won't you?

1254
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:34,440
Good luck.

1255
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:35,440
Thanks.

1256
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:36,440
All right.

1257
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:43,160
So the one thing that I've been building towards all day is this perfect workstation that I'm

1258
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:44,520
trying to get to.

1259
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:49,360
And I've had this massive, massive awakening.

1260
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:50,920
You know, I should have listened.

1261
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:52,620
People tell me to stay woke.

1262
01:05:52,620 --> 01:05:55,080
And they tell me to reclaim my time.

1263
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:56,920
And I finally woke up.

1264
01:05:56,920 --> 01:06:02,580
Like Neo, I woke up from the matrix and I realized everything I knew was wrong.

1265
01:06:02,580 --> 01:06:04,400
You heard it a little bit last week.

1266
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:08,520
Like the beginning of the awakening happened last week.

1267
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:11,840
But so much more has developed in the week since last episode.

1268
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:14,000
We'll get to that in just a moment.

1269
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,560
But first, let's talk about skilling up.

1270
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:17,760
Let's talk about your mind.

1271
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:22,000
Let's talk about Linux Academy, a platform to learn more about Linux and everything around

1272
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,000
it.

1273
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:26,080
Linux Academy is a full featured training library with everything you need to learn

1274
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:28,480
new skills and advance your career.

1275
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:33,580
It's all of the stuff that's core to Linux and the things bolted on top like OpenStack

1276
01:06:33,580 --> 01:06:37,000
and Docker and Azure and AWS.

1277
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:40,240
Everything you need to learn to get hands on experience with self-paced in-depth video

1278
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:43,520
courses and every Linux cloud and DevOps topic.

1279
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:44,520
It's incredible.

1280
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:45,520
It's almost too much.

1281
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:47,600
You're a little intimidated, but they make it so easy.

1282
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:49,200
It makes it brings a tear to me.

1283
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:53,720
I got to tell you, because as an old man, I would have I probably would have gotten

1284
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:56,680
street fights with hobos if I knew it could lead to Linux Academy.

1285
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:59,920
I'm just saying I would have got my butt kicked every single time and I still would have done

1286
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:00,920
it for Linux Academy.

1287
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:03,200
Are you saying those kids today just have it so easy?

1288
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:04,280
That's exactly what I'm saying.

1289
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:09,000
And they're on my lawn with hands on scenario based labs to where you get real experience

1290
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:14,120
on servers, which there is nothing that beats that except for maybe the fact that they have

1291
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:18,640
human beings, real instructors, full time humans at Linux Academy who will answer your

1292
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:21,880
questions and give you advice when you get stuck.

1293
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:24,360
They'll spin up cloud servers on demand as you need to learn more.

1294
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:30,480
They have course schedulers to help you pick a time frame and actually stick to your goals.

1295
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:32,000
Somehow they do this with computers.

1296
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,540
Turns out they're good at these kinds of things.

1297
01:07:33,540 --> 01:07:38,040
And if you just need a specific career track refresher or you're ready to go get a cert,

1298
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:41,960
they have learning paths, which are series of courses and content planned by their instructors

1299
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:43,600
for specific career tracks.

1300
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:46,080
And of course, they've got training and preparation for certs.

1301
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:51,960
Linux Academy dot com slash unplugged with comprehensive study tools and much, much more.

1302
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:52,960
You got to check it out.

1303
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:54,760
Linux Academy dot com slash unplugged.

1304
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:58,720
Go there, support the show and sign up for a free seven day trial.

1305
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:02,280
Big thanks to Linux Academy, Linux Academy dot com slash unplugged.

1306
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:06,160
OK, so I know Crazy Chris is switching desktops again.

1307
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:07,160
All right.

1308
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:08,160
What's happening?

1309
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:09,160
Get your laughs out, everybody.

1310
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:10,160
Shake it out.

1311
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:11,160
Ha, ha, ha.

1312
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:12,160
It's so funny.

1313
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:13,160
Except for this is the real deal.

1314
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:15,160
I know this is this is the real deal.

1315
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:16,160
Maybe like I've heard this before.

1316
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:17,160
I know.

1317
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:18,160
I know.

1318
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:22,200
I've had a I've had a kind of blame Wimpy to Wimpy kind of started this whole thing

1319
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:23,200
with this.

1320
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:24,680
Hey, you ought to try Plasma on Wayland.

1321
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:25,680
Yeah.

1322
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:26,680
What have you done?

1323
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:28,720
I know the reckoning.

1324
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:35,240
And since then, I've installed KDE neon user edition on all of my systems.

1325
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:39,280
I've just I just went I went for it because I really, really wanted to put it to the test

1326
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:43,480
because I'm sick and tired of switching distros and sick and tired of switching desktops.

1327
01:08:43,480 --> 01:08:45,600
I just want one thing that works.

1328
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:51,720
And so I thought, I'm going all in on this to put it to stress tested as much as possible.

1329
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:57,560
And let's make things harder by doing it right in the middle of an upgrade from KDE 5.11

1330
01:08:57,560 --> 01:09:02,520
to 5.12, which, you know, it's always fun to just completely update the desktop environment.

1331
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:06,100
And I did a lot of discussions with people online and one of the most influential people

1332
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:11,200
that I talked to was producer Michael who said, just try KDE neon.

1333
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:15,280
And he described it in a way that perfectly suited my needs.

1334
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:17,820
And producer Michael, I don't want to steal your thunder because you did such a good job

1335
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:23,520
describing the reason why KDE neon has been the perfect Linux setup for you.

1336
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:24,520
And I'd love you to share it with us.

1337
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:29,900
Well, I don't remember exactly what I said, but it was probably somewhere along the lines

1338
01:09:29,900 --> 01:09:35,560
of it's at a point where I was, you know, you know, you're moving to the system and

1339
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:40,140
you're just frustrated with all the problems and the updates constantly break things and

1340
01:09:40,140 --> 01:09:41,840
stuff like that.

1341
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:47,160
Since moving to neon, I've used the same install for almost two years.

1342
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:54,400
And it's while it does have quirks because every system has quirks, I can be safe knowing

1343
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:58,800
that when I update my system, it's not just going to crash everything.

1344
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:03,200
It's like I'm going to have all the settings that I wanted, all the applications, like

1345
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:07,240
loading and where I want them to load, all that stuff is exactly where I left it when

1346
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:14,200
I updated or prior to updating and that that reliability is just so nice.

1347
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:15,200
Yeah.

1348
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:16,680
And you, you like tailored it directly to me.

1349
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:17,680
Like you weaponized it.

1350
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:24,840
You said, um, KDE neon user edition is the perfect blend of a stable LTS base with the

1351
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:29,560
rolling user land because you know that gets me, you know that gets me.

1352
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:37,160
And so it is my entire reason for wanting, like I've been wanting this exact setup for

1353
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:42,360
like a decade of a system that has all the stuff I want, the applications and the DE

1354
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:43,960
and all that stuff to roll.

1355
01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:47,220
But I don't really care if the kernel and the display server and all that stuff rolls

1356
01:10:47,220 --> 01:10:48,360
with it.

1357
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:52,600
But like for the entire time, it's always been, you either have a stable base or you

1358
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:56,800
have a rolling base and I'd rather have that little hybrid approach.

1359
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:58,480
And that's exactly what neon does for me.

1360
01:10:58,480 --> 01:10:59,480
Yeah.

1361
01:10:59,480 --> 01:11:00,480
Yeah.

1362
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:04,600
And then you combine it with flat packs and snaps and it's, it's sort of, it's sort of

1363
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:12,920
this perfect blend of modern user applications, modern desktop environment, but stable old

1364
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:13,920
reliable base.

1365
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:17,480
So when I open up my bash terminal, everything's like it's been for like the last couple of

1366
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:18,480
years.

1367
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:19,480
Ooh.

1368
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:20,480
Yeah.

1369
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:21,480
The stable Unix workstation.

1370
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:28,760
And the other really, really great thing about plasma is there is uniquely new stuff that

1371
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:34,200
gnome isn't doing and windows isn't doing and macOS isn't doing.

1372
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:35,200
Yeah.

1373
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:37,960
They really are pushing ahead in their own direction.

1374
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:40,880
And I've noticed direct benefits.

1375
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:47,080
And I don't know how much this is attributed to plasma desktop versus light DM and SDDM,

1376
01:11:47,080 --> 01:11:50,920
but my machines with neon wake way faster.

1377
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:53,600
Like the screen is up and my desktop is up.

1378
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:58,720
I turned off locking because I'm lazy and I open up my screen and it's my home machine.

1379
01:11:58,720 --> 01:12:00,080
It never leaves the RV.

1380
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:06,160
I open up the screen and I, my desktop is up on my screen before I have finished positioning

1381
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:07,600
my laptop screen.

1382
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:09,320
It's immediate.

1383
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:13,560
And then it takes a, another beat for the network to actually connect, but it's instantaneous.

1384
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:14,800
My screen wakes up now.

1385
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:16,840
I feel like my boot is faster.

1386
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:20,440
It just, Oh, it sounds like your life is better, honestly.

1387
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:21,440
That's what this is.

1388
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:22,440
It's infatuation.

1389
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:24,220
Well, or is it real?

1390
01:12:24,220 --> 01:12:25,220
This is always how it starts.

1391
01:12:25,220 --> 01:12:26,220
Church of neon.

1392
01:12:26,220 --> 01:12:31,640
It does start like this, but I am happy to report that I did go through a five 11 to

1393
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:36,760
five 12 upgrade and if I didn't know that's what I was doing, I wouldn't have even known

1394
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:37,760
the upgrade took place.

1395
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:42,920
It was, I've, I've done it on several machines before the show and nothing, nothing.

1396
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:43,920
I just noticed nothing.

1397
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:44,920
It just was fine.

1398
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:45,920
Exactly.

1399
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:46,920
Yeah, it was easy.

1400
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:52,160
I've gone, I'm on five 12 now and I've, I mean the first time I started was five six.

1401
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:53,160
Wow.

1402
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:54,160
Wow.

1403
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:58,320
Maybe it was five five, I'm not sure, but it was, it was somewhere around there.

1404
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:00,400
You've been upgrading for a while.

1405
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:07,520
So I, I've, I've been looking for a desktop that has better tech, technical fundamentals

1406
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:14,360
than gnome shell and I've been looking for a desktop that is more prepared for Wayland

1407
01:13:14,360 --> 01:13:20,080
and I've been looking for something that feels like it takes advantage of my hardware and

1408
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:25,480
I've been looking for something that doesn't slow down after four or five days of uptime

1409
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:30,200
because all of my systems are a feature we borrowed from windows.

1410
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:31,200
Yeah.

1411
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:35,420
Well, that's really where I got to with gnome shell is I got to the point where I needed

1412
01:13:35,420 --> 01:13:39,120
to load a certain set of extensions to make it usable, but that seems to bring a certain

1413
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:46,760
level of instability and I thought back to when I used to use Mac OS system six and I

1414
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:52,440
was installing extensions that would rip code out of memory and inject their own code and

1415
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:58,480
I, and I thought about how things didn't, didn't properly have isolated processes and

1416
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:07,800
I started to get angry because that was 1987 and we knew those problems existed and somehow

1417
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:14,040
when gnome shell was invented years later, when we knew about all of these mistakes,

1418
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:19,240
they repeated the same sins because they needed to punt on bigger issues that they didn't

1419
01:14:19,240 --> 01:14:27,400
have answers to certain security issues and IPC issues and it has led to a desktop that

1420
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:33,320
honestly like we have this super computer operating system underneath it and it is,

1421
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:40,280
it is crashy as, as windows 98 se and I'm not windows 98 se was a great release of windows

1422
01:14:40,280 --> 01:14:46,240
and if you put the plus pack on there, that shit was choice, but it still would crash

1423
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:51,640
like a bitch and gnome crashes like a bitch all the time.

1424
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:57,280
Before this show started, we dumped our live stream because the gnome shell crashed on

1425
01:14:57,280 --> 01:14:58,280
us.

1426
01:14:58,280 --> 01:15:00,440
It's just sad and true.

1427
01:15:00,440 --> 01:15:01,920
It's too much.

1428
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:02,920
It's too much.

1429
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:08,400
Like what is the point of all of these years of open source innovation just to straddle

1430
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:15,200
ourselves to a technically incompetent desktop environment and I just got angry as I thought

1431
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:20,020
about this and I came to a realization that I could no longer come on the air and I could

1432
01:15:20,020 --> 01:15:26,040
no longer recommend that people try out desktop environments based on gnome shell.

1433
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:28,000
I just couldn't honestly do it.

1434
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:34,400
I would feel like a phony if I told you that's a desktop environment you should be using

1435
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:41,160
and that's pretty fucking scary for me because I 11 years into this, this is the first time

1436
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:45,400
I've ever felt this way.

1437
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:52,640
I have to say Chris, having used Unity for six, seven years and then when we switched

1438
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:58,280
to gnome in Ubuntu, I was kind of surprised at the instability of it.

1439
01:15:58,280 --> 01:16:05,680
I was impressed at how fast the Ubuntu desktop team turned around from Unity by default to

1440
01:16:05,680 --> 01:16:10,040
gnome by default and having something that was prettier than I expected it was going to

1441
01:16:10,040 --> 01:16:11,040
be.

1442
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:18,200
I agree with you it is a bit crashy and I know that there is some work going on upstream

1443
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:23,160
to fix that in the gnome project and in Wayland and mutter and so on but it looks like that

1444
01:16:23,160 --> 01:16:29,200
stuff is kind of some way out, those fundamental architectural changes that are going to be

1445
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:35,440
required to make it rock solid seem a little bit further out than I'm happy with.

1446
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:38,760
So I decided to join you on your journey with KDE Neon.

1447
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:41,280
I'm really excited about that.

1448
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:46,280
You're welcome.

1449
01:16:46,280 --> 01:16:50,440
I keep getting pings from Wimpy saying hey so how are you liking that KDE Neon?

1450
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:51,440
How are you liking it?

1451
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:53,240
I'm curious how are you liking it?

1452
01:16:53,240 --> 01:16:57,320
So do you want the full beans or just the high level?

1453
01:16:57,320 --> 01:17:00,640
I want the full beans because I have a feeling both you and I are going to have a totally

1454
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:02,200
different perspective by next week.

1455
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:05,840
That's my sense of it right now.

1456
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:09,560
There's been a couple of frustrations, niggles, and one of them I filed a bug upstream in

1457
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:13,400
KDE to let them know there's a bug there.

1458
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:19,000
It was all jolly fun downloading the ISO at the gate at the airport in Seattle.

1459
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:24,200
We tried over the airport Wi-Fi and it was just too slow so I downloaded the ISO image

1460
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:31,480
over 3G roaming on my phone and then Wimpy dragged the ISO off my phone and put it onto

1461
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:36,560
a USB stick and we tried the install at 30,000 feet on the flight bell.

1462
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:41,680
I'm installing it on a ThinkPad T450 that's had Linux on it for ages so I know Linux works

1463
01:17:41,680 --> 01:17:43,320
perfectly fine on this thing.

1464
01:17:43,320 --> 01:17:48,240
Unfortunately we discovered a bug that you can't install KDE Neon offline.

1465
01:17:48,240 --> 01:17:51,200
It refuses to install the grub bootloader.

1466
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:52,600
Noah ran into that same problem too.

1467
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:56,440
I think if you have an EFI system, if you have a legacy boot system I think it'll work

1468
01:17:56,440 --> 01:17:57,440
okay.

1469
01:17:57,440 --> 01:17:59,360
Right and I couldn't do that.

1470
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:03,800
I couldn't even get it to boot with legacy mode.

1471
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:08,600
I don't know how many times we tried but we tried a lot of different options in the BIOS

1472
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:14,360
in order to get it to boot and when we got it to boot it wouldn't install so Wimpy after

1473
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:20,780
we sat there and ruminated over a glass of wine on the flight, I know right, he said

1474
01:18:20,780 --> 01:18:24,080
I think I know what this is, you need to be online for that to work because the message

1475
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:28,600
doesn't indicate that's the problem, it just says I can't install this package and sure

1476
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:33,680
enough when I got home I put the same USB key in, connected it to the LAN, did exactly

1477
01:18:33,680 --> 01:18:37,320
the same steps, the install succeeded perfectly fine.

1478
01:18:37,320 --> 01:18:41,360
So that out of the way, I filed a bug and I'm sure they'll fix that and that's great.

1479
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:45,480
Yeah I know they know about it, that won't affect everyone because most people are connected

1480
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:46,480
these days.

1481
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:48,080
Not on the plane.

1482
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:53,840
Right but that aside and one other niggle with the trackpad that's been irritating the

1483
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:58,360
hell out of me, you can't turn the trackpad off.

1484
01:18:58,360 --> 01:19:02,360
I was wondering about that, I had not tried that yet.

1485
01:19:02,360 --> 01:19:07,480
You kind of can, there is an option where it tries to be smart and say turn the trackpad

1486
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:11,280
off when there's a mouse plugged in to say oh well he's got a mouse, he doesn't need

1487
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:18,120
the trackpad but it's not smart enough and my ThinkPad has a nipple obviously and it

1488
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:23,200
thinks that's a mouse so there's a set of exceptions where you can say turn the trackpad

1489
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:29,940
off if there's a mouse connected but not if there's a touch point or nipple connected.

1490
01:19:29,940 --> 01:19:33,840
So if I remove all of those exceptions I can force it to disable the trackpad which is

1491
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:38,800
what I want, I personally don't use trackpads but then it wakes itself up every so often.

1492
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:43,080
I don't know whether it's waking up from suspend or on a reboot but sometimes the trackpad

1493
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:47,960
just turns itself back on again and it's so infuriating because I find I end up clicking

1494
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:53,120
buttons that I didn't intend to because I've got fat thumbs that rest on the trackpad right.

1495
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:57,820
So those two issues aside and those are the only two issues I've had really to speak of,

1496
01:19:57,820 --> 01:19:59,320
the others are just tiny little niggles.

1497
01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:02,720
I've been really impressed with it, it's really really nice, it's quick like you say it wakes

1498
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:03,720
up nice and fast.

1499
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:04,720
You've noticed that too?

1500
01:20:04,720 --> 01:20:08,920
Yep definitely, the battery life feels longer but I've only had it installed for a couple

1501
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:14,880
of days so I can't really say but I'm speaking to you from a snap of a mumble on KDE Neon.

1502
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:15,880
That is awesome.

1503
01:20:15,880 --> 01:20:16,880
There you go, it works.

1504
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:19,960
How do you all feel about the efficiency of it?

1505
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:22,840
I mean in terms of KDE resources?

1506
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:28,260
In terms of like if you looked into the applications that you previously run on a difference DE

1507
01:20:28,260 --> 01:20:32,440
then run it inside of Plasma and see that there's actually improvement on pretty much

1508
01:20:32,440 --> 01:20:33,440
everything.

1509
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:35,560
Especially if you're a QoS user.

1510
01:20:35,560 --> 01:20:40,920
So I have switched to Firefox here because I'm using as many of the default apps as I

1511
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:45,920
can but I also had to install some other things so I installed the Telegram snap, the Slack

1512
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:51,760
snap, the mumble slap, VS Code snap, but on top I haven't really installed anything from

1513
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:57,880
the archive, I've only installed snaps on top of KDE Neon and that's kind of where I

1514
01:20:57,880 --> 01:21:00,040
am right now but it's working really well.

1515
01:21:00,040 --> 01:21:04,540
If you go grab the user edition, there's two versions of the user edition, user edition

1516
01:21:04,540 --> 01:21:05,880
and user edition LTS.

1517
01:21:05,880 --> 01:21:08,000
That's the one I got.

1518
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:13,600
And producer Michael, do you know when does the LTS version of Neon get the new LTS of

1519
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:16,760
Plasma desktop which just came out today?

1520
01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:21,600
It's not as quick as the regular user version but they haven't specified exactly an ETA

1521
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:22,600
yet.

1522
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:23,600
It eventually lands there though.

1523
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:28,120
Yeah, the issue is that this is the first time there's been a switch from an LTS to

1524
01:21:28,120 --> 01:21:32,200
an LTS on the Neon existence.

1525
01:21:32,200 --> 01:21:36,920
And then there's an 1804 switch coming up too so it's kind of interesting times.

1526
01:21:36,920 --> 01:21:40,040
But Popey, you know how you were having that Dropbox menu issue?

1527
01:21:40,040 --> 01:21:44,880
I think the difference between that is that I'm on 5.11 and now 5.12 whereas you're on

1528
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:45,880
5.8.

1529
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:53,520
Yeah, I think I'm happy to test it, whatever version I've got and when I come to upgrade,

1530
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:54,520
maybe we'll see.

1531
01:21:54,520 --> 01:21:57,200
Well, you should get 5.12 pretty soon I would think.

1532
01:21:57,200 --> 01:21:58,920
So you and I will be in sync pretty soon.

1533
01:21:58,920 --> 01:22:00,480
Yeah, I'm not going to force it.

1534
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:04,320
I'm going to keep what's on here on here because that's the experience that I got through downloading

1535
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:05,760
the ISO and installing it.

1536
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:08,280
But I am quite happy with what I've got.

1537
01:22:08,280 --> 01:22:12,220
I've been able to customize it a little bit, tweak the theme, change the mouse cursors

1538
01:22:12,220 --> 01:22:14,640
and stuff like that.

1539
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:16,320
I'm pretty happy with it.

1540
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:17,320
It's a nice setup.

1541
01:22:17,320 --> 01:22:18,320
Me too.

1542
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:19,320
I did Breezedark.

1543
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:20,600
I went to Breezedark and here's the thing.

1544
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:23,280
So I want to invite the audience to try this too.

1545
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:26,400
Go get KDE Neon and grab one of the user editions.

1546
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:28,080
I'm on the main user edition.

1547
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:29,720
They're still using the LTS base.

1548
01:22:29,720 --> 01:22:35,860
So if you get user edition, it's the stable version of Plasma with a Ubuntu LTS base.

1549
01:22:35,860 --> 01:22:41,640
If you go get the Neon LTS, you're getting Ubuntu LTS as well as the Plasma LTS, which

1550
01:22:41,640 --> 01:22:45,440
is what like Popeye is on and Noah is using that as well.

1551
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:52,560
I'm on user edition, which is just today got Plasma 5.12, super smooth upgrade, really

1552
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:55,240
great desktop.

1553
01:22:55,240 --> 01:22:59,560
Once you put on Breezedark mode and I invite you to also go into the GTK application settings

1554
01:22:59,560 --> 01:23:06,480
and turn on dark mode stuff there, I tell you what, I've never in – using KDE since

1555
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:13,080
version 2, I have never had an experience where GTK applications and Qt applications

1556
01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:19,360
look so close to the same look and design.

1557
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:24,440
It's better than when I have a GNOME desktop or a Unity desktop and I pseudo an application

1558
01:23:24,440 --> 01:23:29,800
like the NVIDIA settings and then the NVIDIA settings launches and its theme doesn't – that

1559
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:32,280
doesn't happen anymore under my Plasma desktop.

1560
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:37,440
Like my GTK applications are actually more consistent under my Plasma desktop than they

1561
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:40,520
were under my GNOME and Unity 7 desktops.

1562
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:45,680
One of the things I used to be kind of resistant to KDE was like the plethora of settings and

1563
01:23:45,680 --> 01:23:48,360
I know some people love to be able to twiddle and tweak everything.

1564
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:51,200
I'm not – I don't do that so much.

1565
01:23:51,200 --> 01:23:55,360
When I would find some of these like billion dialogues with loads of radio buttons and

1566
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:59,600
sliders and stuff, I would find that overwhelming and I didn't really like it.

1567
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:05,200
But the way that some of the things have been presented like if I click on the battery,

1568
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:09,280
this laptop has two batteries and if I click on the battery icon, I see the gauges for

1569
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:13,320
both of them really easily and clearly and if I click on the network thing, I can see

1570
01:24:13,320 --> 01:24:18,240
the network I'm connected to and the up and down network traffic and stuff like that.

1571
01:24:18,240 --> 01:24:20,560
It's just – it's really classy.

1572
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:24,200
I really like the exposing those details without it being overwhelming.

1573
01:24:24,200 --> 01:24:25,920
Yeah, exactly.

1574
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:26,920
And there's a system tray.

1575
01:24:26,920 --> 01:24:31,640
Yeah, that is nice to have all of my icons in the system tray just work.

1576
01:24:31,640 --> 01:24:32,640
That is really nice.

1577
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:33,640
Yeah.

1578
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:37,080
There's actually – you can customize the system tray too so that you can say – let's

1579
01:24:37,080 --> 01:24:41,520
say an application shows up in the tray that you don't want it maybe for whatever reason,

1580
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:44,600
you can just go in and individually hide any application you don't want to show.

1581
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:47,880
It will still be accessible through the tray but it won't be on the panel.

1582
01:24:47,880 --> 01:24:52,560
I really appreciate the smoothness of Kaywin so the installation that I'm presenting

1583
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:57,480
right now on screen, this has been running now for about eight days, nine days without

1584
01:24:57,480 --> 01:24:58,480
reboot.

1585
01:24:58,480 --> 01:24:59,480
It's just been super solid.

1586
01:24:59,480 --> 01:25:05,120
It's just – because one of the things I was running into is about four days of uptime,

1587
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:07,840
I was having just this grinding performance.

1588
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:11,440
I shared a video in the Jupiter Broadcasting Telegram group and where even my – just

1589
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:13,100
everything ground to a halt.

1590
01:25:13,100 --> 01:25:14,100
And so now –

1591
01:25:14,100 --> 01:25:15,100
The system is just unusable.

1592
01:25:15,100 --> 01:25:17,280
Now I've doubled that time so far and it hasn't run into that issue.

1593
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:18,280
I'm the same hardware.

1594
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:19,280
Same –

1595
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:23,600
For that same reference, I've done a month and a half without rebooting.

1596
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:24,600
Oh!

1597
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:25,600
Okay.

1598
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:26,600
Mr. Fan.

1599
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:27,600
Yeah.

1600
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:28,600
I'm not a fan of rebooting.

1601
01:25:28,600 --> 01:25:30,640
I like to leave my systems up a lot.

1602
01:25:30,640 --> 01:25:37,640
And one thing that I haven't – are you using KD with Wayland or are you on X11 because

1603
01:25:37,640 --> 01:25:39,640
I didn't make – there didn't seem to be an option.

1604
01:25:39,640 --> 01:25:40,640
No, I don't know.

1605
01:25:40,640 --> 01:25:41,640
I didn't choose anything.

1606
01:25:41,640 --> 01:25:42,640
Yeah.

1607
01:25:42,640 --> 01:25:44,440
But I know I'm on X11 because I've seen the environment set up.

1608
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:46,120
So I don't know why.

1609
01:25:46,120 --> 01:25:47,840
My version is mainly X.

1610
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:48,840
Okay.

1611
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:50,960
So if I upgrade, maybe I'll get Wayland.

1612
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:51,960
Right.

1613
01:25:51,960 --> 01:25:53,320
You'll have the ability to use Wayland.

1614
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:57,880
I wouldn't say that Wayland is ready really to be as a primary anyway.

1615
01:25:57,880 --> 01:26:01,600
It's more ready than Gnome's feature but –

1616
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:07,000
Wayland is already the worst kept secret in the world.

1617
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:12,520
I was just saying like there is some kind of like – some misstatements about the Wayland

1618
01:26:12,520 --> 01:26:14,560
support in Plasma.

1619
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:17,640
It's a lot better than pretty much anything else I've tried.

1620
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:19,200
But it's still Wayland.

1621
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:22,040
I'll look forward to trying it when I get the upgrade.

1622
01:26:22,040 --> 01:26:23,040
If I get the upgrade.

1623
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:27,480
Well, so I wanted to just say I do feel like there's still quite a bit of defaults I

1624
01:26:27,480 --> 01:26:31,920
change but my perspective on it has changed a bit because I feel like I go through it

1625
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:35,080
once when I set up a system and then I just set them all.

1626
01:26:35,080 --> 01:26:36,080
Like I run Dolph.

1627
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:37,080
I just go through console.

1628
01:26:37,080 --> 01:26:39,680
I just run everything and I set it once.

1629
01:26:39,680 --> 01:26:41,160
And once I've set it, it sticks.

1630
01:26:41,160 --> 01:26:42,800
And that's been really nice.

1631
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:43,800
It won't lose it.

1632
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:49,000
I've – after years of using, I've been using Plasma itself for – since like five

1633
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:52,280
years now and I have not lost any of my settings.

1634
01:26:52,280 --> 01:26:56,120
As long as you save the files that they're put in, you're good to go.

1635
01:26:56,120 --> 01:26:59,560
Well, except for my touchpad setting but we'll gloss over that one.

1636
01:26:59,560 --> 01:27:00,560
Yeah.

1637
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:01,560
Actually, I'll talk to you about the show.

1638
01:27:01,560 --> 01:27:02,560
I think I might have a solution for that.

1639
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:03,560
Excellent.

1640
01:27:03,560 --> 01:27:04,560
Good.

1641
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:06,640
So I invite you guys to try it out and just give it a shot.

1642
01:27:06,640 --> 01:27:08,000
You know, change the defaults as you need.

1643
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:09,240
Maybe put the dark theme on there.

1644
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:10,680
It's all pretty nice and play with it.

1645
01:27:10,680 --> 01:27:17,040
I – you know, to the point that you asked about resources, I actually noticed a pretty

1646
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:22,000
huge improvement which directly translated to more battery life on a laptop that's three

1647
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:23,040
years old.

1648
01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:26,400
And I went from getting an hour and a half battery life now to four hours of battery

1649
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:33,140
life with a combination of switching to Plasma but also I dropped Chrome and tried Vivaldi

1650
01:27:33,140 --> 01:27:41,280
for a bit and then just settled on Firefox, significant performance impact difference

1651
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:42,280
on my machine.

1652
01:27:42,280 --> 01:27:45,080
I get better battery – I get significantly better battery life with Firefox.

1653
01:27:45,080 --> 01:27:46,080
Is that right?

1654
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:47,080
Yeah.

1655
01:27:47,080 --> 01:27:48,080
And the combination of Plasma.

1656
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:49,080
30% lighter browser.

1657
01:27:49,080 --> 01:27:50,080
It's huge.

1658
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:51,080
That's their benchmark.

1659
01:27:51,080 --> 01:27:57,920
Well, I mean, I go from two hours to four hours with the combination of Chrome and Plasma

1660
01:27:57,920 --> 01:27:58,920
and Firefox.

1661
01:27:58,920 --> 01:27:59,920
It's much better.

1662
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:00,920
It's a whole new you.

1663
01:28:00,920 --> 01:28:02,200
That's their marketed percentage.

1664
01:28:02,200 --> 01:28:06,160
Maybe it's actually better depending on your structure of how you set it up.

1665
01:28:06,160 --> 01:28:10,960
But the other thing that's kind of nice is certain notifications from Firefox or whatnot

1666
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:14,680
integrate in with Plasma's native notification system.

1667
01:28:14,680 --> 01:28:15,680
So like download notification.

1668
01:28:15,680 --> 01:28:18,680
It really does feel like a consistent experience and I'm impressed.

1669
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:19,680
Yes.

1670
01:28:19,680 --> 01:28:20,680
Firefox –

1671
01:28:20,680 --> 01:28:23,160
Just so you know, in the future, that's actually getting better.

1672
01:28:23,160 --> 01:28:24,840
Yeah, like download status, right?

1673
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:26,840
And media playback controls and whatnot?

1674
01:28:26,840 --> 01:28:27,840
Yeah.

1675
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:29,880
The playback – you have a YouTube video playing.

1676
01:28:29,880 --> 01:28:32,600
It'll be connected to the media player inside of the panel.

1677
01:28:32,600 --> 01:28:33,600
So you can just like –

1678
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:34,600
Right.

1679
01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:37,840
Everything – the best thing about it is that you can have custom shortcuts to that

1680
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:38,840
media panel.

1681
01:28:38,840 --> 01:28:42,680
So you can be a global like play and pause for YouTube anywhere.

1682
01:28:42,680 --> 01:28:43,680
Yeah.

1683
01:28:43,680 --> 01:28:46,960
So just if you didn't catch that, what he's saying there is literally like you could have

1684
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:50,200
a YouTube video playing and you could click on like the volume controller and hit pause.

1685
01:28:50,200 --> 01:28:52,640
It'll pause the YouTube video in a tab somewhere.

1686
01:28:52,640 --> 01:28:55,520
And that's super nice when you have like a multi monitor setup and you have YouTube

1687
01:28:55,520 --> 01:28:57,600
thrown up on one of the screens.

1688
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:59,760
And the other thing – I'll just leave it with this and then we'll move on because

1689
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:01,160
the Ask Noah show is just coming up.

1690
01:29:01,160 --> 01:29:06,440
But I – the thing that pushed me over to try this was – and maybe you remember the

1691
01:29:06,440 --> 01:29:09,800
details, Michael, but I forgot the names.

1692
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:11,680
I think it was Deal Moto but I can't remember.

1693
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:14,200
There was a semi-critical review.

1694
01:29:14,200 --> 01:29:19,440
It was basically a review of Plasma 512 and it said, here's all the rough edges that

1695
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:23,520
I perceive and these are the things that I would do differently.

1696
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:27,440
And if you've watched The Gnome Project, you've witnessed how they handle that kind

1697
01:29:27,440 --> 01:29:29,000
of feedback a few times.

1698
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:35,040
And so I kid you not, I popped my popcorn, I got myself my beverage, I sat down in front

1699
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:41,240
of my computer, I brought up the planet.kde.com page and I thought, okay, let's watch their

1700
01:29:41,240 --> 01:29:42,600
responses to this.

1701
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:44,600
This should be a shit show.

1702
01:29:44,600 --> 01:29:51,920
And what I saw was developers in the Plasma project that took point by point the reviews,

1703
01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:56,760
critiques of the Plasma desktop and either pointed them to existing bugs or converted

1704
01:29:56,760 --> 01:30:01,800
them to new bugs and ideas and was completely receptive to the feedback to the constructive

1705
01:30:01,800 --> 01:30:05,480
criticism and turned it around into things that they're going to implement into the

1706
01:30:05,480 --> 01:30:09,040
Plasma project or things that they're already working on.

1707
01:30:09,040 --> 01:30:14,920
And when I saw that, it really clicked with me that there's a different level of interaction

1708
01:30:14,920 --> 01:30:16,200
with what the community wants.

1709
01:30:16,200 --> 01:30:20,360
There's a different level of weight put on what the community wants.

1710
01:30:20,360 --> 01:30:23,480
You can hear that's why the dogs are barking because they believe it too.

1711
01:30:23,480 --> 01:30:24,840
They're barking for Plasma.

1712
01:30:24,840 --> 01:30:29,980
So if that sounds appealing to you, if you want to bark for Plasma, I recommend going

1713
01:30:29,980 --> 01:30:34,080
to neon.kde.org, go get the user edition, try it out.

1714
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:35,080
Become a Plasma puppy.

1715
01:30:35,080 --> 01:30:39,180
Yeah, become a Plasma puppy, you're a Plasma puppy.

1716
01:30:39,180 --> 01:30:44,740
And just give it a go because there's interesting new things happening there and I've really

1717
01:30:44,740 --> 01:30:45,740
been enjoying it.

1718
01:30:45,740 --> 01:30:48,680
I'll come back next week and I'll tell you if something's gone wrong, you know I'll tell

1719
01:30:48,680 --> 01:30:49,680
you about it.

1720
01:30:49,680 --> 01:30:52,880
But I don't know, I'm pretty impressed with it.

1721
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:53,880
I'm really enjoying it.

1722
01:30:53,880 --> 01:31:00,800
I think one statement is if you're new to the Plasma experience, you should know that

1723
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:05,680
Neon is kind of like a minimal approach to a distro.

1724
01:31:05,680 --> 01:31:09,060
You're not going to get, LibreOffice is not included, you're not going to get any kind

1725
01:31:09,060 --> 01:31:14,040
of office suite or you're going to get the only media player you'll get is the VLC, things

1726
01:31:14,040 --> 01:31:15,040
like that.

1727
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:20,020
So if you don't know what you want, it's not meant for the base level beginner.

1728
01:31:20,020 --> 01:31:23,520
But if you have a rough idea of what applications you want, then it's great.

1729
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:26,360
Yeah that's a more minimal approach, which is kind of how I prefer it.

1730
01:31:26,360 --> 01:31:27,360
It's kind of awesome, yeah.

1731
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:28,360
Yeah, I prefer that.

1732
01:31:28,360 --> 01:31:29,880
LTS base, install whatever I want.

1733
01:31:29,880 --> 01:31:34,360
So you loaded on your rig before the show started and you've been sort of tweaking it

1734
01:31:34,360 --> 01:31:35,720
a little bit as the show's gone on.

1735
01:31:35,720 --> 01:31:36,720
What do you think?

1736
01:31:36,720 --> 01:31:37,720
What are your initial impressions on it?

1737
01:31:37,720 --> 01:31:39,660
And how will this machine give us a benchmark?

1738
01:31:39,660 --> 01:31:40,660
It's like four years old?

1739
01:31:40,660 --> 01:31:41,660
Yeah.

1740
01:31:41,660 --> 01:31:43,720
Yeah, so it's not the BPS, but it's been great.

1741
01:31:43,720 --> 01:31:44,720
The install was super simple.

1742
01:31:44,720 --> 01:31:52,520
It got all of my EFI things sorted out without any issues, which was a surprising delight.

1743
01:31:52,520 --> 01:31:53,520
A delight, you say?

1744
01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:54,520
A delight.

1745
01:31:54,520 --> 01:31:55,520
Yes, absolutely.

1746
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:59,160
And that's been kind of my weak spot is not having a ton of plasma experience, so not

1747
01:31:59,160 --> 01:32:01,560
necessarily knowing where all the settings were.

1748
01:32:01,560 --> 01:32:03,280
And I was really comfortable with a default GNOME.

1749
01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:08,640
I was not a huge GNOME plugin user, so I had somewhat less, I mean a couple plugins, sure,

1750
01:32:08,640 --> 01:32:11,180
but somewhat less issues with crashing or stability.

1751
01:32:11,180 --> 01:32:12,480
And I also tend to reboot my system.

1752
01:32:12,480 --> 01:32:17,440
So I have basically none of your problems, but I'm still having a fantastic time.

1753
01:32:17,440 --> 01:32:19,360
It's super consistent.

1754
01:32:19,360 --> 01:32:24,880
It's really fast and smooth, and maybe a couple pastimes a couple years ago, like when I was

1755
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:30,760
last doing a dedicated plasma try, I did try to give it time, but I didn't get it to a

1756
01:32:30,760 --> 01:32:34,240
place where the default or where the time I had made it a system that I really liked

1757
01:32:34,240 --> 01:32:35,800
compared to what I had in GNOME.

1758
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:38,200
But right now, I mean, I think I can just keep using this.

1759
01:32:38,200 --> 01:32:39,200
Really?

1760
01:32:39,200 --> 01:32:42,040
I'm going to try to convince the KD18 to let me change the defaults.

1761
01:32:42,040 --> 01:32:44,440
Yeah, because it's not that I don't like it.

1762
01:32:44,440 --> 01:32:47,360
I actually really appreciate the ability to tweak things.

1763
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:50,320
I just don't always, you know, I want to be able to fresh install and just work.

1764
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:56,720
The fact that there's so many like silly defaults that like, you know, like just like a couple

1765
01:32:56,720 --> 01:33:00,800
months ago was the first time they introduced the folder view as by default, so you have

1766
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:04,360
desktop icons like that, you know, okay, it's been a decade.

1767
01:33:04,360 --> 01:33:08,080
You know, and I know, I think there's already a bug open about this, but there's others.

1768
01:33:08,080 --> 01:33:09,360
There's like low hanging fruit.

1769
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:13,440
Like when I'm on a high DPI display and I open up Dolphin or I open up system settings

1770
01:33:13,440 --> 01:33:19,640
and it's like taking 10% of my screen up in the corner and like I have to like resize everything

1771
01:33:19,640 --> 01:33:20,720
for the first day.

1772
01:33:20,720 --> 01:33:24,000
I'm resizing all of the windows for the first day.

1773
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:28,560
And you know, the one thing I'll say is it remembers the size.

1774
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:31,520
God dang it if I don't love that about console.

1775
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:33,080
Console is the same place, the same size.

1776
01:33:33,080 --> 01:33:34,520
I open it every single time.

1777
01:33:34,520 --> 01:33:36,440
Man, oh man, do I appreciate that.

1778
01:33:36,440 --> 01:33:41,160
So I only have to resize it once, but every single thing gets resized every time I open

1779
01:33:41,160 --> 01:33:43,220
it for the first time on the plasma desktop.

1780
01:33:43,220 --> 01:33:50,280
Here's one quick, super cool tip about the window, the Kwin structure in plasma is the,

1781
01:33:50,280 --> 01:33:53,960
when you, let's say for example, you'd like to maximize windows, but you don't want the

1782
01:33:53,960 --> 01:33:59,080
title bar to take up space, you can remove the decorations from any application at any

1783
01:33:59,080 --> 01:34:00,080
point.

1784
01:34:00,080 --> 01:34:01,080
Oh, interesting.

1785
01:34:01,080 --> 01:34:03,720
So whether it's maximized or not, you just go, you just right click it, choose more options

1786
01:34:03,720 --> 01:34:06,600
to right click the title bar, choose more options and then click no border.

1787
01:34:06,600 --> 01:34:10,840
And it just removes the decoration so you can maximize and you know, use as much screen

1788
01:34:10,840 --> 01:34:11,840
as possible.

1789
01:34:11,840 --> 01:34:12,840
I'm trying that out right now.

1790
01:34:12,840 --> 01:34:13,840
Oh my God.

1791
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:14,840
That's amazing.

1792
01:34:14,840 --> 01:34:15,840
Wow.

1793
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:16,840
Nice tip.

1794
01:34:16,840 --> 01:34:21,160
You can actually also script it so it automatically does it on individual applications and make

1795
01:34:21,160 --> 01:34:23,400
them specific sizes and all kinds of stuff.

1796
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:24,400
Yeah.

1797
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:25,580
I've been taking advantage of like window rules too.

1798
01:34:25,580 --> 01:34:29,080
So that way Spotify, if I've launched that, always opens on desktop four cause I don't

1799
01:34:29,080 --> 01:34:30,680
want that crap anywhere near me.

1800
01:34:30,680 --> 01:34:32,880
So I always open that up on desktop four.

1801
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:35,080
So I invite you guys to try it out too.

1802
01:34:35,080 --> 01:34:36,400
Give it a go and let us know.

1803
01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:40,120
We'll give you our followup conclusions if we're sticking with it or not in next week's

1804
01:34:40,120 --> 01:34:41,120
episode.

1805
01:34:41,120 --> 01:34:42,720
Our conversation doesn't end here either.

1806
01:34:42,720 --> 01:34:46,960
In fact, Ask Noah is coming up just a little bit after the show and Noah is all in on the

1807
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:48,880
big plasma experiment too.

1808
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:49,880
Are you ready?

1809
01:34:49,880 --> 01:34:50,880
Are you ready Noah?

1810
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:51,880
Have you loaded your systems?

1811
01:34:51,880 --> 01:34:54,840
Have you done the mass formatting, the nuke and paves like I have?

1812
01:34:54,840 --> 01:34:55,840
Yeah.

1813
01:34:55,840 --> 01:34:56,840
Yeah.

1814
01:34:56,840 --> 01:34:57,840
Caught your infection.

1815
01:34:57,840 --> 01:34:59,320
We're all infected.

1816
01:34:59,320 --> 01:35:00,320
Yeah.

1817
01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:01,320
Yeah.

1818
01:35:01,320 --> 01:35:04,280
Well I got home and I was like, wow, I give this a shot and I put it on a, you know, on

1819
01:35:04,280 --> 01:35:05,280
the bench machine, right?

1820
01:35:05,280 --> 01:35:06,280
The one that doesn't matter.

1821
01:35:06,280 --> 01:35:07,280
The one that it's powerful.

1822
01:35:07,280 --> 01:35:10,400
I can play with it, but that's just, I try it for a little bit and then I move back to

1823
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:15,760
what I know will work, except they didn't went and did my work computer.

1824
01:35:15,760 --> 01:35:20,760
And then I actually, so my, the machine downstairs, I, and I hate to admit this, but it's the

1825
01:35:20,760 --> 01:35:21,760
truth.

1826
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:24,260
It, you know, it's been running for fedora for so long.

1827
01:35:24,260 --> 01:35:28,580
It's run every, that, that position, not the same physical hardware, but has run every

1828
01:35:28,580 --> 01:35:31,680
single version of fedora since fedora core one.

1829
01:35:31,680 --> 01:35:35,400
And after it, well how it took me, it took me the entire week and took me three days

1830
01:35:35,400 --> 01:35:37,840
to get everything moved off of there.

1831
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:38,840
Yeah.

1832
01:35:38,840 --> 01:35:40,280
And now that's running plasma as well.

1833
01:35:40,280 --> 01:35:41,280
Really?

1834
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:42,280
Wow.

1835
01:35:42,280 --> 01:35:43,280
Yeah.

1836
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:44,280
I went to Katie and neon.

1837
01:35:44,280 --> 01:35:45,280
I have a sense.

1838
01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:47,120
This might be a topic in today's episode of the ask Noah show.

1839
01:35:47,120 --> 01:35:50,520
I might, we might mention, we might talk about it just a little bit.

1840
01:35:50,520 --> 01:35:52,040
I'm really enjoying it.

1841
01:35:52,040 --> 01:35:55,520
I mean, I, so far this could all, you know, this is the funny thing is the, if the first

1842
01:35:55,520 --> 01:35:59,560
week or so, it's always like that new relationship, you're like, Oh, this is great.

1843
01:35:59,560 --> 01:36:00,560
As is so great.

1844
01:36:00,560 --> 01:36:02,720
Like when you get a new car, it still smells like you haven't figured out what you hate

1845
01:36:02,720 --> 01:36:03,720
about it.

1846
01:36:03,720 --> 01:36:04,720
Yeah.

1847
01:36:04,720 --> 01:36:05,720
Like the dog hasn't crapped in my new car yet.

1848
01:36:05,720 --> 01:36:09,100
You know, once the dog craps in the car, the smell changes and that may happen over the

1849
01:36:09,100 --> 01:36:13,120
next week, but I don't think we've ever tried anything like this where so many of us are

1850
01:36:13,120 --> 01:36:16,120
giving it a go because not only are several of us here in the mumble room giving it a

1851
01:36:16,120 --> 01:36:20,380
go, but, and it's, uh, Noah's giving it a go and it's, it's, this is transpiring across

1852
01:36:20,380 --> 01:36:24,880
the ask Noah show, but also there's a whole bunch of people in the telegram group and

1853
01:36:24,880 --> 01:36:27,080
on Twitter that are also giving this a go.

1854
01:36:27,080 --> 01:36:28,640
So if you want to join in, you still can.

1855
01:36:28,640 --> 01:36:30,340
We have a week that we're trying it.

1856
01:36:30,340 --> 01:36:33,560
Just give me a hashtag so that way I can filter all of this.

1857
01:36:33,560 --> 01:36:36,220
And we are trying to solve the shit show that is the desktop.

1858
01:36:36,220 --> 01:36:41,080
So give me your feedback either in telegram, discord or on Twitter, whatever it is, and

1859
01:36:41,080 --> 01:36:47,440
then append it with hashtag shit show one word that way we can find it and we'll review

1860
01:36:47,440 --> 01:36:48,440
everybody's thoughts.

1861
01:36:48,440 --> 01:36:52,820
So this is going to be a meta review like we've never done on any of our shows before

1862
01:36:52,820 --> 01:36:57,800
crossing multiple shows, crossing multiple communities and multiple different people

1863
01:36:57,800 --> 01:37:03,400
that are, have tons of different preferences who will hold out, who will be the final plasma

1864
01:37:03,400 --> 01:37:05,240
user after all of this.

1865
01:37:05,240 --> 01:37:07,000
And what will the reward be?

1866
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:08,800
Stay tuned and find out.

1867
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:13,120
But in the meantime, that does bring us to the end of this week's broadcast.

1868
01:37:13,120 --> 01:37:14,120
Hope you enjoyed it.

1869
01:37:14,120 --> 01:37:16,680
I encourage you to join us live.

1870
01:37:16,680 --> 01:37:18,400
It's really like a Linux sandwich.

1871
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:19,400
Yeah.

1872
01:37:19,400 --> 01:37:21,600
And probably if you do, you'll end up getting switched to Katie and neon.

1873
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:22,880
So just do it today.

1874
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:23,880
Yeah.

1875
01:37:23,880 --> 01:37:24,880
Go over to jblive.tv.

1876
01:37:24,880 --> 01:37:30,160
It kicks off at 2 PM Pacific, really one 30 ish, but just go to Jupiter broadcasting.com

1877
01:37:30,160 --> 01:37:31,160
slash calendar.

1878
01:37:31,160 --> 01:37:34,060
Cause everybody knows that you got your own unique time.

1879
01:37:34,060 --> 01:37:35,480
You got to solve that problem.

1880
01:37:35,480 --> 01:37:36,520
It's weird.

1881
01:37:36,520 --> 01:37:38,080
Go get more of poppy and wimpy.

1882
01:37:38,080 --> 01:37:40,300
They have a podcast.

1883
01:37:40,300 --> 01:37:41,440
Will it come back?

1884
01:37:41,440 --> 01:37:42,440
Nobody knows.

1885
01:37:42,440 --> 01:37:45,760
But in the meantime, you can check the back catalog, Ubuntu podcast, go check out Daniel

1886
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:46,760
over at elementary OS.

1887
01:37:46,760 --> 01:37:49,700
And of course the ask Noah show coming up right after this, and we'll see you right

1888
01:37:49,700 --> 01:38:06,800
back here next week.

1889
01:38:20,640 --> 01:38:34,720
All right, Mr. Payne, man, you know, it's great.

1890
01:38:34,720 --> 01:38:35,720
Katie neon.

1891
01:38:35,720 --> 01:38:36,720
Yeah.

1892
01:38:36,720 --> 01:38:39,640
That has been pretty great, but no, after this, you and I are going to go do a massive

1893
01:38:39,640 --> 01:38:41,840
upgrade to the Jupiter broadcasting networks.

1894
01:38:41,840 --> 01:38:43,400
It all go up in flames.

1895
01:38:43,400 --> 01:38:44,400
Who knows?

1896
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:45,400
Who knows?

1897
01:38:45,400 --> 01:38:46,400
We'll report on the text net program.

1898
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:47,400
I will listen to ask no while we do it.

1899
01:38:47,400 --> 01:38:48,400
All right guys.

1900
01:38:48,400 --> 01:38:49,400
Thank you very much.

1901
01:38:49,400 --> 01:38:52,640
You can go to jbtitles.com and you can bang, suggest anybody in the mobile room have a

1902
01:38:52,640 --> 01:38:53,640
title suggestion.

1903
01:38:53,640 --> 01:38:54,640
Feel free to throw it out too.

1904
01:38:54,640 --> 01:38:57,320
We got to name this thing before the ask no show.

1905
01:38:57,320 --> 01:39:03,080
How about bang suggest the ending line is see you back here next Tuesday, not next week.

1906
01:39:03,080 --> 01:39:09,480
You know, a lot of people listen on Wednesdays now I've realized, you know, oh really?

1907
01:39:09,480 --> 01:39:10,480
Yeah.

1908
01:39:10,480 --> 01:39:11,480
Cause we put it out.

1909
01:39:11,480 --> 01:39:12,480
What's their fault?

1910
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:14,160
Well, no, it's cause you know, we're in West coast.

1911
01:39:14,160 --> 01:39:18,260
So you know, I'm just, we're behind everyone and actually get done listening to the ask

1912
01:39:18,260 --> 01:39:19,260
Noah show live.

1913
01:39:19,260 --> 01:39:21,760
Like you're going to go download it, you know, you're spent.

1914
01:39:21,760 --> 01:39:22,760
There was something.

1915
01:39:22,760 --> 01:39:23,760
There was plasma something.

1916
01:39:23,760 --> 01:39:25,760
I like to suggest a title.

1917
01:39:25,760 --> 01:39:26,760
Yeah.

1918
01:39:26,760 --> 01:39:28,620
This is like, it's like a running joke.

1919
01:39:28,620 --> 01:39:32,560
How about the church of neon?

1920
01:39:32,560 --> 01:39:34,900
Now we did have the, we did have the guys on from red hat.

1921
01:39:34,900 --> 01:39:35,960
So maybe the, yeah.

1922
01:39:35,960 --> 01:39:42,200
Or I appreciated how about the Linux Grinch, the Linux Grinch that was good too.

1923
01:39:42,200 --> 01:39:43,860
Worshiping at the church of neon.

1924
01:39:43,860 --> 01:39:45,540
There was something about that's good.

1925
01:39:45,540 --> 01:39:53,940
The church of neon the plasma wave plasma.

1926
01:39:53,940 --> 01:39:57,160
I'm no longer the guy telling people to try out plasma.

1927
01:39:57,160 --> 01:40:01,600
Well, everybody has been, you know, a beard was, you know, I've tried it.

1928
01:40:01,600 --> 01:40:04,320
This isn't actually, I will say I should have said this in the show too.

1929
01:40:04,320 --> 01:40:08,160
The fact that I've tried it before made trying it this time a lot easier because I knew like

1930
01:40:08,160 --> 01:40:09,680
how to enable high DPI support.

1931
01:40:09,680 --> 01:40:10,960
But yeah, you're right.

1932
01:40:10,960 --> 01:40:12,760
You've been on there for a while now.

1933
01:40:12,760 --> 01:40:17,220
The thing is, is the, is the gnome keeps having, the gnome keeps having this, the gnome keeps

1934
01:40:17,220 --> 01:40:20,720
having these big headlines like, Oh, you know, canonical shipping it.

1935
01:40:20,720 --> 01:40:25,520
And now, and then, and then that translates into Dell and system 76 shipping it and all.

1936
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:30,280
So it's just, there's so much momentum there that if, if you were to sit back and just

1937
01:40:30,280 --> 01:40:34,720
legacy problem, I think if you look at about it, like gnome has had the, the people got

1938
01:40:34,720 --> 01:40:38,680
attention to gnome, but it's, it's always had similar issues.

1939
01:40:38,680 --> 01:40:39,680
Yes.

1940
01:40:39,680 --> 01:40:44,680
And the thing is what I'm realizing is there's certain people that have been hip to these

1941
01:40:44,680 --> 01:40:45,960
technical issues.

1942
01:40:45,960 --> 01:40:50,300
It's like, it's been, it's been the biggest public dirty secret that we're only now talking

1943
01:40:50,300 --> 01:40:52,900
about that we're this far into it.

1944
01:40:52,900 --> 01:40:58,520
But there's certain, you realize you look back at you go, Oh, that's why company X did

1945
01:40:58,520 --> 01:40:59,520
Y.

1946
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:00,520
Oh, that's why this group did this.

1947
01:41:00,520 --> 01:41:05,480
There's actually something hilariously I recently just found out about the gnome's website.

1948
01:41:05,480 --> 01:41:10,400
So you know, the you know, that gnome tweak, you could install the extensions from the

1949
01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:11,400
zip files.

1950
01:41:11,400 --> 01:41:12,400
Yeah.

1951
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:17,680
There's, there was a, I was talking to someone and they said that canonical had removed that

1952
01:41:17,680 --> 01:41:18,680
ability in Ubuntu.

1953
01:41:18,680 --> 01:41:20,480
They were like, why do you want us to install things?

1954
01:41:20,480 --> 01:41:22,040
And I was like, that seems weird.

1955
01:41:22,040 --> 01:41:23,340
I don't think they would do that.

1956
01:41:23,340 --> 01:41:30,480
So I looked into it, gnome removed that feature from gnome tweak tool in 326 didn't make a

1957
01:41:30,480 --> 01:41:31,480
fuss about it.

1958
01:41:31,480 --> 01:41:35,720
I never really noticed it except for people started blaming canonical because that was

1959
01:41:35,720 --> 01:41:41,600
the first version that was in 1710 and they just kind of made an assumption.

1960
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:49,080
But what's funny is that if you go to the extensions dot gnome website there for a longest

1961
01:41:49,080 --> 01:41:51,960
time, there was no way to download extensions from that website.

1962
01:41:51,960 --> 01:41:55,720
I even created a script that you could download it and make that work because they make the

1963
01:41:55,720 --> 01:41:58,000
downloads that just don't let you download them.

1964
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:01,640
Now you can download them and not use them.

1965
01:42:01,640 --> 01:42:03,080
That's perfect.

1966
01:42:03,080 --> 01:42:05,080
That's exactly what I want.

1967
01:42:05,080 --> 01:42:06,080
Yeah.

1968
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:07,080
Oh good.

1969
01:42:07,080 --> 01:42:10,960
So I think the hardest thing for me in this transition is that it seems like gnome just

1970
01:42:10,960 --> 01:42:12,720
got the windows 10 style.

1971
01:42:12,720 --> 01:42:17,120
Like when you have a snap, yeah, well the snap and then like the, the middle resize

1972
01:42:17,120 --> 01:42:18,560
and I've been loving that.

1973
01:42:18,560 --> 01:42:21,320
There's some good, there's like, it's got like multidimensional snapping, like check

1974
01:42:21,320 --> 01:42:22,320
this out.

1975
01:42:22,320 --> 01:42:24,440
So here I grab, I'll grab the window here, right?

1976
01:42:24,440 --> 01:42:25,920
Are there keyboard shortcuts for the snap?

1977
01:42:25,920 --> 01:42:26,920
Oh yeah.

1978
01:42:26,920 --> 01:42:27,920
Oh, there's keyboard shortcuts.

1979
01:42:27,920 --> 01:42:31,880
So you can do like, like I can do just this quadrant or I can do the full thing or I can

1980
01:42:31,880 --> 01:42:35,960
do the whole thing or I can again just do this lower quadrant, this upper quadrant.

1981
01:42:35,960 --> 01:42:36,960
Like that's pretty nice.

1982
01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:41,000
You can have to do a 50 50 horizontal like, like, uh, like so, right?

1983
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:42,000
Like boom.

1984
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:45,040
And then if I had another window open, I could plug it right there.

1985
01:42:45,040 --> 01:42:46,040
That's pretty good.

1986
01:42:46,040 --> 01:42:47,040
And see how it's sticking.

1987
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:48,260
See, I do like, you see it sticking right there.

1988
01:42:48,260 --> 01:42:49,260
It's sticking.

1989
01:42:49,260 --> 01:42:52,440
I just got so hooked on that, like being able to drag and have them both resize at the same

1990
01:42:52,440 --> 01:42:53,440
time.

1991
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:54,440
Yeah.

1992
01:42:54,440 --> 01:42:55,440
That is super nice.

1993
01:42:55,440 --> 01:42:58,480
Windows 10 actually does pretty well.

1994
01:42:58,480 --> 01:43:01,000
Here's something that actually might make that even better.

1995
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:04,720
You know how, uh, this is like a not, I guess it's not really a power user thing, but you

1996
01:43:04,720 --> 01:43:08,680
know how the alt, uh, left click where you can like move a window.

1997
01:43:08,680 --> 01:43:09,680
Yeah.

1998
01:43:09,680 --> 01:43:10,680
I love that.

1999
01:43:10,680 --> 01:43:12,280
You can alt right click and resize a window.

2000
01:43:12,280 --> 01:43:13,280
Oh, good to know.

2001
01:43:13,280 --> 01:43:14,280
Oh yeah.

2002
01:43:14,280 --> 01:43:15,280
Look at this.

2003
01:43:15,280 --> 01:43:16,280
Oh, thank you.

2004
01:43:16,280 --> 01:43:17,280
Thank you for telling me that.

2005
01:43:17,280 --> 01:43:18,280
That's actually really handy.

2006
01:43:18,280 --> 01:43:22,280
So you can do it from like, as long as you're like, if you're on like anywhere remotely

2007
01:43:22,280 --> 01:43:24,760
near a corner or a side, it works.

2008
01:43:24,760 --> 01:43:25,880
Oh, that's hot.

2009
01:43:25,880 --> 01:43:55,480
Thanks as another producer, Michael Hott.
