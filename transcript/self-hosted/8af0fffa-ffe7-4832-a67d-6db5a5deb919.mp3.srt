1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520
Well, joining us on the show today, we have a colleague from Red Hat of mine, Josh Lascar.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,800
But before we introduce Josh, I just need to warn anybody, like a trigger warning.

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,040
This man has more raspberry pies than Chris Fisher.

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,080
I know, I think there is some discussion about creating a law

5
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,400
against owning this many raspberry pies.

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,320
Well, we have a leaderboard for the amount of storage people have.

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,600
I think we might need to create a new leaderboard for the number of pies.

8
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,520
Anyway, welcome to the show, Josh.

9
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:33,280
Thank you so much. Long time listener and excited to be here.

10
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,680
Very good. Before we get into the show proper, let's just do some housekeeping stuff, shall we?

11
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,440
The London Meetup is coming up fast on August the 5th.

12
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,960
We have finally nailed down a location that everybody seems to be happy with.

13
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:52,640
So we're going to go for the Jubilee Gardens right underneath the London Eye

14
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,520
Hungerford Bridge down by the River Thames in London, next to Waterloo Station.

15
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,880
There is a big grassy area with a bunch of paths kind of winding their way through it,

16
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,440
right next to the South Bank River frontage.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,440
I think if we just all meet up there around about six o'clock, British Summer Time.

18
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:16,080
There's been some consternation in the group about GMT versus BST.

19
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,760
Sounds like a load of BS to me, but there we go.

20
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:26,320
It's six o'clock. As you look at your watch in British Summer Time is when we'll be meeting

21
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,800
down in the Jubilee Gardens in London.

22
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,960
I am super happy that you have found a location.

23
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,760
I know that was a bit of consternation, especially because you're doing it from afar.

24
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,120
So that's really good. It's like getting real now, Alex.

25
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,600
Yeah. Well, I mean, when we were here, we did the one in Raleigh.

26
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,600
I could go and check it out and make sure it was all good.

27
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:47,360
But in London, it's a lot more tricky. And I actually had several offers from folks.

28
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,120
There was a lovely venue near Covent Garden. There was another one in Woolwich that we were

29
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:55,520
offered, but they were indoors. And some of the folks who are meeting with us,

30
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,040
just that's a hard line for them.

31
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,200
You know, Friday night in London, there aren't too many outdoor options.

32
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,480
So I thought we'd just keep it simple and do something fairly central

33
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:09,920
that is fairly touristy and therefore reasonably safe so far as London goes.

34
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,880
And yeah, that's where we ended up.

35
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,800
Meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting for the deets on that.

36
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,320
And of course, you guys have been organizing this.

37
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:23,120
This really was birthed in the self-hosted matrix itself, self-hosted Discord at

38
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,080
self-hosted dot show slash Discord.

39
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,880
The Freudian slip on the matrix there was because this did inspire us to realize and

40
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,960
take action. And that was we created a JB Meetups matrix space.

41
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:41,200
So at Matrix, there's this concept of a space where you can have like a bunch of

42
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,680
collection of rooms. So we have a meetup space and then in there,

43
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,080
we're going to have location specific chat rooms that are going to be standing chat rooms.

44
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,800
So that way we can build crowds like I'd like to create a Raleigh one.

45
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,480
I want to create a California one.

46
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,560
We already have a London colony, a Pacific Northwest colony and the Mumble colony.

47
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,920
So we can also do virtual events. But I could see more in the future.

48
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,520
I'm just kind of feeling it out right now.

49
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,720
And there is already folks organizing in the London colony.

50
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,480
We'll have a link in the show notes to that as well.

51
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,640
Because what we were talking about was potentially going for some air quotes,

52
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:18,960
pre drinks or pre eats before the main meetup somewhere nearby as a smaller group.

53
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,880
Because I know, you know, we pick six p.m.

54
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:26,080
because then anybody that's got to travel after work or has work in the London area

55
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,000
can still make it at the official time.

56
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,040
But I don't know, like three, four o'clock, something like that.

57
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,400
Maybe a few of us might meet up a little bit earlier and go and get some food or

58
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,920
something like that and and then head over at six p.m. proper.

59
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,000
Very good. I want to say thanks to Tim for filling in last episode.

60
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,920
Did a great job while I was out sick, which was horrible timing.

61
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,360
I hope you're feeling better.

62
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,040
Yeah, I'm like 90 percent better.

63
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,760
I still have some junk in my chest and in my in my sinuses, but I'm like 90 percent better.

64
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,400
The worst timing ever, really, is just a horrible time to get sick.

65
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,800
So I was doing prerecords. We were trying to do this show.

66
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,240
I was trying to travel. It was like the worst possible time to get sick.

67
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:06,160
Well, when we had Tim on, we turned it into the Kubernetes action show in your absence.

68
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,760
Yeah, yeah, I enjoyed it. I enjoyed it a lot.

69
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,520
And we got some nice comments, too. So thank you to Tim for filling in.

70
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,680
For those of you that have been following along with the show,

71
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,800
I sent in I think it was probably about six weeks ago now.

72
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:23,120
I sent into Western Digital a failed, shucked hard drive.

73
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,400
I finally got the replacement through yesterday.

74
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,040
OK, well, OK. Do you know how long it was, Alex?

75
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,160
I've lost track of how long it actually took for the replacement to come.

76
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,720
Well, I removed the drive from the server when Brent was here.

77
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:40,320
So I should give you some idea. It was a while ago, six, eight weeks, something like that.

78
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,600
So all I did was I took the failed drive, which was a shucked drive,

79
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,760
about two years old, out of the server, wrapped it in some bubble wrap in a box

80
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:52,640
from reuse from Amazon, sent it across to Western Digital.

81
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:57,200
And then a few days later, the RMA said completed.

82
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,640
I got an email. It didn't give me any problems whatsoever.

83
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:04,720
It just changed from we've received your item to completed.

84
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,920
There was no other updates.

85
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,760
And a few days later, what arrives?

86
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:14,800
I get a brand new drive in a box, an unshucked hard drive.

87
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,360
I got a Western Digital my book delivered.

88
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,560
Unshucked, ready to go.

89
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,840
So you sent them a shucked drive and they so they must have realized

90
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,280
and they sent you back a my book.

91
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,560
It feels passive aggressive almost like they know what you're up to.

92
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,840
And here's the thing, right?

93
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,280
The drive that I sent them was originally an easy store drive,

94
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,280
which is a Best Buy exclusive.

95
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,800
And they send me back a my book, which is not right.

96
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,360
So there's been conjecture and guesswork on the internet for eons

97
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,200
about the fact that they're the same drive.

98
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,280
I guess we have some proof now.

99
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,480
Yeah, it does seem like it is a data point, at least.

100
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:54,000
Josh, have you tried this shucking thing that Alex talks about all the time?

101
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,960
Most definitely.

102
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,880
I've done it both for my Synology boxes when I've grown over time.

103
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,480
I've got three up to this point, one at my local place of worship

104
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,240
and then two here in the lab.

105
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,520
So both a four bay and a two bay and I've had success with it.

106
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,680
I have one drive right now that is actually my it's my one shucked drive.

107
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,400
It's been great.

108
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,440
That's been in production since Brent was here,

109
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,920
which is even longer than since Brent was at Alex's place.

110
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,960
We measure things in Brent time now.

111
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,520
Brent standard time.

112
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:24,800
BST.

113
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,640
What could go wrong using that acronym?

114
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,720
But I mean, you got a disk, right?

115
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,920
I mean, you got to shuck it.

116
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,160
Yeah.

117
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,640
I mean, to be honest with you, I already bought the replacement

118
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,920
because I don't like being down for that long.

119
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,560
So I'll probably throw it up on eBay.

120
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,640
If somebody wants a 12 terabyte drive for cheap, send me a message and

121
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,800
you're not keeping it as a backup.

122
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,560
Oh, what about a hot swap?

123
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,440
Come on, Alex.

124
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,320
I've already got one of those in there.

125
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,680
I don't need I don't need a backup for my hot spare.

126
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:54,720
Mr.

127
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,480
I don't need 12 terabytes over here.

128
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,160
Okay, here's the thing, right?

129
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,960
I went through and so I used, I use radar a lot, right?

130
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,640
I know we don't talk about this stuff very much, but I use radar a lot too much.

131
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,360
If I'm being perfectly honest, and I added some automations to

132
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,200
automatically the based on lists, right?

133
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:21,760
So in any given week, 50 to a hundred movies appeared on my system and I just

134
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:25,520
had no idea where I was going to find the time to watch all this stuff.

135
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,520
So about, about when that drive failed, actually, I just went through and

136
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,120
deleted terabytes and terabytes of stuff.

137
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,120
So I, my, my array, let me have a look merger FS.

138
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:37,680
Here it is.

139
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:44,000
Uh, 71 terabytes right now used 25 remaining 47.

140
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,440
So I think I'll be all right without the extra 12.

141
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,560
I think, yeah, you'll be all right.

142
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,440
You'll be all right.

143
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,880
I just recently did that too.

144
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,240
I was getting ready for the trip or something like that.

145
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,440
I wanted to grab some shows and I realized I was down to like two

146
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:02,480
terabytes of free space and I had like four terabytes in my queue.

147
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,720
And, uh, I, I knew as I was looking at everything, I was like, before this

148
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,920
finishes, I'm going to run out of disk space, you know, one of those moments.

149
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,000
And I just went on a deleting rampage dude.

150
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,440
And it felt so good.

151
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,200
Like it felt so good to just delete stuff.

152
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,480
I know I'm never going to watch.

153
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,000
I got a bunch of stuff on there.

154
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,080
There was like, just, I, I, if I had it on DVD, I backed it up.

155
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,120
Or if somebody, like a friend wanted to request something, the system

156
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:27,920
would go grab it for them.

157
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:31,760
And there was so much stuff that I was, nobody was watching ever.

158
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,600
It felt so good to purge.

159
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,480
It felt so good.

160
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:38,000
Now I've really refined it down to like the stuff that I've either handcrafted

161
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,040
or, you know, the stuff that is like in the watch queue or

162
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,080
something like that right now.

163
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,760
Let the internet be your backup.

164
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,400
How about that?

165
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,240
See, I was still kicking it old school to where I bought my DVDs and

166
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,760
Blu-rays, rip them across, put them onto my Plex media server.

167
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,960
And then when, and if something were to happen, yeah, I could

168
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,160
always re-rip those down.

169
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,760
So I haven't made that next step.

170
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:03,840
You know, I have to say proudly, proudly that the Blu-rays that I have

171
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:08,640
ripped are always better than the ones that you can get off the internet.

172
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,640
Like, I don't know, man.

173
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,560
Maybe it's, maybe it's just because I know what the FFmpeg commands do.

174
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,800
I don't know what the difference is, but.

175
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,600
It always, my encodings years later, like I'll come back.

176
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,960
Like we're watching, my wife and I are re-watching Star Trek Enterprise.

177
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,160
I hand ripped every one of those episodes.

178
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:26,640
Right.

179
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,040
And I did it meticulously with, with two passing coding and like all the

180
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,320
right, all the right settings.

181
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,400
And it just, it holds up, it holds up.

182
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,920
And I did that work years ago.

183
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,120
Very proud of that.

184
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,560
So that kind of stuff I did not purge.

185
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,720
With the setting, make my CPU hurt, huh?

186
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,000
All right.

187
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,160
So I, I have to ask the audience and Josh, you too, you know, I've talked

188
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,080
positively about the HomePods as a voice control mechanism for Home Assistant.

189
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,600
I like them.

190
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,080
Not only do I think they are the best sounding Home Assistant, but the commands

191
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,080
to interface with Home Assistant using the HomeKit API are all done over the LAN.

192
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,560
The voice transcription is done remotely, but once it figures out what you've

193
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:12,640
requested, the HomePod executes that request locally over the LAN, and then

194
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,480
over the LAN to your Home Assistant server using the HomeKit API.

195
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,440
It's very nice.

196
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,720
It's more private.

197
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,560
I just have preferred it.

198
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:26,960
I don't know what's changed, but Siri has lost it, like lost it.

199
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:32,720
Like if I say, Hey, lady tube, turn off the entry bar, her response after she

200
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,120
thinks about it will be, okay, I've turned off the Apple TV 4k.

201
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,400
I'm sorry.

202
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,400
The Apple TV 4k is not responding.

203
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,400
I didn't say anything about that.

204
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:47,040
If I say, Hey, Siri, turn off the bed skirt, she just won't say anything.

205
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:47,840
Like nothing happens.

206
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:51,120
Like commands that I used to do on a daily basis as I was coming and going

207
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,200
from my home just in the last week, quit working.

208
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,920
She just thinks I've said something completely different than what I've

209
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,920
said, completely different.

210
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,400
And then I don't know how, I don't know if my wife tapped something or

211
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:06,480
what happened, but somehow personalized results have been turned on and now

212
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,320
it's doing voice recognition.

213
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,520
And of course it like sees a different set of devices for some reason.

214
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:16,000
When my wife has a command versus when I have a command, this just changed.

215
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,640
And it feels like somebody came into our home and moved all the light

216
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,360
switches around and hooked them up to different stuff.

217
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,480
And it's super frustrating because like the wife approval factor, which

218
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,320
has been very high on this entire system is on a decline right now.

219
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,320
Have you guys experienced this with any of these voice assistants?

220
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,920
Is this something unique to Siri?

221
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,680
Is anybody in the audience?

222
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,880
I'm like, I'm lost for words and I don't know what to do because of course

223
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,000
I've got these stupid home pods all over the place and now they're working

224
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,880
for crap and it might actually be home assistant's fault.

225
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,880
That's the other thing is I opened up my home app and the home assistant

226
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,760
stuff didn't look right.

227
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,520
I don't know what was going on.

228
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:59,360
So it may actually be something in home assistant, but more troubleshooting

229
00:11:59,360 --> 00:11:59,920
needed.

230
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,960
You got to warn us when you're getting your site box out, dude.

231
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,120
I know, I know.

232
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,720
Josh, have you experienced this?

233
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,880
So I'll be honest with you, Chris.

234
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,720
I've just put my big toe finally into the home automation side of the house

235
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,600
and I still don't trust any of the voice command stuff.

236
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,600
I want to make sure it's all here locally toward the point where I put that

237
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,640
entire thing on pause.

238
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,080
I didn't own my home yet.

239
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,080
I now have bought my first home.

240
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:27,920
The issue was I needed to make sure I could segment my network correctly to

241
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,440
where I had an IOT network.

242
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,320
I had a home computer network.

243
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,160
I had a security system network completely separated to make sure they

244
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:41,280
can't see each other and then just then, literally last week after listening to

245
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,840
you guys forever on using home assistant.

246
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,680
That's what's running on the silver pie behind me is I've got that in the

247
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:52,640
combi running and I started playing with that and they can't see other than

248
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,520
what I told it to because it's only on that network.

249
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,360
Yeah, I like that you started with the security first.

250
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,320
That's a great idea.

251
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:03,600
You know, the utility of the voice commands, especially because home family

252
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,160
members don't want to walk to tablets every time, has been really like crucial,

253
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:13,040
I think, in the approval factor by the whole family because, you know, everybody

254
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,720
from, you know, kids to new people that are visiting can do it really quick.

255
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,240
But now it's gone totally sideways and it makes the whole system look loony.

256
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,600
I'm hoping that my craft gets a little bit better and where we get more to

257
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,560
where we're doing it locally again, because like one of the things that

258
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,760
I've got is the re speaker with the four mic set up.

259
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:35,040
And when I tried testing that about a year and a half ago, it wasn't great.

260
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,560
Not that the hardware wasn't great.

261
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,480
Software wasn't great.

262
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,400
So I think it's coming, but it's not there yet.

263
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,840
So I'm not going to hit that button.

264
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,640
I must say, I'm not particularly surprised to hear Josh hitting the

265
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:51,120
security angle pretty hard from the get go because you're involved with the

266
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,920
Defcon scene, aren't you?

267
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,400
I am.

268
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,560
I've been going to Defcon for a few years now.

269
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,480
I enjoy the security aspect of it.

270
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,240
So Defcon is coming up here.

271
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,640
It's not like it's in 45 days and so many hours.

272
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,200
This is fine.

273
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,280
I see.

274
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:05,680
I see.

275
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,600
Well, it's a good angle to look at this stuff.

276
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,120
I think you should always start from a position of not trusting these devices

277
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:11,520
at all.

278
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:17,920
And I'm sure like you guys, before I buy anything these days, I tend to do a

279
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:23,520
lot of research on if it can be locally controlled, what it's built on,

280
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,120
information about the company.

281
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,760
Buying a device these days feels like you have to like almost get in a

282
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,280
relationship with a company.

283
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,360
That's one of the things I really appreciated about local control.

284
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,160
Anytime there's a local API, that's a big win for me.

285
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,600
I feel like that was one of the things I liked about the HomePods.

286
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,800
Another thing, I just got a Nanoleaf.

287
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,280
Nice.

288
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,800
And these are really nice.

289
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,280
They're wood.

290
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,880
They look like wood on the wall.

291
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,840
But you got the wood ones.

292
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,320
Sweet.

293
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,040
They look really great.

294
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,760
They almost look like art on their own, even when they're off.

295
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,760
And true to the documentation, when you power that thing and you get it on

296
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,680
your Wi-Fi, Home Assistant automatically detects it and suggests,

297
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,960
hey, would you like to install the Nanoleaf integration?

298
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:06,320
And it was just a little wonky at first, but it's been totally solid since.

299
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,840
All local API, no cloud account, no nothing like that.

300
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,280
It's very nice.

301
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,360
So there's wins and losses.

302
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:19,200
So I feel like the Nanoleaf win offset the HomePod loss recently.

303
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,320
But now I've just kind of equalized everything out.

304
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:26,720
I recently picked up the Nanoleaf hexes and absolutely love them.

305
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,400
Exact same experience to where once you turned it, connected it to the network,

306
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,640
then from there, Home Assistant just picked it up, no problem.

307
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,920
And they're just neat looking.

308
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:39,040
Against my better judgment, I bought some LEDs from Govi recently.

309
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,960
I say recently, it's probably six months ago.

310
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,480
And when I got them, the integration was cloud polling integration,

311
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,240
and it just worked just fine.

312
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:54,400
About two months ago, Govi just decided to rate limit the API requests.

313
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:58,640
And suddenly all of the lights just stopped working with Home Assistant.

314
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,680
I opened a support ticket and they were like, well,

315
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,880
we don't know what you're talking about.

316
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:08,320
Like the support people just had no clue what even an API probably was sadly.

317
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,200
But thankfully I was able to go into the integration and update the polling rate,

318
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,640
which meant that now they work, they're a bit slower than they were,

319
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:21,200
but they work at least. So yeah, let that be a lesson, kids.

320
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,920
You know, if they don't want to handle the API requests,

321
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,680
maybe they could just let the API requests go locally.

322
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,760
Hmm. I mean, I'm just going to put that out there,

323
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,560
but if your cloud service can't handle the customer demand,

324
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,400
maybe you should re-architect it so it doesn't require your cloud service.

325
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,680
How would you collect the data then, Chris? That's the real question.

326
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,800
Right.

327
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:46,080
What data are you collecting on how many minutes my LED strip underneath my bed is on?

328
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,400
My bed is on four. I mean, really.

329
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,440
Because we need to calculate how much longer it's going to be

330
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,920
until you buy the next set of LEDs, Alex.

331
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:58,720
Well, there's that, but also there is sort of like this metadata information of,

332
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,640
now they don't know if it's not automation,

333
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,880
but most people probably are not automating these things.

334
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,200
So they can kind of probably assume Alex was home

335
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,320
during these times or something like that. I don't know.

336
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:12,960
I don't think it's so much about collecting data with these types of vendors.

337
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:18,560
I think it's more about an ecosystem that they build this mode around

338
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,800
and they try to get you. Every one of these vendors,

339
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,680
even Nanoleaf does this, has like a million products.

340
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,000
Have you looked at the Wyze store recently?

341
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,960
Oh, yeah.

342
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,720
Have you looked at that thing, dude?

343
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,040
They went from selling cameras to like, now they sell scales and stuff,

344
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:39,440
like weight scales and stuff. They're just like everywhere, man.

345
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,800
Everybody does this. They all want to make a million products.

346
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:46,080
The Wyze store is like walking into one of those markets in Taiwan

347
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,280
where you've got like 15 different stores at all moments.

348
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,520
And they've just gone, yeah, we'll have that. We'll have that.

349
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,560
Yeah, we'll stick our logo on that. Yeah, we'll throw our logo on that too.

350
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,840
And yeah, that's fine. That'll do.

351
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,120
We're not going to worry about the support.

352
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,360
Like, you know, with the first gen cameras or anything,

353
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,360
we're just going to slap a sticker on it, right?

354
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,080
Talk about a Trojan horse company.

355
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,440
I think that's sort of the overall motive with these companies

356
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,760
and their cloud-only APIs and whatnot.

357
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,240
But like, that's not how you get my loyalty.

358
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,120
That is the business model. You're right.

359
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,480
It is. I have to agree.

360
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,520
Tailscale.com slash self-hosted.

361
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,680
Go there to get a personal account for up to 20 devices for totes free.

362
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,120
And you support the show.

363
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,920
Tailscale is a zero config VPN.

364
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,280
It's like a ninja VPN.

365
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,720
You install it on any device in minutes. It takes care of the firewall rules.

366
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,880
It takes care of the crazy NAT you might be on.

367
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,320
And I'm saying it takes care of the crazy, crazy NAT.

368
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,840
I can attest to that.

369
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,680
Your devices connect directly to each other.

370
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:50,480
Creates this mesh network based around WireGuard's noise protocol.

371
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:56,320
They're using like the best VPN technology in a super, super clever way.

372
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:01,040
You can quickly and easily create a flat mesh network where your devices get a static IP.

373
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:05,760
And if you're a maniac, you could throw like a pie hole box or a DNS server in that mix.

374
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,040
And you can actually start doing name resolution on that network.

375
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,080
It's so great.

376
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,400
You can also do things like share one machine with a friend like Alex and I do for some of

377
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,480
these testings we'll do here on the shows.

378
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,080
But you know what else they've recently introduced, which blows my mind?

379
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:24,880
Is they've introduced a new product, a new feature, I guess, called TailScale SSH.

380
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,360
You can now easily manage your SSH connections with TailNet.

381
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,920
TailScale SSH allows you to establish SSH connections between your devices in your

382
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:37,680
TailScale network and authorized by your access controls.

383
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:41,280
You don't have to sit around and copy your keys like a caveman anymore.

384
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,120
And it authenticates your SSH connection using WireGuard.

385
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,880
It's so great.

386
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,400
TailScale is a breakthrough VPN technology.

387
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,360
It's the kind of thing I knew they'd build once WireGuard was a thing.

388
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:58,000
That's why I wanted it to be mainline for so many years because I knew we get cool stuff

389
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,280
like this.

390
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,320
I've got to run on everything.

391
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:05,680
My arch servers, my su servers, my x86 boxes, my Raspberry Pis, my portable devices.

392
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,800
It's on my phone right now.

393
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:10,720
I always leave it connected to because the client is really smart about what it routes

394
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,160
to your TailScale network versus what it routes out to the internet and stuff like that.

395
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:17,520
You're not accidentally sending every single web page load over your TailScale or something

396
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,000
like that.

397
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,680
So go try it.

398
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:23,680
Support the show and get it for free up to 20 devices when you go to TailScale.com

399
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,040
slash self-hosted.

400
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:30,320
Imagine one flat network for all your devices, your containers, your VMs, your physical devices,

401
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:35,920
your mobile devices, friends, family, colleagues, all protected by WireGuard that you get up

402
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,200
and running in minutes.

403
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,840
TailScale.com slash self-hosted.

404
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:48,320
Now I teased at the top of the show that we have a, dare I call it a Raspberry Pi hoarder?

405
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,000
I don't know if that's a correct word.

406
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,280
Collector.

407
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,080
Collector.

408
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,120
OK, let's go with that.

409
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,040
Yeah, I mean, I don't know, Josh.

410
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:58,880
I feel like you could almost create a currency based on how many Raspberry Pis you have.

411
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,240
I don't have that many Pis.

412
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,280
Come on now, Chris.

413
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,120
And they are getting hard to get a hold of.

414
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,960
OK, tell the people, Josh.

415
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,000
Tell the people, how many Raspberry Pis do you have?

416
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:14,240
So I've currently got 43 Pis and eight Pi Picos.

417
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:19,360
When we actually list these things off, it's one compute module for 13 Raspberry Pi 4s,

418
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:25,440
seven Raspberry Pi 3s, three Raspberry Pi 2s, six Raspberry Pi 1s, 11 Raspberry Pi 0s,

419
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,960
and one Raspberry Pi 0-2.

420
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,680
And a partridge in a pear tree.

421
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,080
I forgot there was a 400 in there as well, hanging.

422
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,000
Oh, sure, yeah, gotta have a 400.

423
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,920
Gotta have a 400, right?

424
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:41,120
That's what you can actually get a hold of nowadays, too, so you can still find those

425
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,160
at a decent price.

426
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,200
Those are great machines.

427
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:48,160
That is a lot of Raspberry Pis, whatever way you split them.

428
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,400
Whatever way you slice it.

429
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,760
How are you going to justify having so many to us?

430
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,560
Please.

431
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,920
So I have been collecting these literally from the beginning.

432
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,880
I was super excited.

433
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,520
Before I was in working for my current employer, I wanted to get into Linux.

434
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,480
And the Raspberry Pi was a great way to do that.

435
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:11,040
And playing with Linux on the side was always fun, but you never had a dedicated machine

436
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:11,680
for that.

437
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:15,280
Or you'd be dual booting and wiping Windows and Linux and going back and forth.

438
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,600
Hey, the Pi's filled that need, which was awesome.

439
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:23,440
So creating their own cases, I was one of the early adopters to where when I bought

440
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:28,720
them, they actually have the misprint on there to where it's the 10M on there instead of

441
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,240
the 100 megabit to where it was super, super early days.

442
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,960
So I've just been buying a couple per time they come out with a new one and then finding

443
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,160
tasks for them.

444
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:43,040
So it started off with just a thin client.

445
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:49,840
And from there, I was able to use the thin client OS to go over to my ESXi instance,

446
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:55,040
my Proxmox instance, early days, 10 years ago, back when these came out back in 2011

447
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:55,920
and 2012.

448
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:01,520
And then from there, I made myself a lap deck, which was the old school Motorola flip up

449
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:05,360
to where you could use to go through and plug in like your own cell phone back before that

450
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,320
was a thing.

451
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:12,000
And I built my own cables to where I could have a portable Linux Raspberry Pi laptop,

452
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,680
went to my hackerspace, went and talked about it.

453
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,680
And that just kept on growing from there.

454
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:20,640
So what was it about the Raspberry Pi platform that seems to have drawn you so early on?

455
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:25,760
Because for me personally, I think it really took to the Pi 3 and definitely once the Pi

456
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:30,160
4 landed where I said to myself, this is really something I can use now.

457
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:33,200
And but you kind of it seems like you honed in on a lot earlier than I did.

458
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,840
So early adopter with it because I was young and dumb at that point because I wanted to

459
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,000
always try the newest, latest and greatest.

460
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,360
And hey, Raspberry Pis with SD cards instead of being able to afford full up machines,

461
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:50,720
even if you were trying to get them refurbished from like a thrift shop or whatnot, you had

462
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:55,280
more ecosystem, more of a community behind the Raspberry Pis than anything else you could

463
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:55,760
do.

464
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,240
Very true.

465
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,920
There was that network effect very early on in a way that most devices didn't get.

466
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,800
You must have experimented with Pi alternatives, though, right?

467
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:07,120
Because as a Pi user, you're constantly being told there's a much better device out there

468
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,320
if you just bought the right device.

469
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:12,080
I completely agree with that. And I was young and dumb and stupid and bought many of them.

470
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,040
And then I finally figured out there's not the community.

471
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:19,600
And even with like the Libre boards that were out there, I backed those on Kickstarter.

472
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,520
And when trying to get them up and running, the Pi just had it.

473
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,760
And it comes down to open source.

474
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,600
It comes down to the open community.

475
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:31,200
And when you bridge those together, that's where you've got the magic sauce.

476
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,120
So that's what Raspberry Pi just did.

477
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,960
And it kept on hitting it off for me.

478
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,560
And then I agree with you, Chris.

479
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,560
Early days, I was like, oh, I'm going to implement this.

480
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,560
This is going to be my full time desktop.

481
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,840
Yeah, not powerful enough.

482
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,160
Oh, I can do my Plex server on this.

483
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,240
Yeah, no, that's not powerful enough either.

484
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:51,520
So I quickly learned over the years the performance that the Raspberry Pi could do

485
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,800
would most of the time not meet the need that I needed.

486
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,960
So when the new one came out, oh, let's try this again.

487
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,280
Hey, it worked better.

488
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,520
We went from a single core to a quad core.

489
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,920
But that RAM, oh, that RAM hurts.

490
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:07,040
I know, so I agree.

491
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:11,600
Once we got to the Raspberry Pi 4, that's why I've got 13 of them.

492
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,200
Because they got so much more powerful.

493
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,920
So here's the thing for me, Josh.

494
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:26,960
And I just wouldn't a single virtualization server replace all of these?

495
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,960
So that is a good question.

496
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,680
Back when I was still when I was not working from home, I went through that point

497
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,280
and saying I'm going to virtualize everything.

498
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,720
I got the pizza box.

499
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,920
Everything was happy-go-lucky.

500
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,160
Until my wife called and said, hey, this service is down.

501
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:49,040
Oh, why don't you go ahead and just SSH and then just, you know, I'll be home and I'll fix it.

502
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:52,800
Versus, hey, go unplug the Pi, plug the Pi back in.

503
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,760
It's working now.

504
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,000
Have you heard of our Lord and Savior, Tailscale?

505
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,720
You could just VPN in and fix that bitch.

506
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,720
That should be their slogan.

507
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:09,360
So the significant other buy-in was part of that, to be honest with you, Alex.

508
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:14,800
So some things, yes, we do virtualize other things like when you're just getting into

509
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:19,600
a network and you're trying to find out more about your home network, throwing in a Raspberry

510
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:24,000
Pi 4 for Pi-Hole gives you so much more insight of how many devices are reaching back out to

511
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,960
the internet that you would have to buy like ubiquity grade or more enterprise grade gear

512
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,560
to start getting that insight.

513
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:35,120
But let's be honest, you can buy a hundred dollars worth of Raspberry Pi kit, plug it

514
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,800
in and get that information now.

515
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:40,320
So how many dollars do you think you're deep into this hole in?

516
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:47,120
I don't want to even think about that, but I've only ever paid the MSRP.

517
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,520
I've not gone through and supported the scalpers.

518
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,640
That's all I got to say.

519
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,520
Good for you.

520
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,080
Good for you.

521
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:57,280
All right, if we ignore the dollars and cents, let's talk about something a little more tangible

522
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,480
because you live in the desert, right?

523
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,240
Where heat is a problem.

524
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,880
These things are going to consume, I don't know what, 5 to 15 Watts, depending on what

525
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,920
they're doing each.

526
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,440
Yes, yes, they will.

527
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,120
And that's why I've had to go through and pick my favorite cases because I've been collecting

528
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:11,840
for so long.

529
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:17,440
I buy a lot of cases, I buy a lot of hats, all the Raspberry Pi cameras and I've got

530
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:23,840
to say, honestly, for my area in the desert is the Vilarose all aluminum cases are by

531
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,040
far the best because it's completely passive.

532
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,200
You're not having to worry about dirt getting into it.

533
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,880
They actually come with thermal paste to where you could go through and apply it on the case

534
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:38,560
itself and touch all the parts and it keeps it clear and cool.

535
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:42,240
And that's literally what I have running on every single Raspberry Pi when it comes to

536
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,200
the force.

537
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,880
Have you tried the flirt case that also comes with a little thermal pad and

538
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:52,960
I have their previous flirt cases for the three and I still honestly prefer the Vilarose.

539
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,600
Yeah, because I was thinking, you know, I definitely have been in situations where it

540
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:59,200
gets really, really hot and those Raspberry Pis are definitely at like thermal throttle

541
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,000
levels.

542
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,800
So that would be good.

543
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,080
All right, send me a link to that.

544
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,680
I'll try to add that to the show notes.

545
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:08,640
There's a geek worm one that I really like that is all aluminum as well and that does

546
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:13,760
completely passive cooling and that's what's just there on the live stream running that

547
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,080
3D printer back there doing octo print.

548
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:20,080
Speaking of the live stream, I loved Foss accountants comment in here.

549
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:24,800
I no longer need to feel bad about having an unused eight gigabyte Pi four in my drawer.

550
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:32,160
So used pies versus if they're actively being if they're just sitting in a drawer sad or

551
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,400
if they have a project waiting for them.

552
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:38,080
How many you have in production versus how many you have just sitting around are two

553
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:38,640
different things.

554
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,240
So I mean, there's still naming and shaming that should be going on there if they're just

555
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:42,960
sitting in a drawer.

556
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,320
I agree.

557
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,600
I agree.

558
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,400
I got I agree.

559
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,720
I got I got more projects than I got pies at this point.

560
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,600
I need more pies.

561
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,280
So speaking of projects, right?

562
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,480
We've talked about pie hole.

563
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,080
We've talked about thing clients.

564
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,400
There must be some other stuff you use these things for.

565
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:00,240
Like I said, the the lap deck was one of them being into the security side of the house

566
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:05,600
as well standing up your own pen testing box or a Cali instance where you can slap that

567
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,680
in there before Kelly was officially supported.

568
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:11,840
There are other earlier spins that was like called the Pwn Pi or sticky fingers.

569
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,760
There's also the damn vulnerable pie.

570
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,640
So if you needed to pen test against something, you could do that as well.

571
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:21,200
If you're more into the Wi-Fi hacking and tracking, you've got the kismet pie, lots

572
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,600
of different projects when it comes to the security side of the house.

573
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,520
There's a link to all these different projects in the show notes, by the way, along with

574
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:32,560
that, getting my kids also into computing that was their onboarding process to where

575
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:37,440
we went from from going to a Maker Faire to hey, here's the older Raspberry Pi.

576
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,800
So I'd get the brand new one.

577
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:44,480
It would be implemented into my my new project and then I'd give them the old one.

578
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,640
They'd have to learn to go plug in all the cables.

579
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:51,920
I wasn't going to completely cry over if they plugged in the HDMI wrong and broke something

580
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:55,920
to where it was a spare pipe, but they got real life experience with it.

581
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,880
And then that actually helped them later on to where they could build up their full up

582
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:04,560
machines and then move it, unplug it, replug it back in and know the components well.

583
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:08,960
So talk to me a little bit about this SDR monitor station that's in the list.

584
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,240
I've kind of wanted to get into software defined radio for some time.

585
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,280
What do you do with it?

586
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:17,440
So these ones are set up for different use cases on the field, like you're tracking aircraft.

587
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,040
I'm also curious to have more of these implemented now that I'm starting with Home Assistant

588
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,960
and using the Zigbee side of the house.

589
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:28,240
When you get into SDR, you can start with the RTL SDR, which is like starts at 20 bucks.

590
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,560
Those are my understanding as over in Europe, you would go through and use these to receive

591
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,600
TV signals.

592
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,200
But here in the States, you can go through and pick those same things up.

593
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,960
Use a couple of specialized pieces of software and track aircraft.

594
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:45,280
You can go through and see other things that are talking, anything from some cell phone,

595
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:49,840
depending on which bandwidth that you're looking at, which antennas that you have, all the

596
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:55,360
way up to you can buy a dedicated software defined radio like the HackRF, and then you

597
00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:00,320
have a huge area that you can go through and listen to where anything from the FM, like

598
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:04,560
900 or the 90 megahertz all the way up to the six gigahertz range.

599
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:07,440
For me, I'm only listening because I don't have my hand license.

600
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,360
So I'm not going through and injecting anything that goes to the you need to go have a hand

601
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,960
license if you want to start transmitting.

602
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:19,360
So what can you do with that once you've listened to a certain frequency and got some information

603
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:24,720
like I get the fact that you see the pretty graph with the nice colors and the and the

604
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,800
shadow traces of all the stuff, but then what what do you do with it?

605
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:33,520
What I want to go through and do with it is set up a tracking tour with something is moving

606
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,040
within my yard.

607
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,480
This is one of the ways to go through and do that.

608
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,520
You can do that partly with Wi-Fi.

609
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,200
You can do that with these other ones as well.

610
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,400
Oh, cool.

611
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:44,480
So making more of that map to where you can go through and find out how closely can you

612
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,440
track this?

613
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,800
If I've got an evil mother-in-law walking under the property, I want alarms to be going

614
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,600
off.

615
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,880
I mean, I was thinking, actually, you know, if you had an F-16 land in your front yard,

616
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,160
you'd probably notice.

617
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:59,440
Yeah, I mean, most likely, but I tell you what, when I've gone through and used the

618
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:05,440
SDRs, when I've been like in larger metropolitan areas, like San Diego, LA and such, seeing

619
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:10,000
all the flights, I was rocking those back on my old school netbook.

620
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,400
And after like 250 flights, the thing would crash because there was so much data going

621
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:18,880
on because it does not only them taking off their airspeed, their tail numbers and such,

622
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,920
but also their destination.

623
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:23,040
So you can actually see it mapped across the entire situation.

624
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,080
So that's one step.

625
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:28,960
You could also go to like starting to track Zigbee, Z-Wave and seeing the actual traffic

626
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,000
going on there.

627
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,320
If you have the right sensors as well, you can also then start looking at your water

628
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,880
meters, your electrical.

629
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:42,240
And there are things that we can hook into like Home Assistant now that you buy a product

630
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,840
that goes through and does that.

631
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:47,280
What I want to learn more about is actually doing it for myself versus going and just

632
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,320
buying a product to do it.

633
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,320
See, Chris, you've got some catching up to do, brother.

634
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,640
I could use that to maybe measure tanks.

635
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:56,800
As far as aircraft tracking goes, too, you know, it'd be great there for recording, Alex.

636
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:00,720
Whenever the system could tell us when a plane is about to be overhead, we could stop recording

637
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,000
so we don't have bad audio.

638
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,720
What is your absolute favorite Raspberry Pi project that you've either done or want to

639
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,520
do?

640
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,760
My favorite Raspberry Pi project I've done.

641
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:13,600
The one I'm most proud of is probably the lap deck, to be honest with you.

642
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,640
It's one of my first ones, and it was done a long time ago.

643
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,280
I'll have to include some pictures, update the show notes.

644
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:24,800
But the one that I'm most looking forward to is doing Kubernetes on the Pi.

645
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:30,640
I ended up getting three Raspberry Pi for eight gigs for that purpose, doing some more

646
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:36,960
studying up on that, making sure that we've also got the external USP something drives

647
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,960
to where your USB is going to pass through the four 400 megabit per second.

648
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:45,840
If you go watch Jeff Gerling's video on it, he's got certain adapters that he recommends

649
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:49,440
going down that route to make sure you're getting the full read write speed from the

650
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,960
SSD.

651
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,760
That guy basically is a Raspberry Pi engineer at this point.

652
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,240
Right?

653
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,520
Absolutely.

654
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,560
Absolutely.

655
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,480
So how are you going to go about running Kubernetes?

656
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:03,120
We should have had you on last time with Tim, and we could have had a Kubernetes nerd down.

657
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:07,760
So I'm still learning about it, because that's partly where I'm pivoting to in my day job

658
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:13,360
as well with more of the what used to be StackRocks, but that's a whole nother kit and caboodle.

659
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:17,840
Well, we don't talk about OpenShift very much on this show, but Josh is a colleague of mine

660
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,640
at Red Hat.

661
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:23,440
I'm a technical account manager by day, and so is Josh, but you focus on a slightly different

662
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,440
area of technologies, right?

663
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:25,840
Right.

664
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:32,240
I'm more of the platform Tim, and I've gone down the Ansible side of the house as well.

665
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:37,760
But there is a need for my team to be able to bring up ACS or the advanced cluster security.

666
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,440
So that's where I'm starting to deep dive now.

667
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,080
So with that, sure, you can run that in Kubernetes.

668
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:46,160
You can run that on K3, K8, and on OpenShift.

669
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:49,760
So it's like, oh, it's just a small, small little, you're just going to learn just a

670
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,440
little bit to run this one program.

671
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,480
This is fine.

672
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,840
There's a line in the chat room.

673
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:58,000
Be right back, convincing my team to move our OpenShift clusters to Raspberry Pis.

674
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,840
Yeah, I mean, you could swap them out easier, that's for sure.

675
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:06,960
I'm not sure that you'd have as much downtime, but the power efficiency is also something

676
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:10,240
else that we should go through and talk about, because when you're talking about doing that

677
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:16,000
virtual machine and having the old school pizza boxes, you can get them cheap, but sitting

678
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:21,600
there at 300 watts sucking out of the wall versus a Raspberry Pi is not sucking that

679
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:24,320
much or even go into like an Intel NUC instead.

680
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,400
But it can't do as much either, dude.

681
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,360
I agree.

682
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:32,400
There are very limited use cases for it, but those ones are legitimate.

683
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:36,000
And I think I touched on this with Tim last time.

684
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:42,000
The main reason for doing Kubernetes at home is not to do Kubernetes at home, it's to learn

685
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,720
Kubernetes for somewhere else, because it's so complicated and coming back to your point

686
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:52,640
about your wife approval factor of, oh, you just do this and then you tickle this particular

687
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,200
thing in that under that armpit to make it work.

688
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:59,360
You know, doing Kubernetes at home is complete overkill.

689
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:04,800
Yeah, just spin up yourself a Podman and at that point, you're sitting so much better.

690
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,760
Whether you're a Podman or Docker, it's easy enough just to install.

691
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:11,920
If you've got a Linux box, install Cockpit and be done with it.

692
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,920
Install Podman and you're done.

693
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,760
I just run everything in Perl scripts.

694
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,960
That's the way I go.

695
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,040
Whatever floats your boat, man.

696
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,360
That sounds about right.

697
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:26,240
We have a storage leaderboard on our self-hosted.wiki website.

698
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:31,760
How many raw terabytes do you have on your LAN?

699
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:36,000
Live on my LAN, I've only got about 20 terabytes.

700
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,120
Sitting in a case to be digitized, I've got over 96 total.

701
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:44,560
I've not got the Synology's all set up to be able to bring in all the previous, because

702
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:48,400
I've also got to bring things from the IDE drives and all those conversions, because

703
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:52,800
all of the family pictures I'm responsible for, so I'm low on the chart.

704
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,840
I'm only 20.

705
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:54,880
What do you think, Chris?

706
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,120
Do we do we give him 20 or do we give him the W?

707
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:00,400
I mean, I feel like this sets a precedent, Alex.

708
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,800
You said live on LAN, so it's only 20 terabytes.

709
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,640
It's not the case.

710
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,480
You did say live on LAN.

711
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,480
You did say live on LAN, and I think we got to be careful.

712
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,040
I did.

713
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:09,520
I did.

714
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:13,040
Yeah, that's not bad, right?

715
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,160
I mean, it's not bad.

716
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:14,720
It's not bad.

717
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,520
It's not.

718
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,880
It's manageable right now.

719
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:21,760
It's not that I am out of space, because it's not like I'm so close to filling that

720
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,680
up or anything, because I am.

721
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:27,520
But that's what I've got live.

722
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,720
What's the file system?

723
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:33,440
I'm using the Synology file system, so where I can go through and plug in those other

724
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,200
HotSwap larger drives.

725
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,320
Is that ButterFS, I think?

726
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,240
I think it actually is ButterFS under the hood.

727
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,440
I might be wrong on that.

728
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:43,440
I think there was talk about switching to ButterFS, but it's like SH something something.

729
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,000
OK.

730
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,320
Synology Hybrid RAID, I think is what they call it.

731
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,480
Maybe I'm thinking of the Ready NAS, anyways.

732
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,040
That could be.

733
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:54,080
You know, I was surprised, Josh, you could have connected to this episode with the Raspberry

734
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,440
Ninja project.

735
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:02,480
This is a image created by the Video Ninja developer, which is the video chat app we

736
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:08,240
use, and it essentially turns a Raspberry Pi into a dedicated remote camera that does

737
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,600
an RTMP stream.

738
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,120
And so you'd plug this thing in.

739
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:16,960
It'll use GPU acceleration on the Raspberry Pi and then connect back and stream video

740
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,160
just kind of out of the box.

741
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,440
It looks really neat.

742
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:24,560
I will have to definitely give that a try because between Sonobus, there are so many

743
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:27,840
different things that you can literally slap on a Pi, especially when you're going through

744
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:31,920
and you're starting to do interviews with people remotely, doing like an away kit that

745
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:37,360
you can send them through the mail, like starting off with the inexpensive Razer microphones

746
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:44,000
or you step up to the better microphones with like the Samsung 2QU and then you ship a Pi

747
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,080
to them and then you've got a better audio quality in a Pi.

748
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,200
You just plug it in.

749
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:49,760
Absolutely.

750
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,400
I'm down with it.

751
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,040
Linode.com slash SSH.

752
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:59,600
Go there to get $100 and 60 day credit on a new account and you go there to support

753
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,400
the show.

754
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,720
A simple, innovative, affordable and accessible Linux cloud solution.

755
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:10,160
CY developers and Linux users, the DevOps pros of the world, all of you out there.

756
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:13,520
Many of our listeners have chose to use Linode.

757
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,200
You can get up and going in moments.

758
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:20,080
I love the fact that they have a slick, clean, easy to use API.

759
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,000
You can integrate with the command line tool.

760
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,840
You can use like a Python library if you're living that Python lifestyle.

761
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:30,560
And if you just want to use the Web interface, they have an easy, intuitive cloud manager.

762
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,320
It's simple to get things going.

763
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:36,240
If you've never set up a server before or if you've been deploying them for 15 years,

764
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,400
it's going to be just fine.

765
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:43,040
They have really powerful boxes with AMD epic processors, MVB PCIe storage.

766
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:46,240
And of course, they have a bunch of really great back end services, too, like a powerful

767
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,880
DNS manager, DDoS protection.

768
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,680
They have Kubernetes support and Terraform support.

769
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,640
And of course, they have S3 compatible object storage.

770
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,680
And the benchmarks are out there.

771
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:03,280
Linode performs better and faster than those hyperscalers that want to lock you in to their

772
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,200
crazy esoteric platform.

773
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:09,680
And Linode has free 100% human support.

774
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:15,840
No handoffs, no tears, 24-7, 365 support you can actually talk to.

775
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:19,520
And because they've been doing this for nearly 19 years, they know how to build it right

776
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:26,160
with 11 data centers around the world and 99.99% uptime and over a million customers.

777
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,400
And Linode is their own ISP.

778
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,080
So they kind of get infrastructure, too.

779
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:35,040
It could also be a great alternative to some of those hyperscalers.

780
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:38,640
Maybe you need a little hybrid action in your cloud, want to diversify a bit.

781
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,080
It's a great option, too.

782
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,160
Build a portfolio or support your business.

783
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,680
Linode can do it all.

784
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,400
And you can support the show while trying it out and learning something.

785
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,480
Just get started by going to linode.com.

786
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,520
That's how you support the show.

787
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,120
That's how you get the 100 bucks.

788
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,080
Linode.com.

789
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:02,080
Now, Tom H writes in with some Orange Pi feedback.

790
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:05,680
I've been using a mixture of non-Raspberry Pi since around 2016.

791
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:09,920
I started with an Orange Pi 1 and an Orange Pi PC.

792
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:13,040
They were pretty much on par with Raspberry Pi 3B at the time.

793
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:16,320
I think they're about 10 or 15 pounds each on eBay.

794
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:22,800
Since I have moved on to other boards like the friendly arm stuff and the Pine 64 boards,

795
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:27,680
the trouble I have with the orange and friendly arms are the images you're provided by them.

796
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:31,280
They're often on an old kernel and often not updated.

797
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,080
Some manufacturers do a much better job than others.

798
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:36,560
Then I found Armbian.

799
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:40,880
Armbian is an amazing project and the work they do to support a lot of these

800
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,000
air quotes non-Raspberry Pi SBCs.

801
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:48,720
I also found new boards on their downloads page that I never even knew existed.

802
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,120
I highly, highly recommend Armbian.

803
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,320
Thanks, Tom.

804
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:55,600
Josh, I'm curious what OS you prefer on the Raspberry Pis.

805
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,600
And if you have much experience with Armbian.

806
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:01,360
I have not worked with Armbian, so I can't give a comparison there.

807
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:05,840
I've run pretty much every OS under the sun in the last 10 years on any Raspberry Pi I

808
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,040
can get a hold of.

809
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:11,680
And again, back for the community's sake, it's going to be Raspbian or what used to

810
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:14,000
be Raspbian now is Raspberry Pi OS.

811
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:19,200
Pop OS is interesting on the Raspberry Pi, but by default, if you just want to be able

812
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:24,080
to throw a Raspberry Pi at somebody and get them started, just go with the default.

813
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:25,840
Like a brick.

814
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:29,200
Not all of us have enough pies to throw around, Josh, but yeah, I get what you're saying.

815
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:34,960
So to that point, I mean, I help run a hackerspace, so I'm trying to get people into technology.

816
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:39,360
If they show interest, being able to feed that by throwing them a Raspberry Pi.

817
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:45,680
I've also, although I think Raspbian or Raspberry Pi OS is a good idea for that kind of scenario,

818
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:50,400
but I've also found that the Ubuntu team has put a lot of hard work into making Ubuntu

819
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,240
LTS run really well on the Pi.

820
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:57,520
Armbian, though, it's great for that outside the Raspberry Pi ecosystem, like Tom here

821
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:01,360
writes, you know, the orange pie and some of those other boxes where it really feels

822
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:05,920
like Armbian is trying to go above and beyond to include those devices in its support.

823
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:11,840
So I think it's nice to get a pro Armbian user on the air because none of us are really one.

824
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,240
How about we move to Mads here?

825
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:18,000
Mads writes in about upgrading Home Assistant databases.

826
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:18,640
Thanks for the show.

827
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,600
Gives me a lot of ideas.

828
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:22,640
I've been looking into Home Assistant for a while now and I want to get started.

829
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:26,880
I've decided to go to the official Docker container for my setup and I'm running each

830
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,560
add-on as a separate container like Frigate, ESPHome, Dashboard, etc.

831
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,680
You guys seem to talk about a lot of things related to Home Assistant.

832
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:38,640
So I was wondering, have you had any issues with just using the built-in SQLite database

833
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,760
or have you already migrated to something like MariaDB?

834
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,280
Thanks for the info.

835
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:47,200
I'll be honest, Mads, it's not something I give a great deal of thought on a daily basis.

836
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:53,440
I think, therefore, that means I must be using the SQLite database, just the default one.

837
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:58,240
And occasionally, if things go a bit wonky, I'll just delete the database file.

838
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:02,160
I don't really need to know what my front door was doing three years ago, whether it

839
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,160
was open or shut for three seconds or not.

840
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:09,760
I mean, there are some things I think it would be nice to do data samples on like temperature

841
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,040
trends and stuff like that.

842
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:16,640
A kind of nice once in a while to look back at, but they're really not that important

843
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:17,120
for me.

844
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:19,920
So my answer is I stick with the default.

845
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:20,800
I think I have too.

846
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:25,920
I think the only thing that would maybe make me change that is if we saw significant

847
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:26,480
improvements.

848
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:29,360
And we have seen some pretty good improvements in some of the more recent Home Assistant

849
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:34,800
releases, but like something in the energy metrics area where I'd really want to keep

850
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:39,520
that data for a while might kind of nudge me to improve the database because I really

851
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:44,400
think it's going to be metrics that, you know, where you're going to feel the performance

852
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:44,560
issue.

853
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,560
And otherwise, I kind of agree, Alex.

854
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:47,360
But here's the thing.

855
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:52,640
You can still use SQL lite, but ship out everything into influx anyway.

856
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,560
Yeah, true, true, true, right.

857
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:59,040
That is a time series database which is designed for exactly that use case.

858
00:44:59,040 --> 00:44:59,600
Yeah.

859
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:02,640
And I'm only three weeks into running mine, so I haven't had that experience yet.

860
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:04,960
So I'm also just running the built in.

861
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,120
Yeah, I mean, mine's a couple of years old.

862
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:09,040
It's not it's not really a big issue.

863
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:14,320
And the Home Assistant team in the last two releases has made significant improvements

864
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:15,600
in the database performance.

865
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:18,480
So I think it's getting even faster with SQL lite.

866
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:22,560
Marcel boosted in seven days ago with 500 sets, wishing me to get better soon.

867
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:23,280
Thank you, Marcel.

868
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,800
It must have been the reason we all wished it to not not just Marcel.

869
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:27,680
Oh, OK, all right.

870
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:30,960
OK, what do you think this next one is?

871
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:34,480
Fun Deck Kermit, Fun Deck Kermit.

872
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:39,840
Yeah, I got it with Elite Boost 1337 with a tip of the week.

873
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:45,840
The Authentech, which is Auth in T I K, makes single sign in accessible for the home user.

874
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:50,160
You can use LDAP, OAuth 2, maybe even integrate with reverse proxy.

875
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,240
I've been using it for eight months without any problems.

876
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:53,440
Love the show.

877
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,040
Greetings from Sylvania.

878
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:58,720
So Authentic is something I've been wanting to look at for a very long time.

879
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:05,200
I started using it's one of its other competitors, which it's not really authentication, but

880
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,200
it's a it's a project called Orphalia.

881
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:12,160
Essentially, this does like a transparent authentication proxy in front of applications.

882
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:17,840
But I think where Authentic makes a lot more sense is for applications that have integration

883
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:22,800
with LDAP and OAuth and that kind of thing, which unfortunately is not all of them.

884
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:28,640
And I think that really is Authentic's biggest issue is you have to rely on the underlying

885
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:35,200
application to support some kind of, for want of a better phrase, proper authentication

886
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,840
mechanism in order to be able to use it with Authentic.

887
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:43,680
So if you just got a simple HT access authentication, for example, then you're not going to see

888
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:45,120
any benefit with Authentic.

889
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:48,400
But there are other apps, you know, Git T is one of them.

890
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:49,440
Next Cloud.

891
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:54,400
There's a few that we run right in this community that will absolutely integrate very well with

892
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:54,960
Authentic.

893
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:58,720
So thanks for writing in Fundek Hermit.

894
00:46:58,720 --> 00:46:59,680
What a what a name.

895
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,240
I need to give it a look.

896
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:07,840
I wanted to ask Josh what he does for Authentication, given he's an elite hacker DEF CON man.

897
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:09,440
Good question.

898
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:11,840
Yeah, wiping formatting and reinstalling, man.

899
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:18,400
So when it comes to trying to build that out, even for for home use versus for a hackerspace

900
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:22,400
use versus for what we're going through and doing at DEF CON, I would say are three different

901
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:23,440
situations there.

902
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:26,480
I've run free IPA in the past and I've been pretty happy with that.

903
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:29,040
And for our hackerspace, that's worked out pretty well.

904
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:34,560
The issue is when it comes to getting other people to support it, it's been pretty straightforward

905
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:38,800
when we were trying to do it from like my location here in the desert down to like somebody

906
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,080
else in San Diego.

907
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:44,480
It's been interesting to make sure that we have the mirroring on that working correctly.

908
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:48,720
Otherwise, honestly, if you have a Synology, why aren't you just using the one that's built

909
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:49,520
into that?

910
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:53,920
And honestly, for my mom and dad's business, that's what we've just gone through and done

911
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:55,120
there because it's built in.

912
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:56,080
Make it easy.

913
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:56,880
Make it easy.

914
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:59,920
I think that is absolutely the right advice.

915
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:04,800
So Kars Peelend writes in with 3690 sats.

916
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,480
High signal, great show.

917
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:07,280
Thanks.

918
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:08,800
I think he liked last episode.

919
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:12,800
High signal is like a good compliment in the in the Boostergram world.

920
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,320
That's that's rare.

921
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:15,120
Yeah.

922
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:19,360
The Golden Drake and boosted in seven days ago with a row of ducks says it was a great

923
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:20,880
show with Techno Tim.

924
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:22,080
Yeah, absolutely was.

925
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:25,200
I had a blast and I really hope we didn't bore you all too much talking.

926
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:27,360
Nonstop about Kubernetes for an hour.

927
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:28,880
But I had a great time.

928
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:32,720
I found it educational and I don't really even have a use case for Kubernetes myself.

929
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:37,120
But it's still something I like to keep a, you know, a kind of a at least not an ear

930
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:41,040
on, but kind of a some at least an informed background on, I suppose.

931
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,880
And the conversation was perfect for that.

932
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:46,800
Now, Turquoise Fox writes in with a controversial.

933
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,680
Is this controversial piece of feedback?

934
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:54,000
I mean, I don't probably not in our audience because it's a little bit different.

935
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,120
Probably not in our audience because there's probably others that feel this way.

936
00:48:57,120 --> 00:49:01,680
I would imagine this is an issue we've come up with before a turquoise technically boosted

937
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,360
in twice for this one.

938
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:07,280
So I combined them to six thousand two hundred sixty nine cents.

939
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:08,880
But some discord hate here.

940
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:09,880
Boo discord.

941
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:10,880
Yay.

942
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:11,880
Matrix.

943
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:12,880
When will self-hosted be on Matrix?

944
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:16,280
And we get this sometimes we know we've explained it before on the show.

945
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:22,080
But sometimes there we try to walk this balance between the perfect being the enemy of the

946
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:25,360
good enough and discord took off like a weed.

947
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:29,560
There's a really great community over there and there's more good than there is negative

948
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:30,560
as a result.

949
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:36,160
And because really the network effect, it has been very beneficial to just have a strong

950
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,160
discord presence for the show, too.

951
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,560
It's helped the show a lot.

952
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,100
Things like this London meetup, right?

953
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:43,960
They are birthed in that discord.

954
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:49,320
But there is two Matrix self-hosted rooms are not crazy busy, but they are available

955
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:53,760
on the Jupiter Broadcasting Matrix for those of you because like Turquoise here doesn't

956
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:58,440
basically doesn't want to put a phone number in or put information in the discord service.

957
00:49:58,440 --> 00:49:59,920
And there's going to be people out there that feel that way.

958
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,440
I totally understand.

959
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:06,620
So I've got an interesting take on this because if not this community, what community, right?

960
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:08,980
Because this would be the one to be doing it.

961
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:13,480
So with our hackerspace, with our folks that we work with at Defcon, it's like, hey, we

962
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:15,640
want this to be more private, more secure.

963
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:19,840
But the barrier to entry is so much higher, let alone just trying to get our own family

964
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:21,360
members onto it.

965
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:23,200
That's where it gets hard.

966
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:28,040
And until we make it easier for folks to onboard with that, it's much like I think that there

967
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:34,880
are better signal or messaging, secure messaging, like signal versus wire.

968
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:38,100
But the problem is, what's your onboarding process?

969
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:42,300
If it's not seamless, if it's not easy, you're not going to get as many people on.

970
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:46,720
So depending on your paranoia, depending on you actually having to do threat modeling

971
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:51,120
for yourself and your community, you're going to land in different areas.

972
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:55,600
And I could see too, like if this was a podcast that was doing, you know, war crime journalism

973
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:58,640
in Ukraine, maybe we wouldn't want to be on Discord, right?

974
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:01,280
Maybe we'd want to be using really secure encrypted communications.

975
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:05,320
But at the end of the day, this is a podcast and everything we produce is ultimately public

976
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:06,320
too.

977
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:11,280
We've almost got 5000 people in the Discord now, and I really don't think we would have

978
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:14,960
so many people in a Matrix server.

979
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:21,920
I may well be wrong, but my feeling is that the friction to joining a new Discord server

980
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:26,240
for those that are already using Discord, which at this point is a lot of people that

981
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:28,040
listen to this podcast, right?

982
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:32,120
The cross section Venn diagram is quite large.

983
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:37,200
The friction to joining yet another Discord server is quite low compared to signing up

984
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:41,140
for Matrix and then having the right client and then waiting whilst Chris and Wes add

985
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:47,800
more RAM to the box and, and, and, and, and, and so for me, I stand by what we said originally,

986
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:54,900
that the mission of the chat server, in this case, it's a Discord server, is not necessarily

987
00:51:54,900 --> 00:52:01,040
to be the ultimate in self hosting dog food, for want of a better phrase.

988
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:06,280
It's to further the mission by allowing people to collaborate and ask questions in a friction

989
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:07,280
free way.

990
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:11,560
Yeah, it's sort of like we stream on PeerTube now, but we're also streaming on YouTube and

991
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:14,920
Twitch because we want to be where the audience is at.

992
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:17,280
And just like with Matrix, we have a self hosted solution.

993
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:18,960
That is something we self host.

994
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:20,880
I'm long on Matrix, right?

995
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:24,120
I feel like given another five years, it's just going to continue to grow.

996
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:29,480
When we first launched our Matrix server, we had 200 users a year ago, you know, today

997
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:35,680
we have like 2500 users and our largest room is like 1300 people, but it's not as big as

998
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:39,360
the self hosted Discord because the Discord network effect is so much larger.

999
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:42,560
But I am very happy with that kind of growth for a year.

1000
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:46,440
And I imagine if that continues, at some point, Matrix will be a real big part of what we

1001
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:47,440
do.

1002
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:51,640
And it is already for me, it's already the it's out of all of the different platforms

1003
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:56,000
that I'm available on, Matrix is the one that I hang out on the most.

1004
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,120
I do check those self hosted Matrix rooms from time to time, if you want to jump in

1005
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:00,480
there Turquoise.

1006
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:04,280
One day, one day, we'll make the switch just just not yet.

1007
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:10,560
And I think it's going to come soon because we had some Red Hatters jump from Red Hat

1008
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:17,360
over to the Element community and seen some interviews online from Eric the IT guy with

1009
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:20,000
what they're doing and how they're onboarding it easier.

1010
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,780
They're making those bridges happen.

1011
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:24,820
If you throw a couple bucks at them a month, it's making it a lot easier to me.

1012
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:28,800
It made me go and say, huh, it might be time to go relook at that now.

1013
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:29,960
That's true.

1014
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:33,880
Red Hat does is getting a bigger and bigger Matrix present to not just not just the team

1015
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:39,080
people over at the element stuff, but like Red Hat itself, I am in I'm in a couple of

1016
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:42,120
Red Hat rooms actually on Matrix.

1017
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:44,360
So I I may be in rooms that you guys are not in.

1018
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:45,360
How weird is that?

1019
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:49,680
I'm not surprised.

1020
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:53,960
We do have one last boost that came into the show from Seamoon or maybe Simon, perhaps

1021
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:54,960
one day ago.

1022
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:55,960
Five hundred stats.

1023
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:58,500
Hey, guys, I recently learned about the Fountain FM app.

1024
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:00,080
That's one of the new podcasting apps.

1025
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:01,080
So here are some stats from you.

1026
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:02,840
I got a question, though.

1027
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:03,840
And this is a good question.

1028
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:04,920
I thought a lot about this.

1029
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:09,720
He writes, when you got the Bitwarden one time authentication code token that you can

1030
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:13,320
put in when you're when you have the tokens of Bitwarden, he says, isn't that sort of

1031
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:19,320
against the idea of a two factor authentication to store that code right next to the password?

1032
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:20,440
Greetings from Germany.

1033
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:21,440
Keep up the great work.

1034
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:22,440
Simon.

1035
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:23,440
Why?

1036
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:24,440
Yes.

1037
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:25,440
Yes, it is.

1038
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:29,120
But I refer you to an argument I made with in the last episode with Tim.

1039
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:33,400
It's sometimes about just not being the tallest nail, right?

1040
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:38,880
If you have a two factor turned on on your Amazon account, anybody that's got your password,

1041
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:42,880
assuming it's not your Bitwarden password, of course, is going to look at that account

1042
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:46,040
and go, can't be bothered, move on to the next one that doesn't have it.

1043
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:47,040
And that's it.

1044
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:49,520
That really that's all two factors good for, in my opinion.

1045
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:54,180
And so for me, the convenience of having it in Bitwarden and be just a paste away as part

1046
00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:59,840
of the keystrokes that I autofill with that risk profile for me is worth it.

1047
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:06,060
Now there are a couple of places that I remain phone two factor authentication, so GitHub

1048
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:07,060
is one of them.

1049
00:55:07,060 --> 00:55:09,020
My next cloud is another one.

1050
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:14,860
There's a couple that I keep out of Bitwarden, Bitwarden itself being a great example.

1051
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:19,580
Most of the time I keep things in Bitwarden just because it's easier, which is not the

1052
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:21,420
best security answer.

1053
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:22,420
But that's the reality.

1054
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:23,600
I mean, I like your answer, though.

1055
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:24,600
I think it makes sense.

1056
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:26,120
What is the threat model exactly, though?

1057
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:28,440
I mean, it seems like it's a physical one, right?

1058
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:32,900
Isn't it mostly a physical threat model with that situation, which, you know, I think that's

1059
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:35,940
a real balancing act there that you got to decide what you're going to protect against.

1060
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:40,000
And if you're in a scenario where somebody could physically take advantage of that, they

1061
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,740
may also have access to your phone.

1062
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:43,740
Physical access, man.

1063
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:46,760
Once you have physical access and if your kid can then go through and buy stuff from

1064
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:51,700
Amazon or from whatever else, do you want that all in one device and one app?

1065
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:52,700
But I think that's true.

1066
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:56,860
I think Alex made a perfect point, though, that he did his risk model to figure out that's

1067
00:55:56,860 --> 00:56:01,140
not his use case for other people in other situations that might not be.

1068
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:03,800
Wait till his daughter's older.

1069
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:09,020
But my Bitwarden authenticates with my face on my phone or my thumb on my MacBook.

1070
00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:14,340
Like, unless she's chopping my thumb off when I'm sleeping, which I'd probably notice, she's

1071
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:18,540
not going to unlock my Bitwarden unless she literally knows the password, which one day

1072
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:20,420
she will, I'm sure.

1073
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:25,140
If you'd like to send a boost into the show, go get a new podcast app at newpodcastapps.com.

1074
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:28,380
Send your wallet up with a few sats, they're on sale, so it's a great time to boost the

1075
00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:30,180
dip and send it in.

1076
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:34,060
What is Bitcoin with the price check today?

1077
00:56:34,060 --> 00:56:39,820
Not that I'm looking, but $20,016.19, I don't know why you'd ask that.

1078
00:56:39,820 --> 00:56:43,480
It's above 20, I suppose that's considered a W these days.

1079
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:47,300
Let's be honest, not for long, but don't get me into the doom and gloom of the economy

1080
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:49,340
that's coming.

1081
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:52,500
It's a great time to boost the show, I'll just put it that way.

1082
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:53,920
It's a long-term investment, right?

1083
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:54,920
Just hodl.

1084
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:58,020
Put your boosts to work by getting them cheap today.

1085
00:56:58,020 --> 00:57:00,540
Hodl, hodl, hodl indeed.

1086
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:03,600
And also, just a major thank you to our members.

1087
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:07,540
Our site reliability engineers make the show possible, and as a thank you, we give you

1088
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:10,940
an ad-free feed of the show, so no ads.

1089
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:15,940
And we are working, still doing the plumbing on live versions, so we'll have a live feed

1090
00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:16,940
as well.

1091
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:20,900
You'll have both options as a member, and I'm just kind of in the early stages with

1092
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:21,900
that.

1093
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:25,660
But if you are an RSS generator wizard, reach out.

1094
00:57:25,660 --> 00:57:31,060
I could use your help on that at selfhosted.show slash SRE if you want to sign up.

1095
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:34,820
And then you can also support all the shows on the network, become a member for all the

1096
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:39,300
shows, get all the special features, all ad-free at Jupiter.party.

1097
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:44,380
And one of those nice features is a self-hosted bonus post-show, which will be coming up in

1098
00:57:44,380 --> 00:57:45,380
just a little bit.

1099
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:48,380
You're going to talk about yet another golf I've purchased, I think.

1100
00:57:48,380 --> 00:57:49,380
I can't wait.

1101
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:54,140
I've specifically made Alex wait to tell me, so that way I can hear about it in the post-show.

1102
00:57:54,140 --> 00:57:57,580
I bought number seven.

1103
00:57:57,580 --> 00:57:58,580
It's becoming a problem.

1104
00:57:58,580 --> 00:58:01,860
We're going to be having an intervention.

1105
00:58:01,860 --> 00:58:07,580
Now I really do want to see all of your smiling faces in London on August the 5th, meetup.com

1106
00:58:07,580 --> 00:58:10,560
slash Jupiter broadcasting for all the details.

1107
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:14,620
And on the day itself, we'll probably be posting in there as well, if you're not quite sure

1108
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:17,660
exactly where to find us, keep an eye on that meetup page.

1109
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:19,980
That's where the source of truth is for that.

1110
00:58:19,980 --> 00:58:23,080
To write into the show, it's self-hosted dot show slash contact.

1111
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:24,780
That's the place to go to get in touch with us.

1112
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:27,340
And you can find me on Twitter at ironic badger.

1113
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:28,380
How about you, Josh?

1114
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:31,280
So you can find me at JSKAR underscore Hawk.

1115
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:35,820
So that's J S K A R underscore H A W K.

1116
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:36,820
Thank you very much for joining us.

1117
00:58:36,820 --> 00:58:37,820
It was a blast.

1118
00:58:37,820 --> 00:58:38,820
Absolutely.

1119
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:39,820
My pleasure.

1120
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:40,820
Thanks for having me on, guys.

1121
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:41,820
It was a lot of fun.

1122
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:44,820
We'll put a link to your GitHub for all the projects for the Raspberry Pi, as well as

1123
00:58:44,820 --> 00:58:46,220
your social in the show notes.

1124
00:58:46,220 --> 00:58:49,700
You can find the podcast on Twitter at self-hosted show.

1125
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:51,240
I'm at Chris Ellis.

1126
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:54,300
And don't forget, we're doing the show live on Wednesdays now.

1127
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:57,820
Every other Wednesday, you can get your local time and date at Jupiter broadcasting dot

1128
00:58:57,820 --> 00:58:59,180
com slash counter.

1129
00:58:59,180 --> 00:59:04,560
And you can catch video replays of the show at Jupiter dot tube, as also you can catch

1130
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:05,700
the live stream there.

1131
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:08,100
It's just like one place to remember Jupiter dot tube.

1132
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:12,860
Whilst I'm in England, that might might go on hiatus for a week or two, but we'll see.

1133
00:59:12,860 --> 00:59:13,860
We'll see.

1134
00:59:13,860 --> 00:59:16,180
Yeah, there's always there's always trickiness when you're traveling.

1135
00:59:16,180 --> 00:59:18,020
So we'll have to we'll have to be flexible.

1136
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:21,380
One of the places I'm staying, the primary Internet is Starlink.

1137
00:59:21,380 --> 00:59:24,380

It depends on if there's any obstructions and if Dish turns on their 12 gigahertz interference

00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:29,940
stuff.

1140
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:30,940
Right.

1141
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:31,940
Right.

1142
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:32,940
So thanks for listening, everybody.
