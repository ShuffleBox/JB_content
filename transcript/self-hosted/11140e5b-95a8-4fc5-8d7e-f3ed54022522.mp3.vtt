WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.680
Coming up on today's show, we discuss the Home Assistant Security Bulletin.

00:03.680 --> 00:09.840
I've got some pretty cool Bluetooth low-energy OLED temperature sensors for you from Xiaomi,

00:09.840 --> 00:12.880
and we get philosophical in the feedback section. I'm Alex.

00:12.880 --> 00:15.920
I'm Chris, and this is Self-Hosted 37.

00:17.120 --> 00:19.760
You know, it's only the last few weeks I realized that we just sort of

00:19.760 --> 00:22.800
blew right past our one-year anniversary in September.

00:22.800 --> 00:24.080
We're one!

00:24.080 --> 00:28.880
Yeah, I think it's just because we were doing the whole going independent thing again,

00:28.880 --> 00:30.720
and so we just had a lot on our plate.

00:30.720 --> 00:32.880
What's your opinion on first birthdays?

00:32.880 --> 00:36.240
I think the show's been really well received, and it seems like it's still growing,

00:36.240 --> 00:40.160
but it's found its audience, and I think it's a good first year,

00:40.160 --> 00:41.920
especially because, you know, we're not weekly,

00:41.920 --> 00:45.600
and so for some podcasts that can be rough, but it doesn't really seem to have held us back.

00:45.600 --> 00:48.480
I wasn't talking about that. I was talking about, like, you know, kids,

00:48.480 --> 00:51.040
first birthday, do you make a whole big deal about it?

00:51.040 --> 00:52.880
Because obviously they're not going to remember it.

00:52.880 --> 00:56.800
That's true, that's true. Yeah, I don't know, I feel like for podcasts,

00:56.800 --> 01:01.760
it's a good sign that it's a stable podcast, but there's like kind of this,

01:01.760 --> 01:06.160
the real, I think, real landmark for a podcast is five years.

01:06.160 --> 01:08.160
That feels like the one you celebrate to me.

01:08.160 --> 01:10.400
Yeah, you've done a few that have reached episode 300.

01:10.400 --> 01:12.000
I think for me that's a big number.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.080
Yeah, that's also a pretty big one.

01:14.720 --> 01:17.040
Yeah, so congratulations though on the anniversary.

01:17.040 --> 01:21.040
We thought this seems like the perfect episode to follow up on a lot of things because of that.

01:21.040 --> 01:27.360
You know, it's going to take us 11 and a half years at twice a month to reach episode 300.

01:29.040 --> 01:31.040
Maybe we'll have to step it up at some point.

01:31.040 --> 01:32.880
Maybe we'll go daily for the last little bit.

01:33.600 --> 01:37.440
We have flirted with the idea of weekly, but you know, with going indie,

01:37.440 --> 01:38.880
you've had so much on your plate again.

01:39.760 --> 01:42.720
It's not really been feasible for both of our schedules yet.

01:42.720 --> 01:45.680
Yeah, life is busy, but you never know. Things change in the future,

01:45.680 --> 01:49.760
but right now we don't have any plans to change it. We have discussed it from time to time.

01:49.760 --> 01:55.040
The future is, well, it hasn't happened yet, but this episode has happened.

01:55.040 --> 01:57.600
It's happening right now and it's brought to you by a cloud guru,

01:57.600 --> 02:00.560
the leader in learning for cloud Linux and other modern tech skills.

02:00.560 --> 02:03.280
Hundreds of courses, thousands of hands-on labs.

02:03.280 --> 02:07.200
Get certified, get hired, get learning, a cloud guru.com.

02:07.200 --> 02:13.200
I got a rather alarming set of emails and Reddit posts from the Home Assistant project this week

02:13.200 --> 02:18.960
about security bulletin and I wanted to get your take on how they're handling it because

02:18.960 --> 02:22.080
to me, it seems like controlled, well, not even controlled.

02:22.080 --> 02:23.760
It just seems like chaos over there.

02:23.760 --> 02:26.800
Yeah, they're really trying to get the word out. That's one of the reasons I think by now,

02:26.800 --> 02:28.960
when this episode comes out, people will know about it.

02:28.960 --> 02:31.520
But just because this seems to be really important,

02:31.520 --> 02:34.560
I even got a notification again this morning via their Discord community.

02:35.200 --> 02:38.160
So there was a security bulletin put out by the Home Assistant project.

02:38.880 --> 02:44.960
We will have the blog post linked in our show notes, but there's not much to it other than it

02:44.960 --> 02:51.200
just strongly encourages you to update as fast as possible and spread the word as far as possible.

02:51.760 --> 02:56.880
There is a specific call out in the blog post to an issue with custom components,

02:56.880 --> 03:00.320
which are not reviewed by the core Home Assistant team.

03:00.320 --> 03:04.000
But otherwise, there's really zero information in the bulletin as we record.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.080
This is several days after the bulletin as well.

03:06.880 --> 03:10.240
We were told there would be an update with more information,

03:10.240 --> 03:12.880
but it so far hasn't shown up anywhere.

03:12.880 --> 03:16.240
However, we do have several questions that we'd like to have answered,

03:16.240 --> 03:18.000
like which integrations were leaking stuff,

03:18.000 --> 03:20.560
under which circumstances were those integrations leaking stuff,

03:20.560 --> 03:24.160
and does the update that's been released fully address those issues?

03:24.880 --> 03:29.840
Or, as some are speculating right now, is it just merely mitigating them?

03:29.840 --> 03:34.320
Will there still be some risk after updating if we use whatever integration this supposedly was?

03:34.320 --> 03:39.600
So there's definitely questions that haven't been properly answered by the Home Assistant project right now.

03:39.600 --> 03:43.920
I wonder if that's because they just don't have the answers yet. You speculate, really.

03:43.920 --> 03:48.720
And at this point, I want to just let the audience know we are recording this a couple of weeks ahead of time.

03:48.720 --> 03:51.680
I've got some personal stuff coming up, so it's unavoidable.

03:51.680 --> 03:58.960
But, you know, from my perspective, I want to see like CVE-style clarity here.

03:58.960 --> 04:03.520
I want to know what the problem is, I want to know what they've done to fix it, or that they haven't fixed it.

04:03.520 --> 04:06.320
I actually don't necessarily mind if they haven't,

04:06.320 --> 04:11.760
because at least I know what the problem is, so I could maybe go and try and contribute to creating a fix, perhaps.

04:11.760 --> 04:13.280
Yeah, I'm sure they're very busy.

04:13.280 --> 04:18.800
But there are basic questions like, if I didn't use any custom components, do I have any cause for concern?

04:18.800 --> 04:23.360
Now, if you go by the code, because it's an open source project, it looks like maybe they caught that

04:23.360 --> 04:27.440
some nasty things were happening via the HTTP API.

04:27.440 --> 04:32.880
Seems like maybe they've added some basic filters to the code for some common web-based attacks.

04:32.880 --> 04:36.560
But really, the context matters here, so that's only something the project can provide.

04:36.560 --> 04:40.720
Yeah, I see some stuff in the code for one of the commits that's referenced in the forum post

04:40.720 --> 04:45.840
about the security bulletin, about file injection attacks at certain web URLs,

04:45.840 --> 04:51.200
as well as SQL injection protections and stuff like that, so who knows what's going on.

04:51.200 --> 04:55.600
This is where it's a really tricky balance, especially for a overburdened project,

04:56.160 --> 05:00.720
and especially a new one that hasn't really had to deal with a security issue quite like this yet.

05:00.720 --> 05:07.040
There is a real high standard for a platform, a really high standard of clear communication.

05:07.040 --> 05:11.040
And even if that communication is a status update, that they don't have the full report yet,

05:11.600 --> 05:16.960
it needs to be communicated. It's a hard lesson to learn. You also have to create process.

05:16.960 --> 05:22.880
It's a human problem as well as a process problem. But clear communication is critical

05:22.880 --> 05:28.880
for any kind of popular platform. And I know that they're very busy, but that's always going to be the case.

05:28.880 --> 05:32.320
And as more and more people integrate their homes and businesses around this,

05:32.880 --> 05:37.680
it's pretty important that we know what's going on. That's where the communication is probably going to

05:37.680 --> 05:43.680
be a bit of a learning opportunity in the future. But it also reminds me that they're still,

05:44.400 --> 05:51.040
as far as a project goes of this scope, relatively young. And they still have things that they're

05:51.040 --> 05:56.720
going to have to figure out. And it's not why it's a knock when I say this, but it sort of speaks to

05:56.720 --> 06:02.160
why I'm not a huge fan of their entire integrated approach with the OS and Home Assistant and the

06:02.160 --> 06:11.440
Supervisor. I'm not a huge fan of this project building an OS. With these types of security

06:11.440 --> 06:17.360
things, with the underlying platform, that's just an area I'd like to outsource that work to the

06:17.360 --> 06:22.240
folks at Canonical, Red Hat, or Debian. I just don't really prefer having the project control

06:22.240 --> 06:27.760
the entire stack. I understand why they do it. And it's an entirely separate conversation. But

06:27.760 --> 06:32.320
it's one of my arguments why I hope they keep making it possible for folks like me to deploy

06:32.320 --> 06:37.520
the entire Home Assistant experience on the OS of my choice. Because just for my personal comfort,

06:37.520 --> 06:43.520
and just the way I view the world, I like to know that a vendor like Red Hat or Canonical is behind

06:43.520 --> 06:47.920
the server OS that I'm using. I mean, I see on a daily basis at work, a lot of the stuff that goes

06:47.920 --> 06:53.760
on behind the curtain of maintaining a kernel, of maintaining a Kubernetes distribution and that

06:53.760 --> 06:58.640
kind of stuff. And it's an astronomical amount of work. And I've got to agree with you. I think if

06:58.640 --> 07:05.680
the project were to take the limited resources that they have and kind of share them out in their

07:05.680 --> 07:11.200
area, well, not share them out, but like, delegate the responsibilities of the more complex tasks,

07:11.200 --> 07:18.880
like building an OS to vendors whose day job it is, and who have 25 plus years, I'm looking at

07:18.880 --> 07:24.320
Debian, experience in doing this kind of stuff. And then they can focus on what they're good at,

07:24.320 --> 07:28.880
which is building a brilliant home automation platform. But to their credit, they caught this.

07:28.880 --> 07:34.080
And the other thing I think they've done right in this process is they have communicated the need

07:34.080 --> 07:39.760
to upgrade. They haven't been particularly great about communicating why, other than they've

07:39.760 --> 07:47.040
been very good at getting the word out. And there is a pretty safe process to do that upgrade. So I

07:47.040 --> 07:53.040
decided to do it over the weekend. So that way I could report back here on the show. And my setup

07:53.040 --> 07:59.920
is it's Ubuntu 20.04 running on a Raspberry Pi four. I can't even remember how I set it up now,

07:59.920 --> 08:04.400
but I have the full supervised home assistant setup so I can install the add-ons and take

08:04.400 --> 08:09.760
snapshots. And I really love that setup, even though it's not technically a supported setup anymore.

08:09.760 --> 08:14.960
But I went into my home assistant supervisor and I clicked update. Well, first I took a snapshot,

08:14.960 --> 08:19.520
actually did the snapshot. And whenever I'm doing something that may introduce a breaking change,

08:19.520 --> 08:25.040
because it wasn't clear here, if there was an issue with custom integrations, I thought it's possible

08:25.040 --> 08:29.440
they just disabled custom integrations for temporary, you know, until they have this thing

08:29.440 --> 08:33.360
fixed. And so I thought this could be a breaking update. I don't know. There's not really been any

08:33.360 --> 08:37.920
information about that. So I took a snapshot and then I downloaded that snapshot to my local hard

08:37.920 --> 08:44.880
drive, just in case. Then I head over to the update button, click the update. Nothing happens. Click it

08:44.880 --> 08:51.600
again. Nothing happens. And it's not exceptionally good at communicating status. So I SSH into the

08:51.600 --> 08:54.800
server. Again, I love that it's a server I can just get access to. And I have things like

08:54.800 --> 09:00.160
bashtop installed and I run bashtop and htop and I get an idea is like, is there anything happening

09:00.160 --> 09:06.480
in the background? And I pretty quickly determine nothing's happening. So I turned to an integration

09:06.480 --> 09:11.120
that I have. And this is one of the reasons I wanted the full home assistant experience and not

09:11.120 --> 09:16.640
just home assistant core, because there is there's integrations like the upgrade configuration

09:16.640 --> 09:22.640
checker that will download the latest version of home assistant, do a fake container check,

09:22.640 --> 09:27.840
install and then check it against your config yaml and tell you if there's anything that's going to

09:27.840 --> 09:33.520
break in the upgrade. So I thought, I'll run that. Only it broke. And I had to go digging for the

09:33.520 --> 09:38.480
logs on the file system to discover that there was some issue with, quote, custom integration quote,

09:38.480 --> 09:43.920
but they didn't say which integration it was. So I didn't really know what was going to happen.

09:43.920 --> 09:50.240
But I decided for the good of the show, I'd pull the trigger and I did the update. And I

09:50.240 --> 09:55.360
pulled the trigger and I did the update and it still did nothing. Okay, what's going on?

09:55.360 --> 10:02.320
So is the configuration check failed? The update has failed. There must be something wrong. So I

10:02.320 --> 10:07.360
reboot the whole machine figure. Let's just get that out of the way. Home assistant loads back up

10:07.360 --> 10:12.480
by verify functionality. I go in the supervisor, I hit the update button and I started to get the

10:12.480 --> 10:16.400
circle of progress. It starts working all of a sudden, even though I hadn't changed anything.

10:16.400 --> 10:19.600
I just did a reboot and the machine had only been rebooted about 24 hours ago,

10:19.600 --> 10:24.400
too, which I thought was kind of funny about it. It pulls it down. It does the update. And so far,

10:24.400 --> 10:28.800
I don't I don't see any issue. I have the now the latest version. Everything seems to be going just

10:28.800 --> 10:32.800
smooth. And I'm not quite sure why I had the problems with that update. I'm not quite sure

10:32.800 --> 10:38.720
why my config check had problems. But everything's tested and working. The only time I've had issues

10:38.720 --> 10:45.360
with the config checker is when there's been an error in my config, actually. Yeah, I created an

10:45.360 --> 10:49.440
include that was pointing at a missing file or something. And rather than telling me that the

10:49.440 --> 10:54.720
config checker just sat there and span and span and span. It takes a while to on the Raspberry Pi

10:54.720 --> 10:57.760
because you're doing it, you know, you're downloading it, which I don't have the fastest

10:57.760 --> 11:02.960
connection in the RV. So I'm waiting for that. Oh, yeah, it can it can take a beat. That is true.

11:02.960 --> 11:09.360
At least I would say set aside two or three minutes. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Or more. Maybe 15.

11:09.360 --> 11:14.160
But you see the air. I put it there in the show notes for you. It just says invalid config for

11:14.160 --> 11:21.360
script integration. And then it's just blank. And it says not found two quotes that are just empty.

11:21.360 --> 11:26.880
Very helpful. Yeah. So I'm going to pull it up. It says it's online 21. So I know where to go look.

11:26.880 --> 11:31.520
But I decided to run the update since I had a snapshot and everything went through. I have

11:31.520 --> 11:37.520
the latest version and it's working perfectly fine. But I do kind of wonder what that custom

11:37.520 --> 11:41.360
integration airs about and if it's related to some of the fixes they just did since their fixes are

11:41.360 --> 11:46.400
related to custom integration. So I'll be diving deeper into that into the future. But have you

11:46.400 --> 11:51.120
decided to pull the trigger on the upgrade for you? Well, I mean, I was I was quite busy the other

11:51.120 --> 11:55.520
night and I just saw the notification come through and was like, oh, so I just hit upgrade. I didn't

11:55.520 --> 12:02.240
have time to check. I subscribe through the Nabu Casa app. So technically, my install is internet

12:02.240 --> 12:07.360
facing, even if you have to guess a very long obfuscated URL. When did you start doing that?

12:07.360 --> 12:11.040
I didn't know that. Well, I started supporting the project. That was the reason I actually

12:11.040 --> 12:15.440
started paying for it was really to support development, not necessarily because I wanted

12:15.440 --> 12:20.560
the remote features. But it actually turned out to be pretty handy because, you know, with COVID,

12:20.560 --> 12:25.360
I haven't really left the house that much. So I haven't had the need to SSH into my house remotely

12:25.360 --> 12:31.280
very much. And I got to where I was going and found out I couldn't connect to my house to pass

12:31.280 --> 12:37.920
the time or whatever. And so I opened up Home Assistant in the phone app, looked at the URL,

12:37.920 --> 12:43.920
type that into on my on my laptop, and then use the VS code plugin with the built in shell

12:45.280 --> 12:49.280
to create the SSH keys that I needed. And I was good to go.

12:49.280 --> 12:52.240
That's a great little example of how all that stuff can really come together.

12:52.880 --> 12:57.280
Yeah, so I got the update loaded. I haven't actually updated the version on my Home Assistant

12:57.280 --> 13:01.760
blue hardware at the studio, but I'm you know, more a couple of weeks into using that. And I'm

13:01.760 --> 13:05.840
still loving that as well. I'm grateful they're doing the update. What do you use for snapshots?

13:05.840 --> 13:08.480
I use the built in supervisor tool that does the snapshots.

13:08.480 --> 13:11.360
Have you come across the Google Drive backup plugin?

13:11.360 --> 13:12.640
I don't think I have.

13:12.640 --> 13:18.800
No, it's not in the main store. I'm pretty sure it's an external thing, but it is awesome. So I

13:18.800 --> 13:23.360
think in the self hosted life hack that we did a few months ago, I showed it off there where I

13:23.360 --> 13:29.680
basically took a completely fresh install of Home Assistant, applied the snapshot, which was taken

13:29.680 --> 13:34.960
by this Google Drive plugin. So it automatically does stuff like snapshot rotation. So you can

13:34.960 --> 13:39.600
have a daily, a weekly, a monthly, yearly snapshot, that kind of thing. Really? I can

13:39.600 --> 13:43.760
have up to seven days and four months or whatever. You got to link this. You got to link this up. I

13:43.760 --> 13:46.800
got to check this out. All right. Yeah, it's pretty slick. And it obviously integrates with

13:46.800 --> 13:53.760
Google Drive. So, you know, each snapshots 200 megs or so in my setup. So it doesn't really take much

13:53.760 --> 14:01.120
storage. Linode.com slash SSH. Go there to get a $100 60 day credit and support the self hosted

14:01.120 --> 14:05.680
podcast. Linode is our server provider. Whenever we're building something for the show or my

14:05.680 --> 14:11.520
personal infrastructure and now JB 3.0's infrastructure. Yeah, it's all up on Linode

14:11.520 --> 14:18.080
and gamers. Linode is your DIY of choice. They make it really easy. And there are plenty of

14:18.640 --> 14:24.080
simple one click deployments for things like Minecraft and CSGO servers. That's a really

14:24.080 --> 14:28.800
simple way and a really nice and fast way to get a nice private gaming space. And they will

14:28.800 --> 14:33.120
have you fill out like just some of the basics you need to get some of the fundamental server

14:33.120 --> 14:37.600
options set and they'll deploy it pre configured for you. So make sure you check that out. Every

14:37.600 --> 14:43.840
plan comes with Linode's amazing human powered customer support. We've had story after story

14:43.840 --> 14:49.040
from our audience of great experience with Linode's customer support. You can email,

14:49.040 --> 14:53.440
you can hit them up on social media, you can pick up a phone and talk to an actual human.

14:54.240 --> 14:57.760
How about that? I mean, Linode gets it. They've been around for a long time.

14:57.760 --> 15:03.600
They started in 2003 as one of the first companies in cloud computing, three years before AWS and

15:03.600 --> 15:07.040
other enterprise providers. And they're independently owned and they're founded

15:07.040 --> 15:11.120
on a love for Linux and open source technologies. And they really support the community that

15:11.120 --> 15:16.400
surrounds them. Like this show, like the Kubuntu project, like Linux Fest Northwest,

15:16.400 --> 15:23.600
which you know is very special to us. Linode's a supporter of them. But you get a $100 credit

15:23.600 --> 15:28.800
when you go to linode.com slash SSH. So you can play around with their really powerful

15:28.800 --> 15:33.920
systems if you want. Try out building some tools around object storage. It's a great opportunity

15:33.920 --> 15:38.160
to experiment with different stacks. That's one of the things I've done on Linode is I tried

15:38.160 --> 15:42.960
several different WordPress stacks to see which one I like, you know, with nginx or I even try to

15:42.960 --> 15:47.280
web browser where everything runs out of RAM and they have all of this stuff that is just ready to

15:47.280 --> 15:53.840
go as configuration scripts that you can just kick off and get going. It's really simple. And they

15:53.840 --> 15:57.680
also offer a lot of powerful tools. They don't hide that stuff from you either. So try it out.

15:57.680 --> 16:05.440
Linode.com slash SSH. How often do you ask yourself the question, when does it make sense

16:05.440 --> 16:11.440
to build versus buy a solution? A lot of times that's one of the first or second questions I

16:11.440 --> 16:16.240
ask myself. I very frequently do that math. You must as well. Yeah, what's particularly annoying

16:16.240 --> 16:21.760
is that I actually built a solution last year and there's a solution I can now buy that is so much

16:21.760 --> 16:29.680
better for half the price that I'm kind of sat here going, I wish I hadn't built one now. Yeah,

16:29.680 --> 16:33.440
it's tricky, right? Because things like temperature sensors and humidity sensors,

16:33.440 --> 16:38.480
you might end up wanting a lot of them. You do. Yeah. So I mean, probably every single room is a

16:38.480 --> 16:43.680
bit of overkill, but certainly at the other end of the spectrum, just a single thermostat as a

16:43.680 --> 16:51.120
single point of measurement in a house is, it's always struck me as weird. It's absolutely nutty.

16:51.120 --> 16:55.760
It's even nutty in a tiny space, like a tiny home or an RV. Yeah, because one room, if you shut the

16:55.760 --> 17:01.200
door can get to several degrees higher than the hallway. Yeah. So I'm holding in my hand up to

17:01.200 --> 17:06.240
the camera so you can see it. This is the little temperature sensor I've bought. It's from Xiaomi.

17:06.240 --> 17:11.360
So it's a Bluetooth low energy temperature sensor with an OLED screen. There'll be a picture of it

17:11.360 --> 17:17.840
in the show notes. It's about the size of three or four keys on my keyboard square. So it's pretty

17:17.840 --> 17:24.160
small, fits in the palm of my hand very comfortably. And they supply these things with a small little

17:24.160 --> 17:28.240
piece of adhesive tape that you can use to just stick it on the wall anywhere. They're fully

17:28.240 --> 17:36.640
battery powered. They connect to an ESP32, which you flash with ESP Home. You give it the Bluetooth

17:36.640 --> 17:43.120
Mac address of this device, and then ESP Home will connect to these sensors. There is a catch.

17:43.840 --> 17:48.720
You need to flash a custom firmware on the sensors as well. So expect to set aside an evening to do

17:48.720 --> 17:56.000
this if you're flashing half a dozen sensors or so. But the best part is that it's $9 for a four

17:56.000 --> 18:01.920
pack of these sensors. No. With the screen on there? I mean, that's what I love about them.

18:01.920 --> 18:06.880
I know. It's crazy, isn't it? I have very expensive temperature sensors that will do all kinds of

18:06.880 --> 18:11.200
fancy things. But you know what they don't do is they don't actually just display the temperature

18:11.200 --> 18:15.840
on them. And in a way, that's that's a killer feature because you get the context right there

18:15.840 --> 18:19.360
for the room you're in. And it's also being fed to home a system, the temperature and the humidity

18:19.360 --> 18:25.120
on the screen, which in the south east of the US humidity is my is the bane of my life. So

18:26.720 --> 18:31.200
yeah, so you want to you want to keep an eye on that damn thing. Yeah. How long would you say for

18:31.200 --> 18:36.480
four of them to get that flashing process done? Well, it's actually a really slick sort of web

18:36.480 --> 18:41.200
configurator thing built into the GitHub repo that's linked in the show notes. So what you do

18:41.200 --> 18:45.920
is you fire up your phone, you connect your phone's Bluetooth to this thing, flash the firmware through

18:45.920 --> 18:50.960
a web browser, and then listen for the MAC address in the logs that way and then paste that into the

18:50.960 --> 18:58.320
ESP home configuration and flash that to your ESP 32. It sounds like a lot of steps, but it really

18:58.320 --> 19:02.640
isn't that bad. If you're familiar with the SP home doesn't sound bad at all, actually. Sounds

19:02.640 --> 19:06.480
quite doable. Yeah, very slick. I've been very impressed with it. I think I came across this

19:06.480 --> 19:12.960
first on the intimate tech YouTube channel. We had him on a few episodes ago. The Quinn led guy,

19:12.960 --> 19:18.400
they just seem to work really well. I had a couple of Bluetooth dropouts with the ESP 32 is being on

19:18.400 --> 19:24.880
a different end of the house. So I've ended up buying for ESP 32, which is the most expensive

19:24.880 --> 19:30.560
part of the setup, one on each floor at each end of each floor. And they're basically stacked on

19:30.560 --> 19:37.840
top of each other at each end of the house. So I mean, even at $11 each on Amazon for an ESP 32,

19:37.840 --> 19:41.840
we're not talking crazy amounts of money. And you can definitely order them a lot cheaper than on

19:41.840 --> 19:46.000
AliExpress if you're willing to wait for the slow boat. So now that you're getting the temperature

19:46.000 --> 19:49.360
data, what are you going to do with it? Are you going to do any automations? Because that's,

19:49.360 --> 19:54.000
I mean, that's really where it gets next level. Yeah, I want to. I haven't quite figured it out

19:54.000 --> 19:57.440
yet. So I, we're going to talk more about this in the post-show. I think we've got something in

19:57.440 --> 20:04.320
there about thermostats and the vent style unit that I use, but what I want to do is take the

20:04.320 --> 20:10.320
average. And this is something Dr. Z's does a lot of. He takes the average of several sensors and

20:10.320 --> 20:16.240
then uses that as his thermostat input number. What I would like to see is, is I take the average

20:16.240 --> 20:21.840
across the entire top floor of my house, for example, and then use that as the input to the

20:21.840 --> 20:28.000
thermostat. I haven't figured out how to use a custom input with a thermostat that has an

20:28.000 --> 20:34.160
integration. You can do that with the generic thermostat module of Home Assistant, but I haven't

20:34.160 --> 20:40.400
quite joined all the dots up to make it work with a pre-configured one. Justin wrote into the show.

20:41.040 --> 20:46.000
He said he was, he was actually writing it because on Coder Radio, which by the way,

20:46.000 --> 20:50.960
not this podcast. Where's my robe? Yeah, I'm working on it. I am wearing the minimum viable

20:50.960 --> 20:55.200
robe at the moment. I was talking to Mike about his problems with, he moved into a new place and

20:55.200 --> 21:00.960
it comes with a smart thermostat and it's been freezing him out at night. And mine has my system

21:00.960 --> 21:06.320
every now and then something happens and the automation triggers don't fire and I cook out.

21:06.320 --> 21:11.920
I get like too hot, like a heater doesn't get turned off. And I generally, this fix has always

21:11.920 --> 21:17.280
just been, I reboot my Home Assistant host and then it doesn't happen for another couple of weeks.

21:17.280 --> 21:22.080
But Justin wrote into the show and he said, you'd mentioned that failed automation. Home Assistant,

21:22.080 --> 21:26.960
like you were just talking about, Alex, he says, has a generic thermostat component and it is

21:26.960 --> 21:32.560
fantastic. I use it in several rooms of our house. You provided a temperature sensor and a switch

21:32.560 --> 21:39.680
and the component handles all of the rest. It looks like there's some affordance for it

21:39.680 --> 21:44.000
understanding if you want something in a target temperature that it might need to kick in a little

21:44.000 --> 21:49.120
bit at a different time in order to actually get that temperature just right. It seems clever and

21:49.120 --> 21:54.240
like a way better idea than me completely building this automation from scratch like I have been. So

21:54.240 --> 21:58.960
when you do go down that route, I agree with listener Justin, check out the generic thermostat.

21:58.960 --> 22:02.960
Yeah, I need to connect those dots for sure. I mean, in my specific situation,

22:03.680 --> 22:08.720
the room above my garage happens to be where we spend most of our time. And if I close the door

22:08.720 --> 22:14.720
to the hallway on this room and the heat is running, it can easily get four or five Celsius

22:14.720 --> 22:19.680
higher in this room than the hallway. When the forced air is blowing, it gets very dry, the air

22:19.680 --> 22:24.160
and the static electricity becomes a bit of a problem and stuff like that. So what I really

22:24.160 --> 22:30.240
want is just a way to use that sensor that I'm looking at right now in this room as the dedicated

22:30.240 --> 22:35.280
input to the thermostat. If I can use an average, then well, even better. But what I absolutely want

22:35.280 --> 22:40.400
is an automation that fires when that particular sensor gets above a certain threshold that it just

22:41.040 --> 22:44.800
doesn't turn off the heating because that's not what I want. I just want it to stop heating me

22:44.800 --> 22:50.880
for a bit right now and then evaluate things in 10 minutes and figure out whether it needs to still

22:50.880 --> 22:55.680
keep blasting us with the heat or not. And to add an extra layer of complication,

22:56.240 --> 23:04.080
if it could also be somehow energy efficient aware. So if you were running off grid or maybe

23:04.080 --> 23:08.560
in your case you have like a Tesla Powerwall and the grid was down and you were running off battery,

23:08.560 --> 23:13.360
if the system could adjust to use less power but still maintain a minimum comfort,

23:13.360 --> 23:17.040
that'd be the next level. That's what I really want now for dupes.

23:17.040 --> 23:22.080
That's our next business idea. We had cloudfree.shop. The next one is this

23:23.200 --> 23:27.040
sort of mega thermostat that beats the pants off the nest.

23:27.040 --> 23:32.960
Right. So Jim wrote into the show and he wants just our thoughts on going solar. He says,

23:32.960 --> 23:37.120
I'm looking for solar for my home and I'm not really sure where to start looking. Everywhere

23:37.120 --> 23:42.080
I go I get bombarded with ads and people who seem like salesmen. I've looked at businesses like

23:42.080 --> 23:46.240
Tractor Supply and other sources but I worry about what they're selling and if they're actually the

23:46.240 --> 23:51.440
best tech. And he wonders what we did to look into this because I know you've considered solar for

23:51.440 --> 23:56.800
the home. You've considered Powerwalls for the home. I'm curious what your route and trajectory

23:56.800 --> 24:00.880
is when you go off on a research binge for this. It's amazing how quickly you end up with the

24:00.880 --> 24:06.320
Tesla stuff when you start googling this stuff. They must spend a lot on marketing or SEO or

24:06.320 --> 24:13.040
something. I ended up looking at getting, I think it was like 12 panels put on my roof. Ultimately

24:13.040 --> 24:17.840
it ended up being too expensive to consider right now and they weren't in North Carolina yet and

24:17.840 --> 24:22.640
stuff like that. So I haven't done it yet. It's definitely on my list because I do feel guilty

24:22.640 --> 24:29.600
about burning several hundred watts a day of permanent server electricity and stuff like

24:29.600 --> 24:36.640
that that could very easily be supplied through solar. Part of it is I want to try and do my bit

24:36.640 --> 24:41.360
for the environment but the other part is it'd be nice to save some money too. The research of it

24:41.360 --> 24:46.320
for me has always kind of been I try to find communities that are discussing the type of

24:46.320 --> 24:50.960
builds that I'm doing. So in my case they're more mobile builds but we just shift communities

24:50.960 --> 24:57.120
depending on the build. And then also YouTube tends to play a pretty significant role and

24:57.120 --> 25:02.000
it's really a process of finding and refining the selection of YouTubers you find and getting

25:02.000 --> 25:07.840
their advice. I went to a company called AM Solar to have my mobile install done and I did that

25:07.840 --> 25:15.280
through a process of reading lots of reviews about people's solar installs and finding forums

25:15.280 --> 25:20.480
where people were discussing getting solar installed and kind of narrowed it down to a few

25:20.480 --> 25:25.520
companies and then you know had my geographic location and they were kind of within my

25:25.520 --> 25:30.320
striking distance and then I went and looked up pictures of their work which I think is another

25:30.320 --> 25:34.240
really good tip if you can find any on their website or on Google Images I went and found

25:34.240 --> 25:38.720
pictures of their work and thought that you know everything looked really good and tidy and

25:38.720 --> 25:42.400
that was something that was important to me in this installs. I didn't want it to be just a ball

25:42.400 --> 25:48.320
of wires I wanted it to look like it was maybe built from the factory that way and they did

25:48.320 --> 25:53.040
absolutely that. So that was sort of my process. I don't know about you but the more salesier

25:53.040 --> 25:57.040
company is the less interested I am. Yeah and when it comes to that kind of stuff too it's easy

25:57.040 --> 26:02.560
to get scammed so just take your time you know get get multiple opinions on stuff. And the other

26:02.560 --> 26:07.280
thing is and this is a very US-centric comment but there are some federal tax incentives that

26:07.280 --> 26:13.360
tend to expire at the end of each calendar year so I noticed the number of texts I was receiving

26:13.360 --> 26:18.400
about sign up for solar now in December was a lot higher than it has been in January so

26:18.400 --> 26:23.200
just factor that in as well. So Phil wrote in he's a fan of your perfect media guide I think

26:23.200 --> 26:28.480
it's really helped him a lot and he had questions about your VDEV configurations that you're using

26:28.480 --> 26:33.600
for the perfect media server. From what I understand if you use one disk per VDEV there is

26:33.600 --> 26:39.920
no protection benefit for ZFS. I'm researching options for setting up a DIY NAS and need to have

26:39.920 --> 26:46.240
a cost to bring to the wife to get the spousal approval. Yeah we've been there you know my

26:46.240 --> 26:50.080
biggest fear in life is that my wife sells my servers for what I told her they cost.

26:52.480 --> 26:59.360
Yes and I know she's listening to this so hello wife. I run in a mirror VDEV very very simple

26:59.360 --> 27:06.480
I just mirror two drives and that gives me 50% you know space efficiency and stuff like that

27:06.480 --> 27:12.400
so I can I can sustain one drive failing locally before I need to start resorting to backups.

27:12.400 --> 27:18.800
Standard moment where I say RAID is not a backup and you should never rely on it as such I very

27:18.800 --> 27:24.720
much look at it as that's my primary like source of truth but if anything was to go wrong with

27:24.720 --> 27:30.560
that server or both of those drives were to fail at once I actually have just you know been using

27:30.560 --> 27:35.600
the Helios 64 since the review for this but I'm just putting together a new system to act as a

27:35.600 --> 27:43.680
local ZFS mirror of the mirror VDEV in my house so that will live at the other end of the building

27:43.680 --> 27:48.880
in case one end I don't know catches fire or something god forbid. So the short answer is

27:48.880 --> 27:54.000
mirrored VDEV and if you can swing it as well a second copy of the data somewhere else and

27:54.000 --> 27:59.360
preferably another copy off site. Well this is right on topic because listener Phil wrote in he

27:59.360 --> 28:03.600
said you guys often talk about syncing files off site for backup but I'd like to hear a little bit

28:03.600 --> 28:08.320
more detail how are you guys protecting your backups from things like ransomware or accidental

28:08.320 --> 28:12.640
mass deletion in those cases maybe you're not even aware that something is wrong for months

28:13.200 --> 28:17.120
I know we do it in the enterprise level but I'd love your thoughts on using tools for yourself

28:17.120 --> 28:21.440
for folks at home thanks and keep up the good work Phil. How do you protect your backups and I

28:21.440 --> 28:27.360
think you might mean encryption and other things like you know the whole gamut. Well ZFS recently

28:27.360 --> 28:34.320
added data set encryption so the remote system in my setup isn't encrypted it's at my dad's

28:34.320 --> 28:40.000
house so I do trust that as an end point but I think that is a valid thing that I want to try and

28:40.000 --> 28:47.280
implement moving forward but this is one of the primary reasons I run ZFS is snapshot support so

28:47.280 --> 28:53.600
I can roll back to a specific snapshot you know much like the Home Assistant Google Drive plugin

28:53.600 --> 29:00.480
that lets me do hourly, daily, weekly, monthly backups. ZFS lets me do that as well and I use

29:00.480 --> 29:07.680
Jim Salter's Sanoid tool to configure I think I've got like 24 hours worth of hourly backups and then

29:07.680 --> 29:13.760
I've got a week's worth of daily backups and then I've got four weeks worth of backups going back a

29:13.760 --> 29:18.960
month and then I've got one month backup going back six months I think and then I've got an

29:18.960 --> 29:26.320
annual thing as well so pretty well covered I think but I don't know how I would spot ransomware

29:26.960 --> 29:31.440
other than just going to access a file and being like oh crap. Ransomware I'm not particularly

29:31.440 --> 29:35.120
concerned about because it would have to get executed and you know the server environment's

29:35.120 --> 29:40.960
my data city none that's not that's not particularly likely. Kind of like yourself I have the NAS here

29:40.960 --> 29:46.880
at the studio is kind of like a central repository of truth and then JB as a business has several

29:46.880 --> 29:52.880
cloud instances of different data sets I have my data set personally in lady jupes I think all of

29:52.880 --> 30:01.440
that back to the NAS here at the studio I don't have a great backup solution for that NAS now most

30:01.440 --> 30:06.400
of the data on it is actually reproducible by all the other locations if I just brought them all

30:06.400 --> 30:10.640
back again but now I have a little bit more historical information on there that isn't

30:10.640 --> 30:17.280
necessarily duplicated anywhere else and I'm starting to change my opinion on backing up my

30:17.280 --> 30:23.520
media stuff in the past I always thought well I have the source material and what I can't find

30:23.520 --> 30:28.880
on disk I could probably find on the internet and I'm okay with that because I've likely paid for

30:28.880 --> 30:34.480
it at some point so I think I'm okay but now I actually have found that that's not necessarily

30:34.480 --> 30:39.600
the case I've had trouble getting DVDs and Blu-rays and I've had trouble finding things online of

30:39.600 --> 30:45.440
some series so now I'm actually thinking maybe I need to back up absolutely everything but that

30:45.440 --> 30:52.080
becomes like you know a 15 terabyte problem I have to solve becomes a race to the bottom yeah

30:52.080 --> 30:58.800
very quickly yeah and then there's just I mean I think the only way would be I need to create like

30:58.800 --> 31:03.680
a box that maybe I mean maybe it's possible if USB storage if I had the money if I wanted to

31:03.680 --> 31:09.280
invest that kind of money into it and sync it here locally and then take it off site via my

31:09.280 --> 31:15.840
cell set it up somewhere off site and sync it up that is the solution you know is to build a server

31:15.840 --> 31:22.080
and stick a hundred terabytes in it and and just forget about it at your well in my case my parents

31:22.080 --> 31:26.640
house I could do my dad's I could probably even do it at Angela's house you know she has fiber at

31:26.640 --> 31:32.560
her at her place she's a pretty good connection I know I know I would love that as far as protecting

31:32.560 --> 31:39.680
my backups that I send to Google Drive which are things like my Docker config directories my Docker

31:39.680 --> 31:45.440
compose files that kind of stuff I still am very happily using duplicati which I think I've been

31:45.440 --> 31:50.480
using for the entire run of the show and that will do encryption for me and it handles the

31:51.760 --> 31:57.600
both sides encrypting and decrypting side of it and I just love it and I have I've experimented

31:57.600 --> 32:01.680
with using duplicati to save to multiple different cloud providers which is kind of what I would do

32:01.680 --> 32:06.400
in the case of say mass deletion on Google Drive or some sort of issue but I haven't pulled the

32:06.400 --> 32:09.840
trigger yet just because of the bandwidth requirements every single night to do that

32:09.840 --> 32:14.880
it's not like Google ever killed a product either is it so it seems like drives pretty core but you

32:14.880 --> 32:21.200
never know right they could also start doing you know stupid things like revoking API access for

32:21.200 --> 32:26.720
third-party applications Google Drive itself as a core product is probably safe yeah although

32:26.720 --> 32:33.680
nothing truly is with Google but the workarounds that I've been using for the last several years of

32:34.960 --> 32:39.120
buying one seat of G Suite or whatever it's called this week and then just uploading three

32:39.120 --> 32:43.920
or four terabytes I think those days are numbered so yeah I don't know if you saw but they're also

32:43.920 --> 32:49.360
revoking sync access to the Chromium upstream you know open source browser they change the

32:49.360 --> 32:55.520
terms all the time and I could see them revoking they've also revoked like the sign-on for Geary

32:55.520 --> 33:00.880
the email client on Linux that's just hostile isn't it I thought their slogan was don't be evil

33:00.880 --> 33:06.800
well I think their slogan now has become ginormous I'm not sure they've done a lot of stuff with

33:06.800 --> 33:12.800
turning the screws on storage particularly in the last six months yeah so I really don't think that

33:12.800 --> 33:18.480
relying on Google anymore as your off-site backup is going to be a viable strategy beyond

33:19.200 --> 33:24.000
I think it's June this year the Google photos unlimited storage for pixel owners deal that was

33:24.000 --> 33:28.320
that ended is now officially done too as this episode is out so that's all over yeah you're

33:28.320 --> 33:32.000
right there hasn't been a lot of changes there that's why you mentioned it earlier

33:33.280 --> 33:38.320
I think things like cloudfree.shop are the way to go because they're devices that have just been

33:39.280 --> 33:45.120
they're pre-divorced from the cloud when you get them they've been pre-flashed with OS's that are

33:45.120 --> 33:50.560
open source that just use your local network that don't need any cloud connection and like Alex said

33:50.560 --> 33:55.520
it's somebody in the community that built this and I just think it's so cool they're like our

33:55.520 --> 34:00.640
official unofficial sponsor we do have a promo right do we have a promo code we do yeah self-hosted

34:00.640 --> 34:05.520
is the coupon code I think you get 10% off a light bulb and we get a little kickback from anything

34:05.520 --> 34:10.720
else that you buy oh you know what I need light bulbs at the studio I was going to mention they

34:10.720 --> 34:16.800
have that outdoor smart plug too which is slick but I actually am in the market for light bulbs

34:16.800 --> 34:22.480
correction I think it's smart plugs not smart bulbs my bad sorry you know what man you got

34:22.480 --> 34:26.640
me so excited I thought he's got like some sort of light bulb it's all built in over there no

34:26.640 --> 34:31.600
that's cool that's cool the smart plugs smart plugs will do I thought of a slogan for them

34:31.600 --> 34:39.040
though cloudfree.shop your cloud prenup that's pretty good I like that I like that yeah you

34:39.040 --> 34:43.760
welcome that that's free what do you say we do a couple of NFC automation tricks that the audience

34:43.760 --> 34:47.360
wrote in about because you know we've talked about these NFC tags a couple of times I have one right

34:47.360 --> 34:52.480
here on the mixer that I've set up to do like D&D and stuff like that and turn on lights this is

34:52.480 --> 34:57.440
particularly relevant for me right now because I've just switched to iOS I wanted to take my

34:57.440 --> 35:03.520
camera game to the next level and boy is the camera on this thing good but moving some of the

35:03.520 --> 35:09.920
NFC stuff across and just some of the you know more esoteric Android stuff that I like has been

35:09.920 --> 35:16.480
tricky so with with iOS what happens is when I tap my NFC tag I then have to tap on a notification

35:16.480 --> 35:21.600
that comes in on the phone which is just it's just one extra step right but someone wrote in with a

35:21.600 --> 35:26.880
workaround oh yeah and this we got two workarounds and I was wondering about these so that's why I

35:26.880 --> 35:31.200
love these emails because I had seen these as possibilities in the in the back of my mind I

35:31.200 --> 35:36.720
was chewing on it as maybe something to try but these this confirms my suspicions Billy wrote in

35:36.720 --> 35:42.080
with the first one on episode 35 you guys talked about NFC tags in the car I also use an NFC tag

35:42.080 --> 35:46.400
to open my garage door just like the badger I switched recently from Android to an iPhone and

35:46.400 --> 35:50.480
figured out a way to run the NFC automation without having to click the notification

35:51.120 --> 35:56.240
it does require that you have your garage door brought into home kit which I am using via home

35:56.240 --> 36:01.040
assistant he says then you just create an automation in the home app when a specific

36:01.040 --> 36:06.320
tag is tapped like toggle the garage door it kind of sucks that you have to do it that way

36:06.320 --> 36:10.880
but it is triggering a home assistant action if you're already using the app this is very easy

36:10.880 --> 36:14.960
and it's simple to make it work you could just create a boolean that acts as a virtual switch

36:14.960 --> 36:20.560
in the home app and then triggers a home assistant automation or action that's great that is a great

36:20.560 --> 36:24.960
idea and I actually I have encouraged you off air but I'm encouraging you on air at some point in

36:24.960 --> 36:29.760
the future to play around with the home kit integration with home assistant I don't know

36:29.760 --> 36:33.280
if this gets talked about enough because I think maybe we have a lot of Android users out there

36:33.280 --> 36:38.720
that are home assistant users but it brings all of the functionality and home assistant

36:38.720 --> 36:45.280
into home kit and that makes it work with your watch with the home pods with Siri it's it's

36:45.280 --> 36:51.200
pretty great I am glad that Billy wrote in with that one I'm also even more gladder that's not

36:51.200 --> 36:57.040
a word but you know what I mean that he called me the badger that's fun that is fun Quinton Ronin

36:57.040 --> 37:02.880
with maybe even a better one though uh he's also uh he says he's a site reliability engineer I think

37:02.880 --> 37:09.520
one of you commented about using NFC tags I found a way around this you create a web hook in home

37:09.520 --> 37:14.880
assistant and then use an automation on the phone which is created with the shortcuts app to call

37:14.880 --> 37:20.320
that web hook you're allowed to trigger these from an NFC scan without having to confirm the action

37:20.320 --> 37:26.160
manually and he has linked us to a post where he explains it more on his blog so I will include

37:26.160 --> 37:30.560
that in the show notes but this isn't this if you look in the home assistant app you'll see this

37:30.560 --> 37:35.920
web hooks action you combine that with a shortcuts app and you've essentially solved the problem so

37:35.920 --> 37:39.520
you got two options and one of them doesn't require you mess around with home kit at all

37:39.520 --> 37:43.040
that's neat I mean I I've only ever really used web hooks when it comes to Jenkins

37:43.600 --> 37:49.280
so the fact that we can use them for something actually fun and useful cool hey just a thank

37:49.280 --> 37:53.680
you to our members I've noticed some of these emails are from SREs and we really appreciate

37:53.680 --> 37:58.480
everyone who becomes a site reliability engineer helps the show stay independent and as a thank you

37:58.480 --> 38:03.280
you get a little extra content a limited ad feed with a little extra content at the end if you'd

38:03.280 --> 38:08.880
like to help the show and become a member it's self-hosted.show slash sre and so Linus writes in

38:08.880 --> 38:15.280
I don't know if it's that Linus although I doubt it let's just pretend okay Mr Torvalds I'm going

38:15.280 --> 38:20.080
to give you advice on something yeah right okay Linus writes in could you give your opinions on

38:20.080 --> 38:24.960
how your setup will survive you what will happen to your awesome setup if you aren't around anymore

38:24.960 --> 38:29.840
will your spouse just pick up everything and it just work how can I strive towards such a situation

38:29.840 --> 38:35.200
if worse comes to the worst thanks for a great podcast Linus. Deep question one that's a little

38:35.200 --> 38:39.920
uncomfortable to think about sometimes I do think this played a little role in my recent

38:40.480 --> 38:48.800
renewed push to document as much as my setup as possible in markdown but I know that no my my

38:48.800 --> 38:56.080
family wouldn't wouldn't really use these systems I have documented the passwords in a password vault

38:56.080 --> 39:00.320
that they have the password to so they if they needed to could get access to that and then they

39:00.320 --> 39:05.200
could share that with somebody like Alex who could help spin stuff up or down for them and

39:05.200 --> 39:10.160
you know transition them I think that's a great point plain text all the things as much as possible

39:10.880 --> 39:16.160
and have a bit warden or a last pass or something like that yeah so right now it's in last pass

39:16.160 --> 39:21.680
however I have been thinking about transitioning to something else like bit warden or or something

39:21.680 --> 39:24.720
that is I mean it's something I want to have a conversation with them because I need to have

39:24.720 --> 39:29.040
their buy off as well but I want to share you know primarily with my wife but there's some

39:29.040 --> 39:32.400
things that I would leave for Angela too and so I kind of wanted something that could accommodate

39:32.400 --> 39:36.800
different logins with different different credentials so if anybody has any suggestions

39:36.800 --> 39:41.520
I'd love to know but what do you think about what would you think your wife would keep it going for

39:41.520 --> 39:46.320
a bit do you think she'd ask just for somebody to help or do you think she'd just shut it down and

39:46.320 --> 39:50.800
get a cable subscription and start reading books I mean what do you think she would do

39:50.800 --> 39:56.160
well at the end of the day this stuff is my hobby right right and it just so happens I've been lucky

39:56.160 --> 40:02.400
enough to turn it into a podcast and linux as a job but I also enjoy doing this stuff in my spare

40:02.400 --> 40:10.080
time as well yeah I just don't see how she or anyone else in my family would have that level

40:10.080 --> 40:16.960
of interest to keep things on the road beyond you know the initial six twelve months you know

40:16.960 --> 40:22.240
that these things would probably continue running for untouched there are some things I think that

40:22.240 --> 40:28.080
would be missed in terms of quality and life like plex like booksonic like home assistant

40:28.880 --> 40:35.840
but are they sufficiently useful that it's not worth just buying a netflix membership or

40:35.840 --> 40:43.520
or buying some proprietary smart home automation stuff like a lot of what we've done is ultimately

40:43.520 --> 40:50.160
boils down to being nice to have versus absolutely critical I view it as critical because of my value

40:50.160 --> 40:56.720
set and who I am but there's a huge swathe of people in my immediate circle in my family that

40:57.360 --> 41:03.120
wouldn't care if that stuff went away tomorrow really so I think it would continue to work for

41:03.120 --> 41:08.000
some time but ultimately it would sort of decay and die with me which is a bit sad to think about

41:08.000 --> 41:13.120
yeah I think the things that they would care more about would be things like documents and photos

41:14.000 --> 41:18.960
I think that is something that would be a little more significant and so that's something I try to

41:18.960 --> 41:24.320
give thought to a little bit long term is just tripped in that maybe I haven't done a good enough

41:24.320 --> 41:28.560
job with that currently but it wouldn't take a lot of work to make that pretty accessible

41:28.560 --> 41:33.040
to my wife without my without my help maybe the way to think about this is try to think of things

41:33.040 --> 41:38.640
that they would want access to and then make it as easy as possible for them but it's it's always

41:38.640 --> 41:42.800
worth thinking and trying to build your systems that way if nothing else because even though it's

41:42.800 --> 41:47.840
a little bit of a of a morbid thought I think it actually leads to building better systems

41:47.840 --> 41:52.560
totally does I mean just just stop and ask yourself the question now if if something did happen to

41:52.560 --> 41:59.760
you tomorrow or well even if it doesn't right if you just had to give your partner or your brother

41:59.760 --> 42:07.600
or sister or parent or something your laptop and say go and do something you know download a photo

42:07.600 --> 42:13.680
or find this this tax return or whatever it is do you think they'd be able to do it without you

42:13.680 --> 42:19.920
going oh you just do this oh you just do that you know and if the answer is no then like Chris says

42:19.920 --> 42:24.880
maybe maybe you need to write some better documentation and print it out or something

42:24.880 --> 42:30.640
and put it in a safe or something and say go to this web URL and you will find the answers to the

42:30.640 --> 42:35.920
kingdom you know it kind of goes back to a topic that comes up on our show well several times over

42:35.920 --> 42:41.840
the you know the year plus run now because it's over a year now craftsmanship absolutely you know

42:41.840 --> 42:45.600
and that can be another aspect of craftsmanship about your setup and why not because nobody else

42:45.600 --> 42:49.920
is going to do it and it's your setup it's your opportunity to show a little craftsmanship and

42:49.920 --> 42:54.240
also it's another it's another nice way for people to remember you guys look at the time and effort

42:54.240 --> 43:00.000
he took to make this accessible for us so it's a win-win it's it's just a matter of time and I kind

43:00.000 --> 43:04.480
of pulled back on it a little bit but you know what Mr Torvald's writing in here it's got me

43:04.480 --> 43:09.600
feeling like I'm going to keep up with it again it's like inheriting uh someone else's workshop

43:09.600 --> 43:14.400
tools you know yeah when my wife's dad passed away we inherited a bunch of his workshop stuff

43:14.400 --> 43:21.520
and it was I don't know just just odd to be in someone else's cave you know and I guess it's a

43:21.520 --> 43:28.480
similar situation with these types of systems so I'm all sad now thinking about this I feel like

43:28.480 --> 43:32.080
if I logged into your box though I'd feel pretty comfortable I'd have a pretty quick yeah but

43:32.080 --> 43:37.120
you're a massive nerd mate you know I know I know but that's what's I mean there's something about

43:37.120 --> 43:41.280
that that's like kind of weird like server swapping we should try that sometime and then

43:41.280 --> 43:49.760
record a reaction yeah like wife swap but shitter yeah just like almost like that but just a little

43:49.760 --> 43:55.520
bit different just see what it's like where would it air would it air on tlc would that be the place

43:56.080 --> 44:00.480
no I don't think they'd want it but you know it's funny is if you look at some of my servers

44:00.480 --> 44:06.640
you can really see transitions and how I organize stuff or just legacy stuff like the way we have

44:06.640 --> 44:12.720
the nas setup here is really really far removed on how I build a system now and the way I lay out

44:12.720 --> 44:18.800
the disks and all of it and actually the the zfs array that we're using was originally set up and

44:18.800 --> 44:25.520
partitioned and managed by alan jude so it's like extensively complex the man the mr legend yeah he

44:25.520 --> 44:30.160
set it up while he was out here and we it's worked with us I mean it's clearly scaled for years

44:30.160 --> 44:35.920
because we've changed out operating systems we've moved hardware but that zfs pool is still

44:35.920 --> 44:42.640
there and that zfs pool just continues to grow and and survive but if you look at it now it's

44:42.640 --> 44:48.240
a total total misrepresentation of how I would build a system not to mention just because it's

44:48.240 --> 44:54.240
an arch server didn't it start life on bsd and now yeah like you say it's running arch yeah bsd

44:54.240 --> 44:59.360
for a while I think it lived on fedor for a bit and now it's on arch and it's it's so far it

44:59.360 --> 45:04.800
stayed there because it's a minimum viable arch so it's just the absolute bare minimum of a system

45:04.800 --> 45:10.480
that was it coda where you're talking about minimum viable server and uh I was I was resonating so

45:10.480 --> 45:14.960
hard with that because I've just switched over to proxmox and all of its weird abstractions and

45:14.960 --> 45:18.640
stuff and I was thinking oh I was just on arch this would have been so easy I'd have been done

45:18.640 --> 45:24.160
10 minutes ago you know but yep yep yep yeah there is something to that I also want to mention our

45:24.160 --> 45:27.520
sponsor cloud guru is on social media so if you are learning this stuff right now and you want to

45:27.520 --> 45:33.040
engage with them on social media they're just slash a cloud guru on youtube twitter and facebook

45:33.040 --> 45:39.680
alex you're probably on twitter too I bet I sure am I'm there at let's stop that let's stop that

45:39.680 --> 45:45.200
