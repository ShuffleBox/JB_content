00:00.000 --> 00:02.960
Today's episode is a really exciting one for me.

00:02.960 --> 00:05.760
It's the culmination of five years work.

00:05.760 --> 00:08.160
The perfect media server is now,

00:08.160 --> 00:09.840
well, I'll save it for the show.

00:09.840 --> 00:11.760
We also respond to a ton of your feedback.

00:11.760 --> 00:13.760
This is Self-Hosted 35.

00:15.120 --> 00:17.440
Well, Alex, I'll admit it right here on the show.

00:17.440 --> 00:20.800
I set up yet another sync thing server this weekend.

00:20.800 --> 00:23.520
You thought you'd leave 2020 behind in style, hey?

00:24.240 --> 00:25.840
I wanted more speed, Alex.

00:25.840 --> 00:28.800
Actually, it really came down to me doing the math

00:28.800 --> 00:32.080
and realizing, hey, you know, when I switch networks,

00:32.080 --> 00:34.080
it kind of slows the syncing down.

00:34.080 --> 00:37.440
But if I can pull from multiple sync servers,

00:37.440 --> 00:38.560
it kind of makes up for it

00:38.560 --> 00:40.640
and goes even faster in ideal situations.

00:40.640 --> 00:44.560
So I thought, why not set up a sync thing server on Linode

00:44.560 --> 00:46.400
and just sync a small select stuff

00:46.400 --> 00:47.680
that I really wanna move fast?

00:48.480 --> 00:50.160
And it legit works.

00:50.160 --> 00:50.960
It's really nice.

00:51.840 --> 00:53.120
It's like doubles the amount of files

00:53.120 --> 00:54.880
that can be transferred at once too,

00:54.880 --> 00:57.040
from what I can tell in my brief testing.

00:57.040 --> 00:59.520
I'll be honest, I haven't continued with sync thing

00:59.520 --> 01:01.760
after we talked about it a couple of episodes ago.

01:01.760 --> 01:02.640
Just doesn't work for me.

01:02.640 --> 01:04.640
Just doesn't do it, I'm afraid.

01:04.640 --> 01:06.000
But I'm glad it's working for you.

01:06.560 --> 01:08.160
You're a hater, I understand.

01:08.160 --> 01:09.440
I understand, I understand.

01:10.240 --> 01:11.040
I love it.

01:12.400 --> 01:17.680
I think 2020 is the year that I stepped into

01:17.680 --> 01:20.240
a long-term relationship with sync thing.

01:20.240 --> 01:24.080
And it's not like I'm working on files super quick

01:24.080 --> 01:25.440
and I wanna move it between machines

01:25.440 --> 01:27.120
and I wanna edit a file upstairs

01:27.120 --> 01:28.720
and then walk down into the studio

01:28.720 --> 01:30.160
and have that file on my desktop.

01:30.800 --> 01:32.720
It may be able to serve that function,

01:32.720 --> 01:34.400
but I've learned not to expect that.

01:34.400 --> 01:37.600
The one caveat I do have with sync thing

01:37.600 --> 01:40.080
is you gotta let it go at its own pace.

01:40.080 --> 01:41.840
Gotta let it go at its own pace.

01:41.840 --> 01:43.440
And that's why I love online learning too.

01:43.440 --> 01:44.640
And this episode is brought to you

01:44.640 --> 01:46.320
by the all new A Cloud Guru,

01:46.320 --> 01:48.000
the leader in learning for cloud Linux

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
and other modern tech skills.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.560
Hundreds of courses, thousands of hands-on labs.

01:52.560 --> 01:54.400
Get certified, get hired, get learning

01:54.400 --> 01:56.400
at acloudguru.com.

01:57.120 --> 01:59.360
Well, Alex, I think we should start the show today by,

01:59.360 --> 02:01.360
well, maybe we started by talking about sync thing,

02:01.360 --> 02:04.000
but now we should start talking about a project

02:04.560 --> 02:06.560
in various forms at least you've been working on

02:06.560 --> 02:08.000
for about five years.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.400
And I think if I'm not wrong,

02:10.400 --> 02:13.200
it's like about to reach its ultimate form.

02:13.200 --> 02:14.160
Perhaps, yeah.

02:14.160 --> 02:16.800
Well, I mean, as we record, it's still 2020,

02:16.800 --> 02:19.600
but I think this is gonna come out on new year's morning.

02:19.600 --> 02:21.600
So happy new year, everybody.

02:21.600 --> 02:23.040
Welcome to 2021.

02:23.040 --> 02:26.080
Hopefully it's more prosperous than the last one was.

02:26.640 --> 02:29.040
We're talking about my perfect media server project.

02:29.040 --> 02:31.440
So this was something that when I was involved

02:31.440 --> 02:35.440
with linuxserver.io that actually helped me

02:36.160 --> 02:39.040
kind of form the direction for that site

02:39.040 --> 02:40.560
and the blog and stuff like that.

02:40.560 --> 02:43.760
So on the 2nd of February, 2016,

02:43.760 --> 02:47.920
I wrote a post about what I called

02:47.920 --> 02:50.400
the perfect media server for once for better name.

02:50.400 --> 02:51.760
And it's kind of stuck now.

02:51.760 --> 02:53.360
It's bold, but now you've kind of become

02:53.360 --> 02:54.880
the perfect media server guy.

02:54.880 --> 02:55.920
Yeah, I guess so.

02:57.040 --> 02:59.040
I've toyed with changing the name a few times,

02:59.040 --> 03:01.200
but enough people have seen it.

03:01.200 --> 03:02.640
And I've looked at the analytics

03:02.640 --> 03:05.840
and a lot of people have read that post over the years

03:05.840 --> 03:09.040
that in fact, funnily enough, when I moved to Raleigh,

03:09.040 --> 03:11.520
one of my closest friends now who's also called Alex,

03:12.640 --> 03:14.960
he joined Linux server originally.

03:14.960 --> 03:16.800
He's now one of the Linux server devs.

03:16.800 --> 03:17.840
He joined that website

03:17.840 --> 03:20.640
because he read my perfect media server post.

03:20.640 --> 03:23.520
And so when I came to town, he met up with me

03:23.520 --> 03:25.840
and we had a few beers and stuff like that.

03:25.840 --> 03:27.520
And he was so excited to tell me

03:27.520 --> 03:30.000
that he'd built one as well around Docker

03:30.000 --> 03:33.680
and SnapRaid and MergerFS and all this kind of stuff.

03:33.680 --> 03:38.000
So it's been a really cool thing to share with the world.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.080
Well, you also got a great domain name for it,

03:40.080 --> 03:42.080
perfectmediaserver.com.

03:42.080 --> 03:42.960
Is that new?

03:42.960 --> 03:43.840
Brand new, yes.

03:43.840 --> 03:49.840
I, well, when I say brand new, I mean, I bought it in June.

03:51.040 --> 03:55.280
I've been promising a 2020 version of this article

03:55.280 --> 03:58.800
for rather longer than I would like.

03:58.800 --> 04:02.320
So I released one in 2016, another one in 17

04:02.320 --> 04:03.840
and another one in 19.

04:03.840 --> 04:05.200
And, you know, when you start thinking

04:05.200 --> 04:06.560
about what can I write about

04:07.280 --> 04:10.160
with these perfect media servers

04:10.160 --> 04:14.560
when everything is just so reliable and just works,

04:14.560 --> 04:16.400
there comes a limit when you think,

04:16.400 --> 04:20.080
well, I can't really rehash the same thing again and again.

04:21.280 --> 04:24.800
And so this time I was looking at the three posts

04:24.800 --> 04:27.840
and since I'm no longer involved with Linux server,

04:27.840 --> 04:31.040
I don't have access to edit those blog posts easily anymore.

04:31.040 --> 04:33.520
I mean, I can ask the team to fix things and stuff,

04:33.520 --> 04:36.480
but invariably information goes out of date

04:36.480 --> 04:40.560
and I am a huge advocate of open source

04:40.560 --> 04:43.520
and community contributions and Wikis

04:43.520 --> 04:44.480
and all that kind of stuff.

04:44.480 --> 04:48.320
And so I just thought that this would make much more sense

04:48.320 --> 04:50.880
as a kind of a Wiki type website

04:50.880 --> 04:53.600
with first-class search categories,

04:53.600 --> 04:56.080
walking people through how to do things,

04:56.080 --> 04:58.080
you know, in a step-by-step kind of fashion

04:58.800 --> 05:00.240
and then leave the blog posts

05:00.240 --> 05:02.160
as kind of like an annual opinion piece

05:02.160 --> 05:07.600
alongside this more kind of dry technical Wiki style website

05:07.600 --> 05:09.200
at perfectmediaserver.com.

05:09.200 --> 05:10.560
Okay, that makes a lot of sense.

05:11.280 --> 05:14.960
And I think probably the real value for people to understand

05:14.960 --> 05:17.920
is you're telling people there's a lot of options out there,

05:17.920 --> 05:20.080
but maybe this is a great stack to use.

05:20.080 --> 05:21.840
You can use this stack, I've tested this,

05:21.840 --> 05:23.600
I've refined it over the years

05:23.600 --> 05:28.800
to do really a beyond just okay media setup,

05:28.800 --> 05:30.480
but a great whole media setup.

05:30.480 --> 05:33.280
And instead of saying, oh, there's so many use cases

05:33.280 --> 05:36.480
or the answer which is frequently it depends,

05:36.480 --> 05:38.240
you make some opinionated decisions

05:38.240 --> 05:40.640
and kind of point people in a direction

05:40.640 --> 05:42.080
and then lay out how to do it.

05:42.080 --> 05:45.680
And I think that's maybe for me the real value of the site.

05:45.680 --> 05:48.480
I think as well, a lot of people come to Linux

05:48.480 --> 05:50.320
and I've said this before on the show,

05:50.320 --> 05:53.520
a lot of people come to Linux not through the desktop

05:53.520 --> 05:57.680
but through Plex, through running headless apps

05:57.680 --> 05:59.520
on a Synology or a Raspberry Pi

05:59.520 --> 06:00.880
or something like that.

06:00.880 --> 06:04.080
And once you start having a box in your house

06:04.080 --> 06:07.120
that does everything 24 hours a day,

06:07.120 --> 06:09.040
that is on 24 hours a day,

06:09.040 --> 06:10.720
you think what else could I do with it?

06:10.720 --> 06:13.680
And that single spark is a huge rabbit hole.

06:13.680 --> 06:16.640
And I think one of my primary goals with the site

06:16.640 --> 06:19.440
is to equip those newer people

06:19.440 --> 06:23.440
with the skills that they need to install Ubuntu,

06:24.320 --> 06:28.480
set up merger FS, figure out what an FS tab is

06:28.480 --> 06:32.640
and not be intimidated by wading through

06:32.640 --> 06:35.840
lots of different disparate documentation

06:35.840 --> 06:37.520
across different places on the internet.

06:37.520 --> 06:39.440
It's just all in one place.

06:39.440 --> 06:42.400
And if you wanna have multiple hard drives

06:42.400 --> 06:45.040
in a single box that are of mismatched sizes

06:45.040 --> 06:46.800
with different file systems,

06:46.800 --> 06:48.640
well, here's a solution for you.

06:48.640 --> 06:50.320
You've already got data on these drives,

06:50.320 --> 06:52.640
you don't wanna do RAID, great, cool,

06:52.640 --> 06:54.640
come along and join the party.

06:54.640 --> 06:57.520
Yeah, and honestly, it's a lot of the stack

06:57.520 --> 06:58.800
that we talk about frequently.

06:58.800 --> 07:01.520
You talk about Docker, kind of some of the background

07:01.520 --> 07:02.960
in there, how to get it going,

07:02.960 --> 07:04.880
and you work your way up through

07:04.880 --> 07:07.040
how to manage multiple disks of different sizes,

07:07.040 --> 07:10.160
like you say, but then also, if you wanna go ZFS

07:10.160 --> 07:14.240
and here's also a Proxmox layer you should consider,

07:14.240 --> 07:16.000
any one of those could be broken out

07:16.000 --> 07:18.480
and really have nothing to do

07:18.480 --> 07:20.240
with building a media server.

07:20.240 --> 07:21.920
So it's kind of valuable in that way too, I suppose.

07:21.920 --> 07:23.600
So I mentioned that just for the audience

07:23.600 --> 07:25.840
who's not interested in building a media server,

07:25.840 --> 07:30.400
but does wanna learn more about Docker or MergerFS

07:30.400 --> 07:33.840
or SnapRate or ZFS or Proxmox or hardware,

07:33.840 --> 07:36.320
any of that kind of stack, stuff we talk about on this show

07:36.320 --> 07:38.720
and you wanna read something from Alex on it,

07:38.720 --> 07:40.320
you can find it there too.

07:40.320 --> 07:43.280
I could totally have seen a guy like me,

07:43.280 --> 07:45.200
maybe if I was building my media server setup

07:45.200 --> 07:47.280
for the first time, I'd be thinking, okay,

07:47.280 --> 07:50.160
I know I wanna use containers, but I don't quite know how

07:50.160 --> 07:53.280
and in what way to use them to do this right.

07:53.280 --> 07:55.680
I know about MergerFS, but I don't know

07:55.680 --> 07:59.520
how to deploy it and so having you write something,

07:59.520 --> 08:02.720
having used this stuff in production for five years now,

08:02.720 --> 08:04.400
there's value to that.

08:04.400 --> 08:06.480
So you should be the perfect media server guy.

08:06.480 --> 08:08.480
I think I said good on you.

08:08.480 --> 08:10.000
You be the perfect media server guy

08:10.000 --> 08:12.880
because I endorse this media server build here.

08:12.880 --> 08:15.040
You are Chris and you support this message.

08:15.040 --> 08:17.600
Wonder what the cost is, have you thought about that?

08:17.600 --> 08:19.440
Have you thought about like what the cost would be

08:19.440 --> 08:22.560
for a minimal build of something from this guide?

08:22.560 --> 08:23.840
Well, in terms of hardware.

08:23.840 --> 08:24.960
Yeah, in terms of hardware.

08:24.960 --> 08:28.640
I think QuickSync now for me is a minimum price of entry

08:28.640 --> 08:31.200
after everything we talked about in the last episode.

08:31.200 --> 08:34.640
So a hundred bucks for a CPU,

08:35.200 --> 08:36.480
you can probably find a used motherboard

08:36.480 --> 08:38.080
that will do the trick for a hundred dollars.

08:38.080 --> 08:40.480
Again, RAM is a bit about a hundred

08:40.480 --> 08:42.880
and then hard drives for an eight terabyte hard drive.

08:42.880 --> 08:44.480
Now you can go to Best Buy and pick one up

08:44.480 --> 08:47.680
for around 130, 140.

08:47.680 --> 08:51.520
So I don't know, let's say 140.

08:51.520 --> 08:53.360
140, what's that?

08:53.360 --> 08:57.040
It's like $1,100 or so for hard drives.

08:57.920 --> 08:59.520
I don't know, 1,500.

08:59.520 --> 09:03.520
I think all in would get you five, eight terabyte drives

09:03.520 --> 09:08.080
of 40 terabytes of storage for $1,500 all in

09:09.280 --> 09:10.880
and you own it forever.

09:13.440 --> 09:15.040
I mean, Synology make a great product.

09:15.040 --> 09:17.600
So do QNAP and Unraid's also great,

09:17.600 --> 09:18.720
but it's not open source.

09:18.720 --> 09:22.320
FreeNAS requires learning ZFS,

09:22.320 --> 09:25.040
which I know I talk about in Perfect Media Server,

09:25.040 --> 09:29.280
but it's kind of orthogonal to the main content.

09:29.280 --> 09:31.120
It's not required learning,

09:31.120 --> 09:34.960
whereas with a TrueNAS or a FreeNAS product, it is.

09:34.960 --> 09:37.760
It's just the most flexible thing for most people.

09:37.760 --> 09:41.520
And I think when you start looking at putting together

09:41.520 --> 09:42.400
one of these servers,

09:42.400 --> 09:45.200
$1,500 isn't a small upfront investment.

09:45.200 --> 09:47.120
And you think, right, well, where can I cut some cost?

09:47.120 --> 09:50.240
And the obvious answer is the hard drives.

09:50.240 --> 09:54.000
Rather than buying five, let's only buy a couple, right?

09:54.000 --> 09:56.240
And then I'll add the other three

09:56.240 --> 09:58.080
over the next year or two.

09:58.080 --> 09:59.520
MergerFS lets me do that.

09:59.520 --> 10:02.720
It lets me add drives as my collection grows

10:02.720 --> 10:07.040
without having to re-silver a ZFS array

10:07.040 --> 10:10.800
or rebuild a RAID setup or anything like that.

10:10.800 --> 10:14.240
It just grows as I do and it changes and matures.

10:14.240 --> 10:16.160
And because it's just Linux,

10:16.160 --> 10:19.520
it's open and I can go and tinker as deep

10:19.520 --> 10:20.880
as I want under the hood.

10:20.880 --> 10:23.840
Or again, because it's Linux, it will just work.

10:23.840 --> 10:24.720
It's just reliable.

10:24.720 --> 10:27.200
It's battle tested and hardened everywhere.

10:27.200 --> 10:31.520
So I really do think that if you're willing

10:31.520 --> 10:35.680
to put the time in and learn a little bit of this stuff

10:35.680 --> 10:37.840
with the information that's provided here for you,

10:37.840 --> 10:38.960
for free, I might add,

10:38.960 --> 10:41.040
I don't make a penny off of this stuff.

10:41.040 --> 10:42.400
Anyway, I never have.

10:42.400 --> 10:43.840
I just wanted to give this information

10:43.840 --> 10:45.200
back to the community.

10:45.200 --> 10:47.280
I don't think there's a better solution really

10:47.280 --> 10:48.960
if you're willing to put the effort in.

10:48.960 --> 10:51.280
And I'll just give one more mention

10:51.280 --> 10:52.560
because as you were talking there,

10:52.560 --> 10:54.800
I was just also reviewing your QuickSync

10:54.800 --> 10:58.800
and Proxmox page and damn, you put some work into this.

10:58.800 --> 11:00.880
But I also, I think it's pretty clever

11:00.880 --> 11:03.760
that you embedded the relevant JB content

11:03.760 --> 11:06.240
where we've talked about a lot of this stuff in depth

11:06.240 --> 11:07.360
when it still holds up.

11:07.360 --> 11:10.240
So not only do you get a lot of the written stuff

11:10.240 --> 11:11.200
and the visual examples,

11:11.200 --> 11:13.840
but you've got like a video from Wendell in here too.

11:13.840 --> 11:17.520
And so you add the supplemental media content.

11:17.520 --> 11:21.360
I could see us linking this to a lot of people

11:21.360 --> 11:22.240
that write into the show

11:22.240 --> 11:24.400
and ask questions about this stuff.

11:24.400 --> 11:26.240
If I were gonna contribute one area,

11:26.240 --> 11:27.120
I just thought to troll you,

11:27.120 --> 11:29.520
I'd probably contribute using ButterFS

11:29.520 --> 11:33.680
because literally everything you just said about MergerFS

11:33.680 --> 11:35.040
is why I use ButterFS.

11:35.040 --> 11:38.160
Seriously, like word for word.

11:38.160 --> 11:41.120
So on the ZFS page,

11:41.120 --> 11:44.160
there's a whole section about what about ButterFS.

11:44.160 --> 11:45.000
So-

11:45.000 --> 11:48.320
Okay, good, you've addressed it, I can see.

11:48.320 --> 11:49.600
Well, a little bit.

11:49.600 --> 11:53.440
And my conclusion was that using ButterFS

11:53.440 --> 11:56.320
would probably be easier than ZFS

11:56.320 --> 11:58.720
simply because it shipped as part of the Linux kernel.

11:58.720 --> 12:02.720
But I've invested in ZFS mentally,

12:02.720 --> 12:07.360
but also I've synced six, seven terabytes worth of data

12:07.360 --> 12:09.920
across the ocean to the UK.

12:09.920 --> 12:13.520
And I don't wanna have to spend another six or seven weeks

12:13.520 --> 12:15.120
doing that again if I switch.

12:15.120 --> 12:19.440
Well, ironically, it's more about how you use MergerFS.

12:19.440 --> 12:21.280
However, I think both are great.

12:21.280 --> 12:23.680
And if MergerFS is working for you,

12:23.680 --> 12:26.000
I'm really not, I'm just more of teasing.

12:26.000 --> 12:30.560
But it did strike me that being able to join mismatched disks

12:30.560 --> 12:32.000
and add them as it grows

12:32.000 --> 12:33.920
and be able to remove them easily

12:33.920 --> 12:36.240
is why I switched to using ButterFS

12:36.240 --> 12:37.520
on my Raspberry Pi media servers

12:37.520 --> 12:39.120
because I needed some extra data

12:39.120 --> 12:41.760
in my media servers because I needed something

12:41.760 --> 12:43.440
that essentially was no cost.

12:43.440 --> 12:45.760
Since ButterFS is built into the kernel

12:45.760 --> 12:47.840
and it also doesn't have a high,

12:47.840 --> 12:49.440
it's a very efficient file system.

12:49.440 --> 12:50.720
There's not a big performance penalty.

12:50.720 --> 12:52.480
I don't need a lot of RAM.

12:52.480 --> 12:53.760
It meant that I didn't have to install

12:53.760 --> 12:56.080
any additional software at all.

12:56.080 --> 12:59.280
And actually no additional config files or anything.

12:59.280 --> 13:00.960
There's no config, it's just,

13:00.960 --> 13:03.280
it's all just with volume management on the command line.

13:03.280 --> 13:04.240
And it's very simple.

13:04.240 --> 13:07.360
It's like ButterFS add volume and you give it the path

13:07.360 --> 13:08.640
and you tell it what volume to add to

13:08.640 --> 13:09.760
you're done and then remove.

13:09.760 --> 13:10.880
And as long as you have enough space,

13:10.880 --> 13:12.560
it sinks everything off and you can remove it.

13:12.560 --> 13:14.880
And I actually have not tested that.

13:14.880 --> 13:16.560
I could imagine it being tricky.

13:16.560 --> 13:20.640
But I think there's different ways to solve all of these.

13:20.640 --> 13:22.720
And what you've done here with this is said,

13:22.720 --> 13:24.960
well, these are ways that not only

13:25.840 --> 13:28.800
are very sensible solutions, but ones that I've tested.

13:28.800 --> 13:30.000
And that's the value again.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.080
Like, yeah, I could add something about ButterFS,

13:32.080 --> 13:35.520
but there's limited value in it.

13:35.520 --> 13:36.480
It's my experience.

13:36.480 --> 13:38.560
And this is something that you've worked at for a long time.

13:38.560 --> 13:40.240
So I think it's, yeah,

13:40.240 --> 13:41.600
I think MergerFS is a great solution

13:41.600 --> 13:42.400
for that kind of stuff.

13:42.400 --> 13:44.800
And, you know, things like ZFS and SnapRaid,

13:44.800 --> 13:46.400
depending on what your needs are,

13:46.400 --> 13:48.640
also can be appropriate solutions.

13:48.640 --> 13:51.040
So I've built this site around MKDocs,

13:51.040 --> 13:53.680
which happens to be the same project

13:53.680 --> 13:55.520
that we're using for the self-hosted Wiki,

13:55.520 --> 13:57.760
which I've also put some work into this week

13:58.400 --> 13:59.920
over the Christmas break.

13:59.920 --> 14:02.800
So please go ahead and contribute to the self-hosted Wiki

14:02.800 --> 14:04.480
at wiki.selfhosted.show.

14:04.480 --> 14:06.640
Cause we're crying out for content over there.

14:07.280 --> 14:10.000
But MKDocs, I'll tell you what, Chris,

14:10.000 --> 14:14.320
has become a hell of a Wiki software, you know?

14:14.320 --> 14:15.760
So I don't know when you're browsing this,

14:15.760 --> 14:18.160
but I don't know if you noticed it has a keyboard shortcut

14:18.160 --> 14:19.360
and they don't tell you this obviously,

14:19.360 --> 14:21.280
but it's the same as Vim.

14:21.280 --> 14:23.760
So you can press the forward slash key,

14:23.760 --> 14:25.280
which brings up search,

14:25.280 --> 14:28.000
and then you can search for any string in any page.

14:28.000 --> 14:31.040
And it will just in real time and then use the arrow keys.

14:31.040 --> 14:32.080
Oh yes.

14:32.080 --> 14:34.240
And it will just take you straight to the page.

14:34.240 --> 14:36.080
Straight to the section of that page.

14:36.080 --> 14:38.560
Just that feature alone had me sold.

14:39.520 --> 14:40.080
That's great.

14:40.080 --> 14:42.160
But they've added dozens of other features,

14:42.160 --> 14:44.400
you know, like they've got little tool tips,

14:44.400 --> 14:47.920
little info boxes and stuff that breaks up the content.

14:47.920 --> 14:52.080
The code formatting highlighting is just brilliant.

14:52.960 --> 14:54.480
It's fully customizable.

14:54.480 --> 14:58.240
So, you know, it was using the COBOL Wiki

14:58.240 --> 14:59.760
for the Helios 64 review,

14:59.760 --> 15:04.400
which finally got me to really take MKDocs seriously

15:04.400 --> 15:06.480
and really went through the documentation

15:06.480 --> 15:07.680
with a fine tooth comb.

15:07.680 --> 15:10.000
And I've enabled all the features that I want.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.320
And the only thing I haven't done yet is comments,

15:12.320 --> 15:15.920
which I might do, I might not, I haven't decided yet.

15:15.920 --> 15:20.960
But the material theme for MKDocs really is stunning.

15:20.960 --> 15:23.280
And I don't think at the moment

15:23.280 --> 15:27.200
there's a better open source documentation platform.

15:27.200 --> 15:29.440
Yeah, I will say that just the presentation.

15:29.440 --> 15:30.960
So not even commenting on what it's like

15:30.960 --> 15:32.480
to actually write on it,

15:32.480 --> 15:35.440
but the presentation is extremely readable.

15:36.000 --> 15:36.960
You know, documentation,

15:36.960 --> 15:39.840
especially something as extensive as a topic like this

15:39.840 --> 15:41.680
can be just a chore to get through.

15:42.240 --> 15:43.760
But the way it lays out, like you said,

15:43.760 --> 15:46.880
the way it does some of the different quoting and code blocks

15:46.880 --> 15:50.000
and all of it, just all of it is really,

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
it's just, it makes me want to use it for my stuff.

15:52.000 --> 15:52.880
So I was going to ask you,

15:52.880 --> 15:54.160
I was going to talk to you about MKDocs

15:54.160 --> 15:54.800
and see what you thought,

15:54.800 --> 15:57.760
because yeah, it's really seems impressive.

15:57.760 --> 16:00.880
And probably the perfect solution

16:00.880 --> 16:03.680
for just JB internal documentation.

16:03.680 --> 16:06.240
Yeah, I mean, it's all, everything's written in Markdown.

16:07.120 --> 16:10.160
So if in the future you decided to use a different solution

16:10.160 --> 16:12.720
for some reason, it's just plain text.

16:12.720 --> 16:16.400
It's not in a CMS somewhere, lives in a Git repo

16:16.400 --> 16:18.560
and just copy and paste and job done.

16:18.560 --> 16:19.360
That's pretty nice.

16:19.920 --> 16:23.360
Well, so as we record right now, this isn't live.

16:23.360 --> 16:24.720
So what's your plan?

16:24.720 --> 16:26.000
I assume you're gonna try to get it out

16:26.000 --> 16:27.840
when the show goes live.

16:27.840 --> 16:30.320
If you look at my GitHub commit history this week,

16:30.320 --> 16:31.760
it's gonna be bright green.

16:33.360 --> 16:35.040
I'm working away feverishly on this

16:35.040 --> 16:36.720
to get it done by the end of 2020.

16:36.720 --> 16:39.360
So I'm aiming for a New Year's Eve launch.

16:39.360 --> 16:40.960
So by the time you listen to this episode,

16:40.960 --> 16:43.360
it should be live, perfectmediaserver.com.

16:43.360 --> 16:46.160
Let me know what you think at ironicbadger on Twitter.

16:46.160 --> 16:48.240
I would love to hear what you think

16:48.240 --> 16:49.840
because I've put a lot of time,

16:49.840 --> 16:52.480
probably several hundred hours into this site

16:52.480 --> 16:54.080
by the end of it, all told.

16:54.080 --> 16:56.320
I'd also accept PRs on the GitHub repo.

16:56.320 --> 16:57.280
So if you want to open an issue,

16:57.280 --> 16:59.280
if you find a mistake or something,

16:59.280 --> 17:01.760
which is highly likely at the pace I'm working right now,

17:02.480 --> 17:03.840
let me know through a GitHub issue

17:03.840 --> 17:05.120
or open a pull request or something.

17:05.120 --> 17:06.160
I would love to hear from you.

17:06.160 --> 17:12.240
Okay, needsmorebutterfs documentation.

17:12.240 --> 17:15.120
Serious, seriously, geez.

17:17.520 --> 17:20.560
You sir are a grade A troll, thank you.

17:20.560 --> 17:25.760
linode.com slash SSH.

17:25.760 --> 17:30.080
Go there to get a $100 60-day credit towards a new account

17:30.080 --> 17:31.760
and go there to support the show.

17:31.760 --> 17:34.000
Linode is our cloud hosting provider.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.280
And because the price is so great,

17:35.280 --> 17:38.480
they can make it possible for you to use Linode

17:38.480 --> 17:41.520
even for a small deployment or for a large deployment.

17:41.520 --> 17:43.200
Jeff used Linode to test migrate

17:43.200 --> 17:45.040
his important Nextcloud setup.

17:45.040 --> 17:47.280
He just took things one step at a time

17:47.280 --> 17:48.720
using different guides on Linode

17:48.720 --> 17:50.720
to make sure everything was right.

17:50.720 --> 17:53.600
And he says, eventually after about three pages of notes,

17:53.600 --> 17:56.720
he did a completed successful migration.

17:56.720 --> 17:58.800
And then he was able to take that knowledge,

17:59.360 --> 18:01.200
take that hands-on experience

18:01.200 --> 18:05.280
and go actually implement it on his production Nextcloud instance.

18:05.280 --> 18:06.320
He said, but in the testing,

18:06.320 --> 18:10.240
he noticed that even their smaller Linodes

18:10.960 --> 18:13.280
were still faster than his local quad-core

18:13.280 --> 18:14.800
16 gigabyte local machine.

18:14.800 --> 18:18.320
So he's looking at maybe just hosting it on linode.com.

18:18.880 --> 18:20.640
And Alex, I know that you're using Linode

18:20.640 --> 18:22.320
for the perfect mediaserver.com.

18:22.320 --> 18:23.120
I sure am.

18:23.120 --> 18:25.840
Yeah, same node as is doing the Wiki

18:25.840 --> 18:30.880
and gallery.selfhosted.show is doing perfect mediaserver.com.

18:30.880 --> 18:33.040
So you can really squeeze quite a lot

18:33.040 --> 18:34.320
out of these little things.

18:34.320 --> 18:36.880
I love hearing how people are using Linode.

18:36.880 --> 18:39.440
So do let me know either at the contact form

18:39.440 --> 18:41.200
or at Chris Lass on Twitter.

18:41.200 --> 18:44.000
Because with $5 a month worth of data,

18:44.000 --> 18:45.920
$5 a month rigs, you can do a lot.

18:45.920 --> 18:49.600
But they also have dedicated CPU systems

18:49.600 --> 18:52.880
or machines with tons of RAM or lots of GPU.

18:52.880 --> 18:55.760
So go experiment with that $100 60 day credit.

18:55.760 --> 18:58.320
They also offer S3 object storage.

18:58.320 --> 19:01.200
This is a great way to store things in the cloud

19:01.200 --> 19:03.600
that don't need a Linode or a server sitting in front of them.

19:03.600 --> 19:06.160
You can just generate a public URL for that asset.

19:06.160 --> 19:08.000
I do this for soundboard clips.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.360
You can do this for websites.

19:09.360 --> 19:11.760
It's a great way to get a super fast portfolio

19:11.760 --> 19:14.400
where everything's stored statically in object storage.

19:14.400 --> 19:15.600
And their prices are great.

19:15.600 --> 19:17.840
They also have load balancers and they have data centers

19:17.840 --> 19:19.680
in 11 locations around the world.

19:20.320 --> 19:21.840
So you're going to find something close to you

19:21.840 --> 19:23.680
or close to your client.

19:23.680 --> 19:26.560
So go to linode.com slash SSH.

19:26.560 --> 19:29.120
Go there, get that $100 60 day credit,

19:29.120 --> 19:30.400
apply that towards a new account

19:30.960 --> 19:32.240
and go there to support the show.

19:33.040 --> 19:36.080
You help make independent content like this free

19:36.080 --> 19:38.720
when you go to linode.com slash SSH.

19:38.720 --> 19:41.520
I can't quite believe just how many Powerline emails

19:41.520 --> 19:43.200
we had this week though, can you?

19:43.200 --> 19:45.680
Alex, it was wild.

19:45.680 --> 19:48.240
So I responded to several of them directly.

19:48.240 --> 19:50.160
I figured we respond to a couple here in the show

19:50.160 --> 19:52.560
when we had a few people write in about this stuff.

19:53.120 --> 19:55.520
I kind of suspected that Powerline networking

19:55.520 --> 20:00.960
was probably something that got more use and deployments

20:00.960 --> 20:04.560
than kind of gets representation

20:04.560 --> 20:06.240
because there's so many scenarios

20:06.240 --> 20:10.560
where Wi-Fi just doesn't work, especially older style Wi-Fi,

20:10.560 --> 20:14.880
non mesh Wi-Fi, where like either a house construction materials

20:14.880 --> 20:19.040
involved or distance or all kinds of weird things.

20:19.040 --> 20:22.720
Like I have a family member who's next to an airport

20:22.720 --> 20:26.080
and their radio signal situation is just crazy.

20:26.080 --> 20:28.240
It's just, it's just unusable.

20:28.800 --> 20:32.320
So I suspected we would hear a lot about this,

20:32.320 --> 20:35.840
but JT wrote in to say that he's been using Powerline adapters

20:35.840 --> 20:37.200
for a couple of years.

20:37.200 --> 20:40.240
He currently has three of the TP-Link AV1000s,

20:40.240 --> 20:43.040
which is the kit I bought, with two different kits

20:43.040 --> 20:44.400
and he's using them without any issues.

20:44.400 --> 20:46.720
So he bought two of the kits, two of what I have,

20:46.720 --> 20:48.240
and they all link together.

20:48.240 --> 20:50.400
He says, I do have a problem with one of the rooms though,

20:50.400 --> 20:52.960
where one adapter normally gets about 120 megabits

20:53.920 --> 20:55.040
and then it gets out of sync

20:55.040 --> 20:57.520
and it starts dropping packets like mad,

20:57.520 --> 20:59.600
dropping the bandwidth next to nothing.

20:59.600 --> 21:02.400
Sometimes even less than a megabit, but if I unplug

21:02.400 --> 21:04.400
and re-plug them back in, it seems to fix it.

21:04.960 --> 21:08.000
It happens from time to time, but also I wanted to give

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
just a quick shout out to cloudfree.shop,

21:10.000 --> 21:12.320
one of our official unofficial sponsors here

21:12.320 --> 21:15.520
of the self-hosted podcast, coupon code self-hosted.

21:15.520 --> 21:19.360
He said cloudfree.shop finally gave him the kick in the butt

21:19.360 --> 21:21.440
he needed to begin automating his home.

21:21.440 --> 21:23.520
He says, I never want anything really connected to the cloud

21:23.520 --> 21:26.240
and with smart plugs from Cloudfree and Home Assistant,

21:26.240 --> 21:27.920
it felt like I had to do something about it.

21:27.920 --> 21:30.880
And Home Assistant, it felt like I could finally get started.

21:30.880 --> 21:32.480
The first thing that I automated

21:32.480 --> 21:35.280
was my bearded dragon's cage lights.

21:35.280 --> 21:37.280
Yep, one of the first things I automated here in the studio

21:37.280 --> 21:38.400
was my fish tank lights.

21:38.400 --> 21:40.480
So totally, totally with you, JT.

21:40.480 --> 21:42.880
He says, which got rid of a terrible

21:42.880 --> 21:45.680
constantly clicking analog timer that I used to use.

21:45.680 --> 21:49.760
I also bought a D1 mini ESP8266 Wi-Fi board

21:49.760 --> 21:53.600
and a BME280 temperature pressure and humidity sensor

21:53.600 --> 21:56.320
and combine them into an MQTT based sensor

21:56.320 --> 21:58.640
that Home Assistant uses to control the heat lamp

21:58.640 --> 21:59.440
in the cage.

21:59.440 --> 22:00.480
Heck yeah, he did.

22:02.080 --> 22:02.560
That's great.

22:02.560 --> 22:03.840
That's the next level.

22:03.840 --> 22:06.000
Talk about like you want a backup,

22:07.040 --> 22:08.720
no fail state for that thing.

22:08.720 --> 22:12.000
He says the spousal approval factor was very high

22:12.000 --> 22:16.240
on these purchases and the time I spent learning to solder.

22:16.960 --> 22:17.520
That's great.

22:17.520 --> 22:19.760
Says thanks for the shows, looking forward to the next one.

22:19.760 --> 22:20.960
Good to hear that JT.

22:20.960 --> 22:21.920
I love it when it works out.

22:21.920 --> 22:24.480
And yeah, for those of you who are new to the show,

22:24.480 --> 22:27.120
cloudfree.shop is a community built store

22:27.840 --> 22:30.880
and we're official, unofficial, official sponsors,

22:30.880 --> 22:31.440
or they are.

22:32.240 --> 22:34.640
We just love them and we worked out a deal.

22:34.640 --> 22:37.040
We use the promo code and you get devices

22:37.040 --> 22:40.400
that don't have like the cloud connected stuff on there.

22:40.400 --> 22:41.920
You know, sometimes I like a little cloud,

22:41.920 --> 22:44.000
like I put a sync thing server up in the cloud,

22:44.000 --> 22:45.360
made stuff faster.

22:45.360 --> 22:48.000
But the smart plug that controls the old fish tank,

22:48.000 --> 22:49.600
I don't want any cloud involved with that.

22:49.600 --> 22:51.600
You know, it's just how it goes.

22:52.400 --> 22:53.600
And you also don't have to wait

22:53.600 --> 22:55.440
necessarily on the slow boat from China

22:55.440 --> 22:57.040
sometimes for these things to arrive.

22:57.040 --> 22:58.560
So true, true.

22:58.560 --> 23:00.720
It is nice that they are state side as well.

23:00.720 --> 23:01.760
Yeah, that's good.

23:01.760 --> 23:02.400
That's a good point.

23:03.600 --> 23:06.240
Ro wrote in about Powerline Finicky.

23:06.240 --> 23:08.160
And I think the reason I included his email

23:08.160 --> 23:11.120
is because he referred to us as Chris and the Badger,

23:11.920 --> 23:20.000
which gave me like this morning AM or FM radio vibe.

23:20.000 --> 23:24.880
And I just pictured you and I doing a morning KWRAX.

23:24.880 --> 23:25.760
Chris and the Badger.

23:25.760 --> 23:27.120
Yeah, I can hear it now.

23:27.120 --> 23:28.080
It's Chris and the Badger.

23:29.840 --> 23:31.040
Welcome to Chris and the Badger.

23:31.040 --> 23:31.600
Chris and the Badger.

23:31.600 --> 23:32.080
Chris and the Badger.

23:32.080 --> 23:32.880
It's the Badger.

23:33.680 --> 23:35.280
Yeah, I could see that.

23:36.720 --> 23:38.960
Oh, I want a listener now to try and make us a jingle.

23:38.960 --> 23:40.160
Chris and the Badger, please.

23:40.160 --> 23:40.720
That would be fun.

23:42.240 --> 23:43.680
Chris and the Badger in the morning.

23:44.400 --> 23:46.080
He says, Chris, I was surprised to hear about

23:46.080 --> 23:47.200
your experiences with Powerline.

23:47.200 --> 23:48.960
I've been using the TP-Link Powerline products

23:48.960 --> 23:51.440
for several years now, and I've had mixed results.

23:51.440 --> 23:52.800
In my experience, it works.

23:52.800 --> 23:54.480
But sometimes it has some problems

23:54.480 --> 23:57.280
that make it hard to really recommend.

23:57.280 --> 23:59.520
And he tells me about different products

23:59.520 --> 24:00.960
that he's tried and troubleshooting.

24:00.960 --> 24:04.000
And he has a pretty solid looking house layout.

24:04.000 --> 24:06.480
There's nothing too crazy about his electrical.

24:06.480 --> 24:11.360
It's a modern house, and it's shorter than 300 meters

24:11.360 --> 24:13.440
and all of that kind of stuff that you'd look at.

24:13.440 --> 24:15.760
But he says Powerline works, but it's definitely

24:15.760 --> 24:18.320
nowhere as fast as wired ethernet.

24:18.320 --> 24:22.000
In fact, it isn't even as fast as some of the mesh Wi-Fi

24:22.000 --> 24:22.800
that he's tested.

24:22.800 --> 24:24.800
So he did several different kind of speed tests for us

24:24.800 --> 24:28.800
and said in all, he is able to get better performance

24:28.800 --> 24:29.840
on mesh Wi-Fi.

24:29.840 --> 24:33.440
But in some situations where Wi-Fi didn't reach

24:33.440 --> 24:36.560
or there was other issues, he was still able to get

24:36.560 --> 24:39.840
around 100, 150 megabits with his Powerline adapters.

24:40.480 --> 24:42.240
In one case, depending on a product he tried,

24:42.240 --> 24:43.920
he was able to get 300 megabits,

24:43.920 --> 24:45.920
which that's pretty respectable.

24:45.920 --> 24:47.680
That's really all I'd want over Powerline.

24:47.680 --> 24:49.280
I'm not expecting gigabit.

24:49.280 --> 24:53.280
I mean, if all you're doing is streaming on Kodi

24:53.280 --> 24:55.440
or something like that, that's all you need.

24:55.440 --> 24:57.440
He points out, and it's a great thing to consider,

24:57.440 --> 25:02.720
is a little play of words that these manufacturers use.

25:02.720 --> 25:03.200
Yes.

25:03.200 --> 25:04.960
And I haven't verified this, but according to him,

25:04.960 --> 25:07.280
he says, when they say it's a gigabit,

25:07.280 --> 25:09.840
they mean it's a gigabit when you combine

25:09.840 --> 25:11.440
the send and the receive.

25:11.440 --> 25:15.360
It's actually half a gigabit in both directions.

25:15.360 --> 25:18.400
In a perfect world when there is no wind outside,

25:19.520 --> 25:22.800
they're about one centimeter apart, probably, yes.

25:22.800 --> 25:25.040
So if you get a two gigabit model,

25:25.040 --> 25:26.480
which there are two gigabit units,

25:26.480 --> 25:28.960
then it's one gigabit send, one gigabit receive.

25:28.960 --> 25:32.240
It's actually a one gigabit unit the way we think of it

25:32.240 --> 25:33.760
in terms of like Ethernet adapters.

25:34.480 --> 25:37.120
So that's a little trick or ruskies that they like to pull,

25:37.120 --> 25:38.240
that when they're quoting speeds,

25:38.240 --> 25:40.640
they're quoting just a send or receive.

25:41.840 --> 25:43.040
But we got lots of other feedback.

25:43.040 --> 25:44.400
Some people thought that it was,

25:44.400 --> 25:45.760
that maybe I'd have better performance

25:45.760 --> 25:49.440
if I didn't have solar panels on the RV,

25:49.440 --> 25:51.200
that they thought maybe that was causing

25:51.200 --> 25:52.880
some high degree of interference

25:52.880 --> 25:54.640
just because of the intensity of that.

25:54.640 --> 25:57.120
But those systems are totally separate.

25:57.120 --> 25:59.760
The house power doesn't connect

25:59.760 --> 26:03.200
to like the charge controller or the batteries directly.

26:03.200 --> 26:05.440
Yeah, because a lot of folks wrote in and said

26:05.440 --> 26:07.600
that if you have coax in your walls,

26:07.600 --> 26:12.400
you can actually get power line over coax adapters.

26:12.400 --> 26:14.800
And because they're not carrying any signal

26:14.800 --> 26:17.360
in modern houses, generally speaking anymore,

26:18.320 --> 26:22.640
you can actually get away with running Ethernet over those

26:22.640 --> 26:24.720
and they're a very clean signal.

26:24.720 --> 26:26.480
So you get better performance that way.

26:26.480 --> 26:28.080
That could be worth looking into.

26:28.080 --> 26:32.000
Yeah, I got a couple of spots that have coax pre-run.

26:33.040 --> 26:33.760
That's interesting.

26:34.960 --> 26:38.400
I don't know, Alex, maybe one day in the future.

26:38.400 --> 26:42.880
Brad wrote in about a killer mobo with a QuickSync.

26:42.880 --> 26:47.440
Yeah, he's found the ASRock J5040 ITX board.

26:47.440 --> 26:51.600
It's a mini ITX form factor with a quad core Pentium chip

26:52.320 --> 26:55.680
and it has QuickSync version 6.0.5.

26:55.680 --> 26:59.680
Now he wrote in about this one because of energy usage.

26:59.680 --> 27:04.000
This one idles, he says, between 10 and 15 watts only.

27:04.800 --> 27:07.120
But it also has four SATA ports,

27:07.120 --> 27:11.040
which I thought, hmm, this would make a really nice

27:11.040 --> 27:13.200
sort of NAS motherboard potentially

27:13.200 --> 27:16.640
because four hard drives, a small enclosure,

27:16.640 --> 27:18.880
low power draw, QuickSync.

27:19.680 --> 27:21.600
You're pushing my buttons here, Brad.

27:21.600 --> 27:23.440
Yeah, really, me too.

27:23.440 --> 27:24.960
It looks like a really nice motherboard.

27:24.960 --> 27:30.000
Yeah, this ASRock J5040 ITX.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.880
We'll put a link in the show notes.

27:32.880 --> 27:36.560
But that hardware acceleration, that QuickSync,

27:36.560 --> 27:38.720
that QuickSync, boy, that is looking really good.

27:38.720 --> 27:40.720
And this you could totally bill,

27:40.720 --> 27:43.200
I bet you for, if you had the storage,

27:44.000 --> 27:47.520
I bet two, $300 to build a nice system

27:47.520 --> 27:50.800
with a decent little case with some memory around this thing.

27:50.800 --> 27:52.880
It's a passive CPU as well.

27:52.880 --> 27:56.240
So it takes, it doesn't need a fan on the CPU.

27:56.880 --> 28:00.560
Also, it takes sort of laptop style SO-DIMM memory.

28:01.120 --> 28:02.160
So this thing is tiny.

28:02.160 --> 28:05.280
It's got a couple of M2 slots on there for Wi-Fi if you want.

28:05.280 --> 28:07.680
So yeah, yeah, go ahead and check that one out.

28:07.680 --> 28:10.000
That looks like a really, really useful little build.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.800
Stefan wrote in to tell us about some benchmarks in German

28:12.800 --> 28:15.200
that show that the latest AMD desktop APUs

28:15.840 --> 28:19.280
are getting idle power well below 10 watts.

28:19.280 --> 28:22.640
And depending on the motherboard, as low as six or seven watts.

28:22.640 --> 28:25.040
So it seems like there's something to watch there too.

28:25.040 --> 28:28.480
Oh, I'm trying to avoid buying a Ryzen 5000.

28:28.480 --> 28:29.840
I'm really trying to avoid it,

28:29.840 --> 28:35.440
but stuff like that makes me want to buy one.

28:35.440 --> 28:36.400
Hey, while we're doing feedback,

28:36.400 --> 28:38.080
I want to take a moment and mention

28:38.080 --> 28:41.360
that a Cloud Guru has a Python 3 scripting course

28:41.360 --> 28:42.960
for system administrators,

28:42.960 --> 28:45.120
where you can develop the skills you need to write effective

28:45.120 --> 28:49.920
and powerful scripts and create command line tools using Python 3.

28:49.920 --> 28:51.200
So in the course, you're going to develop skills

28:51.200 --> 28:53.840
you need to write effective and powerful Python scripts.

28:53.840 --> 28:55.280
And it's a big one.

28:55.280 --> 28:56.320
So beyond the language itself,

28:56.320 --> 28:57.920
you'll go through the full development process,

28:57.920 --> 29:00.960
including project setup, planning, automated testing

29:00.960 --> 29:03.040
to build two different command line tools and more.

29:03.040 --> 29:05.120
So check out the link we'll have in the show notes

29:05.120 --> 29:07.520
for the Python 3 scripting for system administrators

29:07.520 --> 29:08.880
at a cloudguru.com.

29:10.480 --> 29:12.240
Hey, so I'm sat here whilst we were recording

29:12.240 --> 29:13.840
and thought my feet are cold.

29:13.840 --> 29:15.920
So whilst you were reading that ad spot,

29:15.920 --> 29:17.360
I logged into my home assistant

29:17.360 --> 29:19.200
and just bumped up the thermostat a little bit.

29:19.200 --> 29:22.240
That's nice, isn't it?

29:22.240 --> 29:23.920
Yeah, yeah.

29:23.920 --> 29:27.680
I think my favorite still is because of the home assistant

29:27.680 --> 29:29.600
and the home kit integration.

29:29.600 --> 29:31.040
When I'm driving home,

29:31.040 --> 29:32.800
I just push a button on the steering wheel

29:32.800 --> 29:36.160
and I tell the computer just to turn on,

29:36.160 --> 29:37.520
you know, the heaters to extra heat.

29:37.520 --> 29:39.120
We have an extra heat mode that kind of brings up

29:39.120 --> 29:41.280
the temperature more, a little quicker.

29:41.280 --> 29:43.520
And so when I buy the, and turn on the lights.

29:43.520 --> 29:45.680
So when I get home, all the lights are on.

29:45.680 --> 29:46.880
Place is nice and toasty.

29:46.880 --> 29:50.400
Oh, I've been thinking about like an NFC tag

29:50.400 --> 29:51.440
on the dashboard or something

29:51.440 --> 29:53.840
that I could just tap with my phone maybe.

29:53.840 --> 29:56.320
I haven't done it, but I've been thinking about it.

29:56.320 --> 29:57.360
I've been thinking about that too.

29:57.360 --> 30:00.640
I actually have an NFC tag at the door out the studio.

30:00.640 --> 30:02.560
So on my way out the studio, I can tap it.

30:02.560 --> 30:04.400
And right now it just kind of sends like an alert

30:04.400 --> 30:07.920
to the wife with an ETA and all of that kind of stuff,

30:07.920 --> 30:10.320
you know, based on my location and her location.

30:10.320 --> 30:12.320
But I have been thinking, man, it'd be pretty great

30:12.320 --> 30:14.880
to tie that in with the heating and the lighting,

30:14.880 --> 30:16.640
check to see if it's on or not.

30:16.640 --> 30:19.280
NFC tags and all of that is probably still

30:19.280 --> 30:22.800
the most underutilized area because on iOS,

30:22.800 --> 30:23.760
it kind of sucks.

30:23.760 --> 30:24.960
And I think it's similar on Android,

30:24.960 --> 30:26.640
but not quite the same where on iOS,

30:26.640 --> 30:28.480
it just brings up, as far as I understand it,

30:28.480 --> 30:31.600
a notification prompt that you then have to tap

30:31.600 --> 30:34.480
to execute the NFC automation.

30:34.480 --> 30:36.080
And that just sounds like garbage.

30:36.080 --> 30:37.040
Not true on Android.

30:37.040 --> 30:39.200
I just tap the tag and my garage door opens.

30:39.200 --> 30:40.400
It's amazing.

30:40.400 --> 30:41.520
That's what I want.

30:41.520 --> 30:44.080
I can kind of see maybe why Apple did it this way

30:44.080 --> 30:48.000
for novices who, you know, they don't want to execute stuff

30:48.000 --> 30:49.360
randomly on their phone.

30:49.360 --> 30:52.800
But man, I totally appreciate that,

30:52.800 --> 30:54.480
but I just would love a setting to say,

30:54.480 --> 30:56.160
don't require user interaction.

30:56.160 --> 30:57.760
It just totally kills the usefulness.

30:57.760 --> 31:00.160
I have also here on the studio mixer,

31:00.160 --> 31:02.640
I have an NFC tag because for some reason,

31:02.640 --> 31:04.080
Behringer thought it'd be a great idea

31:04.080 --> 31:06.480
to put like a phone holder on the mixer

31:06.480 --> 31:07.520
because the idea is you're going to use

31:07.520 --> 31:09.040
like their touchscreen app on your phone.

31:09.600 --> 31:12.240
And so I have a spot where my phone sits

31:12.240 --> 31:15.040
and I just put an NFC tag in that spot,

31:15.040 --> 31:16.320
just set my phone to D and D

31:16.320 --> 31:17.840
and turn on the studio lights,

31:17.840 --> 31:19.600
which are on Home Assistant and all that.

31:20.480 --> 31:22.240
Oli wrote into the holiday mailbag

31:22.240 --> 31:23.520
and said, I'm a longtime listener,

31:23.520 --> 31:25.280
occasional disc order from Norway.

31:25.280 --> 31:27.680
And we talk about storage setups on the show a little bit,

31:27.680 --> 31:30.480
but I'd love you to go into some details with setups

31:30.480 --> 31:33.040
ranging from smaller setups to bigger setups.

31:33.040 --> 31:36.080
Do you have any strategies deciding on what you invest in?

31:36.880 --> 31:38.480
My backups are going to Backblaze,

31:38.480 --> 31:40.000
but I'm rethinking things a little bit

31:40.000 --> 31:41.760
and I think I want more same local storage,

31:41.760 --> 31:43.680
but I'm a little put off at the price.

31:44.640 --> 31:47.200
What would be a sweet spot in terms of discs and storage

31:47.200 --> 31:49.680
for about an eight terabyte media collection

31:49.680 --> 31:52.320
as well as some more personal media like photos

31:52.320 --> 31:53.840
that I just don't want to lose?

31:53.840 --> 31:55.040
Any links would be great too.

31:55.040 --> 31:57.360
Man, this question was made for me, wasn't it?

31:57.360 --> 31:58.640
It really was.

31:58.640 --> 32:02.000
So, perfectmediaserver.com, first of all,

32:02.800 --> 32:06.240
I think is where I will send you in the first instance

32:06.240 --> 32:07.680
to look at the software side of things.

32:08.320 --> 32:10.960
I will be building up the hardware recommendation section

32:10.960 --> 32:12.560
of that site over the next few months.

32:13.200 --> 32:16.800
But really, I would just take a look at serverbuilds.net.

32:16.800 --> 32:20.160
They have some amazing used enterprise gear

32:20.160 --> 32:22.560
and I know it's quite a US centric website,

32:22.560 --> 32:24.480
but you can still get a lot of good ideas

32:24.480 --> 32:26.480
about what to use, like QuickSync, for example,

32:26.480 --> 32:29.680
that came from JDM, the guy behind that site

32:29.680 --> 32:30.800
who we've had on the show before.

32:31.600 --> 32:33.360
And just take a look at what they're doing

32:33.360 --> 32:36.000
and the trends and the way the industry's going

32:36.000 --> 32:38.400
with what those guys are doing over there at Server Builds.

32:39.680 --> 32:40.800
And I think you can probably get away

32:40.800 --> 32:43.280
with a fairly minimal kind of setup.

32:43.280 --> 32:45.040
So you've got eight terabytes worth of stuff

32:45.040 --> 32:45.760
you want to store.

32:45.760 --> 32:50.400
So I would buy a hard drive that is at least eight,

32:50.400 --> 32:53.200
probably 10 or 12 terabytes, so you've got a bit of headroom,

32:53.200 --> 32:59.120
and buy a pair of them so that you can have full redundancy.

33:00.000 --> 33:03.840
You're already using Backblaze, so RAID is not backup.

33:03.840 --> 33:06.480
It's a very common phrase that you'll hear people say.

33:07.520 --> 33:10.560
Make sure that you have everything duplicated

33:10.560 --> 33:14.160
in at least two different physical locations.

33:14.160 --> 33:18.640
So even if that just takes the form of a USB hard drive

33:18.640 --> 33:21.280
that you leave at your parents' house, when you go and see them

33:21.280 --> 33:24.320
one day in the future, who knows?

33:26.320 --> 33:27.840
The world is so different right now.

33:27.840 --> 33:31.440
But if it's just a USB hard drive in a drawer

33:31.440 --> 33:34.240
at a parent's house, then that will do the trick as well

33:34.240 --> 33:37.840
in a lot of situations, unless you have lots of media

33:37.840 --> 33:38.800
being added all the time.

33:38.800 --> 33:40.880
But I don't think that's the use case for a lot of people.

33:40.880 --> 33:44.160
I think most people, those kind of periodical backups

33:44.160 --> 33:47.840
every three to six months is probably sufficient

33:47.840 --> 33:55.840
so build yourself a small mini ITX, couple of bay box

33:55.840 --> 33:59.680
and stick the perfect media server stack on there

33:59.680 --> 34:00.720
and you'll be good to go.

34:00.720 --> 34:03.840
Yeah, thankfully, eight terabytes is a really

34:03.840 --> 34:06.400
pretty doable problem to solve.

34:06.400 --> 34:08.240
So of course, you want more than that.

34:08.240 --> 34:12.240
At least I'd say go 12 terabytes, if not more,

34:12.240 --> 34:14.480
if you already are using eight terabytes.

34:14.480 --> 34:16.080
And you could probably even justify

34:16.080 --> 34:18.000
a bit more than that.

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
But that's some great strategy advice right there

34:20.000 --> 34:23.440
and perfect timing for the show too, so best of luck.

34:23.440 --> 34:26.800
I would take a look at Amazon.de,

34:26.800 --> 34:30.000
quite often have the Western Digital,

34:30.000 --> 34:31.440
what are they called over there?

34:31.440 --> 34:33.280
They're not easy stores because they're Best Buy

34:33.280 --> 34:34.240
like US centric ones.

34:34.240 --> 34:37.840
They're called My Books, I think, in Europe.

34:37.840 --> 34:42.080
You can quite often get those for a 10, 12, 14 terabyte

34:42.080 --> 34:46.080
hard drive in the 200, 250 euro range.

34:46.080 --> 34:48.080
So that would be a good place to start.

34:48.080 --> 34:49.840
It's not gonna be super cheap.

34:49.840 --> 34:53.840
My philosophy with regards to how much local storage

34:53.840 --> 34:57.840
do I need versus cloud is it's up to you, right?

34:57.840 --> 35:01.840
It's your personal risk profile.

35:01.840 --> 35:05.200
And how important is this data to you?

35:05.200 --> 35:07.280
Are you gonna be upset if Backblaze,

35:07.280 --> 35:08.640
I don't know if they're going to,

35:08.640 --> 35:11.520
but if they turn around next week and trick you

35:11.520 --> 35:15.040
triple their prices, what are you gonna do if that happens?

35:15.040 --> 35:17.840
If you have a hard drive in your closet,

35:17.840 --> 35:20.560
you know upfront what that cost is gonna be,

35:20.560 --> 35:23.360
what the total cost of ownership for that storage

35:23.360 --> 35:25.440
is gonna be, and there'd be no surprises

35:25.440 --> 35:26.240
or anything like that.

35:26.240 --> 35:28.000
So, I mean, you're talking to a guy

35:28.000 --> 35:29.680
that's got 100 terabytes in his basement,

35:29.680 --> 35:32.080
so maybe I'm not the right guy to speak to.

35:32.080 --> 35:34.160
And the other guy who's like,

35:34.160 --> 35:35.760
I need to get more disks as fast as possible.

35:35.760 --> 35:37.520
I've only got 12 terabytes free right now.

35:37.520 --> 35:40.480
I'm like, yeah, yeah.

35:40.480 --> 35:42.720
But really there's so many ways to solve it,

35:43.280 --> 35:44.640
but I'd love to hear what you do.

35:44.640 --> 35:47.840
So go to selfhosted.show slash contact to update us.

35:47.840 --> 35:50.080
And then Scott wrote in with another question

35:50.080 --> 35:51.680
that I have a sense the audience

35:51.680 --> 35:53.040
may have a few answers for us.

35:53.040 --> 35:55.040
So keep that contact link in mind.

35:55.040 --> 35:56.960
He says, I was hoping you could make a recommendation

35:56.960 --> 36:00.080
for self-hosted online cookbook.

36:00.080 --> 36:01.840
My mother has a huge cookbook

36:01.840 --> 36:03.920
full of old family recipes,

36:03.920 --> 36:07.840
which I would like to digitalize ideally with OCR

36:07.840 --> 36:10.000
and the ability to take and search the recipes

36:10.000 --> 36:11.680
as well as preserving original image

36:11.680 --> 36:14.080
of the old handwritten family recipe.

36:14.080 --> 36:16.000
Scott, I love this idea.

36:16.640 --> 36:17.440
What do you think, Alex?

36:17.440 --> 36:19.680
Has anything come to mind for you?

36:19.680 --> 36:22.320
Well, we covered Chowdown a little while ago

36:22.320 --> 36:24.560
as a self-hosted recipes app.

36:24.560 --> 36:25.520
There is another one,

36:25.520 --> 36:27.440
which whilst we're doing this segment,

36:27.440 --> 36:29.200
I will try and find,

36:29.200 --> 36:30.640
which I can't remember right now,

36:30.640 --> 36:34.480
but there is also an old JB project, isn't it?

36:34.480 --> 36:35.520
Yeah, that's true.

36:35.520 --> 36:36.240
That is true.

36:36.240 --> 36:39.840
There is the open your mouth recipes,

36:39.840 --> 36:42.880
which we actually used GitHub and Markdown for those.

36:42.880 --> 36:44.880
I was thinking Scott could get started

36:46.480 --> 36:48.080
without any software selected yet

36:48.080 --> 36:52.240
by just getting good quality captures of those cards.

36:52.880 --> 36:54.000
And he's gonna want probably something

36:54.000 --> 36:56.800
he can take over to grandma's house or mom's house

36:56.800 --> 36:58.800
or whoever, the aunt or uncle,

36:58.800 --> 37:01.200
whoever the family members you wanna capture these from

37:01.200 --> 37:02.320
because why not get them all, right?

37:02.880 --> 37:06.000
You could probably get away with something like ScanBot

37:06.000 --> 37:09.360
or the other available scanning apps on your phone,

37:09.360 --> 37:10.880
but you might look into scanner options too

37:10.880 --> 37:12.000
and just start there.

37:12.000 --> 37:14.560
Start getting the high quality images from there

37:14.560 --> 37:16.800
and then the software will come.

37:16.800 --> 37:17.520
I found it.

37:17.520 --> 37:22.400
Okay, it's called Vabine 1111 slash recipes.

37:23.280 --> 37:24.640
What a catchy name, huh?

37:24.640 --> 37:27.920
It's a Django application designed for managing recipes

37:27.920 --> 37:29.200
and it's a web app.

37:29.200 --> 37:32.240
So I would imagine it runs out of a container,

37:32.240 --> 37:34.160
but it's got a search built

37:34.160 --> 37:38.560
on top of Django's trigram similarity search engine

37:38.560 --> 37:41.120
and it allows you to create and search for tags

37:41.120 --> 37:43.920
and assign them in batches to certain files

37:43.920 --> 37:45.680
matching certain criteria.

37:45.680 --> 37:48.720
It will sync with both Dropbox and Nextcloud

37:48.720 --> 37:51.840
with more support being added every week.

37:52.400 --> 37:55.760
And you can import lots of recipes from different websites

37:55.760 --> 37:58.560
with JSON objects and stuff like that.

37:58.560 --> 38:00.720
And there are also apps for mobile devices

38:00.720 --> 38:02.000
like phones and tablets.

38:02.000 --> 38:04.960
So yeah, lots and lots of stuff in there,

38:04.960 --> 38:06.240
runs in a Docker.

38:06.240 --> 38:11.680
This is what the Reddit collective thought recommends

38:11.680 --> 38:12.240
at the moment.

38:12.240 --> 38:14.160
So I haven't tried this one.

38:14.160 --> 38:16.080
I just haven't got to it, but it's on my short list.

38:16.080 --> 38:18.560
So go and take a look at that link in the show notes.

38:18.560 --> 38:22.880
I also recall that groceries had a bit of a recipe manager.

38:22.880 --> 38:25.760
I don't recall how extensive it was,

38:25.760 --> 38:27.600
but that's a past pick too.

38:27.600 --> 38:29.040
So we'll put links to all of these.

38:29.040 --> 38:30.640
The one that Alex just talked about,

38:30.640 --> 38:33.120
you could see the example of how we used Open Your Mouth

38:33.120 --> 38:35.440
on GitHub and just made it a community project.

38:35.440 --> 38:36.880
So you could have multiple family members

38:36.880 --> 38:37.920
that contribute that way.

38:38.480 --> 38:40.240
Or perhaps somebody out there will know

38:40.240 --> 38:42.960
a great software project that we haven't mentioned

38:42.960 --> 38:45.120
and inform us all at selfhosted.show.com.

38:46.000 --> 38:49.040
The last one in our holiday extravaganza mailbag here

38:49.040 --> 38:52.400
is a Joshua writes in regarding thoughts

38:52.400 --> 38:54.880
that were inspired by self-hosted episode 33

38:54.880 --> 38:57.280
triggered by the Helios 64 discussion.

38:57.280 --> 38:59.280
He says, hey guys, I was listening to your review

38:59.280 --> 39:01.040
of the Helios 64 with some interest

39:01.040 --> 39:03.440
since I am the owner of their previous product,

39:03.440 --> 39:06.560
the Helios 4. I believe the points you make

39:06.560 --> 39:08.160
about software are quite valid.

39:08.160 --> 39:09.200
Yet I'd like to point out

39:09.200 --> 39:11.600
that there's a really hard problem to solve.

39:11.600 --> 39:13.920
I work personally with a company in Israel

39:13.920 --> 39:15.920
that makes SBCs and SOMs,

39:16.480 --> 39:19.280
mostly with ARM-based system on chips.

39:19.280 --> 39:21.600
It's my job to make Debian available

39:21.600 --> 39:23.280
for each product to their customers.

39:23.920 --> 39:25.440
Long ago, when I started,

39:25.440 --> 39:27.120
I really wanted to do this the right way.

39:27.120 --> 39:28.880
I submitted bug reports and patches

39:28.880 --> 39:30.320
to the Debian project for enabling

39:30.320 --> 39:31.760
all kinds of small things.

39:31.760 --> 39:33.600
A kernel.config for a driver here,

39:33.600 --> 39:35.200
a customized boot script there,

39:35.200 --> 39:37.840
enabling OpenGL ES backends and shared libraries,

39:37.840 --> 39:40.720
and continuously watching and testing

39:40.720 --> 39:42.800
the distributions for things that break.

39:43.440 --> 39:45.200
Turns out I never got to the point

39:45.200 --> 39:47.920
where I could give customers a pure Debian system.

39:47.920 --> 39:49.120
There's always another tweak

39:49.120 --> 39:51.200
that I had to carry out of tree.

39:51.200 --> 39:53.680
So to this day, I'm creating block device images

39:53.680 --> 39:55.360
with custom kernel packages,

39:55.360 --> 39:57.200
integrated binary blobs,

39:57.200 --> 39:58.480
and maybe a system D service

39:58.480 --> 40:00.080
for loading Bluetooth firmware

40:00.080 --> 40:02.400
and even patched parts of X or Wayland.

40:03.120 --> 40:04.720
So why do I tell you all of this?

40:04.720 --> 40:06.560
Well, the reason being for a new product,

40:06.560 --> 40:08.960
it takes time and continued effort

40:08.960 --> 40:10.720
for mainlining all the things.

40:10.720 --> 40:12.480
And the experience can differ largely

40:12.480 --> 40:14.640
by a particular SOC in your hands.

40:15.440 --> 40:16.640
And you'll find that despite even when

40:16.640 --> 40:17.760
the vendor does everything right,

40:17.760 --> 40:18.720
it's still not perfect.

40:19.360 --> 40:20.400
To really solve this problem,

40:20.400 --> 40:22.080
there has to be a way for hardware makers

40:22.080 --> 40:24.160
who are both capable and willing to do the work

40:24.160 --> 40:25.280
to achieve something greater

40:25.280 --> 40:27.120
than what I was able to do in my job.

40:27.920 --> 40:29.680
In his opinion, it's just not there yet,

40:29.680 --> 40:31.360
he says, Alex, that the ecosystem

40:31.360 --> 40:34.400
just can't support the kind of rapid support

40:34.400 --> 40:36.080
that the hardware needs at this stage.

40:36.080 --> 40:37.440
And you know, after reading this,

40:37.440 --> 40:40.160
I was thinking, look at the Raspberry Pi.

40:40.880 --> 40:42.160
It's been around forever.

40:42.160 --> 40:43.360
And of course, they've had iterations

40:43.360 --> 40:44.160
that have changed things,

40:44.160 --> 40:46.640
but you really still even there,

40:46.640 --> 40:48.400
you kind of have to get an image

40:49.360 --> 40:52.640
that's at least been tested for the Raspberry Pi.

40:52.640 --> 40:54.720
You can now get the Ubuntu ARM image

40:54.720 --> 40:56.640
and it will boot on the Raspberry Pi.

40:56.640 --> 40:58.400
But that's only just recently.

40:58.400 --> 41:00.560
And it's really not there with all distros.

41:00.560 --> 41:01.840
Yeah, you make a good point.

41:01.840 --> 41:04.480
I mean, the Ubuntu image for the Pi 4

41:04.480 --> 41:05.760
has made a big difference for me

41:06.480 --> 41:08.080
to the overall kind of feel of it

41:08.080 --> 41:11.040
being a real, air quotes, a real device.

41:11.600 --> 41:12.800
And it's now in production for me.

41:12.800 --> 41:14.320
I'm using it as Pi KVM,

41:14.320 --> 41:15.920
which ironically runs on Arch.

41:15.920 --> 41:18.640
But anyway, yeah, I agree with you.

41:18.640 --> 41:20.160
I mean, I ended up getting ZFS

41:20.160 --> 41:22.560
working on the Helios 64 after the review.

41:23.760 --> 41:24.800
In the end, it was a few days,

41:24.800 --> 41:25.760
there was a kernel update

41:25.760 --> 41:27.360
and DKMS started working again.

41:27.360 --> 41:29.200
But yeah, I just don't know how

41:29.760 --> 41:33.200
without an Apple level of control

41:33.200 --> 41:34.720
over both the hardware and software,

41:34.720 --> 41:38.480
you could ever hope to solve this problem fully.

41:38.480 --> 41:39.520
Slow but steady.

41:39.520 --> 41:41.600
There are standards like server ready

41:41.600 --> 41:45.040
that try to solve this more for the data center.

41:45.040 --> 41:46.880
But those lessons could be learned

41:46.880 --> 41:47.840
in the consumer devices.

41:47.840 --> 41:51.120
But there's just not necessarily the vendor buy-in.

41:51.120 --> 41:53.280
And there's not necessarily the vendor buy-in

41:53.280 --> 41:54.640
to support the development, right?

41:54.640 --> 41:56.080
That's an area where they could apply

41:56.080 --> 41:57.440
a little bit of leverage.

41:57.440 --> 41:59.520
They could hire people to just write the code

41:59.520 --> 42:00.400
and contribute it more

42:00.400 --> 42:02.000
and participate in these projects.

42:02.880 --> 42:05.040
But it's only so scalable.

42:05.840 --> 42:07.440
And it's really not a problem

42:07.440 --> 42:10.240
we have on the x86 side of things.

42:10.720 --> 42:14.240
We're so kind of swept up by the power usage of ARM

42:14.240 --> 42:17.760
or the small size form factor or the price point.

42:18.560 --> 42:20.640
I think we forget some of the luxuries

42:20.640 --> 42:23.440
that we've gained over the years with the x86 platform.

42:23.440 --> 42:24.080
It just works.

42:24.080 --> 42:25.040
You don't have to think about it.

42:25.040 --> 42:28.400
You don't have to grab a special version

42:28.400 --> 42:31.280
of a Linux distro or Windows

42:31.280 --> 42:33.280
or whatever it is to run on it.

42:33.280 --> 42:38.720
And with Apple changing to ARM based CPUs,

42:38.720 --> 42:40.400
that's the first real departure

42:40.400 --> 42:42.400
that mainstream computing has seen

42:43.200 --> 42:46.800
from x86 instruction sets for 15 years.

42:46.800 --> 42:48.800
And I think that's gonna influence,

42:49.360 --> 42:52.640
hopefully in five years time or so,

42:52.640 --> 42:54.960
the rest of the industry will run on it.

42:54.960 --> 42:57.280
We'll be in a similar position to where Apple are now

42:57.280 --> 42:58.880
with that kind of level of integration.

42:59.760 --> 43:00.960
Of course, Apple will be five years

43:00.960 --> 43:02.160
further down the road by then.

43:02.160 --> 43:04.400
So who knows, maybe they'll never catch up.

43:04.400 --> 43:07.600
But it's a really interesting time for sure.

43:07.600 --> 43:10.320
And I really wanna support these guys

43:10.880 --> 43:13.600
doing these projects like COBOL.

43:14.320 --> 43:15.280
They're a small team.

43:16.480 --> 43:18.640
They're not doing this to become millionaires overnight.

43:19.600 --> 43:21.440
They're doing it for the love, I'm sure.

43:21.440 --> 43:23.600
And they made a really great product.

43:23.600 --> 43:25.120
It just missed in a few key areas.

43:25.120 --> 43:27.840
So I wanted to let some of the listeners know

43:27.840 --> 43:31.520
that I will be selling my Helios 64.

43:31.520 --> 43:33.280
So if you're interested in the market,

43:33.280 --> 43:35.600
just let me know via Twitter.

43:35.600 --> 43:36.480
You don't have to wait for it to ship

43:36.480 --> 43:38.080
or anything for the next batch.

43:38.080 --> 43:39.040
We'll sort something out.

43:39.040 --> 43:40.960
Just leave a little stink on it when you ship it out.

43:40.960 --> 43:42.480
Let's make it real special, okay?

43:43.200 --> 43:44.560
Get a little bit your stink on there.

43:44.560 --> 43:46.800
I'll sign the inside in Tipex or something.

43:46.800 --> 43:47.360
How about that?

43:49.520 --> 43:51.120
I wanna say also a special thank you

43:51.120 --> 43:53.920
to our members at selfhosted.show slash SRE.

43:53.920 --> 43:56.880
You can become a site reliability engineer for this show.

43:56.880 --> 44:00.000
You get a limited ad feed and you get extra content.

44:00.000 --> 44:01.280
You get a post show.

44:01.280 --> 44:03.440
I think it's gonna be a doozy today.

44:03.440 --> 44:05.840
So thank you to our SRE team.

44:05.840 --> 44:08.080
You keep this show up and running.

44:08.080 --> 44:09.600
You are our reliability engineers.

44:10.240 --> 44:12.400
I wanna mention that you can find our sponsor,

44:12.400 --> 44:14.160
A Cloud Guru on social media.

44:14.160 --> 44:16.800
It's just slash A Cloud Guru on any of the major platforms.

44:16.800 --> 44:20.560
Like youtube.com slash A Cloud Guru and go find them there.

44:20.560 --> 44:22.720
Now I know that you all know how to find this

44:22.720 --> 44:25.120
with the gargantuan amounts of feedback we've had.

44:25.120 --> 44:27.360
I mean, we really only got to a small portion of it

44:27.360 --> 44:30.240
this episode, but please do keep sending it in

44:30.240 --> 44:32.960
because it keeps us vitalized and connected with you guys.

44:32.960 --> 44:35.760
And particularly in these present times,

44:35.760 --> 44:39.040
hearing from you helps us keep the show focused

44:39.040 --> 44:40.400
on what you guys wanna hear about.

44:40.400 --> 44:42.800
So selfhosted.show slash contact

44:42.800 --> 44:44.400
is the place to go to get in touch with us.

44:45.200 --> 44:47.120
You can find me on Twitter at ironicbadger.

44:47.120 --> 44:50.640
And I'm there too at Chris Last and the show is at Self Hosted Show.

44:50.640 --> 44:53.120
And don't forget the network at Jupiter Signal.

44:53.120 --> 44:54.400
Thanks for listening everybody.

44:54.400 --> 45:21.120
That was selfhosted.show slash 35.
