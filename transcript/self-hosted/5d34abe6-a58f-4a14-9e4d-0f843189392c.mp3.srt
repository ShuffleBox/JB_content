1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
We're doing something fun for episode 69

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:08,140
We're doing our first self hosted live stream and we have a whole bunch of people hanging out with us live while we do the show

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:15,520
This is your crazy idea Alex. I know right SSH 69 and we've bumped up the recording date by one day to make it on

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:22,820
420 I mean we couldn't pass up that opportunity could we so joining me today? Obviously we have mr. Fisher. Hello Chris. Hey there

5
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:29,740
Also in the room with me is Brent. Hello. Hello, and we have cheese bacon from Denver. Hello there

6
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:36,440
Hello bacon. Welcome back to the show cheesy. Thanks, man. And we have 40 plus crazy people watching us on the live stream

7
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:41,700
Hello live stream. Hello. Jitsi room, although they're all muted Alex. So they're all not gonna chime in

8
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:46,220
Well, that's that's a technical hurdle. I need to understand still

9
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,180
If you are watching live and you want to suggest a title

10
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:53,860
We're doing a whole lot style thing. You can bang suggest in the IRC room today

11
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:56,860
That's right, and we'll pick something. That's fun

12
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:58,580
We thought I don't know we've never done this before

13
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:02,860
But every now that it'd be kind of neat it also I think it'd be a lot of fun to do a live stream

14
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:04,100
Maybe on like a project day

15
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:07,200
We work on something and then we do an episode and talk about it

16
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,700
And maybe we do part of the build or the configuration on the live stream. We got ideas

17
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:15,480
We got all kinds of ideas. I have a drawer full of ideas behind me

18
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,480
I

19
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:23,040
Have been collecting my ideas in a box that I store in my closet in the RV so

20
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:28,820
We both have like to-do boxes of stuff, but you literally have a nice light out drawer

21
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:33,100
Box or drawer of shame, whatever you want to call it. I just can't get to it

22
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:38,480
I've been I've been creating new shows. I've launched office hours dot hair. It's a new podcast

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,040
sort of a podcast for the Jupiter broadcasting community and

24
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:46,000
One where I can kind of talk about things going on with JB the shows

25
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,280
Community events podcasting in general. So I started a new show

26
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,000
It's but now that I've got that out of the way, I'm planning to get back to some of my projects

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,200
But go check it out

28
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,200
It's office hours dot hair

29
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,200
Now of course

30
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:05,440
This is the first episode since our big East Coast rally meetup rally thing that we did a couple of weeks ago

31
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,760
We had about a hundred people show up. So great job and hello to anybody that we said hi to on that day

32
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:17,040
Yeah, we had fun. We had some feedback from five who wrote in. Thanks Alex for conjuring the meetup

33
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,200
I had a really great time and I would definitely come out to the East Coast from Minnesota again

34
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,280
The barbecue the brew pub and the park were all superb

35
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,680
I was curious about what drew you to North Carolina in the first place

36
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,540
But after meeting the friendly people and enjoying the beautiful trails of Raleigh, I get it. Oh

37
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:41,700
Oh, that's nice Brent. You've been living there for a hot minute. How do you feel about that live in the East Coast life?

38
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,700
I feel as though

39
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:50,580
It's maybe a month ahead of the season where I'm used to so this is like a vacation super great and Alex and I have been

40
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:56,260
Doing projects galore which has kept me very interested very busy and learning a bunch of new stuff

41
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:59,980
Yesterday he turned up with a pickup truck bed full of

42
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:06,300
Materials we're gonna build a roof under my deck tomorrow to store my lawn tractor and all sorts of stuff. We're having a good time

43
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,740
Your lawn tractor. You're so American now. It's a terrible

44
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:15,300
you know when in Rome darling when in Rome before we were even like

45
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:23,100
24 hours after the meetup the folks in Raleigh were already talking about holding their own just because there is such a crowd there

46
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:26,780
There's more tech there than I realized that's what the meetup really showed me

47
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:31,340
Is that there's a lot more tech in Raleigh than I then I even probably

48
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:37,340
Appreciated and they're really motivated to keep going. That's something I not to plug the show game

49
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:41,560
but that's actually one of the reasons I'm launching that new shows to help organize community meetups because I think

50
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:46,580
people could just start doing these on their own even if we can't make it and maybe from time to time we drop by because

51
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:50,460
We had we had over a hundred folks show up at this one and it was cold

52
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:55,180
The weather wasn't really cooperating with us and it was kind of vague where to even find us

53
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:57,180
Right, and we still had over a hundred people show up

54
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:01,140
We actually covered in full detail in lup full 53

55
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:04,780
We had a bunch of interviews with the folks that we met on the day and stuff like that

56
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:12,260
So if you want more information about the meetup and you know our initial reactions because we recorded it the day after the meetup

57
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:15,940
Linux unplug.com slash 453

58
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:22,380
Now tell me about the open mower thing here because I'm picturing you building a robot that mows your lawn

59
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:25,220
I mean, that's pretty much what we're talking about here

60
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:30,380
I mean, so I was looking at I have a push mower and I have like about half an acre to mow

61
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:34,660
It's not too big but it's big enough that in the North Carolina heat in the summer that I'm just like

62
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:40,380
Nah, this is this is too much like an hour sweating late in the evening. No, thank you

63
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:44,580
So I bought the lawn tractor in the end, but what I really wanted to buy was one of these autonomous

64
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,300
Mowers, but they're too expensive for the moment

65
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:55,020
Then came along this open mower project, which I just think is the coolest thing in the world. It uses like open-source software

66
00:04:55,700 --> 00:05:00,300
to do like GPS traces of the mower in your yard and

67
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:05,380
for those in the jit see room Chris is playing at the video from the github page and

68
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:08,020
essentially this thing is

69
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,180
It's like it's like the autonomous mower

70
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:16,020
But actually smart the old ones like the kind of I say old like the current generation ones

71
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:19,440
Just sort of bop around the lawn in a random pattern until they're done

72
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:26,100
This thing actually uses GPS traces to figure out the most efficient pattern and then zips ups back across the lawn

73
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:33,780
Of course, my question is does it work with home assistant? It really is. It looks like a Roomba for your lawn

74
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:41,080
It looks like while training it. He's walking it manually with almost like an RC controller that's wired to it

75
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:46,460
That's teaching it the the way he would mow the lawn. So it's essentially repeating

76
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,460
his

77
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:54,640
Lawn mowing technique right? It's just memorizing it. I mean he's basically saying to his lawn mower. This is the way

78
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,980
Right. This is the way

79
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,660
Previously other lawn mowers, right?

80
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:05,260
The automated lawn mowers would have like a wire or something that you would like embed in the ground

81
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:13,020
Which would then say hey stop here. So to see this open and the fact that it operates on GPS is pretty rad

82
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:17,300
Yeah, this one specifically calls out in the github page. No

83
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,960
No perimeter wire needed

84
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:27,220
Hmm I like that you could I mean with the walking it technique while that means one time you have to walk this thing around

85
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,700
You could also give it really specific routes

86
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:35,460
So if you have like a patch of gravel somewhere you'd want it to avoid or stumps and roots and stuff like that

87
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:39,140
This is a really simple way to just avoid the thing from screwing itself up

88
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:43,340
And then of course I go to like well, could I then get metrics?

89
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:47,260
What kind of metrics can I get out of this and what could that tell me about the state of my yard?

90
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:51,260
Well, and maybe maybe you could you know learn how?

91
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:57,340
More efficiently you could mow your yard if it was operated in different patterns, right?

92
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:00,820
like the kind of like Google gives you the recommendation of

93
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:06,900
The most economic or eco-friendly path to your destination versus the shortest route and stuff

94
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:12,020
Well, you know what actually thinking about I could give you an example is the things monitoring when it's raining or not

95
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,660
So that way it doesn't run during rain

96
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:21,620
It would be actually now I think about it. I'd really like something that specifically told me for my yard

97
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:25,700
When it rained how long it rained when it stopped raining all of that

98
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:29,820
So if anybody has a recommendation something that I could pull into home assistant

99
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:35,900
Send a boost into the show or email me Chris at Jupiter broadcasting comm because that actually I could geek out on you need a weather

100
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:41,700
Station right, but which one aha Alex I'm interested in the hardware that's running this thing

101
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:47,620
Is it like a do-it-yourself kid or are you taking something off the shelf and reflashing it or something?

102
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:51,900
well, unfortunately this project has been shared a bit too much and

103
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,620
several of the components in the

104
00:07:54,620 --> 00:08:00,980
Hardware bill of materials have sold out. I mean, we're all used to that at this time of the

105
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:06,500
Pandemic right, but the trouble is the specific stepper motors that is using are

106
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:13,820
Out of production or out of stock. They're not even sure if they're still going to make them like he bought maybe the end of

107
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,820
the batch or something

108
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:20,940
Coincidentally, so unfortunately he's saying to people make sure you look up before you invest in this project

109
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,380
You can actually find all the parts because it's not a given

110
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:27,260
another thing he said that's really interesting though, is that it looks like

111
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:33,400
in terms of the robot mowers that are already on the market, there's a bunch that may

112
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:38,180
Share a similar main board across rebranded different manufacturers. So

113
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,980
he's gonna try and target that one and

114
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:45,020
hopefully make that one open and then you could just buy a

115
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:50,940
Clone of this mower and then flash it with his firmware. It's like the pixel of a lawnmowers

116
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,940
It sounds pretty awesome

117
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:58,100
Hmm. Well, I guess we'll stay tuned and if anybody tries this let us know

118
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:03,460
So this week we had we had one of these stories that was kind of the inspiration for the podcast

119
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:07,860
And it's just a shameful story. You may have heard of insti on well

120
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:14,740
It looks like they're gone and the entire company seems to have just abruptly shut down before the weekend as we record here and

121
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:19,500
That broke users cloud dependent smart home setups with no warning

122
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:24,980
there was no official word ahead of the shutdown no advanced warning to users and

123
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:29,940
It's sort of like salt in the wound style. They have a

124
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:36,180
Craptastic status page that's obviously manually updated because when you go to it, it says all services online

125
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,100
Right. Yeah

126
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:43,460
Clearly that monitoring doesn't do jack. I hate that. I hate that so much

127
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:50,940
Yeah, so instant is or more likely was a smart home company that produced a variety of smart home devices

128
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:57,540
They did something along the lines of Zed wave or Zigbee with their own proprietary protocol

129
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:02,860
Which has thankfully been reverse engineered. So we're not completely up the creek without a paddle just mostly

130
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,860
And yeah, like Chris says they went out of business

131
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:12,780
some point over the weekend and their CEO has scrubbed all mentions of the company from his LinkedIn page and

132
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:18,140
Basically all of the devices belonging to insti on are now paperweights

133
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:23,740
With the exception of their wall switches, which are electrically connected as part of the circuit

134
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:30,240
So that the worst case scenario that happens with those is they're still mechanical switches that will operate the the lights at least so

135
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:33,560
There is some silver lining. It's a small one

136
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,560
But it's there

137
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,640
This is horrible

138
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:45,000
and whatever you do do not factory reset your hub, apparently it has to contact their servers as part of its setup and

139
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,240
That's gonna fail now home assistant have actually

140
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:55,480
Updated a documentation since yesterday to say it's now possible. You don't have to worry about that anymore

141
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:00,520
So if you do actually factory reset it they now have a workaround

142
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:07,200
This is really a shame to see and they also had their own proprietary networking protocol, which actually looks like it was kind of neat

143
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,800
I mean, it's 900 megahertz, which is usually pretty good

144
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:16,920
It also could coexist with power line networking, which is kind of neat and it supported local control, but it was

145
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:22,360
Proprietary and patented and you know unique to them. So that's just sort of gone now

146
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,640
See not only are your cloud services gone, but the whole protocol that has been created is essentially now invalid

147
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,320
It's still usable, but nobody's they're maintaining supporting

148
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,320
Shepherding it

149
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,160
We just see this happen over and over again

150
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,720
and it's these kinds of stories that really got Alex and I thinking we should we should do a show about this because

151
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,720
When you take this kind of stuff over

152
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:50,320
Like if you go to cloud free dot shop or you reflash something or you just get it working locally and you get all working

153
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,960
Home assistant, you no longer need an account or you know a cloud login

154
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:59,800
There is a so there is a sensation of self-sovereignty that you get it feels really good to have

155
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:03,360
control over this stuff like it feels better than you'd expect and

156
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,640
I think it's because we keep seeing these rug pulls

157
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:10,760
Essentially from these companies and you buy these things and there's sort of this implicit

158
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,000
promise that they're gonna keep the service running, but they never actually

159
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:18,400
Commit to it. And there's no warning to the average consumer

160
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,320
that

161
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:27,400
The discontinuation of the online services invalidates the product, right? They don't understand that they don't get that our audience understands that but

162
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,640
People that are buying these things from like Home Depot or whatever. They don't understand that. I

163
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,640
Mean the obvious answer is to just use home assistant and never worry about it again

164
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:42,280
You know use devices with open firmware like TAS motor, you know, not the ones from cloud free dot-shop

165
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:48,440
There are some other options, of course, you know, there's a home kit compatible stuff

166
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,600
Which is all local only

167
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,880
It's not quite as good as like a fully open firmware, but it's it's close

168
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:01,080
Open hab and what's the other one Dom a titch? I'm never quite sure how to say that one because in tight. I

169
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,600
Mean it's just a shit situation, isn't it?

170
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:10,360
It is because I feel like you're kind of giving the typical answer of oh

171
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:16,520
You don't like what the carrier flashed your Android device with well, you can always put lineage on it. Yeah. Okay. Well, I'm

172
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:23,600
Maybe but probably nobody else in my family, right? It's I mean the reality is they have just created a

173
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,600
huge amount of e-waste

174
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,040
In yeah weekend. I was just about to touch on that exactly

175
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:35,320
100% yeah, I'd like to see some kind of legislation from

176
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:42,960
governments from the EU from these bureaucratic bodies to say you have a duty of care on the

177
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:49,520
life cycle of these devices whether that extends to how people sunset devices and say right we're going to

178
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:55,120
The Sonos that we talked about last year at some point the v1 hub or bridge or whatever it was

179
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:59,440
Why didn't they rather than just saying you've got to buy the new one?

180
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:04,240
Why didn't they provide a firmware to say for the v1 devices?

181
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,080
Hey, you can put this open firmware and I can do what you like with it, you know

182
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:13,200
Make it this open device and give it another life. We've been doing that with laptops for

183
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,920
Two three decades now, you know

184
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,920
We take old crusty Windows laptops and throw Linux on there and give them a new lease of life

185
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,760
All I'm proposing is we do the same thing with embedded hardware

186
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,120
Yeah, absolutely. That's it. That's a great idea

187
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:33,520
So, you know you had kind of mentioned Chris about Home Depot and you know possibly picking these off the shelf and and I don't

188
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,520
know, you know where

189
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:41,120
These were sold at retail, right? And then, you know, Alex mentions about the e-waste which I think is a very significant problem

190
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:45,600
but how many of these devices do you think are still on the shelves and

191
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:52,400
Retail, you know at retailers and consumers are just buying with the intent that they're going to work as soon as they get them home

192
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:56,480
Maybe this is their first smart device ever right as soon as they get them home

193
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,600
Now it doesn't work. It doesn't connect to the cloud server

194
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,120
Here I am trying to go through some work around something. I don't know

195
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:08,240
Here I am trying to go through some work around something. I'm not technically inclined. How do I get this flashed?

196
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,240
How do I get this to work with something else?

197
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:15,760
You know, imagine being that teenager that's finally convinced your dad to buy a piece of smart home gear, right?

198
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:19,360
He gets it home and this happens. Yeah, exactly bad luck

199
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,360
exactly

200
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,920
You know, it's not an isolated case either. Um, my father's dealing with this right now

201
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,760
He bought a few d-link cameras and water sensors

202
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:33,920
For a few rental properties that he has in his home as well. He gets some flooding there

203
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:40,240
Just as a security blanket and this is a perfect example of a really great use case for these devices, right?

204
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,560
Um, luckily he got an email maybe at the beginning of the year in january saying oh d-link

205
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:54,560
We're gonna stop supporting our protocols and all devices will stop working at the end of the year or in september or something like that

206
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:59,840
But it's I think what's troublesome and I chris, I think why you suggested that

207
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:05,620
The whole premise of this show started was that this is not an uncommon situation

208
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:11,280
We see it, you know time and time again multiple times a year with various devices and it's just really saddening

209
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:17,600
Luckily, I looked it up and of course they're compatible with home assistant. So i'll be doing some homework there

210
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,640
Now for those of you that are already home assistant users

211
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:26,080
They just put out a blog post for insteon users detailing all the little ins and outs of how you can get the most out of

212
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:29,200
Those devices moving forward. We'll put a link to that in the show notes

213
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,560
Linode.com

214
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:38,080
Slash ssh go there to get one hundred dollars in 60-day credit on a new account and you go there to support the show

215
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:43,700
Now this is a way for you to host things under your control on linode's incredible infrastructure

216
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,000
They have 11 data centers around the world

217
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,120
They have super fast systems with amd epic processors if you want to go with a crazy fast cpu system

218
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:56,720
They have pci mvme storage if you want some really fast storage. And of course they have systems that are just

219
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,040
Real budget focused if you just want something for you a friend

220
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,040
maybe a real basic gaming server the whole whole gamut and

221
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:12,240
Unlike the hyperscalers that want to lock you into their esoteric complicated platforms with their own language and their whole

222
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,800
entire own ecosystem

223
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:20,020
Linode is real old-school servers built with a modern infrastructure

224
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:26,160
And people that really know what they're doing and of course you could do a one-click application deployment if that is your bag

225
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,960
You just want to hit a button and spin a server up they got you

226
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,240
But if you want to build something from the ground up you can do that as well

227
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:38,100
And that's why I think it's perfect for our audience and with pricing 30 to 50 cheaper than those major hyperscalers

228
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:43,760
It's going to work for a personal project or for your business and everything we've built in the last couple of years

229
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,800
We've built on linode. It scales up to demand

230
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,480
They have s3 compatible object storage, which I use all the time

231
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,640
ddos protection vlan support a powerful dns manager

232
00:17:55,040 --> 00:18:00,720
Kubernetes and terraform support if you want to integrate it in with your overall infrastructure and so much more and at the end of the day

233
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:06,720
The audience tells me over and over again. They have the best support they've ever experienced

234
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:11,040
that's the number one thing I hear from the audience is whenever they run into trouble with their site or

235
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:16,560
They hit the wrong button or they just don't feel right about something. Linode has answered their questions

236
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:23,440
They haven't escalated them to a different tier. They've remained on the line and got it solved 365 even during the holidays

237
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,880
And that gives me the confidence to use them for my business

238
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,760
Even though I've never had to I love knowing that they just have the best support in the business

239
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:37,940
So go check it out build something try something learn something take advantage of that 100 go to linode.com

240
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:41,080
dollars go to linode.com slash ssh

241
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:46,980
Now I've still got brent staying with me after the meetup and

242
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:52,820
He is quite the phos advocate. I tell myself. I'm a phos advocate, but this guy lives and breathes it

243
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:58,660
And so we watching something on plex the other night and it was just an offhand comment about plex. I can't remember what it was

244
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:02,900
And it made me think well, I should probably try out jellyfin again. It's been a few months

245
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:09,460
And so I thought well i've got a bunch of watched status in plex. I'd rather not lose

246
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:15,140
And so I started investigating how I could sync the watched status between plex and jellyfin

247
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:21,540
And I came across this plex tracked sync plugin. So t r a k t for tracked

248
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:27,220
And this thing is awesome. Essentially it scans your media in plex

249
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:33,620
And adds it to a tracked collection. It will do things like sync the ratings and the watch status as well between

250
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:36,660
Different plex servers that you run this thing against

251
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:42,340
There's a config file that you can edit which will let you know which things you can and cannot sync

252
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:46,340
You know, you could exclude certain libraries like home movies, for example

253
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:53,460
It doesn't require a plex pass or a tracked vip membership though. Of course if you're going to be hitting the tracked api a lot

254
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:58,980
Consider supporting those guys. They do a great job over there. Um, the downside though is it was

255
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:05,300
It wasn't difficult to set up but it wasn't easy either. Um, so I ended up running this thing in a container

256
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:08,260
Just a one-liner docker run file

257
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:14,340
Uh docker run command and then I set it to run on a cron job every four hours or something like that

258
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:20,420
Um, I mean it worked fine. Uh, there was a couple of um gotchas with a pin you had to enter between

259
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:24,500
Tracked and the command line in the correct order to get things to link up correctly

260
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:27,060
But overall worked as advertised

261
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:34,420
well, this is you're doing the lord's work here alex because uh, this is this is powerful stuff here because the other thing that this

262
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,500
clearly would be useful for is

263
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:42,500
If you have a couple of locations and you have some of the same plex media content, right?

264
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:46,580
And you watch them in separate spots like sometimes cd and I will watch something here at the studio

265
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:51,460
And then i'll go home and watch something and I have to like manually mark things red like a damn caveman

266
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:54,340
And this could solve that problem. This is huge for that

267
00:20:55,060 --> 00:21:00,900
And i'll tell you what I felt during this whole process that the next stage was to was for me to load up jellyfin

268
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:05,620
I still had my config directory. So I just had to redownload the container and set it up again

269
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:08,260
Which took all of 30 seconds

270
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,660
Don't you love docker for that?

271
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:16,580
Uh, so once I got uh, jellyfin up and running the first thing that struck me it remembered my library

272
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:22,260
It was like a time capsule of four months ago when I last tried it, but the first thing that struck me was how quickly?

273
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:30,420
Everything loaded because there was no cloud communication going on. I was logged in instantly my media loaded instantly

274
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:34,580
It was so refreshing. Yeah, and i'll note

275
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:35,780
It's real nice

276
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:40,900
If for just some reason you're trying to watch tv and you don't have an internet connection that night jellyfin just you know

277
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:46,020
It doesn't mind at all. Um before you go too much further. Can I ask you you're not having to like

278
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:52,260
Modify the plex container or put this put any software like a plugin into plex or jellyfin

279
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,660
It's just all running as separate containers that are

280
00:21:55,300 --> 00:22:01,460
Speaking via api or what plex speaks via the api I think and uh, it runs on your local system

281
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:08,980
And you authenticate against the plex website with your username and password. It also supports 2fa, which is pretty cool on the plex side

282
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:15,780
Uh, but on the jellyfin side, it's even easier. There's a plugin right there in the store built into jellyfin

283
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:20,500
You know three or four clicks. It's all done in the user interface. No wacky container stuff

284
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:26,340
And it adds itself into the scheduled task section of jellyfin itself

285
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:30,420
This is perfect. I do have a question on the initial

286
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:37,300
Setup to sync between how long do you think since it was local? How long do you think it took to to sync these watch status?

287
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:41,140
And the the stars and stuff like that. It's a good question

288
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:46,580
The first run of uploading it from my plex library to tracked took about 16 minutes

289
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:54,340
I've got about a thousand movies and I don't know 150 tv shows or so about 60 terabytes worth of stuff. That's really reasonable

290
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:59,060
But jellyfin on the other hand pulling it down was about half that time

291
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:04,820
About eight minutes or so. So it's pretty quick process really and honestly once it's running as a scheduled task in the background

292
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:08,180
As long as it doesn't take three days. I don't care how long it takes

293
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:16,660
Well, this is uh, absolutely a will do after the show, uh thing for me, I love it when you have these ones that's great

294
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:21,780
I love that that's I've thought I've thought how am I going to solve this problem because it's not a huge

295
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:25,460
It's not a huge issue, but I also like you

296
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:29,380
Have contemplated moving to jellyfin and I know this seems stupid

297
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:34,500
But one of the things that brings me back to plex is we're in the middle of watching a couple of series

298
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:39,380
And or the kids and I are watching like a movie. That's like a trilogy or something like that

299
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,420
And we just want our watch status

300
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:45,860
It's silly, but it's been a real problem. So this sounds like a real way

301
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:51,060
I could sync to track it and then sync track it to jellyfin and I could just start there

302
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:56,740
And this also could solve the problem between watching things at home and watching things at the studio alex. You're solving problems for me today

303
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,580
I'm here to serve

304
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:03,540
Now the only thing that still has me pausing about jellyfin is the android tv client

305
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:08,180
It's still not quite as reliable as I want it to be. It's pretty close

306
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:12,580
It's really getting there, but there's just some nice things now, particularly plex have added this

307
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,780
Uh, what do we call it?

308
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:18,420
Like the discover feature where you get some extra little ratings and some extra little things about which sort of

309
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:22,980
Some extra little ratings and some extra little things about which servers it's on and qualities and stuff like that

310
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:26,420
That plex have done that. I think jellyfin could probably add as well

311
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:30,500
Um that would you know, just take the interface just to that next level

312
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:38,580
The the search aspect of that discover feature where it shows you all of your friends servers is is actually really nice

313
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:45,220
Yeah, but the beauty is you know, you could switch between plex and jellyfin at your heart's content now and everything will stay in sync

314
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:51,300
That's a good point. You could also just get rid of android tv and use a good tv platform like apple tv and run infuse

315
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:53,380
Which works great with jellyfin?

316
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:59,620
Oh you now I also wanted to have a look and see uh, if I was going to drop plex completely

317
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,860
Um, it needs to do a couple of things for me

318
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:07,060
I use prologue on ios to do audiobooks and I actually shared this with your good lady while she was here chris

319
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:11,220
Uh, so I can see she's been listening to a lot of my audiobooks since then

320
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:18,580
and that's one of my favorite things of the trip alex is we exchanged audiobooks once again, she exchanged some of her audiobooks and

321
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,820
uh, she's like

322
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,820
she she I think is probably

323
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:29,380
In heaven right now because she's kind of been on a bit of a dry streak with audiobooks and i'll be honest

324
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:31,460
I have not been super happy

325
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:38,180
With how I was doing my audiobooks prologue helps a lot though that that's been nice, but it's really only best on the phone

326
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:44,020
The downside to that is there isn't really a good solution to audiobooks and plex on android

327
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:49,060
And so with brent staying with us, you know, we've been talking about books and stuff and we thought well

328
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:53,220
There's got to be a better way. My wife has been using book sonic for many many years

329
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:58,820
Which is a java based application based on top of the old subsonic base

330
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:05,780
It's fine, I guess I mean it it's pretty reliable until it breaks because it's a java app

331
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:10,180
You know, there's some memory leak somewhere or something just doesn't quite work and it crashes

332
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:13,860
so I actually have a job to restart book sonic every day because it's

333
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,500
Not the most reliable application

334
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:21,700
So I saw on reddit the other day. There was an application called audio bookshelf had been released

335
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:27,860
And this is a self-hosted audiobook server for managing and playing your audiobooks still early days

336
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:34,580
The first commit the first release actually, sorry was only in september 2021. So it's not even a year old yet

337
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:39,060
Uh, and I don't know if you remember the old ios like ibooks application

338
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:44,100
That was like skeuomorphic with like the wooden bookshelves and all that. This is what this thing looks like

339
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:48,820
Yeah, the best version you mean? Yeah, I remember that I loved it. Were you and scott forstall good buddies back then?

340
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:55,140
Nice callback, dude. Yes. I like the skeuomorphism. Why not? You got that high resolution screen. Let's make it look good

341
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:59,220
Yeah, it's got the wood shelves. It's got nice big bold book covers

342
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,300
This is great

343
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:07,460
Well, it looks great and I think it's got a lot of potential but it's sadly not quite ready for prime time yet

344
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:13,140
So I tried out the ios app which I had to install that test flight thing because it's not properly in the app store yet

345
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:15,540
It's like like the application is is in beta

346
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:20,340
And let me tell you it's most definitely in probably alpha stage right now

347
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:23,940
I had two versions across the last two days where I was testing it

348
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:27,860
The first version didn't load any of the audiobooks from my library at all

349
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:31,780
So even though I had a few hundred books in the library, it just said library empty

350
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:35,940
Okay, that's a bit that's a bit of a problem. Luckily. There was an update available

351
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:39,140
So I pulled down that update and installed it from the test flight app

352
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:43,540
Um, and then I tried to do it found the books this time

353
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:49,700
But I tried to test the syncing of playback positions between the browser on my laptop and my phone in my hand

354
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,500
And it worked ish

355
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:56,340
So if I started playing the the book on my phone and skipped to a certain chapter

356
00:27:56,340 --> 00:28:01,380
The browser would update in real time as to where I was and it would save that status if I close the browser and come

357
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:04,260
Back, it would remember it if I close the ios app

358
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,980
It would just start at the beginning every time

359
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:12,820
So there's obviously some work to do. It's not it's not quite there yet, but it's extremely promising

360
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,740
Hmm. Okay

361
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:20,420
Yeah, i'd like something that I could use reliably on the desktop and on mobile because sometimes I want to sit down

362
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,500
I want to listen on my desktop speakers

363
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:24,580
um, and I need something that's really

364
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:32,200
Really usable by the wife and she likes prologue quite a bit. I also set it up for my son dylan and I used plex collections

365
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:38,660
to create just a collection of books for dylan and then um, you know when he signs on on prologue

366
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:42,660
He just sees he goes to the collections tab and he just sees all the books that I've already picked for him

367
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:48,820
And so over lunch we were talking with brent about how to get him access to my book sonic because it's behind my firewall

368
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:51,940
Typically, I just give my wife my uh wire guard access

369
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,380
access

370
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:57,060
I love brent, but I don't want to give him full access to my lan. You know, I can't trust his phone

371
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:59,140
That's literally about to catch fire

372
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:02,500
You know the one i'm talking about. It's literally the battery's popping out the thing

373
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:07,380
I can't believe you're letting him bring that in the house. You have a family now. You got to get that out of there

374
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:14,820
And so I was looking at tailscale and they actually offer a way to share a specific server as an exit node

375
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:20,260
With someone else with a tailscale account. So what i'm thinking of doing is sharing just my

376
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:25,940
Uh media server with brent as an exit node and then he should be able to access book sonic that way. Oh

377
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:28,740
Now this is excellent

378
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:36,340
Tailscale.com slash self-hosted, you know alex what we ought to consider is playing around with that for helipads

379
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:38,420
So you guys can see the boosts?

380
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:42,740
because I have my uh bitcoin node on tailscale

381
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:49,780
And that's how I read the boost that people send in from anywhere i'm at on my phone whenever whenever I need to pick me up

382
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:52,740
I'm not even kidding whenever I need a pick me up. I pull up the boost page

383
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,820
And it just always puts a smile on my face

384
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:57,940
So if we could figure out a way for you to read those I'd probably do the same for you

385
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:04,500
Now if you don't know tailscale is a zero config vpn you can install on just about any dang device you've got I mean

386
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:12,040
any device a mobile device an arm device a raspberry pi an x86 server to help you manage your firewalls

387
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:17,220
And it works from anywhere. I found the coolest thing today in the feature request section

388
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:21,880
They're adding android tv support. Can you believe this i'm so excited

389
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:27,380
This is going to make me keep a shield. I have one shield left and this is going to make me keep it

390
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:31,620
Think about this for a second think about how amazing this could be when you're traveling

391
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:36,740
And then you reconnect to your home network and it just discovers your media server like you're right there on your land

392
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:44,820
Or you have family members or maybe there's some content you want to get access to this is next level stuff and tailscale is in this beautiful

393
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:48,580
Beautiful sweet space where they're just created this amazing tool

394
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:55,460
With just enough infrastructure to make it work like you need and they use wireguards noise protocol for the security of it

395
00:30:55,460 --> 00:31:00,180
Which you know is great and they support your single sign-on provider

396
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:03,460
If you're a corporate user like you could use whatever you want and for me

397
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:07,700
I'm using my google account with two-factor authentication, which just gives me a little bit extra peace of mind

398
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:11,540
And the best part is wherever i'm at if i'm at alex's house

399
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:14,740
If i'm on the road if i'm back here at the studio

400
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:18,180
I just use the same ip for the devices. I need to visit all the time

401
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:23,800
It's one flat wireguard network and you can put a dns server in there and you got name resolution

402
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:28,180
There's acl support. There's exit node support like alex was talking about

403
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:34,260
It's such a like take my work to the next level kind of tool. I am thrilled

404
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:40,580
They are sponsoring this show because I can completely enthusiastically endorse this because this is making house

405
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:45,620
This is making how I do my job better. And I think it would really be a great tool for you, too

406
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:47,460

Self-hosted that's tailscale.com slash self-hosted

410
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:04,580
Now I want to take a moment to say thank you to our site reliability engineer subscribers

411
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:08,500
You make this show possible over at self-hosted.com slash sre

412
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:12,500
Now as many of you know and you love to write in and tell us we're wrong

413
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:17,380
We'll get to the feedback shortly, but you can write in at self-hosted.com slash contact

414
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,300
and also

415
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,980
this week

416
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:26,580
And also we have a discord server over at self-hosted.com slash discord loads of great conversations

417
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:29,460
But this week there was one that really took the sandwich

418
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:36,820
This week we found out the origin of the pseudo logo. This thing is so cool. Have you seen it?

419
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:43,940
No, I waited. I saved it right now for this. Um, the have you seen the xkcd comic of sudo make me a sandwich?

420
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:45,940
Make me a sandwich

421
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:48,180
Well, the logo for sudo is

422
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:51,220
a sandwich

423
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:54,260
That's great, I love it

424
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:59,220
Is it though? No, it is it's great. It is great. It is

425
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:06,260
Well, I think it's great because if you look in the corner of the actual logo, it says influenced by xkcd 148

426
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:07,860
149

427
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:14,900
That's pretty impressive. That is pretty great real world change being affected right there right there. That's that's fantastic

428
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,620
Um, all right. We I know we have a couple of quick tips

429
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:20,660
We wanted to bust out is this a thing we do now we do quick tips on the show

430
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:25,380
Uh, it is this week because i've been using the crap out of docker stats, which is

431
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:27,940
It's like a top for your containers

432
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:31,620
So if you if you ssh into a box right now and just type docker stats

433
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:39,540
you'll get like a live print out of the cpu memory disk io network io usage of each container one by one broken out and it's

434
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:46,820
It's legit pretty cool. That is oh, you know, I think i've seen this tool before but I think I completely forgot about it

435
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:48,740
So, thank you

436
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,740
All right. I think it's time to get into feedback. Don't you?

437
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:58,580
Yeah, we got a boost coming in from remaking eden one week ago 2000 sats. This is hello from manchester, england

438
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:03,860
Hey, that's where I met my wife. Hey as a listener since episode one

439
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:07,860
I wanted to tell you that self-hosted has changed my entire home

440
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:13,620
And helped shape my it career. So thanks so much. That's awesome. I have three wise style cameras

441
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:19,140
I think they're actually rebranded yaomei cameras. Um, oh, okay interesting. I didn't know why he sold them

442
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:23,220
He says in the uk the most popular seller seems to be neos. I immediately

443
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:28,260
Um reflashed mine with the dfang hacks firmware

444
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:34,020
I use the rtsp feed straight in home assistant and frig it and they've been flawless for years

445
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:39,780
I was wondering if you looked at this as an option seems like they're not yet working on a v3 camera though

446
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:43,700
I didn't even know these were essentially rebranded wise cameras

447
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:46,260
That's fascinating

448
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:48,260
Remaking eden. Thank you

449
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,940
Alex go buy some

450
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:54,660
Brenda if you still got that credit card, you should go pick a couple up. I think I know where he keeps it

451
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:58,580
I know where you sleep at night. Is that

452
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:00,500
That's creepy

453
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:06,580
Yeah, so I actually tried this to fang hacks firmware on my original wise v2s

454
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,660
It was probably two or three years ago now

455
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:13,220
And honestly, it was a pain in the ass, uh trying to get it flashed on there with the sd cards

456
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:19,300
I had a real time getting it on there, but thankfully they released the official rtsp firmware some time ago now

457
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:24,020
So for me the use case for the defying hack firmware has kind of been diminished somewhat

458
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:27,460
Yeah, and also with wise bridge

459
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:28,660
um

460
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:34,980
It's even kind of simpler now to just use the default firmware get all the security updates and still capture the video locally

461
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:39,540
So that's kind of the route that I think i've been suggesting people go anonymous boosted in

462
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:42,420
He says I meant to get the name. I apologize for a thousand stats

463
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:47,860
I found you guys through the fountain app, which is a fountain.fm a new podcast app

464
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:51,140
Because you have the podcasting 2.0 tag set up

465
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:55,940
So I want to take a second and just break this down because you may be seeing this if you're in our community more and more

466
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:59,480
So podcasting 2.0 is a set of new specifications

467
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:07,540
For podcasts to give them more features like chapter images well chapters to begin with

468
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,940
transcriptions

469
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:11,540
links that are

470
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:18,820
At a particular time code all kinds of other features including a value for value tag, which includes the boost that you hear us talk about

471
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:23,160
And you can grab one of these new podcast apps that supports these new standards at newpodcastapps.com

472
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,340
And we'll have a link in the show notes

473
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:29,220
That takes you to the ones that specifically support the boosts

474
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:32,340
But alex, I know we also just got a whole bunch of traditional emails this week, too

475
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:35,940
We did and i'm gonna make use of having brent sit next to me and read the long one

476
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:39,540
You just want to hear my voice, don't you? I do baby. We all do we all do

477
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:43,860
It reads. Hey chris and ironically named badger

478
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:50,340
I was listening to your segment about what to do with syncing certificates to multiple servers using something like s3

479
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:54,500
And I have some comments, please for the love of god, don't do this

480
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:57,780
Firstly because the certificates are the keys to your kingdom

481
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:04,660
A leak of those removes all security on your services and lets anyone in the middle snoop on whatever it is you're doing

482
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:12,520
Self-hosted or otherwise certificates are massively important and shouldn't be stored anywhere. Other than where they're absolutely needed

483
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:15,880
Secondly because it's just not necessary

484
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,200
If you're not using wildcard certificates

485
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:21,240
Then just creating certificates for each domain is totally fine

486
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:26,040
And they can be stored and managed wherever the domain needs to be served from if you are using wildcards

487
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:28,760
There's nothing which says only one can exist in the world

488
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:34,280
My servers each have their own wildcard automatically managed and renewed by trafic

489
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:43,000
This way there's neither a need to store their certificates anywhere other than the servers nor to set up some secure storage or communication method

490
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:48,360
I don't even bother backing out my certificates anymore. That seems crazy to me

491
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:55,800
Let's encrypt or more specifically acme makes provisioning certs insanely simple

492
00:37:55,800 --> 00:38:00,760
Let them deal with the security side of things. We can just use their tools to create all the certificates. We want

493
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:05,880
Wherever we want. Thanks for reading and keep up the great work your friendly neighbor orange

494
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:12,680
Thanks for writing in jake. Now. This is jake of episode 42 fame who came in on our first community spotlight

495
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:19,880
Also, we had kevin write in who told us that we're actually trying to over complicate the management of ssl certificate management

496
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:27,000
He says I get the desire to use a wildcard cert, but it would be much easier to generate machine-specific certificates on each vm instead

497
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:33,160
I manage a few dozen servers and use dehydrated to generate let's encrypt certificates on each host

498
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:38,760
That way the private key and the certificate don't need to be distributed and they never leave the vm

499
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:46,040
It uses a plain text file to configure the host names and generate certificates and it makes it very easy to add extra names that way

500
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:51,000
Thanks for writing in kevin. You raise a very good point. And uh, yeah, I don't know why we missed that

501
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,880
It's a really obvious thing. Just run

502
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:59,800
Just run acme or cert bot on each machine problem solved. Well, I do this is of course

503
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:04,440
easy for me to say now, but I remember specifically on the pre-show that we were

504
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:10,440
Not streaming. We we thought this guy isn't doing this, right and we did start talking about this

505
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:13,880
But then we did we just dropped it and we got to the business of actually recording the show

506
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:18,520
We have this thing don't we where we're always having a pre-show conversation and all the best versions

507
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:24,120
Of our problem solving comes out then and we're like save it for the show and I guess we just forgot to save that nugget

508
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:27,480
Yeah, and it is absolutely our bad

509
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:33,560
So, um, thankfully we have an awesome audience who helps us with that kind of stuff and we have no qualms at all about making

510
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:36,920
Corrections and fixing that sort of stuff because it's all about just getting the best info out there

511
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:42,200
Now I was hoping to solicit some feedback from the audience on my next next video

512
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:47,480
Back from the audience on my next networking upgrade. I've currently got a gigabit network everywhere

513
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:53,160
Which like most people I did because it's cheap, you know, I can buy a five port switch for 15 bucks at best buy

514
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,280
And every time i've looked at going

515
00:39:56,520 --> 00:40:00,120
More than gigabit so, you know 10 gigs probably the next logical step

516
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:05,560
I'd look at the switch prices and they're like two three hundred dollars per switch and I think oh

517
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:09,480
I'll just wait for the prices to come down a little bit and they never seem to

518
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:17,480
And jeff geerling, you know who was also on the show previously just did a video on a microtik switch the crs

519
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:21,960
309 1g 8s plus in

520
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:26,040
That name rolls off the tongue doesn't it flippin. Yeah, nice smooth

521
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:33,000
So we basically questions for the audience if you've done 10 gig i'm really curious to know how you did it

522
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,600
Did you run fiber in your house? Did you do it with cat 6a?

523
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:40,680
Thankfully, I ran cat 6a on the trunks in my house when I moved in three years ago

524
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:46,520
Or am I shooting for the stars with 10 gig is 2.5 enough for my needs right now

525
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:54,440
That's a fair question. I'm curious what you're doing right now. That makes even gigabit insufficient. Well, i've got gigabit

526
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:59,640
WAN so sometimes if i'm pulling something down from the internet and then trying to stream something to

527
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:06,040
Plex, uh, you know a high bitrate movie or moving some files around from my desktop to my nas, for example

528
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:11,800
Uh that can sometimes cause issues. Sure. Yeah, especially when you're you're you're you know

529
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,680
Not working with like cisco switches there at your house, right?

530
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:20,440
So that also makes a difference that makes I mean i'm i'm never going to stop a guy from going as much performance as possible

531
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:25,800
I'm, all about it. Uh, I I think that's a great question is two and a half gigabit enough

532
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,960
and

533
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:32,920
And is it worth the leap to 10 gigabit? I have to tell you alex

534
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:39,560
I feel like you're the kind of guy that appreciates the value of doing it once and just doing it, right?

535
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:44,840
You know, like you could do 2.5 gigabits and you could probably get away with it for a couple of years

536
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,360
Probably even five years

537
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:50,920
But there's gonna be a point where you're gonna wish it was faster because you're just that kind of guy

538
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:53,720
And so and you know, it could be better too. That's the other thing

539
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:59,400
You are totally spot on now lucas writes in in the live chat

540
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:05,800
I impulse signed up for two gig google fiber and realized almost nothing. I have can distribute it across the land

541
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,360
Oh, no

542
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:12,280
Who thought we'd have wan connections that were faster than gigabit, huh? Yeah

543
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:16,920
I mean, I would love to have that problem. I'm still stuck with 300 megabits here at the studio

544
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:18,840
That's what i'm with you chris. Yeah

545
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:25,320
They're i'm not even joking. There are days when the starlink in the rv performs better than the comcast here at the studio

546
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,560
Yikes, I know although

547
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,320
although

548
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:33,720
We did get a letter saying that fiber was in the area and would be available soon

549
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:38,280
So things could be looking up boys. Things could be looking up. Oh brent will attest to this

550
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:42,920
We're driving around my area at the moment and there are just trucks rolling running fiber

551
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:46,140
Everywhere around me but not in my neighborhood

552
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:47,820
Good

553
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:51,020
That does sting very it's very frustrating and it's

554
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:54,860
They're also hard to miss their giant rolls of orange

555
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:59,580
Beauty so alex every time we're out driving. He's like there's another one fiber

556
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:03,660
Yeah, yeah, I will say that I agree with chris here on that though that

557
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:09,980
You might as well go ahead and do 10 gigabit and you know, we were on the topic of e-waste earlier

558
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:15,580
Right. What is it going to be like 2.5 for five years until then you upgrade to 10?

559
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:19,260
It just seems like save yourself the time and the effort do it once and do it, right?

560
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:25,500
I agree completely and that was why I ran cat 6a when I moved in was because I had one eye on that in the future

561
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:32,540
But I was talking to abstract vector who is matt adventurous way who was also on the show a few episodes ago building the house

562
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:37,260
He's running fiber in a conduit from the road to his house

563
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:40,300
Which is like a three four hundred foot driveway or something

564
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:46,140
Uh, but then he's also running fiber between all the buildings. He's building on his land

565
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:51,820
And so he's looking at all the different switching gear. He's going to need for that kind of stuff. So you would too

566
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:55,280
Right. I mean wouldn't you at this point? I mean, absolutely

567
00:43:55,980 --> 00:44:00,060
I would love to do that. Yeah, we should have him on at some point and see how it goes how it's all working

568
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:04,060
Yeah, we need a six monthly update from matt on his house build

569
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:08,620
But he was doing he was doing 10 gigabit over two and a half for his home build

570
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:11,340
We'll have to ask him

571
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:15,180
Okay, I bet if he's running fiber in conduit. Yeah, you might as well right?

572
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:18,380
You know what?

573
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:21,660
I want to find out we'll talk to him. Maybe he can let us know in fact

574
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:26,460
Let us know what you think two and a half. Should he go all the way to 10 gig? How would you do it?

575
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:29,340
How have you done it go to self hosted dot show slash contact?

576
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:31,340
That's the place to go to get in touch with us

577
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:36,460
Give us some feedback or send us a boost get a new podcast app your boost go to the front of the line

578
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:42,720
As always you can find me on twitter at ironic badger and i'm over there at chris las

579
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:46,780
Cheesy you got anywhere you want to send people? It's been a while since you've been on anything to plug

580
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:51,660
Uh, no, nothing really to plug per se, but uh, i'm glad to see that you guys are still healthy

581
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:54,620
The show's still doing great. Sorry. I missed the meetup this time

582
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:58,860
Hopefully i'll get to come out next time when we're not in the helm buying process

583
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:04,960
Which is just a nightmare in and of itself right now. Um, yeah. Yeah, that's a whole podcast

584
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:09,420
When you do get a place and it's time to tech it out. You got to come back on the show

585
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:11,260
We'll talk about that. Oh, absolutely

586
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:15,260
Absolutely, we'll drop into a helicopter in and do some ethernet pools with you or something

587
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:19,740
Well, yeah, you know now that i'm here at the apartment like I brought all of my unify gear with me

588
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:23,260
Though I can't really it's like just sitting in the closet right now. Like I can't really use it

589
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:28,780
You must be already daydreaming. You must be thinking about absolutely every house we look at dude. I'm like, hmm

590
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:33,900
Where could we go here? Oh, I like this crawl space plenty of place for me to get around here. Um, right

591
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:39,500
But yeah, you know, it's great to see that you guys are still uh, chugging along doing great in the the the turnout

592
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:41,580
You know 100 people that's that's pretty phenomenal

593
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:45,820
Um and that people are already talking about meeting up there individually. That's I think that's just a

594
