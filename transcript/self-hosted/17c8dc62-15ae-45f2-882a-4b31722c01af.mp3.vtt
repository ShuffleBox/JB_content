00:00.000 --> 00:03.240
2022, it's here with a bang.

00:03.240 --> 00:05.960
We've dragged in our favorite Canadian out of the cold.

00:05.960 --> 00:07.360
Welcome back, Brent.

00:07.960 --> 00:09.360
Hello, everyone.

00:09.440 --> 00:11.240
And Chris, as always, how are you doing?

00:11.240 --> 00:12.120
Happy new year, sir.

00:12.800 --> 00:13.760
Hey, you know what?

00:13.760 --> 00:17.400
I want to say thank you to the team that stepped in for the holiday 3D printing

00:17.400 --> 00:18.800
episode, that was a lot of fun.

00:19.120 --> 00:21.080
And now, I mean, it feels like I haven't done this forever.

00:21.520 --> 00:22.600
Yeah, who are you again?

00:23.040 --> 00:24.720
What is this thing in front of my face?

00:24.720 --> 00:29.040
Well, I thought maybe if I brought Brent with me, I'd be accepted back.

00:29.520 --> 00:30.640
Maybe we'll see.

00:30.640 --> 00:32.720
The jury is still out on that one.

00:33.040 --> 00:34.320
It always works with Alex.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.960
The quickest way to Alex's heart is through a Brent.

00:37.960 --> 00:40.000
Oh, it's true.

00:40.160 --> 00:44.640
Also, video games, you know, my favorite game of all time, I think, is probably

00:44.640 --> 00:51.440
Factorio, but I potentially have a new one, which is vying for a top spot at the

00:51.440 --> 00:54.760
moment, it's called Anno1800, have either of you played this game?

00:55.240 --> 00:56.440
Oh, this is the first I hear of it.

00:56.880 --> 00:57.400
Yeah, same.

00:57.400 --> 00:58.280
What kind of game is this?

00:59.040 --> 01:02.640
It's a city builder where you manage like supply chains and that kind of thing.

01:02.640 --> 01:04.840
Oh, it sounds like it's up your alley.

01:04.840 --> 01:09.120
You're pretty much playing as the East India Trading Company, minus the slavery

01:09.240 --> 01:10.680
part, so that's kind of nice.

01:11.520 --> 01:16.080
But yeah, you just trade goods back and forth and build cities and yeah, it's a

01:16.080 --> 01:18.200
fun, relaxing, single player game.

01:18.680 --> 01:20.320
When was this released and how'd you hear of it?

01:20.320 --> 01:24.920
Ages ago, I don't know when it was released exactly, but I think I heard

01:24.920 --> 01:30.440
about it first when Linus of Tech Tip fame mentioned it on one of his videos

01:30.440 --> 01:33.520
and I thought, oh, I'll go and check it out and downloaded a demo and liked it.

01:33.520 --> 01:34.040
So I bought it.

01:34.840 --> 01:37.560
It's kind of great when you discover a game that's been out for a while.

01:37.600 --> 01:39.880
So that means it's got a couple of patches under its belt.

01:40.200 --> 01:41.600
You can find stuff online.

01:41.600 --> 01:45.480
There's a community, sort of a sweet spot, you know, you know, a game doesn't

01:45.480 --> 01:47.680
have to be cutting edge brand new for it to be enjoyable.

01:48.440 --> 01:49.000
Absolutely.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.840
Not speaking of stuff that's no longer cutting edge and brand new, I thought

01:52.840 --> 01:57.880
I'd just do a quick bit of follow-up on the Linux Unplugged Predictions episode.

01:58.080 --> 02:01.400
Unfortunately, I wasn't able to make the recording of this year's

02:01.440 --> 02:06.120
predictions episode itself, but I thought I'd follow up on the prediction

02:06.120 --> 02:11.120
I made last year, about 20 terabyte hard drives being available, I think,

02:11.120 --> 02:12.920
for 250 bucks at Best Buy.

02:13.760 --> 02:14.800
That didn't quite pan out.

02:14.880 --> 02:16.440
No, it didn't quite, did it?

02:16.440 --> 02:16.720
No.

02:16.720 --> 02:21.560
I mean, there was a few shenanigans going on that kind of scuppered my, my plans.

02:21.600 --> 02:24.800
First of all, supply chain, obviously we all know at this point, what's

02:24.800 --> 02:27.160
going on with the supply chain, but second of all, it was Chia.

02:27.200 --> 02:31.720
We had a hard drive mining crypto coin come out of the woodwork.

02:32.400 --> 02:36.600
Yeah, there's just no way with all that was going on, that was going to happen.

02:37.240 --> 02:39.160
You think maybe you got a better shot this year?

02:39.840 --> 02:41.600
No, but I'm just going to say it anyway.

02:41.600 --> 02:46.160
I mean, I was trying to, you know, with this Anno 1800 game, I've got a 1080

02:46.160 --> 02:49.760
TI graphics card, which I've had for several years now, which was actually

02:49.760 --> 02:53.920
incidentally paid for originally by Bitcoin mining four years ago.

02:54.560 --> 02:57.520
And now with this Anno 1800 game, I've been looking for a new GPU.

02:57.520 --> 03:01.200
And I was looking, you know, just to see what was out there.

03:01.760 --> 03:08.720
The cheapest 3080 that I could find was on Facebook marketplace near me for $1,800.

03:08.720 --> 03:10.520
What is going on with that?

03:13.520 --> 03:14.120
Ridiculous.

03:14.240 --> 03:19.880
Yeah, we've been building a new replacement server here and the number

03:19.880 --> 03:24.120
one cost because the audience has been so awesome by providing the main rigs

03:24.120 --> 03:27.280
has been storage and the just a limited amount of storage.

03:27.280 --> 03:31.440
So I had to buy a batch of two terabytes and a batch of four terabytes.

03:31.440 --> 03:35.120
I wanted all four terabytes, obviously, and I had to buy them all at the same

03:35.120 --> 03:39.920
price, which I'm not super comfortable with, but it's going to be in an array

03:39.920 --> 03:44.000
in array array, so hopefully if one or two pops will be all right, but they're

03:44.000 --> 03:48.080
all used this and, you know, we paid a fair amount for them, even buying in the

03:48.080 --> 03:52.080
after, you know, whatever you call it, the lightly loved market, I assume,

03:52.080 --> 03:53.200
because they're enterprise drives.

03:53.200 --> 03:55.280
So I hope I hope the last.

03:55.600 --> 03:58.960
I've just recently learned about this whole hard drive used market.

03:58.960 --> 04:02.880
Is this Alex, do you think something's going to happen with this market?

04:02.880 --> 04:06.480
Is this Alex, you think something worth even considering?

04:07.440 --> 04:09.200
I mean, how cheap are we talking?

04:09.600 --> 04:11.200
A 14 terabyte.

04:11.200 --> 04:12.480
So here's my reference point.

04:12.800 --> 04:16.480
A 14 terabyte easy store that I can shuck from Best Buy.

04:16.960 --> 04:21.760
I think I picked one up before Christmas for about $190, $200, something like that.

04:23.040 --> 04:28.480
I think it's also what is your risk tolerance and do you have a setup that

04:28.480 --> 04:31.600
can tolerate one or two drives at least failing?

04:31.600 --> 04:32.960
Yeah, that makes sense.

04:32.960 --> 04:35.440
So the new server, do we keep that in mind?

04:35.440 --> 04:36.560
Yeah, yeah, we can.

04:36.560 --> 04:38.320
We can sustain a couple of dis failing.

04:38.320 --> 04:42.080
I think in total, we're OK until three fail simultaneously.

04:42.880 --> 04:47.200
And I normally wouldn't think that's likely, except for these are probably all

04:47.200 --> 04:49.760
originally from the same manufacturing batch.

04:49.760 --> 04:53.840
They're all the same exact hard drive, the same exact model, all bought at the same

04:53.840 --> 04:54.400
exact time.

04:55.600 --> 04:57.360
I thought that was a rule not to do that.

04:57.360 --> 05:01.680
I'm pretty sure there's a rule against that, like the bathtub curve or something.

05:01.680 --> 05:03.040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:03.040 --> 05:05.440
But beggars are definitely not choosers.

05:05.440 --> 05:07.280
And in this case, that's what we got.

05:07.280 --> 05:12.560
Have you considered calling your buddy Alex over here and shipping him a couple of hard

05:12.560 --> 05:17.920
drives and then you could use some of his basement space as a offsite backup?

05:17.920 --> 05:19.040
Maybe we could do that.

05:19.040 --> 05:20.320
That'd be a fun project.

05:20.320 --> 05:25.520
Now, I know this is a lot of power, but what about a full server potentially?

05:25.520 --> 05:26.080
Why?

05:26.080 --> 05:28.800
Well, because I think I might have one that I'm going to totally sink.

05:30.560 --> 05:35.760
And I mean, but you know, I think he has more servers than hard drive space.

05:35.760 --> 05:36.800
You're pretty offsite.

05:36.800 --> 05:40.560
You know, that's a good offsite backup, you know, in terms of offsite backups go when

05:40.560 --> 05:41.040
in the East.

05:41.040 --> 05:45.680
I mean, if a nuke hit DC, would it come out as far as Raleigh?

05:45.680 --> 05:46.400
Probably.

05:46.960 --> 05:47.440
I don't know.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.520
I mean, if that happens, I think I probably got bigger problems, really.

05:51.520 --> 05:52.560
Oh, I don't know.

05:52.560 --> 05:53.280
I don't know.

05:53.280 --> 05:54.080
You're on the West Coast.

05:54.080 --> 05:56.560
I don't think the fallout would make it quite that far.

05:56.560 --> 05:57.120
I'm joking.

05:57.120 --> 05:58.640
Of course, there'll be bigger problems than that.

05:59.360 --> 06:01.600
There's one or two mountains between us, I suppose.

06:01.600 --> 06:02.960
Maybe I'll do all right.

06:02.960 --> 06:04.720
And then really life should just go on as normal.

06:04.720 --> 06:06.240
There would be no other repercussions.

06:07.600 --> 06:11.760
No, I mean, if the federal government disappeared tomorrow, I don't think anybody would be too

06:11.760 --> 06:12.080
upset.

06:12.080 --> 06:12.580
Do you?

06:13.200 --> 06:15.280
No, I just vote with blockchain.

06:15.280 --> 06:16.640
I think that's what happened.

06:16.640 --> 06:18.560
Oh, so is that your prediction?

06:18.560 --> 06:19.680
Was it 200?

06:19.680 --> 06:20.160
What was it?

06:20.800 --> 06:24.000
I think I missed the 20 terabyte easy store for 250.

06:24.000 --> 06:24.720
Dollars or less.

06:25.680 --> 06:27.280
Okay, okay.

06:27.280 --> 06:31.840
Can I ask you what you think, Alex, your success rate might be?

06:32.880 --> 06:33.680
Zero percent.

06:35.440 --> 06:37.840
Oh, man, but he's doing it anyways.

06:37.840 --> 06:43.120
A couple of years ago, I was pretty confident about it, but I don't know the way things

06:43.120 --> 06:46.240
are at the minute and, you know, chip shortages and all that kind of stuff.

06:47.360 --> 06:50.640
I'm not so sure anymore, but, you know, can't blame a guy for trying.

06:51.440 --> 06:52.000
No.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.640
What about diminishing returns when it comes to hard drive?

06:54.640 --> 07:00.400
Like, I don't know, squeezing that much data into tiny like it's a physical space.

07:00.400 --> 07:01.440
Is there any?

07:01.440 --> 07:03.120
Terabyte is a terabyte.

07:03.120 --> 07:06.880
Yeah, but I guess what I'm saying is, is there any physical limitation to how far this can

07:06.880 --> 07:07.120
go?

07:07.120 --> 07:11.040
Oh, there's been a lot of innovations in that space for better for worse, for sure.

07:11.040 --> 07:17.280
Yeah, they do all sorts of shenanigans to fit more bits and bytes and stuff onto a single

07:17.280 --> 07:17.760
platter.

07:17.760 --> 07:21.360
You know, that's way beyond what I think about generally on on the regular.

07:22.240 --> 07:25.440
I think about how much space I can fit into a single drive slot.

07:26.400 --> 07:31.920
And for for me, in my backup server, for example, I've just built a new backup server that has

07:31.920 --> 07:33.680
five hot swap drive bays.

07:33.680 --> 07:38.720
And so for me, I want to be able to cram as many terabytes into those five slots as I

07:38.720 --> 07:39.200
can.

07:39.200 --> 07:43.520
So trying to get the most terabyte per slot for me is the name of the game.

07:44.720 --> 07:46.560
Yep, I totally agree.

07:46.560 --> 07:47.920
Totally agree.

07:47.920 --> 07:52.240
So Santa brought you a few gifts and some of them speak home kit.

07:53.280 --> 07:57.120
And this is a topic we've danced around on the show because we appreciate not everyone

07:57.120 --> 07:59.840
listening even cares about this kind of stuff.

07:59.840 --> 08:02.400
You've been prepping for this episode for years.

08:03.280 --> 08:10.080
Yeah, you know, honestly, before I gave home assistant a go, I gave home kit a go.

08:10.080 --> 08:14.160
Like, I just tried to do everything with home kit because there's there's things I like

08:14.160 --> 08:14.480
about it.

08:14.480 --> 08:19.120
If you're not familiar, it's it's basically a software framework that Apple created that

08:19.120 --> 08:21.680
exists in the iOS ecosystem and now the Mac.

08:22.240 --> 08:27.920
And it allows for land based smart automation and device controls.

08:28.560 --> 08:32.000
And it's because it's land based, it's really quick.

08:32.000 --> 08:36.720
And because it's Apple, it's integrated into the OS and it's integrated into any of the

08:36.720 --> 08:42.480
Siri speaker devices and anything that you can invoke Siri on, you can control a home

08:42.480 --> 08:43.200
kit device with.

08:43.200 --> 08:46.080
So that it kind of opens it up to a pretty wide ecosystem.

08:46.080 --> 08:49.280
Even the Apple TV remote can be used to control home kit devices.

08:49.920 --> 08:55.200
And of course, Apple builds home kit automations into their shortcuts app on the iPhone.

08:55.200 --> 09:00.640
So you can build automations in your smart home using the shortcuts app, just if you

09:00.640 --> 09:03.200
really live in that ecosystem.

09:03.200 --> 09:08.240
But obviously, because it's Apple's ecosystem, it's a big sandbox, but it is absolutely a

09:08.240 --> 09:09.680
sandbox and it does have walls.

09:09.680 --> 09:15.120
So absolutely, I'm already bumping up against those walls on, you know, day 10 or whatever

09:15.120 --> 09:17.680
of my iOS transition.

09:17.680 --> 09:22.960
You know, I've been using Android for the best part of a decade and I figured I'd give

09:22.960 --> 09:26.160
the iOS side a proper college try this year.

09:26.160 --> 09:28.160
So I'm going to keep going with this phone.

09:29.200 --> 09:30.160
I'm going to try and do a year.

09:30.160 --> 09:31.120
We'll see how it goes.

09:31.120 --> 09:32.640
I like it so far for the most part.

09:32.640 --> 09:37.680
There's a couple of things, but coming back to home kit, what's really nice is how it's

09:37.680 --> 09:39.680
it's seamless, right?

09:39.680 --> 09:44.320
And when I pull down on my notification kind of control center thing up in the top right,

09:44.320 --> 09:48.880
I get a button there called home, which has some favorites within it.

09:48.880 --> 09:54.480
And one of the things that came up right away without any configuration at all was my LG

09:54.480 --> 09:54.880
TV.

09:54.880 --> 09:57.200
So I can just turn it on and off straight from my phone.

09:57.200 --> 09:58.560
No need for a specific app.

09:58.560 --> 10:02.640
Yeah, as you would expect, Apple is pretty good at what they do support.

10:02.640 --> 10:03.680
It works pretty well.

10:04.560 --> 10:07.040
And home kit itself seems to be fairly robust.

10:07.040 --> 10:09.360
They've open sourced a lot of it.

10:09.360 --> 10:12.160
It uses encryption that seems to be pretty strong.

10:12.720 --> 10:15.520
And they're promising broader integration with matter as that develops.

10:15.520 --> 10:16.720
They're one of the partners there.

10:17.360 --> 10:19.040
So there's some things to like about it.

10:19.040 --> 10:22.240
And I think as we get into this, I want to talk about how you can integrate it with Home

10:22.240 --> 10:22.560
Assistant.

10:22.560 --> 10:23.920
I don't know if you've tried that yet, Alex.

10:25.120 --> 10:25.600
Not yet.

10:25.600 --> 10:30.240
I mean, you know that I have dozens of home automation devices around this house already.

10:31.040 --> 10:34.320
The only one that got picked up out of the box was my LG TV.

10:34.320 --> 10:36.800
Okay, well, so I think let's let's start here.

10:36.800 --> 10:42.640
I think where I want to take this is if you have family members listening that want some

10:42.640 --> 10:48.480
home automation, they're not comfortable with Google or Amazon doing cloud control services.

10:48.480 --> 10:54.000
And they're not interested in running something like Home Assistant or OpenHAB or a smart

10:54.000 --> 10:57.360
things hub, but they have iOS devices, right?

10:57.360 --> 11:01.040
This is a category of user that's perfect for this because they can really get a lot

11:01.040 --> 11:03.120
done here at the studio.

11:03.120 --> 11:09.760
Here at the studio, I actually use automations with HomeKit to turn on and off the lights

11:09.760 --> 11:11.200
when I arrive and leave.

11:11.200 --> 11:14.080
I don't actually do it directly on Home Assistant.

11:14.080 --> 11:16.560
It's triggering Home Assistant devices, which we'll talk about.

11:17.200 --> 11:21.040
But the automation is actually being triggered by shortcuts on my iPhone.

11:21.600 --> 11:25.840
Also, I use that same setup to scan NFC tags to trigger automations.

11:25.840 --> 11:30.240
So there's some nice things you can get without having to run a whole back end infrastructure.

11:30.240 --> 11:33.200
So what happens when Chris's iPhone isn't there?

11:34.080 --> 11:39.840
They have this concept of a hub, and it's either the Apple TV or an iPad that you're

11:39.840 --> 11:46.960
willing to leave on the LAN, probably plugged in, or a HomePod, big or small.

11:46.960 --> 11:50.000
They can all act as a HomeKit hub.

11:50.000 --> 11:53.040
It becomes the primary orchestrator of your HomeKit network.

11:53.600 --> 11:59.200
And if you're comfortable with this, it also will act as the proxy to iCloud.

11:59.200 --> 12:03.120
So Apple establishes a secure connection between your iPhone and iCloud.

12:03.120 --> 12:07.680
So when you leave the house, you can pull down that control center, and all your devices

12:07.680 --> 12:10.400
still work, all their status information still works.

12:10.400 --> 12:14.720
And when you trigger them, what's happening is a proxied request is being routed through

12:14.720 --> 12:18.400
iCloud to the HomeKit hub, which in my case is a HomePod.

12:18.960 --> 12:21.440
And then the HomePod is executing it locally on your LAN.

12:22.880 --> 12:25.760
Okay, that's pretty legit.

12:25.760 --> 12:29.680
That's similar to the Nebuchadnezzar service, right?

12:29.680 --> 12:34.320
Right, and it's all encrypted between your HomeKit hub and your phone.

12:34.320 --> 12:36.320
So Apple doesn't have the key to that.

12:36.960 --> 12:40.560
So they do have the ability to exchange it.

12:40.560 --> 12:42.720
So in theory, they could probably intercept it.

12:42.720 --> 12:47.200
But as far as where the encryption keys are held, it's on your iPhone or your iOS device,

12:47.200 --> 12:50.000
could be the watch, and the HomeKit hub.

12:50.000 --> 12:55.680
So how do I add things that don't have HomeKit support to this ecosystem?

12:55.680 --> 12:56.240
Can I do that?

12:57.120 --> 12:59.040
I do it through Home Assistant, but we'll get there.

12:59.600 --> 13:02.160
I wanted to mention HomeBridge.

13:02.160 --> 13:04.720
HomeBridge is really the way to do this right now.

13:04.720 --> 13:06.640
You mentioned LG televisions.

13:06.640 --> 13:11.440
Before LG natively supported HomeKit, everyone was doing it with HomeBridge.

13:11.440 --> 13:15.840
And you could run it like on a Raspberry Pi, and it essentially, it'll talk their proprietary

13:15.840 --> 13:19.760
API, whatever protocol or service it might be.

13:19.760 --> 13:23.360
The bridge will talk that, and then it will translate it to HomeKit.

13:23.360 --> 13:27.520
So it'll just show up to your iPhone as a HomeKit device.

13:27.520 --> 13:30.160
But it's really the bridge making that representation.

13:30.160 --> 13:35.040
And so people were controlling LG televisions using this bridge, and LG got wind of it.

13:35.040 --> 13:38.800
They thought, oh, well, maybe we should work with Apple and just build in the HomeKit support.

13:38.800 --> 13:40.320
And that's how that actually started.

13:40.320 --> 13:41.760
So I don't need the HomeBridge.

13:41.760 --> 13:43.600
That's just nice to have.

13:43.600 --> 13:45.920
Yeah, and you really don't if you're a Home Assistant user.

13:45.920 --> 13:51.280
But again, if you want to go the route of controlling stuff without the whole infrastructure

13:51.280 --> 13:56.640
of managing Home Assistant, you could use HomeKit to do 90% of what you need.

13:56.640 --> 14:00.720
And then those random cheap devices that are quote unquote smart devices that are not HomeKit

14:00.720 --> 14:06.640
compatible, you could run HomeBridge on your Mac or on a Raspberry Pi or on a Windows box

14:06.640 --> 14:10.640
or a Linux box, and you could get that other 10%.

14:10.640 --> 14:14.080
And it does a bunch of neat stuff that Apple's probably never going to really do, you know,

14:14.080 --> 14:15.760
as any community builds on.

14:15.760 --> 14:17.600
So there's some other advantages to HomeBridge.

14:17.600 --> 14:21.760
It's not necessary unless you want to support non-HomeKit compatible devices.

14:22.720 --> 14:24.240
OK, well, thanks for clearing that up.

14:24.240 --> 14:30.320
The terminology here is so confusing, you know, HomeKit and HomeBridge and Home Assistant.

14:30.320 --> 14:34.720
And it's kind of hard to keep all this stuff straight in your head when you're fresh to it.

14:34.720 --> 14:41.040
Why don't we come back to that in just a second?

14:41.040 --> 14:43.920
Linode.com slash SSH.

14:43.920 --> 14:46.960
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account.

14:46.960 --> 14:48.560
And you go there to support the show.

14:48.560 --> 14:49.440
That's how this works.

14:49.440 --> 14:51.520
You go there, you support us, we keep on going.

14:51.520 --> 14:53.920
And it's like the circle of podcasting.

14:53.920 --> 14:55.520
It's an ecosystem, if you will.

14:55.520 --> 14:57.280
You know, Linode is how we host everything.

14:57.280 --> 14:59.920
It's also how I'll do like a quick R&D.

14:59.920 --> 15:03.440
I want to try out an open source project or I have an idea for something that I want to

15:03.440 --> 15:04.080
build.

15:04.080 --> 15:08.960
I guess back in the day, I'd like get a VM on my local machine, but those always kind

15:08.960 --> 15:09.360
of suck.

15:09.360 --> 15:12.320
And not to mention it makes my machine busy and I have to have a certain machine that's

15:12.320 --> 15:13.920
always capable of doing that.

15:13.920 --> 15:18.240
When I flipped to using Linode for this kind of stuff, it changed like the kind of hardware

15:18.240 --> 15:19.280
I'm buying now.

15:19.280 --> 15:21.440
It like opened up a whole new door, man.

15:21.440 --> 15:25.360
It's really it's really pretty great, even just for like just research and development.

15:25.360 --> 15:27.600
And then, of course, you want to flip it to production.

15:27.600 --> 15:29.760
It's the best place to do that, in my opinion.

15:29.760 --> 15:31.600
They got 11 data centers around the world.

15:31.600 --> 15:33.920
Their machines are screamers, just super fast.

15:33.920 --> 15:38.240
Lots of distributions to choose from, including now images for Rocky Linux and Alma Linux

15:38.240 --> 15:40.080
and CentOS Stream, if that's your thing.

15:40.640 --> 15:44.080
And on top of all of it, a really great user experience.

15:45.120 --> 15:49.760
Every system over there is a great value, great performance, and a nice experience setting

15:49.760 --> 15:50.240
it up.

15:50.240 --> 15:53.760
If you like to do it yourself and build it from the ground up or just deploy an image

15:53.760 --> 15:58.320
with something ready to go, like say Next Cloud, maybe Discourse or GitLab, they've

15:58.320 --> 16:00.240
got one click deployments for that.

16:00.240 --> 16:03.840
And then I'm often finding that I'm taking advantage of their things like S3 compatible

16:03.840 --> 16:08.560
object storage just by using their command line client or just not even having a machine

16:08.560 --> 16:10.800
in between or just using a web interface.

16:10.800 --> 16:14.720
They have all kinds of nice things like that, like a DNS manager that's going to let you

16:14.720 --> 16:15.920
get done what you need.

16:15.920 --> 16:19.840
Kubernetes support, if that's the way you go, just a lot to try.

16:19.840 --> 16:23.840
And pricing is 30% to 50% cheaper than any other major cloud provider.

16:23.840 --> 16:26.240
So go to linode.com slash SSH.

16:26.240 --> 16:28.720
Get that $100 to really try it out.

16:28.720 --> 16:32.320
Kick the tires, create an account, see what I'm talking about, and support the show.

16:32.320 --> 16:34.560
linode.com slash SSH.

16:36.560 --> 16:40.560
Alex was touching on a bunch of the terminology here, but Chris, it sounds like you've put

16:40.560 --> 16:41.760
a bunch of links in the show notes.

16:42.480 --> 16:44.960
Link Ninja, and I didn't overdo it.

16:44.960 --> 16:48.080
I just tried to put the best of the best in there that helps you go through it all with

16:48.080 --> 16:49.920
screenshots and stuff like that.

16:49.920 --> 16:53.520
So if you're trying to set this up for yourself or like a family member, hopefully those will

16:53.520 --> 16:54.400
work as a resource.

16:55.120 --> 16:59.680
But Alex, I think what you really need to kind of wrap your head around is connecting

16:59.680 --> 17:01.680
HomeKit and Home Assistant.

17:01.680 --> 17:05.840
You've got such an established Home Assistant set up now that I don't really think it's

17:05.840 --> 17:11.840
worth like developing and I guess cultivating your HomeKit devices because you're essentially

17:11.840 --> 17:15.120
going to replace them with everything that's in Home Assistant when you connect it.

17:16.080 --> 17:21.760
And so every device that is in Home Assistant will now show up to your iPhone as a HomeKit

17:21.760 --> 17:22.240
device.

17:23.040 --> 17:27.760
So you connect the devices to Home Assistant and then they show up on the iPhone.

17:27.760 --> 17:32.080
And so that means non-HomeKit devices show up, obviously.

17:32.080 --> 17:37.520
That also means things like your automations and your scripts and those types of things,

17:37.520 --> 17:40.800
even camera feeds now also show up as HomeKit devices.

17:41.520 --> 17:42.240
Camera feeds?

17:43.040 --> 17:45.440
Yeah, it depends on the camera, of course, but yeah.

17:45.440 --> 17:47.120
Oh, that's pretty cool.

17:47.120 --> 17:54.720
So I've just right now installed the HomeKit integration and I now have about 20 different

17:54.720 --> 17:57.840
devices asking me to scan a QR code and add them to the Home app.

17:58.640 --> 18:03.920
Yeah, that's why I'm saying like it's kind of easier to just I had to just take a weekend

18:03.920 --> 18:08.160
and because I was all in on HomeKit and I just had to move them all over if I recall,

18:08.160 --> 18:11.600
although read on it because it's been so long since I've done it that they may have changed

18:11.600 --> 18:12.480
the way it works now.

18:13.120 --> 18:16.480
But then future devices now I just add them directly to Home Assistant.

18:17.760 --> 18:18.160
All right.

18:18.160 --> 18:22.800
So live listeners, I am going through the process of adding a camera into the Home app.

18:22.800 --> 18:25.200
I have added the HomeKit integration.

18:25.840 --> 18:31.200
Now I'm going through my notifications and adding by scanning a QR code in the Home app

18:31.200 --> 18:36.640
on iOS, I'm adding an uncertified accessory and I get a great big warning telling me it's

18:36.640 --> 18:39.040
not secure as I do it.

18:40.480 --> 18:45.600
It's now connecting to the camera, which is in the kitchen.

18:46.720 --> 18:47.920
What's that kitchen hub?

18:47.920 --> 18:49.360
I don't even have a camera in the kitchen.

18:50.480 --> 18:52.480
Oh, yeah, it'll try to guess.

18:52.480 --> 18:54.320
Yeah, it will try to continue.

18:54.320 --> 18:58.640
OK, blue iris, all cameras and camera that you know of.

18:59.280 --> 19:01.360
I mean, let's be honest, Brett and I have both been in there.

19:01.360 --> 19:03.280
There's a few cameras you don't know about.

19:03.280 --> 19:05.200
Oh, it's my driveway, not my kitchen.

19:06.080 --> 19:06.880
That's pretty cool.

19:07.920 --> 19:08.560
Yeah.

19:08.560 --> 19:13.840
Now what's nice is all your devices on your iCloud account and your family devices can

19:13.840 --> 19:14.880
get access to those.

19:15.440 --> 19:20.640
So Catherine could have all of those devices on her iPhone and my kids, like when they're

19:20.640 --> 19:25.600
at the RV, have access to those devices on their iPad so they can read or be in bed at

19:25.600 --> 19:28.640
night and they can just grab their iPad and turn the lighting off when they're done now,

19:28.640 --> 19:31.600
which has been great because they just discovered that on their own.

19:31.600 --> 19:33.520
And I didn't even have to tell them about it.

19:33.520 --> 19:37.440
And they have also the tablets, but now they have it right there on the device that they

19:37.440 --> 19:38.000
already have.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.760
So why not have that additional integration?

19:40.720 --> 19:41.200
Absolutely.

19:41.200 --> 19:42.400
Yeah, that's pretty cool.

19:43.200 --> 19:47.120
For me, answers some of the biggest questions I had actually, and I've deliberately left

19:47.120 --> 19:51.840
all of this research to do it kind of live on air, live on the episode to make it more

19:51.840 --> 19:52.800
exciting or something.

19:52.800 --> 19:53.360
I don't know.

19:53.840 --> 19:56.800
It answers some questions that I had about how to actually integrate this stuff.

19:56.800 --> 20:01.680
But when we were talking the other day, you suggested that I might need an Apple TV.

20:01.680 --> 20:05.680
And I know we touched on the iPad and things like that as like a home hub.

20:06.240 --> 20:07.520
Why would I need that?

20:08.240 --> 20:10.960
Is that for the kind of relay thing that you were mentioning?

20:11.840 --> 20:14.480
Yeah, so the Apple TV can act as that hub.

20:14.480 --> 20:18.000
And it will do a fine job because it's powered on all the time.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.840
And you'll probably have it plugged into Ethernet.

20:19.840 --> 20:21.920
So it's actually a really good device for that.

20:22.720 --> 20:25.680
And they have a low power mode for it and everything like that.

20:25.680 --> 20:28.000
And there's even some information when you go into the settings screen.

20:28.000 --> 20:32.160
You can see like what its status is as far as your home GitHub goes.

20:32.160 --> 20:34.720
And when you put it on your network, you plug it in.

20:34.720 --> 20:38.560
If that's the first device you have, that's if you don't like, say, or you have a home

20:38.560 --> 20:42.800
pod, it'll just sort of negotiate and it'll become the leader automatically.

20:42.800 --> 20:44.720
You'll never know. You never really have to fuss.

20:44.720 --> 20:45.440
It just does it.

20:46.400 --> 20:50.800
Now, I've just tried to add my robot vacuum and it tried to pick that up as a camera for

20:50.800 --> 20:51.360
some reason.

20:52.400 --> 20:58.960
I think because of the map portion that the Xiaomi RoboVac thing that I have, Roborock

20:58.960 --> 21:04.400
S5 is the one I have, and it's trying to use that map as a camera and it's just failing

21:04.400 --> 21:05.120
and spinning.

21:05.120 --> 21:08.800
And so this isn't perfect by any stretch, but I can certainly see why this would be

21:08.800 --> 21:09.300
useful.

21:09.300 --> 21:13.140
What I would do for some of those devices is just disable them in HomeKit because like

21:13.140 --> 21:18.420
so say you have like my sensors that have six different sensor feeds.

21:18.420 --> 21:22.420
Each one of those will show up as a device in HomeKit.

21:22.420 --> 21:24.980
The humidity, like all of it just shows up as a device.

21:24.980 --> 21:27.540
And some of it there isn't like a parallel.

21:27.540 --> 21:30.900
There's nothing in the Apple world that equates to that kind of device.

21:30.900 --> 21:32.740
And so I just disable those.

21:32.740 --> 21:37.860
So basically, it's like a one time curation where I go through and I just I take a look

21:37.860 --> 21:39.940
through and I just I take some stuff out.

21:39.940 --> 21:41.700
There's a couple of different ways you can do that.

21:41.700 --> 21:47.220
I don't remember the best way, but I found it online by looking and I just went through

21:47.220 --> 21:51.700
one time and disabled everything that I didn't want in that HomeKit screen once.

21:51.700 --> 21:52.660
And it's been great.

21:52.660 --> 21:57.940
But yeah, there is edge cases like a device that has two camera feeds and stuff like that.

21:57.940 --> 22:02.420
But I think Apple only expects devices to have one single camera and those kinds of

22:02.420 --> 22:03.300
weird edge cases.

22:03.300 --> 22:08.900
But when you're looking for like controlling smart devices or lights or kicking off automations

22:08.900 --> 22:10.980
or scripts, it's great at that kind of stuff.

22:11.860 --> 22:17.780
But it doesn't fully replace going to the Home Assistant web UI or app if you're even

22:17.780 --> 22:18.900
a moderate power user.

22:18.900 --> 22:20.900
I don't think it helps either.

22:20.900 --> 22:26.580
My other primary HomeKit kind of ecosystem, the Philips Hue stuff, I recently replaced

22:26.580 --> 22:30.900
that with a Combi to ZigBee bridge and ZigBee buttons everywhere.

22:30.900 --> 22:37.460
So the couple of low hanging fruit that I had that would have worked now don't work

22:37.460 --> 22:39.700
because I've kind of taken that control back in house.

22:40.340 --> 22:45.140
But if you do connect HomeKit up all to Home Assistant, then those will show up.

22:45.140 --> 22:48.980
Those will be devices as buttons you can use in HomeKit.

22:48.980 --> 22:49.700
That's pretty cool.

22:50.420 --> 22:50.900
Yeah.

22:50.900 --> 22:56.340
And so then that means also your iPad gets that, your watch and any of your Siri tubes

22:56.340 --> 22:56.820
get that.

22:56.820 --> 23:02.260
And I think the Siri tubes actually make for kind of a nice home automation voice control.

23:02.260 --> 23:03.700
It's a decent compromise.

23:03.700 --> 23:09.780
I think it's not a perfect privacy story, but it's clearly better than Google and better

23:09.780 --> 23:10.900
than Amazon.

23:10.900 --> 23:16.180
Yeah, I'd be lying if I said that wasn't part of my motivation to switch for a bit.

23:17.060 --> 23:21.140
And I like that their protocol is LAN based.

23:21.140 --> 23:22.740
It's not API cloud based.

23:22.740 --> 23:23.540
It's LAN based.

23:23.540 --> 23:29.700
Now, the voice translation that Siri does is cloud based, although Apple does seem to

23:29.700 --> 23:32.580
be moving to doing that on chip more and more.

23:32.580 --> 23:33.860
They do that in the latest iPhone.

23:33.860 --> 23:38.420
So it's conceivable future HomePods may do local transcription.

23:38.420 --> 23:40.260
So that part still goes to the cloud.

23:40.260 --> 23:45.060
But once Siri realizes what you're asking for, that happens on the LAN.

23:45.060 --> 23:46.500
That happens immediately.

23:46.500 --> 23:48.580
It's faster than some of the other ones because of that.

23:48.580 --> 23:54.180
So another question I have for you, with the Nebuchadnezzar cloud service, I can connect

23:54.740 --> 24:03.220
the Google and Amazon PUCs, tubes, whatever, voice assistants to react to various phrases.

24:03.220 --> 24:05.700
And I can program those with Google, for example.

24:05.700 --> 24:06.900
You do it in the Google Home app.

24:07.540 --> 24:12.180
I can create key phrases that trigger certain scripts in Home Assistant, that kind of thing.

24:12.820 --> 24:15.700
What's the equivalent in the HomeKit world?

24:16.500 --> 24:17.620
That's a great question.

24:17.620 --> 24:20.260
I'm really glad you asked because I should make this point.

24:20.260 --> 24:26.180
You don't need Nebuchadnezzar cloud or any of that to have HomeKit and Siri work together

24:26.180 --> 24:32.180
and have Siri trigger all the HomeKit stuff because it's doing it through the HomeKit

24:32.180 --> 24:32.820
integration.

24:33.460 --> 24:41.940
And Siri is executing those commands from the hub device or whatever Siri device requests

24:41.940 --> 24:45.060
it directly to the Home Assistant using that integration.

24:45.060 --> 24:50.660
So it bypasses the need for the complicated setup to get Google Assistant to work completely.

24:50.660 --> 24:54.180
So also, I think it's just a great setup because you don't actually need the Nebuchadnezzar

24:54.180 --> 24:54.740
cloud part.

24:54.740 --> 24:57.460
You don't have to do all the cloud stuff if you don't want to.

24:58.260 --> 25:00.740
So you just get the HomeKit integration set up.

25:00.740 --> 25:06.340
And once you have all the HomeKit devices associated with Home Assistant, Siri just

25:06.340 --> 25:07.140
works.

25:07.140 --> 25:07.860
It'll work on your phone.

25:07.860 --> 25:08.900
It'll work on your HomePod.

25:08.900 --> 25:09.700
It'll work on your watch.

25:09.700 --> 25:11.140
It'll work on your Apple TV.

25:11.140 --> 25:12.900
It all just happens immediately.

25:12.900 --> 25:13.700
Very nice.

25:13.700 --> 25:16.420
Now, we're going to take a quick break from the Apple stuff.

25:16.420 --> 25:17.620
We'll come back to that shortly.

25:18.580 --> 25:21.140
I have a request to ask of our listenership.

25:22.420 --> 25:25.380
My mother sent me a few videotapes for Christmas.

25:25.380 --> 25:28.740
They are mini DV format tapes.

25:29.540 --> 25:35.700
I rang a local video shop that does like digital or analog to digital conversions and they

25:35.700 --> 25:39.940
wanted to charge me something like $20 a tape and I've got about 10 or 20 of these things

25:39.940 --> 25:40.580
to digitize.

25:40.580 --> 25:42.900
That seems a little bit expensive to me.

25:43.700 --> 25:48.580
Also, what seems expensive is looking on eBay at these used camcorders.

25:48.580 --> 25:55.700
They're like $100, $150 for a 10, 15 year old outdated proprietary format camcorder.

25:56.340 --> 26:01.860
So I was wondering if there's anybody in the audience that has any suggestions about how

26:01.860 --> 26:09.380
I could acquire a mini DV camcorder for cheaper than $150 or would be willing to pay for it.

26:09.380 --> 26:12.260
Or would be willing to loan me one for a few weeks.

26:12.260 --> 26:13.140
That would be kind of cool.

26:14.260 --> 26:19.300
If you have any suggestions about how to actually go ahead and digitize the tapes properly,

26:19.300 --> 26:22.900
please let us know at selfhosted at jupyterbroadcasting.com.

26:24.900 --> 26:27.300
Tailscale.com slash self-hosted.

26:27.300 --> 26:31.700
Go there to get a free personal account for up to 20 devices and you support the show.

26:31.700 --> 26:32.820
Yeah, it's Tailscale.

26:32.820 --> 26:34.580
It's a zero config VPN.

26:34.580 --> 26:36.580
It installs on any device in minutes.

26:36.580 --> 26:40.500
It manages your firewall rules for you and it works from anywhere.

26:41.060 --> 26:45.780
Devices connect directly to each other using WireGuard's noise protocol encryption.

26:45.780 --> 26:49.620
It builds a mesh network with the best VPN security in the business.

26:49.620 --> 26:51.940
And it does it quickly and easily.

26:51.940 --> 26:56.900
You'll create a secure network between your servers or your computers or your cloud devices.

26:56.900 --> 27:00.900
And even when you're separated by firewall, subnets or the dreaded double NAT,

27:00.900 --> 27:02.660
Tailscale just works.

27:02.660 --> 27:05.940
I use Tailscale to keep all of my family's computers connected.

27:05.940 --> 27:07.460
I provide them tech support.

27:07.460 --> 27:10.260
I give them access to the secure resources behind my firewall.

27:10.260 --> 27:13.780
And I have it running on everything from an arch 86 server to a Raspberry Pi with

27:13.780 --> 27:16.820
openSUSE Tumbleweed and my iOS devices.

27:16.820 --> 27:22.900
But for me, some of the best parts is just that every device on my network now has a stable IP.

27:23.540 --> 27:28.740
No matter where I'm at, what Wi-Fi network I'm on or if I'm on cellular, it's always the same IP.

27:28.740 --> 27:33.300
So my bookmarks that I've set for all my different dashboards and everything work every time.

27:33.300 --> 27:37.700
And devices only connect after they sign through your existing identity provider.

27:37.700 --> 27:40.420
So you could easily enforce multi-factor authentication

27:40.420 --> 27:42.660
and you can deauthorize the machines you need to.

27:42.660 --> 27:44.500
Maybe an employee has moved on or so forth.

27:45.380 --> 27:51.460
And the fact that my Tailscale VPNs are always on and work with every OS that I use and has

27:51.460 --> 27:56.020
a GUI based ACL editor, well, that's just like icing on the cake.

27:56.020 --> 27:58.420
It's dead simple to use and it's fast.

27:58.420 --> 27:59.620
That's the main reason I liked it.

27:59.620 --> 28:02.580
And I ended up using it every single day.

28:02.580 --> 28:04.500
So go try it for yourself for free.

28:05.140 --> 28:10.100
Up to 20 machines and support the show at tailscale.com slash self-hosted.

28:10.100 --> 28:13.380
That's tailscale.com slash self-hosted, one word.

28:15.540 --> 28:17.460
Hey, Chris, I've got good news.

28:17.460 --> 28:23.300
The NVIDIA Shield, our favorite video player has been updated to Android TV 11.

28:23.300 --> 28:24.820
It has a stadia button now.

28:25.860 --> 28:27.380
Wait, are you serious?

28:27.380 --> 28:30.180
No, I mean, it's apparently called it 95 Google.

28:30.180 --> 28:30.420
Yeah.

28:30.420 --> 28:31.940
Oh, boy.

28:32.660 --> 28:34.260
And they didn't get rid of the ads either.

28:34.260 --> 28:35.540
I went and looked for a screenshot.

28:35.540 --> 28:36.900
Still has the ads on the interface.

28:37.540 --> 28:40.740
That kind of home launcher thing is all money, baby.

28:41.780 --> 28:46.100
You know, I don't know what is going on, but I was trying to watch Deadwood and I have

28:46.100 --> 28:51.700
the NVIDIA Shield in the bedroom and I don't watch TV back there a lot, but I was just for

28:51.700 --> 28:56.100
whatever reason, we were watching TV back there that night and I hit play and I start

28:56.100 --> 28:59.540
watching it and about five minutes in, it starts buffering.

28:59.540 --> 29:01.540
I'm thinking, what the hell's going on here?

29:02.180 --> 29:08.260
So I pull up the Raspberry Pi on, you know, SSH on my phone in my bed, like a lazy bastard,

29:08.260 --> 29:12.660
and I pull up H-Top and sure enough, Plex is chugging away transcoding.

29:13.380 --> 29:19.940
And so I go get the information in the playback and it says that the audio codec is unsupported.

29:19.940 --> 29:24.900
And so it's transcoding the entire thing, even the video, because the audio codec, whatever

29:24.900 --> 29:29.700
it is, I don't know, is unsupported on the Shield, but shockingly, it doesn't have to

29:29.700 --> 29:32.100
transcode it for playback on the Apple TV.

29:32.100 --> 29:37.060
So I can't imagine what codec the Apple TV has that the NVIDIA Shield doesn't, but I

29:37.060 --> 29:41.140
kind of designed my Plex setup to never transcode because I'm doing it on a Pi that's doing

29:41.140 --> 29:42.340
like a thousand other things.

29:43.060 --> 29:47.460
So once it starts transcoding, all bets are off, you know, that TV watching session gets

29:47.460 --> 29:47.960
wrecked.

29:49.220 --> 29:53.620
I think the NVIDIA Shield, we did an episode on it a long time ago, but it is the single

29:53.620 --> 29:58.340
longest running piece of hardware in my entire house, near enough.

29:58.340 --> 30:04.340
I think I've got a UniFi access point and an NVIDIA Shield that all date from 2014,

30:04.340 --> 30:08.100
15, something like that, and I haven't replaced or upgraded either of them.

30:09.140 --> 30:11.620
It's like the Android LTS, right?

30:12.180 --> 30:16.180
I think it helps that it's the same chip that they used in the Nintendo Switch, though.

30:17.540 --> 30:22.420
Yeah, and a couple of NVIDIA devices they sold to OEMs too, so I'm sure they still have

30:22.420 --> 30:25.540
engineers working on drivers and getting Linux running on there.

30:26.580 --> 30:32.980
So I'm keeping mine for now, but I am tempted to replace it because of this codec issue,

30:32.980 --> 30:34.980
although it really hasn't been a problem in the past.

30:34.980 --> 30:38.820
So what would you replace it with, Mr. Apple iOS boy?

30:39.380 --> 30:40.340
Well, what do you think?

30:40.340 --> 30:43.860
I actually think the Apple TV is pretty decent, especially if you only buy these things every

30:43.860 --> 30:48.820
four or five years, and they don't update it very often, so they last about five years.

30:48.820 --> 30:51.940
The performance is better than even the NVIDIA Shield, and that really is saying something.

30:52.900 --> 30:56.980
This isn't supposed to be an exhaustive comparison between the Apple TV and the NVIDIA Shield.

30:56.980 --> 30:59.220
Perhaps we'll save that for a future episode.

30:59.220 --> 31:04.180
But there's a couple of things before I buy one that make me worry a little bit about

31:04.180 --> 31:06.420
doing so, potentially.

31:06.420 --> 31:10.020
Number one is I'll list my use cases and then perhaps you can address them.

31:10.020 --> 31:12.020
Are you talking about the Apple TV or the Shield?

31:12.820 --> 31:17.220
So I'm talking about use cases I have on the Shield that I'm worried I won't be able to

31:17.220 --> 31:19.300
replicate on the Apple TV.

31:19.300 --> 31:19.860
Gotcha.

31:21.300 --> 31:22.900
First of all is iPlayer.

31:22.900 --> 31:29.460
So obviously living in the States and being British, we like to get real TV from the BBC.

31:30.260 --> 31:34.340
And the way we do that is we have a WireGuard VPN that goes into one of my parents' houses

31:34.340 --> 31:41.140
in England, and our IP address is a residential IP, so so far as the BBC are concerned, we

31:41.140 --> 31:45.220
can just stream iPlayer as if we were in that building, and there's no problems there.

31:45.220 --> 31:49.380
Whereas if you were trying to use several commercial VPNs or host something up on Linode

31:49.380 --> 31:55.220
or DigitalOcean or AN other cloud provider, that IP block is kind of blacklisted by the

31:55.220 --> 31:55.780
BBC.

31:56.580 --> 32:02.660
We've also heard stories that they blacklist certain models of Rokus from listeners, so

32:02.660 --> 32:06.820
you know you've got to be really careful about the devices you try and do this on apparently.

32:06.820 --> 32:11.460
So that's number one is how am I going to get a WireGuard tunnel on an Apple TV back

32:11.460 --> 32:12.500
to England?

32:12.500 --> 32:15.620
And then the second one is something like Kodi.

32:15.620 --> 32:21.140
So Kodi, as I'm sure most of our listeners know, is like the jack-of-all-trades, like

32:21.140 --> 32:25.780
if it won't play in Kodi, it's a broken file type video player.

32:26.980 --> 32:32.820
So for me, those two things, Plex and Jellyfin, I'm assuming, are both absolutely fine on

32:32.820 --> 32:33.460
the Apple TV?

32:34.260 --> 32:36.020
Yeah, those are fine.

32:36.020 --> 32:38.580
Those are both really good questions.

32:38.580 --> 32:43.940
I don't really have an answer for you on the WireGuard VPN other than solving that at the

32:43.940 --> 32:49.300
network layer, which I could imagine a couple of tricky ways to do that, but no particularly

32:49.300 --> 32:50.820
great ways to do that.

32:51.860 --> 32:57.140
But I could imagine a routing situation where you're taking care of that at your firewall

32:57.140 --> 32:58.900
or at some other device.

33:00.340 --> 33:01.460
That's the only way I could think of it.

33:01.460 --> 33:07.140
I think you'd probably want to go that route because it's not on the Apple TV.

33:07.140 --> 33:12.740
It's not unheard of to have people route the Apple TV and install third-party apps.

33:12.740 --> 33:20.260
That's been more common on the Apple TV than it is on other iOS devices, but I don't really

33:20.260 --> 33:24.260
find that to be a good long-term way to go because eventually Apple releases an OS that

33:24.260 --> 33:25.540
breaks it every time.

33:26.260 --> 33:30.660
You used to be able to, to your second question, there was a period of time where you could

33:30.660 --> 33:33.220
make an Apple TV a hell of a Kodi box.

33:33.220 --> 33:34.100
It was awesome.

33:34.100 --> 33:38.260
But time moved on, Apple updated the hardware and the OS requirements and that ability went

33:38.260 --> 33:38.760
away.

33:39.860 --> 33:43.620
And I have replaced Kodi with Infuse.

33:43.620 --> 33:45.380
I've mentioned it before on the show.

33:45.380 --> 33:52.820
I think Infuse is the best set top television style interface to video playback.

33:52.820 --> 33:54.580
It's got the best codec support.

33:54.580 --> 33:56.260
It supports Samba shares.

33:56.260 --> 33:57.860
It supports SFTP.

33:57.860 --> 34:00.420
It supports syncing to Plex and Jellyfin.

34:00.420 --> 34:01.940
It supports DLNA.

34:01.940 --> 34:05.300
It supports just attaching a disk and watching files locally.

34:05.300 --> 34:06.580
It's got tons of codecs.

34:06.580 --> 34:08.740
It has a super active development team.

34:08.740 --> 34:13.780
And all respect to the Plex team, they're just focused on making a great video player.

34:14.500 --> 34:17.140
They don't necessarily need to own the back end.

34:17.140 --> 34:20.660
If you want to roll it with a file system, they'll go that way.

34:20.660 --> 34:23.220
If you want to sync it to a Plex server or Jellyfin, they'll go that way.

34:24.020 --> 34:28.820
And so Infuse for me, I even subscribed to the Pro version because I think it's absolutely

34:28.820 --> 34:29.380
worth it.

34:29.380 --> 34:32.980
And I took about a year off from Kodi.

34:32.980 --> 34:36.100
And man, I tell you what, I used to be one of Kodi's biggest fans.

34:36.100 --> 34:41.860
You can find really embarrassing old videos of me on YouTube where I'm really advocating

34:41.860 --> 34:42.580
Kodi.

34:42.580 --> 34:47.540
Actually, man, you can even find videos of me advocating XBMC before it became Kodi.

34:47.540 --> 34:50.580
Like, it's the loyalty runs deep.

34:51.380 --> 34:56.980
I think there are videos of you advocating how to run XBMC on a PlayStation 3 running

34:56.980 --> 34:57.540
Linux.

34:57.540 --> 35:02.820
Back in the day, do you remember DLP televisions, the ones with the reverse projectors?

35:02.820 --> 35:07.460
Yeah, it was 720p, baby.

35:07.460 --> 35:08.260
And we were happy.

35:08.260 --> 35:09.300
God damn it.

35:09.300 --> 35:10.260
Yeah, it was.

35:10.820 --> 35:11.460
It was great.

35:11.460 --> 35:15.300
But I took a year off from Kodi and then I went back to it last month.

35:16.340 --> 35:20.660
And oh, my God, I realized it's just from another era.

35:21.300 --> 35:24.020
Like, I think if you have momentum with it, it's fantastic.

35:24.020 --> 35:30.100
But if you take a year off and then come back to it, we don't design software this way anymore.

35:30.100 --> 35:35.540
And it does all this crazy stuff and it's a lot.

35:35.540 --> 35:40.180
And Infuse, it seems simple at first, it's deceptively simple.

35:40.180 --> 35:44.260
But as you begin to use it, you realize it's very powerful.

35:44.260 --> 35:48.900
And it has a fantastic video playback engine too, which is job one here.

35:48.900 --> 35:54.020
And it's great at jumping around, the just only downside, but if you're a Jellyfin user,

35:54.020 --> 35:54.580
you're used to this.

35:54.580 --> 36:00.260
But if you're a Plex user, I think the only downside is that it doesn't have skip intro,

36:00.260 --> 36:04.020
which I love, but they do not yet support skip intro.

36:04.020 --> 36:05.460
I think it's on the roadmap.

36:05.460 --> 36:10.980
It does have a feature that Plex needs to have, and that is it blurs spoilers.

36:10.980 --> 36:16.340
So when you go into a show and you look at a season, it blurs the episodes you haven't

36:16.340 --> 36:19.540
watched yet, and I can't tell you how great that is.

36:19.540 --> 36:23.380
Whilst you were talking just then, I've actually gone ahead and installed it on the Mac.

36:23.380 --> 36:28.820
I'm recording this on and connected up my Plex library within, what, two minutes?

36:28.820 --> 36:31.220
Yeah, pretty, pretty impressive.

36:31.220 --> 36:35.380
It's doing something now where it's processing my files or something like that.

36:35.380 --> 36:42.100
But I've got a 4K HEVC 10-bit test file that I know is of a very, very high codec, and

36:42.100 --> 36:44.260
it just played instantly on my Mac.

36:44.260 --> 36:48.980
So if you turn on the iCloud sync settings, you can then go install it on your Apple TV,

36:48.980 --> 36:52.980
and all of those directories and stuff will be there on the Apple TV immediately.

36:52.980 --> 36:55.460
It may have to do some scanning, but it's nice like that.

36:55.460 --> 37:02.260
And the thing about the Apple TV is the Apple processors have been really good CPUs for,

37:02.260 --> 37:03.780
what, five years now?

37:03.780 --> 37:07.700
And so even though it doesn't have the latest processor, it's still just about better than

37:07.700 --> 37:11.540
anything else that's shipping in any other set-top box, and that includes power use.

37:11.540 --> 37:15.860
It's a low-power device, too, so it takes less power when I'm running on solar than

37:15.860 --> 37:19.700
the Shield does, which, you know, not a big difference with these devices, but I'll take

37:19.700 --> 37:21.300
every little gain I can get.

37:21.300 --> 37:22.580
Marginal gains, Chris?

37:22.580 --> 37:24.180
Marginal gains?

37:24.180 --> 37:27.220
Marginal gains matter in the solar business.

37:27.220 --> 37:29.220
Yeah, they do.

37:29.220 --> 37:33.460
Well, whilst we're on the topic of media servers, I know we talked about Jellyfin a couple of

37:33.460 --> 37:37.140
episodes ago, mentioned it on LUP as well, I think.

37:37.140 --> 37:41.860
And Bryn, I know you've been building a Jellyfin box for your family.

37:41.860 --> 37:43.380
How's that been going?

37:43.380 --> 37:45.620
Yeah, I finally dove in.

37:45.620 --> 37:51.620
I think I ran out of excuses to try Docker, try my hand at Docker, and Jellyfin was a

37:51.620 --> 37:54.740
nice excuse to do that.

37:54.740 --> 37:58.900
I have to say, I think it's the beginning of a new era for me, which is very exciting.

37:58.900 --> 38:04.020
I mean, you guys are old-hand at this, but Jellyfin itself, I think I've been really

38:04.020 --> 38:04.500
impressed.

38:04.500 --> 38:09.620
It's the first time I really tried to run a centralized media solution.

38:09.620 --> 38:17.380
And in my situation, my brother's in one home and about 90 steps away, I'm in another cabin

38:17.380 --> 38:20.820
and we kind of watch movies back and forth a lot.

38:20.820 --> 38:23.060
But we share network, which is kind of neat.

38:23.060 --> 38:26.900
So I'm able to kind of optimize this thing while they're sitting there watching TV, which

38:26.900 --> 38:28.900
is kind of fun.

38:28.900 --> 38:31.860
But it just opened up a whole new world of possibility for me.

38:31.860 --> 38:36.660
I have always wanted to be able to, I don't know, sit at the dining room table and be

38:36.660 --> 38:41.780
able to put on my favorite album or change to, oh, I feel like jazz now.

38:41.780 --> 38:48.020
And I can see Jellyfin being able to do that because you can sort of tell it to play the

38:48.020 --> 38:49.460
music on a different device.

38:49.460 --> 38:55.620
And these are maybe features that I should have had in my life a long time ago.

38:55.620 --> 38:58.740
Perhaps you two are just laughing at me because I'm late to the game here.

38:58.740 --> 39:02.980
But it sounds and feels really transformative, really.

39:02.980 --> 39:08.020
Well, I'll tell you, I'm curious because I know that we've shared Plex servers with

39:08.020 --> 39:09.780
you for some time now.

39:09.780 --> 39:13.940
So you're pretty well familiar with Plex and how it feels and how it operates in its feature

39:13.940 --> 39:15.460
sets.

39:15.460 --> 39:21.300
How does it feel as a longtime user of Plex switching over to Jellyfin?

39:21.300 --> 39:26.260
Yeah, I think I'm looking at it from a bit of a different perspective now because I'm

39:26.260 --> 39:30.900
looking at it from a bit of a different perspective now because now I'm kind of administering

39:30.900 --> 39:33.300
Jellyfin, which I've never done with Plex.

39:33.300 --> 39:41.860
But as a pure user, and I will say I have much more experience with Plex in that regard,

39:41.860 --> 39:43.420
it doesn't seem quite as polished.

39:43.420 --> 39:47.420
But I could see that it's starting to get there, like occasionally, I mean, I'm now

39:47.420 --> 39:54.740
using the Jellyfin app on my Android phone to browse the interface and then sort of send

39:54.740 --> 39:56.500
that to the TV, right?

39:56.500 --> 39:58.800
So I'm doing things I never did with Plex.

39:58.800 --> 40:06.580
But occasionally, that connection just kind of drops down, like the TV portion of it will

40:06.580 --> 40:09.700
just kind of give a black screen and the interface just goes away.

40:09.700 --> 40:14.660
So I can definitely see some glitches that I've pretty much never experienced with Plex,

40:14.660 --> 40:15.660
I'll say.

40:15.660 --> 40:19.140
Well, inevitably, this is what usually leads someone to just get a set top box that connects

40:19.140 --> 40:24.020
to their TV and you just have a Plex client or a Jellyfin client on that device.

40:24.020 --> 40:30.700
And that's why Alex and I think about this a lot because you just want that to be a really

40:30.700 --> 40:31.700
nice experience.

40:31.700 --> 40:37.020
When you're sitting down, like we were sitting down to watch a movie, and we were all hyped.

40:37.020 --> 40:38.700
It'd been a couple of nights we've been talking about it.

40:38.700 --> 40:46.140
We finally sat down to watch the movie, I hit play, and I had a file error.

40:46.140 --> 40:47.620
And I was able to resolve it quickly.

40:47.620 --> 40:50.820
I figured out what was wrong pretty quick, probably took us about five minutes.

40:50.820 --> 40:55.780
But that is it's so like disruptive because you got you got a whole night going.

40:55.780 --> 41:00.500
It kills the momentum of the entire night for a good five minutes.

41:00.500 --> 41:02.740
And that's a best case scenario.

41:02.740 --> 41:06.580
You know, that's a best case scenario, five minutes, I think it's by far the time of day

41:06.580 --> 41:10.180
you want to least be doing this kind of troubleshooting, right?

41:10.180 --> 41:14.460
That's how I ultimately ended up going with just Apple TV and infuse.

41:14.460 --> 41:15.620
But I like that you're going down this route.

41:15.620 --> 41:17.820
I'm actually kind of more excited that you're playing with Docker.

41:17.820 --> 41:21.580
I think that's going to be really great, too, because that's going to open you up to a world

41:21.580 --> 41:24.260
of trying all kinds of apps.

41:24.260 --> 41:27.140
And those skills will work on any Linux box.

41:27.140 --> 41:32.780
If it's a, you know, laptop, a server, or, you know, a VPS machine, it's the same commands

41:32.780 --> 41:36.260
and tools to install software on all of them.

41:36.260 --> 41:37.980
That sounds really nice.

41:37.980 --> 41:39.960
And I think it's also going to be a huge paradigm shift.

41:39.960 --> 41:44.580
You've both talked about how the day you kind of wrapped your head around Docker, your whole

41:44.580 --> 41:47.180
idea of how to run computers changed.

41:47.180 --> 41:49.300
And I'm really just starting that journey.

41:49.300 --> 41:56.140
For me, it was, as an old IT guy that was doing this for, you know, for years before

41:56.140 --> 41:59.900
we even had anything like containers, I mean, FreeBSD had jails.

41:59.900 --> 42:05.740
But for me, it was finally a real solution to separate my application from my data.

42:05.740 --> 42:09.580
That had always been something that I thought the lines blurred too much when I would set

42:09.580 --> 42:11.100
up a home server.

42:11.100 --> 42:16.540
And with containers, and Docker, I think, is the most widely used container technology.

42:16.540 --> 42:23.180
With containers, I finally had a really solid, reproducible way where I could blow away the

42:23.180 --> 42:24.180
application.

42:24.180 --> 42:29.040
I could completely destroy the container, pull down a fresh one.

42:29.040 --> 42:32.420
If the config was all the same in my Docker Compose, it just reconnects everything.

42:32.420 --> 42:34.220
It starts right back up.

42:34.220 --> 42:39.460
And that was the day I was like, oh, man, this means I can finally move an application

42:39.460 --> 42:40.700
and its data around.

42:40.700 --> 42:47.140
I can pick all the data up off of one server, drop it on a new server, take that Docker

42:47.140 --> 42:51.500
Compose file, pull down the image, and it reconnects like it's always been running on

42:51.500 --> 42:52.500
that box.

42:52.500 --> 42:53.500
It just fires right up.

42:53.500 --> 42:56.740
And it makes disaster recovery such a thing of beauty.

42:56.740 --> 43:00.380
And it makes actually being able to move off of a box so much easier.

43:00.380 --> 43:04.020
So when you need to grow and expand down the road, it's so much simpler.

43:04.020 --> 43:09.980
You know, I was giving this also as a gift to my brother's wife because she loves watching

43:09.980 --> 43:10.980
videos and stuff.

43:10.980 --> 43:13.020
And we don't have the greatest internet connection, as you know.

43:13.020 --> 43:15.780
And so I've been ripping all of her favorite DVDs.

43:15.780 --> 43:17.480
She has just boxes of them.

43:17.480 --> 43:19.420
And so this was a nice gift to give.

43:19.420 --> 43:23.660
But the morning, Christmas morning, I thought, OK, I had stayed up late, you know, putting

43:23.660 --> 43:25.500
a bunch of stuff on there, make sure everything works.

43:25.500 --> 43:32.620
And that morning, for whatever reason, the interface on Jellyfin just stopped working.

43:32.620 --> 43:34.420
I couldn't access it.

43:34.420 --> 43:35.420
I couldn't do anything.

43:35.420 --> 43:39.180
And I thought, oh, this is hard sinking.

43:39.180 --> 43:42.020
And I think Christmas morning is maybe not the time to be troubleshooting.

43:42.020 --> 43:45.060
But what I ended up doing was just, OK, I'm going to start from scratch.

43:45.060 --> 43:48.820
It wasn't that hard to kind of build this thing.

43:48.820 --> 43:53.160
So I'm just going to delete the container and start over again.

43:53.160 --> 43:59.380
And I had that aha moment that you just described, which was brought the container up.

43:59.380 --> 44:03.660
And then everything was identical to the way I had left it, except it was now working.

44:03.660 --> 44:07.560
And that was the lightbulb moment where I was like, oh, not only have I rescued my Christmas

44:07.560 --> 44:12.520
gift, but this is amazing.

44:12.520 --> 44:18.320
And it just then made me realize, OK, I've got to do this everywhere.

44:18.320 --> 44:22.180
There's no way that I don't want to be playing much, much more with this.

44:22.180 --> 44:25.980
I do have a few questions for each of you, though.

44:25.980 --> 44:33.300
I was constantly wanting to use the tools that I've had for many years to try to interact

44:33.300 --> 44:37.400
somehow with, like for troubleshooting, I was like, OK, this thing's not working anymore.

44:37.400 --> 44:38.700
How do I troubleshoot this thing?

44:38.700 --> 44:43.900
And I know it's a whole world, but any like beginner tips on how to interact with these

44:43.900 --> 44:48.460
containers and how to make them easy, I guess?

44:48.460 --> 44:49.460
Right.

44:49.460 --> 44:54.900
I have a web page over at PerfectMediaServer.com, of course, which I'll put a link to in the

44:54.900 --> 45:01.100
show notes, which will hopefully take you through all of the basics of my ethos on why

45:01.100 --> 45:03.900
you should be thinking about using containers.

45:03.900 --> 45:07.140
Largely it's a regurgitation of what Brent just said.

45:07.140 --> 45:11.100
But then throughout the rest of the page, it talks about things like Docker Compose,

45:11.100 --> 45:15.020
where you get your containers from and why and how do you pick one over another and what

45:15.020 --> 45:18.020
about Podman and all those kinds of things.

45:18.020 --> 45:22.820
So if you have a bunch of questions, I would direct you to that page.

45:22.820 --> 45:26.980
I will just say quickly, just to help you get your head around it, like you got to realize

45:26.980 --> 45:28.740
that it's own contained environment.

45:28.740 --> 45:32.860
So if you want to execute a command in there or something like that, you have to use the

45:32.860 --> 45:37.300
Docker command line tools to execute the command inside that container.

45:37.300 --> 45:40.500
The other thing that's kind of nice about Docker Compose, well, there's a lot of ways

45:40.500 --> 45:45.940
to do this, but I think Docker Compose is probably the best way for a new beginner,

45:45.940 --> 45:50.340
is when you launch an app with Docker Compose, you can do Docker Compose up.

45:50.340 --> 45:53.880
And if you don't tell it to otherwise, it'll give you the output on the screen.

45:53.880 --> 45:55.580
And you can sit there and watch the log output.

45:55.580 --> 45:57.140
Oh, that actually sounds really interesting.

45:57.140 --> 45:58.140
Yeah, it's logs.

45:58.140 --> 46:00.340
Really, the key to your answer is you want logs.

46:00.340 --> 46:03.620
So however you have it, whatever tool you're using, you just want to be able to get to

46:03.620 --> 46:04.620
the logs.

46:04.620 --> 46:05.620
That's really what I wanted.

46:05.620 --> 46:06.860
And I had no idea how to get to it.

46:06.860 --> 46:09.620
So I just kind of nuked the whole thing.

46:09.620 --> 46:12.580
And yet, that gave me exactly what I was looking for.

46:12.580 --> 46:14.260
So I don't think that'll be the case every time.

46:14.260 --> 46:16.620
But in this case, it worked nicely.

46:16.620 --> 46:22.180
There is an alias that I use, which I created a long, long time ago called detail, literally

46:22.180 --> 46:26.100
detail slammed together as one word.

46:26.100 --> 46:31.180
And for me, what that does is it prints out the last 50 lines, it tails the last 50 lines

46:31.180 --> 46:33.380
of a container's standard output.

46:33.380 --> 46:34.460
So that's nice.

46:34.460 --> 46:39.740
One thing you'll run into with containers is that not every app logs the standard out

46:39.740 --> 46:40.740
by default.

46:40.740 --> 46:45.540
And so sometimes, you'll look at the logs for that container, and you won't see anything

46:45.540 --> 46:46.820
in the logs.

46:46.820 --> 46:51.180
So you might need to fill that particular application, enable things like debug or error

46:51.180 --> 46:56.260
logging or higher modes, sorry, than error logging, you know, more than warning or info

46:56.260 --> 46:57.260
at those kinds of things.

46:57.260 --> 47:01.740
You need to turn it up to the highest chattiness that it has in the logs.

47:01.740 --> 47:06.860
Some containers that will drive your potty, other containers, it's the bare minimum.

47:06.860 --> 47:13.140
Traffic's a good example of where they don't put enough stuff in the logs that they should.

47:13.140 --> 47:16.860
We've mentioned it on the show before, but as a tool called Dozzle, which will put your

47:16.860 --> 47:22.020
containers logs into a browser, and then you can search through the containers running

47:22.020 --> 47:26.420
on a specific box and look at the logs in a browser, if you want to do it that way as

47:26.420 --> 47:27.420
well.

47:27.420 --> 47:31.820
Well, before we go, I should mention we're doing a meetup at the end of January here

47:31.820 --> 47:32.820
at the studio.

47:32.820 --> 47:36.780
January 30th, it's a Sunday, we'll do a live recording of Linux Unplugged.

47:36.780 --> 47:38.540
And then it's a Hangin' Chow.

47:38.540 --> 47:42.620
I have a birthday around there, so it's kind of a half birthday celebration, but I'm not

47:42.620 --> 47:46.900
making a big deal about that, because I don't want people to think it's a birthday thing.

47:46.900 --> 47:51.460
I did buy some bubbly for you that I hid in the fridge, so there'll have to be a birthday

47:51.460 --> 47:53.100
pop of the cork on that one.

47:53.100 --> 47:55.100
Meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

47:55.100 --> 47:58.780
If you're in the Pacific Northwest or you want to fly in on your private jet, we do

47:58.780 --> 48:03.180
have an airport nearby, you can go there.

48:03.180 --> 48:05.580
Meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting for that.

48:05.580 --> 48:09.780
Also thank you to our subscribers, selfhosted.show slash SRE.

48:09.780 --> 48:13.900
You get some bonus content, you get a post show, and it's ad-free, so thank you for supporting

48:13.900 --> 48:17.260
us and we do have the new network membership.

48:17.260 --> 48:22.620
Jupiter.party, if you want to support, for about the cost of two shows, you want to support

48:22.620 --> 48:25.700
the whole network, you get all the shows.

48:25.700 --> 48:29.020
Plus you get Linux Action News ad-free, it's the only way to do that at Jupiter.party.

48:29.020 --> 48:33.820
I'm really sorry Chris, but I won't be able to fly in on my private jet for your birthday

48:33.820 --> 48:34.820
party.

48:34.820 --> 48:38.500
That's alright, I understand.

48:38.500 --> 48:42.620
We should really fly to you, I mean you're the one with the newborn, and the weather.

48:42.620 --> 48:43.620
It's really our fault.

48:43.620 --> 48:44.620
I do.

48:44.620 --> 48:49.020
You know, you're up in the frozen tundra, up in the north, it's vaguely warm down here

48:49.020 --> 48:50.020
at the moment.

48:50.020 --> 48:55.580
Yeah, it's rough here in Seattle, we're known for our rough winters, that's for sure.

48:55.580 --> 49:00.140
We'd love to get your feedback on content ideas, things we talked about today, great

49:00.140 --> 49:04.300
apps that you're running on your network, something you just self-hosted recently, feedback

49:04.300 --> 49:05.780
on the show, or sponsors.

49:05.780 --> 49:06.780
All of it.

49:06.780 --> 49:08.860
That's selfhosted.show.com.

49:08.860 --> 49:38.700
And thanks for listening everybody, that was selfhosted.show slash 62.
