1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,320
Coming up on Self-Hosted 16, we're getting to some network basics and tips for solid

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:06,560
Wi-Fi connectivity.

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:12,120
Plus, we make the biggest compromise in the history of the show. I'm Alex, I'm Chris,

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,000
and this is Self-Hosted 16.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,320
Hello Alex. Staying sane while staying indoors, I assume?

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,960
Doing my best. Yeah, I realised I haven't actually left this building in four days.

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,880
You're such a nerd though, because you sent me a screenshot of a new home assistant card

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:33,520
you have that tracks your quarantine amount percentage-wise. You were like 99.4% at home.

9
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:41,920
It's QuarantinoMeter. It was on the Home Assistant Reddit page. It uses my Life360 integration

10
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:48,000
to calculate how many hours I've been at home in the last seven days. Turns out I've only

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,280
left the house for three hours in the last seven days, which is fine. I know as a community

12
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:58,320
and as a society, we all need to be doing that. But when you see the data presented

13
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,760
to you, you think, what was I doing for three hours? Okay, I was grocery shopping for somebody

14
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,760
that had just come down from New York, and they were self-isolating. So I was doing a

15
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,800
good thing for the community, and at the time I was out walking my dog. But you think to

16
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:15,880
yourself, well, actually, I could probably do seven straight days. And then here I am

17
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:19,120
on day four, and I'm going slightly mad.

18
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:24,220
I feel like I could do it. I love it. Something about it. For me, it's like, I love being

19
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:29,080
all in there and cozy and working on stuff. Also, it's given me a great chance to hang

20
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,840
out in our new Discord, which has been amazing.

21
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:37,760
Yeah. So we've launched a Discord server. We have unfortunately fallen into the traps

22
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:42,320
of a non-self-hosted chat platform. I know that's what you're thinking.

23
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,740
Within 20 minutes of launching it last week, we already had people giving us a hard time.

24
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:49,400
So we've definitely gotten it. Should we just address why that elephant is in the room?

25
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,800
Because even going back to episode one, I think this is something we flirted with, but

26
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,200
this is the first time we've really, this and maybe Plex.

27
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:02,360
It's like the whole GitHub versus GitLab self-hosted argument of, yes, each organization, each

28
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:08,000
project, whatever, could host their own chat server. You know, a Mattermost, a RocketChat,

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:15,040
an IRC server, whatever it is this week, a matrix thing. But in reality, you have to

30
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,460
go where the communities are. And if you look at the purpose behind why we've launched this

31
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:25,620
Discord server, it's to give people a place to hang out and talk about everything relating

32
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:34,640
to self-hosting. Not necessarily to be a self-hosted platform itself, but it's to enable the community

33
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,380
to grow and, you know, build relationships and stuff like that. And whilst the Telegram

34
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:44,960
group that we have is fantastic with, you know, 1700 people in it and growing still,

35
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:49,920
and Telegram isn't self-hosted either, by the way, conversations and threads get lost

36
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,120
in that number of people sometimes. And I think it's going to be really great for people

37
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,000
to have an area they can come and just talk about a specific topic without blasting it

38
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,360
off to 1700 people every time.

39
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,080
Trenton Larkin Absolutely. We'll have a link in the show notes

40
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:07,320
at self-hosted.show slash 16. And I'll also try to remember to put a link at the top of

41
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:12,020
the website for the Discord. I want to underscore something here because I want to make it clear.

42
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:15,980
It's not a decision Alex and I came to lightly. It's something that he and I have literally

43
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:22,880
been discussing since episode zero when we were just brainstorming. And while we almost

44
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:28,880
always default to self-hosted, it is in a few exceptions where we don't. And there's

45
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:33,520
other areas, too. I'll just admit to it right now. I use Twitter and I use YouTube and I

46
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:40,400
don't like it. I actually don't like it because I don't host them. But that is where the audience

47
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:47,480
is. And I think for a lot of people it's all a balance. Some stuff is really worth going

48
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,880
on to the top of the hill and fighting to your death. And some stuff is just easier

49
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:56,280
to go with the flow and just get collaborating. And I think that if this Discord server leads

50
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:01,200
to more people collaborating and trying out more self-hosted software and technology and

51
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,080
building out more self-hosted infrastructure, then it's a net win.

52
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,240
Trenton Larkin Yeah, couldn't have said it better myself.

53
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:12,440
Let's do some follow up from last episode where we talked about Grossi, the toilet paper

54
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,680
stockpiling inventory management system.

55
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,680
Josh Birk And batteries.

56
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,360
Trenton Larkin And batteries. There is a really cool thing

57
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:23,660
that you can get called Barcode Buddy. So one of the pieces of feedback I had was it's

58
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:29,380
quite laborious to enter all of your stuff into the inventory system. Well, with Barcode

59
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:35,080
Buddy, there's a link in the show notes. With Barcode Buddy, you can actually scan using

60
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:39,400
an app on your phone, the barcodes of, you know, tins of beans and all that kind of stuff

61
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,320
and actually add it to the database that way. So I thought that was pretty cool and worth

62
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,320
sharing with you.

63
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,960
Josh Birk That I actually would do. Not so big on the

64
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:52,560
manual entry, but the old scan and go, I'm okay with that. I think that's a nice little

65
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,880
addition. I love that.

66
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,840
Trenton Larkin Right. Shall we come on to the bad news of

67
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,840
the day?

68
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,840
Josh Birk Okay, I'm ready.

69
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,960
Trenton Larkin It was announced this week that Dark Sky have

70
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,560
been bought by Apple.

71
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,160
Josh Birk Yeah.

72
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,160
Trenton Larkin Sad trombone.

73
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,640
Josh Birk This is a bad one because it's super popular

74
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:15,000
as a tool in the home assistant community. But I've discovered based on the now daily

75
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,480
messages I'm getting from audience members that a lot of other projects are using it

76
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:25,220
too for their backend information. This is an example where a hosted project maybe wasn't

77
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:29,560
the best solution. And I don't know what your answer is here for weather other than it did

78
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:34,160
get me thinking. Is it time for a weather station in the junkyard?

79
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,000
Josh Birk You could easily do it with an ESP8266 board

80
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,440
and you know, maybe $15 worth of parts.

81
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,040
Trenton Larkin Yeah, you think?

82
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,040
Josh Birk Yeah.

83
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,320
Trenton Larkin Okay. All right. Sounds like we got a project

84
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,160
for next time Alex visits Washington.

85
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,600
Josh Birk I've been meaning to do this in my backyard

86
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,800
since I moved here. So I will do it. I will do it.

87
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,560
Trenton Larkin I'd legitimately be interested to see how

88
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,560
it goes.

89
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,560
Josh Birk Don't tempt me.

90
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,280
Trenton Larkin This is a shame though. Apple bought them

91
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:04,680
and you know, it's not unusual for when they make an acquisition like this for them to

92
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:11,340
either shut down or just change the game completely. The good news is if you already have API credentials,

93
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:14,880
it sounds like it's going to remain on until maybe some point in early 2021.

94
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,400
Josh Birk Yeah, that is air quotes good news. New users

95
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,560
cannot get API keys anymore. So even once Apple integrate this into whatever product

96
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:28,800
they have in mind, presumably the weather app, right? They're gonna be doing API calls

97
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:35,000
under the hood anyway. Dark Sky is a paid service. I think I pay 79 pence or $1 a year

98
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,880
or something for Dark Sky access through my phone. It's such a small amount of money that

99
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:44,400
I can't remember exactly how much it is. But you know, the point is, is that Apple could

100
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:52,080
maintain the existing product without necessarily really affecting, in my opinion, whatever

101
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,720
integrations they're trying to do. Now, obviously, I'm not, you know, Scott Federighi. I don't

102
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,960
exactly know what plans they have for it.

103
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,960
Trenton Larkin Craig Federighi.

104
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,560
Josh Birk Oh, Scott Forstall, wasn't it?

105
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,160
Trenton Larkin Yeah. You know, I follow you. I think they

106
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:09,560
would brand it as like iCloud weather or something like that, and then nobody would want it.

107
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,200
I think Apple looked at this and they say, well, this isn't enough money to be worth

108
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:18,520
our time. Let's just keep our competitive advantage. And we'll just internalize it.

109
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:24,400
So not only is it probably not a moneymaker, even at $1, as you say, a year, or a month,

110
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:29,680
whatever. I think that combined with the competitive nature of them being the exclusive holder

111
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,360
of this information is probably worth it. I mean, for me, the thing I loved about Dark

112
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,560
Sky was that super hyper local rain information. As you can imagine here in the Pacific Northwest,

113
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,560
I check that thing daily.

114
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,000
Josh Birk Almost like it rains a lot where you are.

115
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,680
Trenton Larkin Almost like that.

116
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,100
Josh Birk One time I stood outside a pub in London with

117
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:50,360
some colleagues and I got Dark Sky out and we were having a pint stood outside. You know

118
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,360
how it is in London. If you've been there, there's the little tape on the floor. You

119
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,960
have to stand inside. And so we were stood just outside the tape, outside the canopy,

120
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:02,420
and it started to absolutely throw it down. And I said to people, right, this rain is

121
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:07,280
going to last for three more minutes. Three minutes later, it stopped. Bang. Dead on.

122
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,880
Trenton Larkin Yep. Same thing. I was at a meetup and we

123
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:13,200
were eating outside and we checked Dark Sky. Is it worth going inside? Because there was

124
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:17,640
really no tables. What would we do? Look at Dark Sky. Yep, it's worth going inside. It's

125
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:21,720
going to be raining for an hour. It was really nice. While we're still on the Home Assistant

126
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:26,000
topic, what are you going to do in Home Assistant to replace Dark Sky? What is do you have an

127
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
option right now?

128
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Josh Birk I don't know. I'm hoping to solicit feedback

129
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,960
from the audience. Quite honestly, self hosted dot show slash contact.

130
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,160
Trenton Larkin While we're still in follow up and on the

131
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:40,340
topic of Home Assistant, the last episode, I think it was, you made a very, very strong

132
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:44,900
pitch for me to switch to what I refer to as has IO, which is just now Home Assistant.

133
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:51,120
But it's the whole OS stack, where you get the supervisor with official add ons and third

134
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,480
party add ons. And then it's very easy to add hacks, the Home Assistant community store,

135
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:00,100
and get even more integrations. And you really kind of piqued my interest when we did a live

136
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:04,500
stream. And I thought to myself, I got to do this at some point. It all went south though,

137
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:10,140
when my Raspberry Pi Raspbian install started kicking up a bunch of errors, package errors,

138
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:15,560
about the Linux image package, which that sounds really bad. It also kicked up a bunch

139
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:20,800
of errors about my time zone information. And I just don't think it's going to survive

140
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,620
a reboot. So I thought, well, I recognize the problem better do something about it.

141
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:32,580
So I bought another Raspberry Pi four. Only this time, I put Ubuntu 2004 LTS on that sucker.

142
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:40,060
And it's running from an external SSD, not off the SD card. It screams, screams, Alex,

143
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:44,100
I can't believe the performance I'm getting on this thing. Everything's faster. And then

144
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:49,340
what I did is I grabbed Home Assistant's installation script. And I ran that on top of 2004. It

145
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:53,260
pulled down all the containers after I had Docker set up. And now I'm essentially running

146
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:58,160
what I would have traditionally called has IO with custom themes. I got hacks installed,

147
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:05,020
I got everything reset up. And really, it wasn't as bad as I was expecting. I drove

148
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:11,260
home dreading this because my Home Assistant setup works so well. And it is actually responsible

149
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:15,140
for quite a few things. Now. I was dreading it. You told me it wouldn't be so bad. And

150
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:20,060
you were right. Thank you. Two tricks I'd like to impart upon the audience. The thing

151
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:25,280
I was most concerned about was moving over my Z wave devices. I have some Zigbee and

152
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:31,760
Z wave devices that I use for temperature, light, motion, security, base data is battery

153
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:36,900
based at it's like all kinds of Z wave devices, and outdoor plugs. And I just didn't know

154
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:43,180
like what what how do you move a Z wave network over. But I shut down the old Docker images

155
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:48,220
of my old Home Assistant core install, export it out or went in on the file system grabbed

156
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:54,340
all of the Z wave configs. I shut down the Home Assistant install and has IO move those

157
00:10:54,340 --> 00:11:00,240
Z wave configs over inside the container, and then plugged in the adapter started it

158
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,460
up and all of the devices just moved with the controller and all started reporting they

159
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:09,940
lost all their names. So I had to rename everything which was a real chore figuring out what was

160
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:14,980
what? Let me tell you. That can be a pain in the ass. Yep. Yeah, yeah, it was. So one

161
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:18,660
of my tricks was is I just cranked the heat in the room and then just waited to see which

162
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:25,740
one registered. So that was the other room. I opened all the windows. It was a mess. And

163
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:30,180
then the HomeKit devices were particularly hard because once they're paired with something

164
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:35,140
that can't be repaired with and a lot of them just have a general reset defaults. They don't

165
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:38,740
have a way to unpair them by holding down keys. So I had to go around to the HomeKit

166
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:45,460
smart plugs, reset them, rejoin them to my phone, then remove them from HomeKit and then

167
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:52,960
add them to Home Assistant one by one. So I got rid of those. Now, I will say last thing,

168
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,260
if you want a really easy smart plug that isn't something you have to flash, I still

169
00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:01,140
think the TP links were a good purchase because they were automatically all redetected. And

170
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:05,180
the names I had given them were actually written to the device. So they all showed up with

171
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:10,020
the names I had from the old Home Assistant install, auto populated, clicked right in.

172
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:15,020
The easiest part was the TP link. And they're the smaller ones that only take up one plug.

173
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,860
I think if you're going to get a smart plug that isn't something you reflash, that's still

174
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:22,500
the one to get. Just works immediately with Home Assistant. It does require an app.

175
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:27,340
You know, it's even better than the TP link ones. This is a point where I talk about Tasmota

176
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,340
again.

177
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,900
No, you're right.

178
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:35,320
When I rebuilt my Home Assistant instance, the DNS name that I use for my MQTT server

179
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:39,740
meant that I didn't even have to reconfigure the plugs. It just picked up the MQTT server

180
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:40,740
again and

181
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:46,740
Oh, that's even better. You're right. See, what I appreciate about the TP links is I

182
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:51,260
could get them in two packs for like $35 from Amazon. And then they just plug in. You use

183
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:54,340
the app once to configure them. You never have to use the app again after they're on

184
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,340
your network, though.

185
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:56,340
Yeah, it's not too bad.

186
00:12:56,340 --> 00:13:00,140
It's not too bad. But one day that app will probably go away.

187
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:03,740
Yep, it will. Don't know when, but it will.

188
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:08,540
Yeah. In the meantime, it's not so bad. Just how I'm on the fence like with those kinds

189
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:09,540
of things.

190
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:14,860
You know, I think there is a real value in doing a Nuke and Pave. When it's a new thing

191
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:20,760
like Home Assistant, it's relatively new. I think back to my early days with Windows

192
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:28,220
of Linux of even Mac OS, the way I used to learn the most was when I was rebuilding those

193
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:32,120
systems, rebuilding those automations, whatever it might be.

194
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:36,860
It's like a trail. You're re-stamping down the grass and the weeds. You're making that

195
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:42,060
trail. You're working it in. It took me, what, a week or two the first time, and it took

196
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:48,100
me an evening this time. Maybe it's not 100% done, but in other ways, I have more functionality

197
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:53,580
now with the add-on store hacks. Now I have snapshots, themes.

198
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:59,020
Additionally, this time around, I thought, well, why not set it up more with their Nebuchadnezzar,

199
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:06,320
the Home Assistant online services. I decided, let's turn on the Echo integration. I'd never

200
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,320
done that before.

201
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:12,860
Jason Valee It's pretty great. I can kick off automations

202
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:19,660
and scripts via the Echo. Now that's money. If I say Echo, run bed time, which we call

203
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:24,740
last call, from anywhere, and then I can say Echo, good morning, and it just, from anywhere,

204
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:30,300
it's really nice. Via the Echo, I can set brightness levels. So I can just say Echo,

205
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,300
set kitchen strip to 10%.

206
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:34,220
Jason Valee Again, that speaks to the whole...

207
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:37,900
Jason Valee...compromise. Yeah, it's a compromise that those things are not self-hosted. They

208
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:46,300
are reliant upon Amazon and Google and Apple to some extent, and for me, an internet connection

209
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:50,260
as well, which is not always guaranteed. But the way I look at it is that remote control

210
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:57,380
is just the beginning. If you can turn something on and off remotely, that then opens the door

211
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:01,900
to be able to link it in with all the other devices, and this is why, in my opinion, Home

212
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:08,580
Assistant is doing such a great job. It allows a single entity, a single instance where it's

213
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:14,420
just got a record of everything that's in your house or in your RV or whatever, and

214
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:18,620
it's all in one place and it's all aware of what everything else is doing, and then you

215
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:24,820
can kick off automations based on that. For example, in my garage, I have a light switch

216
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:29,380
with Shelly in it. Shelly is the thing we talked about a few weeks ago that is a smart

217
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:34,060
switch kind of like add-on. This is the size of like an Oreo cookie and goes inside the

218
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,060
light box.

219
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,860
Right, turns any regular switch into a smart switch.

220
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:43,380
Correct. And then I have on a separate light circuit, a separate pair of lights in the

221
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:47,660
back half of my garage so that I would normally have to walk over to the far side of the garage

222
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:53,180
and flick a separate individual switch that's on a completely different circuit. But because

223
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:57,940
these two lights are on the same Home Assistant instance, I can flick one switch and I have

224
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:02,680
an automation that's always listening for a state change. And if either of those switches

225
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:08,460
gets toggled, it knows to turn the other one off as well. And once you start thinking about

226
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:14,220
how you can convert dumb switches into smart switches, oh boy.

227
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:19,180
Very much so. And I also kind of look at the Echo stuff and even the Nebuchadnezzar or

228
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:26,160
whatever it's called, remote integration as layers on top of a core. And if that were

229
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:31,900
to go away, no big deal. I have a tablet mounted to the wall. That's actually my main control

230
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:35,640
for my Home Assistant is the tablet mounted to the wall, not the Echo.

231
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,260
What do you use? Is it the Fire?

232
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:43,900
Yeah, I know a lot of people will like reflash it or set up in kiosk mode. I find none of

233
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:48,180
that necessary. I just got one app to keep the screen on all the time. And then I just

234
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:52,420
open the browser in full screen mode and just leave it up. And it works all the time.

235
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:57,540
As you see in the latest Home Assistant update, 1.0.7 is the latest version, there is a new

236
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:04,260
dashboards feature. So you can actually have different home screens for different devices,

237
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:10,460
not different pages. It's like a different kind of interface all based off the same Home

238
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:11,460
Assistant instance.

239
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:15,380
That's definitely something I'm going to take advantage of because there's an interface

240
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:20,340
that works well on that tablet, but that doesn't necessarily look good on my desktop browser.

241
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:23,720
Yeah, tablet, you want big fat buttons for your big fat fingers.

242
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,220
That's exactly what I did.

243
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:28,340
On a desktop, you want tiny little toggles because you have a mouse, right?

244
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:34,080
I did exactly that. I did really big buttons with sliders and just to make it really easy

245
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:39,180
for one spot for them to touch. And then I did like individual smaller toggles for myself

246
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:43,100
and using like the new temperature cards and stuff like that, that all look very nice.

247
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:46,940
So visually to the family, it looks like dad just did a big upgrade to the thing that they

248
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:47,940
use.

249
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,540
Good job, Chris. Well done. Nice effort.

250
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:55,660
Little do they know, I was like, oh, God, I don't know if I'm going to pull this off.

251
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:59,300
But I'm glad I did it now. And I'll be playing around more with the stuff that's built into

252
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:05,940
it. One of the things that works significantly better with this load is my Wyze cams. I pull

253
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:11,500
the RTSP feeds into picture elements or media elements into Home Assistant. I just have

254
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:17,900
one security tab where I can get a real time feed of all of my Wyze cams. Works much better

255
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:22,860
with the new load. That is unless I take advantage of this new firmware they've released.

256
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:27,420
Yes, with the new work from home movement that seems to be gripping the world by storm

257
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:31,900
right now, Wyze have enabled a webcam mode.

258
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:36,540
This is a weird one, but it involves manually installing a firmware onto your Wyze camera

259
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:42,900
like you would to get RTSP support. And then after that, the Wyze camera no longer communicates

260
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:48,140
with the Wyze app. It just stops talking to their cloud servers. But you can plug it in

261
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:53,380
to your machine and it'll power it over the USB port and act as a USB web camera for them

262
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,380
Zoom calls you're making.

263
00:18:54,380 --> 00:19:01,100
You know, I have a top tip if you want a webcam. Probably don't use your Wyze cam. Go to eBay

264
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:04,780
and buy a Logitech C920 for $40 used.

265
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:08,860
Yes, great tip. The nice thing about that, too, although probably the Wyze as well, is

266
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:14,380
that it does H.264 encoding in the camera. So it takes less CPU load, which is always

267
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:19,300
a good thing and still a pretty good picture. I don't think this is something I would use,

268
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:23,780
but I do appreciate the flexibility of these $25 cameras. That's kind of fun.

269
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:27,340
Well, I'll tell you what's great. My wife is a music teacher and she's had to convert

270
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:32,380
all of her students and teach them through Skype or Zoom or FaceTime or whatever. And

271
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:37,300
her iPad is getting a real workout at the moment. And if for any reason that went down

272
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:42,900
and stopped working or whatever and then one of the three laptops I have in the house stops

273
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:48,420
working and then one of the three other webcams I have in the house stopped working, then

274
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:52,020
I might use a Wyze cam as a webcam.

275
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,660
And you decide not to just do it from your phone for some reason, which probably has

276
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,660
a better camera.

277
00:19:55,660 --> 00:20:01,380
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. There's a lot that would have to break in my house before I got to

278
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:04,220
the Wyze cam, but it's not the case for everybody.

279
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:11,360
However, if you just want to buy one $25 camera, it will do it all, which is, I guess, nice.

280
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:15,500
We have not dug a lot into home networking yet, but it's something Alex and I are talking

281
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:20,220
a lot more about. So we thought we'd cover a little bit of home networking basics today.

282
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:24,260
With this whole working from home business, there's been a lot of calls appeared in my

283
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:29,260
calendar of people that normally work in an office that are missing that kind of social

284
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:32,820
contact. Now, for those of you that don't know, I work from home 100% anyway. So for

285
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:38,620
me, not a huge amount has changed on my day to day, besides obviously the world ending.

286
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:43,380
And I think that listening to a lot of these people, you know, quote unquote normies talking

287
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:50,060
about Wi-Fi and firewalls, and I've just referred to other Red Hatters as normies, didn't I?

288
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:56,820
I know. I just love where this is going. Now, to bail you out a little bit, 100% of my meetings

289
00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:02,380
this week have people working from home dealing with Wi-Fi trouble. And then people like going

290
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:06,360
from the nice room that they've set up where they've cleaned up behind them to like progressively

291
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,940
having to just move closer and closer to the router. And pretty soon they're like just

292
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:12,660
in their closet so they can make the call work. Let's preface everything I'm about to

293
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:19,240
say about Wi-Fi with the caveat that a wire is always better, significantly better for

294
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:23,860
real time video calls as well. The machine I'm doing this call with you wired in right

295
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:29,300
now, I would never do this without it being wired in. And so you have this initial spot

296
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:33,600
with a lot of people's home networks where the Wi-Fi network just by its very nature

297
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:38,420
because it's radio isn't as solid. And so that right there introduces problems regardless

298
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:42,380
of the rest of the network infrastructure on your LAN or your internet connection.

299
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:50,540
Yes. And another thing that a lot of people don't think about is the ISP provided routers

300
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:55,940
often have Wi-Fi hotspots built into them. You know, your ISP will rent you a router

301
00:21:55,940 --> 00:22:00,980
or sell you a router or maybe just give you one for the duration of your contract. And

302
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:06,720
quite often they are what's called a combination device. They do all the routing into and out

303
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:13,680
of your network. So every webpage that you visit, your traffic goes through that firewall

304
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:18,760
outbound. And then when you request that webpage to come back, it comes inbound through your

305
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:24,740
firewall that way and then out through the Wi-Fi that's also in the same device. So sometimes,

306
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:29,220
especially when you have a house full of, I don't know, half a dozen children and, you

307
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:33,900
know, a dog and everybody that wants to stream Netflix all at the same time, you can end

308
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:38,420
up quite quickly in a situation where the routing tables in these devices, they're very,

309
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:45,460
very cheaply made Chinesium type routing devices and they don't have a lot of memory in them,

310
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:50,860
a lot of these cheap ones. And very quickly you can exhaust the tables that they have

311
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:55,700
available that will fit in their memory. And that can manifest itself in a number of different

312
00:22:55,700 --> 00:23:04,640
ways, poor performance, slow latency, pages just not loading for no reason, crash, crashes.

313
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:09,580
One of the things that I did probably four or five years ago that's helped my Wi-Fi experience

314
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:18,100
the most more than anything else was to separate my ISP modem or my router from the Wi-Fi hotspots

315
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:24,100
that I use for everything else. Now, I will also say that putting everything I possibly

316
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:29,300
can on an ethernet cable helps a lot as well. You know, like my Nvidia Shield is on ethernet,

317
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:36,300
my PlayStation 4, my 3D printer is on an ethernet cable, all of my desktops, my laptop is on

318
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:41,820
Wi-Fi 90% of the time, but at my desk where I spend most of my day, there is an ethernet

319
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:49,340
cable there ready for it. So if I can avoid Wi-Fi, I will. But sometimes you just can't,

320
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:51,900
you know, with a phone or a tablet, for example.

321
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:58,180
Or in my situation where we have ethernet everywhere in the studio, I go to the RV,

322
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:03,480
I can't run ethernet at all. It's just literally not an option. And so I have to have extremely

323
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,700
robust Wi-Fi.

324
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:09,860
And so by separating out the firewall from the Wi-Fi, that gives you a few benefits.

325
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:14,980
Firstly, if you have to reboot the router, all of the devices in your house will maintain

326
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:19,660
their Wi-Fi connection. Chromecasts won't decide that they need to now turn into a hotspot

327
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:24,260
and take a few minutes to figure out that the Wi-Fi is available again. But the same

328
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:29,460
is true conversely as well. If there's a problem with your Wi-Fi, you can reboot just the access

329
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:34,900
point and then your internet connection will stay completely stable and solid.

330
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:40,220
So there's a few benefits to doing it. And the company that I've used for the longest

331
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:43,940
time now is Ubiquiti, who make the UniFi line of devices.

332
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:48,100
I think probably most people listening at this point must be familiar with Ubiquiti.

333
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:54,580
They are extremely popular in our segment. And I think the number one thing I've heard

334
00:24:54,580 --> 00:25:00,240
is they have really sophisticated management. And generally, there's just the one downside

335
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:05,180
brought up and that is the controller software. But even that doesn't necessarily sound like

336
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:08,100
it's the end of the world. You just have to be willing to host an application and it has

337
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,820
to be able to talk to the internet.

338
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:14,060
I was talking to somebody on the Ubiquiti broadcasting telegram just this afternoon

339
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:19,660
about hosting the UniFi controller out of a Docker container. Linux server obviously

340
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:26,780
make one and I've used that for years and it just works. Now I have two, I've just recently

341
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:33,060
added actually a third access point in my house. And all of these devices talk back

342
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:38,040
to a UniFi controller that's running on a DigitalOcean droplet. So it's not even running

343
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:43,380
in my house. I wrote a blog post last week, which there'll be a link to in the show notes,

344
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:49,060
about how to adopt an access point, a new access point with a remote controller. Now

345
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:52,900
for most people, they're going to be running their UniFi controller on a Raspberry Pi inside

346
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,740
the firewall or...

347
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:55,740
In a container.

348
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:59,260
Yeah, something like that. And it's not going to be an issue. It's just going to appear

349
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:05,260
through magic in the controller. You can adopt it and then configure it that way. It gives

350
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:10,620
you a lot of flexibility in some ways. It did feel, I will admit the very first time

351
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:16,740
that I did it, like a bit of a, why do I need, why can't I just go to the IP address of the

352
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:21,500
access point and do it that way? That's the way I've always done it before. But the advantage

353
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:27,540
of having a centralized configuration system is that if for any reason I need to reload,

354
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:32,500
I can back up all my configurations to that central system, wipe the access point and

355
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:36,780
then just reload the configuration from there. And what it's meant is that I've had now a

356
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:43,920
stable Wi-Fi configuration and network that's transcended four, five different houses, multiple

357
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:50,380
different ISPs. And that's another point I didn't actually bring up is if you separate

358
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:57,620
your Wi-Fi from the ISP provided router, every time you change ISPs, if you move house or

359
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:02,580
whatever, you don't have to reconfigure all your Wi-Fi devices. You've still got the same

360
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:03,580
SSID, the same password.

361
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:08,700
So I've got a couple of questions for you. Are they aware of each other essentially?

362
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:13,080
Do they balance their signal because they're aware of each other's location? Is that also

363
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:17,240
a benefit of the centralized controller? I had presumed it was when I had seen enterprise

364
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:20,580
deployments. Is that true in home deployments as well? Or is it not really applicable for

365
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:21,580
you?

366
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:26,420
I don't know if that's because of the centralized controller, but the Unifi gear itself does

367
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:30,860
have this zero handoff feature, which allows me to roam between different access points

368
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:37,220
in the building. And I just don't know slash care which particular access point I'm connected

369
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,220
to right now.

370
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:40,700
Yeah. So have you tested the performance of it?

371
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:48,780
Yes. Yes, a lot. I use that Libre Speed app running on the server in my basement to test

372
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:52,700
the throughput of the Wi-Fi. And I actually identified that one of the ethernet ports

373
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:58,740
on my Unifies was slightly dodgy through that. And I used a bit of hot glue to really jam

374
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:04,540
the cable in there and keep it there. And so I went from sort of round about 100 megabits

375
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:09,220
on that one up to pretty much full gigabit speed, not through Wi-Fi.

376
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:14,780
The reason I asked, and I think this is really important to underscore, is I've been to Buddy's

377
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:20,780
houses, I've been to a shop, and I've had one set up here in the studio that are all

378
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:30,620
Unifi Wi-Fi networks. And in those three anecdotal experiences in which I have gone to, I had

379
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:36,140
some of the worst Wi-Fi experiences like devices not connecting, horrible performance. And

380
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:39,980
I think what it just sort of underscores is if the rest of your network isn't really up

381
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:44,380
to shape, it doesn't matter what access points you put in. So like for these guys, their

382
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:47,940
DHCP server was running on a piece of crap that was so slow that it would time out before

383
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:50,700
you know you can get an IP. So that was the issue on one of them.

384
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:55,780
There's other aspects to a network that make it... It's not just the access points, but

385
00:28:55,780 --> 00:29:00,700
I do think that it is more important than ever that Wi-Fi be as close to wire grade

386
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:01,700
as possible.

387
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:07,940
So I don't care whether you use Ubiquiti, Microtech, whoever. It really doesn't bother

388
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:14,340
me whatsoever. The point is that you separate the Wi-Fi from the firewall. And that will

389
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:19,980
in itself just enable easier troubleshooting. It will also mean, like I just said, that

390
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:23,300
you can transcend different houses with the same Wi-Fi gear.

391
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:27,080
Right. And the nice thing about the Ubiquiti gear is that's easy for you to do. And it's

392
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:31,860
not so easy with a lot of the mesh solutions that are out there now, like the Google one

393
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:37,100
and the D-Link one and the Eero one, which I've had good success with, but it wants to

394
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,100
be a router.

395
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:42,380
Now in the Eero solution, you don't have to use it as your main firewall slash router,

396
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:47,820
but in some of these you do. And I very much like Alex, am a big proponent of separating

397
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:53,940
those two tasks. I actually reboot my firewall on a somewhat regular basis because I'm often

398
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:58,300
switching between multiple networks. And I just want to clear things out every now and

399
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:03,860
then. And it takes like 15 seconds to reboot this little slate that I have. And so I just

400
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:09,580
toss off a reboot. And I know that all my... What? You like tossing off a reboot? You like

401
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:12,860
that? I toss off a reboot from here to there.

402
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:15,540
Tossing off in England is slang for...

403
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:21,380
I know what it's slang for. I just wasn't going to call it out. So I toss off a reboot

404
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:26,740
and I just wait a few seconds and the device is reconnected and everything's good. That's

405
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:27,740
my pro tip.

406
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,460
Who doesn't enjoy a good toss off?

407
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:35,500
No, especially when it's a reboot. It just feels good. So there's definitely some solid,

408
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:39,000
solid rationale for separating those two devices. So if you are looking at some of those mesh

409
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:44,220
networks that do offer some nice advantages, just be wary of that. Separate those functions

410
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:45,220
if you can.

411
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:49,780
There's a huge amount of stuff that if you want to hear about, let us know through selfhosted.show

412
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:56,180
slash contact or find me on Twitter at ironicbadger. And let us know if you want to hear more about

413
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:59,620
the UniFi. There's a bunch of features in there which we could cover.

414
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:03,300
Yeah, I would like to get that feedback because we are definitely not done talking about this.

415
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:07,660
We want to talk about switches and firewalls soon. So it's your chance to get your feedback

416
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:12,260
in the Discord. That'd be a great spot to just engage with us on this. And it's a spot

417
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:15,920
not only are we watching really closely, but where we could kind of have a ongoing conversation

418
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,980
about it. So be sure to join us there.

419
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:23,060
I need to upsell you on PFSense or OpenSense or one of these others.

420
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:25,820
You think you could run on a Pine64 board?

421
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:26,820
You're a madman.

422
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:30,860
I know, I just ordered one and I'm trying to think of, you know that thing's got a PCI

423
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:31,860
slot, Alex.

424
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:32,860
Ooh.

425
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:36,620
Yeah, I know. And I know if I'm thinking about it, thinking about it. But let's wrap up today

426
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:40,340
by spending a little time talking about a really cool app you can load on your rig to

427
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:45,260
get really good information. In fact, you can even use it to monitor multiple, it's

428
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:49,860
called NetData and it's a Westpane special. He loads it on all of our systems here at

429
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:50,860
the studio.

430
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:57,100
If you've never tried it, netdata.cloud, it's kind of amazing. So it provides real time

431
00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:02,140
metrics of pretty much everything that's going on in your system. And it's really quite

432
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:05,320
beautiful. It just runs in the background. You won't even know it's there. It uses very

433
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:10,140
little resources. But if you want to know, for example, which of your hard disks is being

434
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:16,180
completely trashed right now and causing your machine to stutter, load up this NetData thing,

435
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:19,360
go and look at the disk IO section and you'll figure out, oh, it's this one over here. Maybe

436
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:23,980
I need to move this workload over here or do something else with it.

437
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:27,860
You can also monitor network traffic. It's a really good way to test, you know, you'll

438
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:32,080
see quite often in Linus tech tip videos, they're monitoring network speed through an

439
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:37,220
unraid server and they're using NetData to do it. So there's a lot of different use cases

440
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:40,940
for this software and it comes highly recommended.

441
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:46,100
Like you said, it is also very pretty, which I appreciate the way it visualizes everything.

442
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:48,860
We keep it running here on the systems like I was talking about. And it's just a nice

443
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:53,620
way to just check in on the health of them to get an idea of what the workload is. And

444
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:58,420
you will spot weird problems watching these graphs. You will notice something's taken

445
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:04,180
a long time to wait on X. Maybe it's like Alex was saying, a disk. I found what seemed

446
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:10,980
to be a wonky Nick. And how about that? A wonky Nick. And we replaced it and it immediately

447
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:15,580
looked better. It just was one of those things you could immediately visualize the improvement.

448
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:19,100
And that's kind of cool too. Plus it stores all that stuff and then you can add your other

449
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:22,880
rigs in there and switch between them. I don't think it stores them on their servers. It's

450
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,460
all local. So they all have to be able to have access to the internet if you want to

451
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:26,820
be able to jump around.

452
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:30,780
It's all local. Yeah. Do you want to know the icing on the cake though? What is that?

453
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:35,500
I discovered a Home Assistant integration for it. Stop it. Link it up. I got to see

454
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:43,420
that. It's in the show notes. No, no, no, no way. So you could run net data on all of

455
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:48,260
your pies and then have it show up various stats in Home Assistant about each of those

456
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:56,100
pies. I do run it on my pies. So I will be doing this. That's great. Home Assistant is

457
00:33:56,100 --> 00:34:02,220
so awesome. This is ultimately why I had to go to the more HaasIO style setup because

458
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:07,660
I realized there's such a great community around it and it's just getting better. And

459
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:10,580
so you got to have access to all these cool things people are doing and that's just the

460
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:11,580
best way to get it.

461
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:17,900
Absolutely. Now I was on Reddit this week and I saw a post about somebody saying, everything's

462
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:23,380
gone. All of my stuff is gone. And they'd accidentally exposed one of their services

463
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:27,980
to the internet and some bad actor had come along and deleted all their media. Oh, that's

464
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:34,220
so sad. Now we have an Ask SSH question from Seb Couture. Did I get that right, do you

465
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:38,300
reckon? Let's say yes. I don't know why I'm asking you. You're horrible at pronouncing

466
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:43,740
stuff. Yeah. I would have said SebCulture or something. And Seb writes in on Twitter,

467
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:49,420
would you open your Home Assistant behind a reverse proxy? Is it safe? What do you think?

468
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:55,660
Well my previous answer was no. And then this time I signed up for the Home Assistant cloud,

469
00:34:55,660 --> 00:35:00,500
which is not quite what he's talking about, but it is a form of remote access.

470
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:05,740
That security through obscurity though almost with the URL's really long string of random

471
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:06,740
characters.

472
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:12,860
Yes, it is. And then you have to have authentication and there's those elements to it. And I opted

473
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:17,820
to do it this time. In the past I required like a wire guard connection to get to it.

474
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:20,720
And I think you've kind of opted to do the same, haven't you? You've set up a reverse

475
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:26,180
proxy for yours. So you have kind of made that same sort of call. Again, it's a compromise.

476
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:32,500
I run a few apps on my reverse proxy, which are public and internet facing, but they all

477
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:40,180
have at minimum some kind of authentication. The mistake the guy made on Reddit was that

478
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:45,380
he had no password for anything set. So if you just guessed the URL or the port number

479
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:51,060
correctly, you could log in and delete whatever you wanted with no password.

480
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:56,060
I don't think I would expose any of my media server or media collection applications to

481
00:35:56,060 --> 00:36:01,460
the web. I would only expose applications that are explicitly designed to have public

482
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:05,540
facing features. And I know that just because some of these apps are web apps, it seems

483
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:09,260
like they're designed for that, but they're not. They should only be used on your LAN,

484
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:11,420
I think, or with a VPN.

485
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:15,980
Right. And that was going to be my point, you know, with WireGuard making it into the

486
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:24,220
Linux kernel now, which is amazing, incredible. There's no real excuse these days. And perhaps

487
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:29,700
when we talk about firewalls in an episode or two, we'll talk about why I switched to

488
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:36,020
OpenSense and what that has to do with WireGuard. But I think, you know, once you're on the

489
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:42,980
VPN, it's so easy to pretend with DNS or whatever that you're on your LAN anyway. I mean, maybe

490
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:47,940
five years ago it was different, but nowadays with WireGuard, it's so easy. I don't really

491
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:51,860
see any excuse to open much to the internet anymore.

492
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:56,980
I look forward to talking more about networking. That's been Self-Hosted 16, and we'll see

493
00:36:56,980 --> 00:37:10,300
you on Discord.
