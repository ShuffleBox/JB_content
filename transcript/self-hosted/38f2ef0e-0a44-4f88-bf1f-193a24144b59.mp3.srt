1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
Rumor has it a new TV has showed up in the Alex household a wild LG appeared. Oh, really?

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,480
Did you happen to get one that has a web OS and home kit? I certainly did

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,560
Yeah, I remember when I was at palm I think had web os back in the early days

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,080
And LG bought it and everyone was like what they're going to do with this

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,160
And then they turned it into I think one of the best smart TV interfaces around

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,600
I've only tried it in a limited capacity, but I was pretty impressed

7
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,240
it's it's actually

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,280
I would say good enough that you might not even need a set top box hooked up to it

9
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:36,560
Are you going to keep your shield hooked up? So I have the shield right now and uh Brent is staying with me right now

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:43,680
And we watched uh last night. So this this is um, let me rewind a little bit. This is an LG C9 OLED TV

11
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,080
Last year, um, I was looking at buying a new TV after I emigrated

12
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:53,120
and I was looking at the OLEDs really closely, but they were they were about three thousand dollars, which is

13
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,160
Let's let's be fair. That's a lot of money for a TV

14
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:02,960
um, then the black friday deal started coming through for this year about a week ago and I was on slick deals and

15
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,280
Best Buy came up with the

16
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,520
LG OLED for about two thousand one hundred dollars, which is again still a lot

17
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,040
And then another deal came up on ebay. That was like seventeen hundred and I was like, oh

18
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,040
Okay, now we're talking. It's got super fast

19
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,760
processor in it because

20
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,760
you know i'm coming from the shield which

21
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:28,880
That thing hardly ever stutters like it's just ridiculously overpowered for what it's trying to do

22
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:35,120
It's the set top box performance benchmark. It really is. Maybe maybe the apple tv is is parallel to it

23
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:39,440
But it's very good. But the thing about the shield is it can run kodi it can run plex

24
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:45,440
It can run iPlayer because it's android. It will also do open vpn, which is important for me to get iPlayer working

25
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,920
Oh, I hadn't really considered that I think it's also worth mentioning not only does it

26
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,040
Play plex, but the shield in some capacity can also act as a plex server

27
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,960
And if you only are streaming to one or two computers or tvs in a house

28
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:05,600
You actually could just have your set top box be your plex server and it has some units have built-in storage

29
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,240
And some units have external storage. I suppose at this time everybody knows about the shield though, right?

30
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,760
I feel like you and I are such fans, but we've we've been fans for so long and they just released a new version too

31
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,480
Mine's the original 2015 version. So, uh, it's getting quite old now, but it works just great

32
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,680
um, I had an issue with the power supply on it about uh,

33
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:30,560
Three months ago and nvidia, you know considering it's a four-year-old device at this point full credit to them

34
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:36,880
They shipped me out a new power adapter. No questions asked no proof of purchase even required. So oh, that's good

35
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:40,160
I've heard some people complain. Those are hard to get so you just gotta know who to ask

36
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,880
They just sent it to me for free, you know, so

37
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,520
Really great experience there from a customer perspective

38
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:52,160
So the thing is about using um the built-in smart tv stuff

39
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:58,560
I've always been a proponent of I want my screen to be dumb. I just want it to be a really good quality panel

40
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:06,720
I'll handle the content. Don't worry about apps. Don't worry about anything else could have a five to ten year panel

41
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,440
And then a set top box you replace every couple of years

42
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:15,280
Potentially depending on price. Um, now the downside to that is that you need to make sure that everything every link in your chain

43
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,520
Between your set top box and your tv

44
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,200
supports

45
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,080
The audio formats the the video resolution so 4k and things like dolby

46
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:30,080
Dts master audio is pretty well supported. But there are some others that are slightly more esoteric that sometimes

47
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,200
Don't get full pass-through support. So

48
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,720
Brent and I ran into this last night. I was like, oh my god

49
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,080
so Brent and I ran into this last night actually, so

50
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,280
There we are watching the matrix

51
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:48,560
A full-on uhd blu-ray rip that I have stored

52
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,120
um on my plex server

53
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,920
And we're watching through the nvidia shield through my denon avr

54
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,800
into the

55
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,000
lg

56
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,400
We got halfway through the movie and it started buffering for some reason

57
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,800
I think there was several people watching my plex or something

58
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:10,080
Um, so I started looking at some data and it turned out it was actually only

59
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,200
Playing at 1080p on the screen because my receiver doesn't do 4k pass-through because it's old

60
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,440
Okay, so I now need to upgrade my receiver great, but then I thought hmm. What if I use the plex app built into the tv?

61
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,840
Turns out because it's built into the tv it not only bypasses my receiver

62
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:34,320
Um in terms of that 1080p limitation, but it also supports hdr which my receiver didn't

63
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,280
So brent and I are sat there and there's that lobby scene where they're, you know, shining flashlights in the matrix

64
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:45,840
You all know the scene and um, you know neo and trinity are doing the cartwheels and shooting each other and all the people

65
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,840
It's a classic. Yeah, there were moments in that scene where both of us were sat in a dark room where it was like so

66
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,400
bright because of the hdr stuff we're just like

67
00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:01,440
Oh, that's like, you know when someone shines a flashlight in your eyes in real life. It was genuinely like that from a tv

68
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,920
astonishing

69
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:09,120
I actually think i'm probably going to ditch the shield for the majority of my content now because

70
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:17,440
The lg thing has this magic wand remote you can wave around and it's it's like a I guess a wee a wee nunchuck remote type deal

71
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,200
um

72
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:25,440
It's fantastic. And you've sort of simplified too, which is kind of nice because really all of the hard work's being done back on your

73
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,880
Plex server. You just need a front end to stream the hd64 stream

74
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:36,400
And you need it in the right colors in the right sound channels direct play all the things but so having uh plex on the

75
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:43,280
Tv leads to an interesting issue that I hadn't even considered getting sound to your speakers, correct? Yes

76
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:49,440
So I discovered last night and this is quite an old technology, I think but I discovered audio return channel last night

77
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,980
There's a hdmi port on my tv that has an arc

78
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,360
Thing and there's a hdmi port on my receiver that has arc marking

79
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:05,440
So it will take the sound from the plex app or any sound from the tv actually and then it will use hdmi. I think cec

80
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,400
Protocol to actually turn the receiver on

81
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,600
Send the sound to the amp. Um, and then I get the full surround sound passed through coming through the amp

82
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,960
That's so much fun getting something like that. And it sounds like you got a really good one

83
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,840
Um, and did you say you got it as a black friday deal too? Yeah, I love early black friday stuff

84
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,080
I'm looking for storage. You got a tv lots of good deals to be had at best buy on storage

85
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,960
Those uh easy stores are still 12 terabytes

86
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,740
470 180 bucks something

87
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,640
I love it. You i'm in a telegram group that brings out a bunch of stuff

88
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:41,840
I'm in a telegram group that broadcasts when there's great deals on hard drives. Have you seen this telegram group?

89
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,640
There's a server builds.net one that's pretty good for sort of an used enterprise gear that i'm part of

90
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:53,840
That's even better. That's a great one. So, um on the opposite end of that is my home assistant setup, which is

91
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,400
Uh running on raspberry pi 4 in a docker container and then I have another one

92
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:03,520
I have two I have another one here at the studio, which is running on a much larger x86 box

93
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,080
and home assistant

94
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:11,280
Is probably one of the open source projects. I am the most passionate about now

95
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:17,680
What I love about home assistant is it allows me to take all of the different quote unquote cloud connected smart devices

96
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,200
And control them with one interface over my lan with no cloud connectivity required

97
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,260
Home assistant works off of these integrations

98
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:34,880
And these integrations enable additional functionality home assistant is underpinned by very simple easy to read yaml configuration files

99
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:40,800
And it's got a default ui that's built around something called lovelace, which is pretty easy to customize or you can just throw it all out

100
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,200
Uh, I am not as long of a home assistant user as you are though

101
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:50,000
I think you've probably been using it for probably twice as long as I have it was january that I started

102
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,960
Uh, it was the smart led project that I talked about at linux fest northwest

103
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:02,240
You know just I i'm a huge proponent of solving real problems to get yourself excited about something

104
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,040
And for me that was lighting. It's a great way to learn

105
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,840
It's like the way for for me to learn really

106
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:15,280
It's a very low risk way to learn. So if if you're let's put it this way. So if your lights don't switch on

107
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,240
Nobody's going to really get hurt or you know something

108
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,920
It's not going to cost you a huge amount of money or something like that. Whereas if you're automating

109
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:29,520
Like the the locks on your house instead, like you might be locked out if you screw up, right?

110
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,640
And that's that's obviously a bit more of a a big kind of risk

111
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,160
Um, so for me lighting is a really great way for people to get started. It's uh, it's fairly cheap

112
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,800
You know, you can either just buy off-the-shelf bulbs from

113
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:47,200
Philips hue or lifex or any other z wave compatible or zigbee compatible kind of brand

114
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,240
Uh, I think ikea even makes some stuff now

115
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,360
Or you can make it yourself, which is what I which is what I did

116
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,960
I had a lot of pre-existing smart products

117
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:01,760
Because I initially went for speed and ease and I went and I tried

118
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:08,240
the uh google smart stuff the alexa smart cancel. Sorry everybody the echo smart stuff

119
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,280
And um

120
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:17,680
I also went pretty deep into home kit because I really liked that home kit was over the land. No like cloud api stuff

121
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:25,920
And so I ended up with a real hodgepodge of devices and it wasn't until I got this project off-grid mandate to say no

122
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:31,040
Cloud I want all of this stuff that i've learned to like and love in some cases to work when I don't have internet

123
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:36,080
And that's when I really started to refocus on home assistant. So not the longest user

124
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,640
But I have gotten so much out of this

125
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:46,080
It has it has become a quality of life project for me. Like it's improved our quality of life

126
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,720
so much so that um, even as recent as this morning

127
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:56,400
And this is this we've had this conversation several times now my wife and I have been discussing how it has improved

128
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,800
our quality of life in the rv over

129
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:04,000
the fall and into winter and then something you touched on there too alex is

130
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,160
Sometimes things can go rough at work

131
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:11,120
You can have a couple of losses in a day at work and you're not feeling that great and if you can go home and

132
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,200
accomplish something

133
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,720
it sort of

134
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:20,480
Softens the blow of what happened during the day at work and it gives you a sense of accomplishment that you can you can enjoy

135
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,480
so this landed really at a great time for us because i've been

136
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,360
Really experimenting with how lighting can change our space

137
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,760
and putting in light strips and light bars and um

138
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:41,200
just kind of experimenting with different lifex bulbs and seeing how changing colors and adding light essentially painting our home where I

139
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,040
I looked around and I said, where is it really kind of dark? Where's the light falling off in this space?

140
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:49,920
and then I put warm different kinds of lights in there that shine lights on walls and ceilings and

141
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,840
tying all of that to the sunset and the sunrise

142
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,880
and morning and wake scripts

143
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,880
It's really made it feel homey. How cool does it feel when you're just sat on the couch watching tv?

144
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,720
You haven't thought about it. You haven't even noticed it's getting dark outside

145
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:12,000
And then suddenly your light switches on just gently and it's like I did that

146
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,400
I mean, okay home assistant did that but I thought to write that automation that did that

147
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:22,480
And home assistant has sunrise and sunset as a trigger, which is just fantastic. So it does that figuring out for you

148
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,240
And then you just say when sunset occurs fade these lights on for me

149
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,880
And it's wonderful. Another thing I love about home assistant are the the

150
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,560
Metrics that you can use to figure out what's going on

151
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:39,200
Are the the metric s ton of integrations that it has

152
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:45,680
Looking at the website home hyphen assistant dot ios slash integrations. They have at the time of recording

153
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,340
1492 different integrations

154
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,560
And so what can you do with some of those things right now?

155
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,480
Um, I don't live in london anymore

156
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,680
But when I did, um, it would have been quite useful just to have some kind of a visual indicator in the morning

157
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:04,640
Not another notification, but just like some some kind of visual thing that says hey

158
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:08,080
Your train is going to be delayed this morning

159
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:13,840
What I have done is I have used one of the many things you can do in home assistant besides integrations

160
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,480
But just something the lovelace ui allows

161
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:23,760
Is I pull in traffic cams from all of the major intersections around my home and the studio. So I have one tab

162
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,120
In home assistant. I get a snapshot of the weather

163
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:32,240
The temperature at the studio the temperature at home and all of the driving conditions. Very cool

164
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,240
the thing that I love most is the fact that it's a single pane of glass for

165
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,040
every single iot type situation that you have so

166
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:47,600
You know in london you're taking the tube somewhere and you know, let's say your your tube line is delayed

167
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,760
There's a london underground integration

168
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:55,360
So it will go and pull the london underground api and say the circle line this morning

169
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,880
It has massive delays. So I could change my route based on that maybe

170
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:04,720
And because it's a sensor home assistant has a bunch of different constructs in it

171
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,240
And one of the things in there is a sensor

172
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,520
So that could include stuff like a water sensor for you in your rv to check that something isn't leaking

173
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:15,040
It could be a light sensor in the window to check the ambient light levels

174
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,400
So if it's a particularly gloomy day, it will turn the lights on in your house

175
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:24,240
Or in this case, it is an api call that this integration makes to the london underground

176
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:30,320
Api to say hey, this tube line is screwed this morning avoid and that status

177
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:37,280
Access sensor input to the home assistant system and so then think of it a bit like if this then that but on your lan, right?

178
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,840
So you have a sensor

179
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,400
that triggers

180
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,840
Something so again, you have another another construct called a trigger

181
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:52,880
So a sensor triggers an automation and so an automation can be anything that you can think of

182
00:13:52,880 --> 00:14:01,520
It could literally be changing a light bulb from 50% red to 50% blue number one impact on our quality of life

183
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:08,000
Has been what I have done with our heaters and our water system because they actually make living in the rv possible

184
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:15,920
RVs are not super well insulated and ours has three slides and where the slides are at air can pass and so it can be a challenge

185
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,600
To keep it comfortable when it's 30 and 20 degrees fahrenheit outside

186
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,760
So I have a series of sensors and i'll link to my sensors that I just absolutely love

187
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,160
That report into home assistant constantly every couple of seconds

188
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,120
So I also get data I get chartable data on my temperatures, but we'll get to that

189
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,440
so I have an automation that gets triggered by this sensor data that says if it's

190
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:44,640
between 7 p.m. And 9 a.m. And the temperature in this room drops below 67 degrees

191
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:49,120
Turn on a heater until it right rises to 72 degrees

192
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,240
Now the thing is in an art that sounds great, but in an rv

193
00:14:52,880 --> 00:15:00,240
You can lose temperature so fast that you either a can't keep up with the demand or b as soon as you turn the heater off

194
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,280
The room starts to get cold

195
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:08,960
I have solved this with a oil heater that is very low slow

196
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:16,160
Ambient once it's going it just sort of radiates heat and small little 500 watt space heaters that will kick in in the short term

197
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:23,360
As the temperature begins to climb up the short term 500 watt heater kicks off and the oil heater finishes the job

198
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,120
And then we have the same thing if the temperature begins to drop too rapidly

199
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:32,560
The little 500 watt space heater will kick in to shore up the gap and keep it around 67

200
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,920
68 degrees in our bedroom all night long. That's not a problem

201
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:42,480
67 68 degrees in our bedroom all night long. That's nice. It's it's changed our lives. We sleep so much better

202
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:47,520
and my wife is particularly sensitive to the house not being comfortable for me, you know, it could be

203
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,720
60 degrees i'm fine, right throw a jumper on yeah, exactly

204
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:57,520
But she does not want to have cold toes. No cold. She has a no cold toe policy alex

205
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:04,000
So i've really gotten a nice quality of life improvement out of just a couple of sensors and

206
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:10,560
Just different smart plugs activating oil heaters or space heaters when you add things to the system

207
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:15,440
They all become data input points. So when you add a camera, it can also be a motion sensor

208
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:23,040
A lot of these also offer motion sensing and humidity sensing and this is all information you bring into home assistant that enables you to make

209
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:28,160
Different decisions and different actions. I'll give you another example

210
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:34,640
It's very possible for our water to freeze this time of year our water comes in from a hose into a water bay

211
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:40,560
Now water bay is outside the rv. It's in an enclosed space, but it's low and it gets colder than the inside of the rv

212
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,680
does

213
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:48,000
I have a temperature sensor. It's a z-wave device. It runs off of a little tiny lithium battery. It runs for a year

214
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,360
And it's 3m taped to the inside of that bay

215
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,760
And it measures the temperature constantly

216
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:59,360
When the temperature reaches 37 degrees it turns on a traditional incandescent light bulb

217
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:05,840
That light bulb in an enclosed space is enough heat to raise the temperature up above 40

218
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:09,280
Even when it's freezing outside and when the temperature reaches 40

219
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:15,280
It turns off the light and that prevents my water lines just that that simple little tweak prevents my water lines from freezing

220
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:21,680
Doesn't take much does it and uh, sometimes those those really small jobs add up to a

221
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,680
cumulative

222
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,680
massive impact on your life

223
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:32,400
You know for me a couple of my favorite automations are around a bedtime routine. So in my house. I'm like, hey hockey puck

224
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:38,640
It's bedtime that that starts off like a 20 minute routine in my house with the lights doing a certain dimming pattern

225
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:43,520
Um, so that I don't have to reach for any switches when you know when you're lying in bed and you're comfortable and you're ready

226
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,640
To go to sleep. The last thing you want to do is reach over and actually turn the light off

227
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:52,080
Um, I don't have to do that anymore. But the other thing and this is a really weird fringe benefit is that

228
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:57,760
Archie my dog has learned to recognize that particular phrase of bedtime

229
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,880
So much so that as soon as I say hey

230
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,560
g

231
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:07,680
uh bedtime he'll jump up from his bed and go and stand by the back door and wait to be let out, you know, so it's

232
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,640
I've automated my dog

233
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:16,480
You know what I stole that idea from you when I when I visited you I saw that and so I went home and I implemented

234
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,560
a bedtime script

235
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,840
And a good morning script now scripts are not the same as automations

236
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:28,000
Scripts are when you just want to manually execute a series of things and you can program in and what you did

237
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Which I totally ripped off from you

238
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,360
Is you programmed in some delays and some dims?

239
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:37,680
So when you kick off the sequence, it's sort of a cascading shutting down

240
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:42,240
Of the lighting in your home and they ratchet down their brightness and then they turn off completely

241
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,480
And there's kind of like it's it

242
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:49,360
Over a month or so of using that it builds in a routine. Like it's you know

243
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:55,040
I'm really going to bed now. Like the house is shutting down. I I can't just stay up and just do what I want

244
00:18:55,040 --> 00:19:00,800
I got to go to bed now. I've kicked off the routine. I supplemented it a little bit because we have kids and we're sometimes when we're

245
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,000
When we're moving we're sometimes in noisy areas like rest stops

246
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,800
We have placed a couple of white noise makers into smart plugs

247
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:15,280
And so my bedtime scripts turn those on as well lights start to dim the noise makers come on when those noise makers come on

248
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:19,920
That's leafy's cue to go get in bed as well. Same thing. I've automated the dog and in the morning

249
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,840
I hit that it turns off the noise makers and it does a soft lighting

250
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:28,320
So that way not everybody gets blasted with lights a couple of small lights come on and then over a 10 minute period

251
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,320
They come up to full brightness. So

252
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:36,880
Some of these automations and stuff do require quite a lot of thought to get them right and tweaking when they're longer

253
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:42,000
Yeah, tweaking and stuff. This isn't something i've done yet, but I want to investigate something called node red

254
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:49,360
Which allows you to basically have um, I don't know the terminology but you have boxes and lines that you draw between things

255
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:53,360
To basically create a automation flow chart

256
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:58,960
So you say, you know if this then that but on a graphic level you can basically draw a flow chart

257
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,960
And that but on a grand scale

258
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:07,040
And it can do stuff based on presence detection, which is something i've not really investigated much

259
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,280
But it's a huge part of home assistant really

260
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:13,200
There's a bunch of sensors that can detect when your phone is on wi-fi

261
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,880
You could use a service like life 360 to detect when you're driving

262
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,340
You and I both have the automatic obd2

263
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:28,160
Things in our car obd2 ports to read. I don't know like engine statistics and mileage and all that kind of stuff

264
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:34,320
And you couple all of those data points together and then home assistant can actually have a pretty good picture of whether you're home or not

265
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,760
And so a lot of the problems with things like phillips hue

266
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:45,840
Is that it has a gps thing built into my phone and it uses that for presence detection on the lights in the house

267
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,320
Well, what about if my wife's home and i'm not

268
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:55,840
That the logic is just not smart enough to deal with that kind of actually pretty basic situation and very common

269
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,520
Not to mention the privacy implications, too. That's going to their cloud service

270
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:05,120
Yeah, and a lot of this other presence data doesn't leave my lan in the home assistant world. So

271
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:12,640
There are just huge huge benefits that it does take a bit of you know, effort to to get started with home assistant

272
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:19,120
But once you do boy and you can start with simple just turn one or two things on and off with this cheap smart plug

273
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:24,480
If you want something dead simple a couple of devices I can just recommend off the top of my head

274
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:30,160
Is there's a fantastic tp-link integration with home assistant if you have a one of those casa smart plugs

275
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,800
You can use them immediately with home assistant

276
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:39,280
Nearly all home kit smart plugs that just speak the home kit standard protocol

277
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:46,240
Will work with home assistant. So that for me was huge because that covered everything I had also the I know for sure

278
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:50,100
Like I have a few in production kind of like um recommendation

279
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:55,620
Recommendation the I home smart plugs, which are home kit will work

280
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:58,900
I've the reason why I mentioned home kit a couple of times is

281
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,460
It's a pretty solid protocol

282
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:08,180
Does not require any ios devices on your network when you're using home assistant and it's all over the lan

283
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:16,100
The company you bought the device from never even needs to know it's online so you can take advantage of economic

284
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,860
compact

285
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:22,660
wi-fi capable smart devices over your lan and that for me is huge because

286
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:25,380
That means anybody can get started with home assistant

287
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:29,380
I like the tp-link ones because I buy them in a two-pack for 30 bucks

288
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:33,300
And that's not even the most economical way. There's even cheaper ways to do smart plugs

289
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:38,420
Especially if you go the diy route like you do alex. Yeah, one of the first projects I did was

290
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:43,860
Again, like lighting was a very low risk one, but smart plugs again are quite low risk. They're very

291
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:48,340
Easy to to do and very low risk if they go wrong

292
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:52,920
And so I ordered a four pack of something called the tekken sp20

293
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:58,440
And these guys are 100 to 240 volt compatible

294
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:02,260
And they will support a maximum load of 16 amps

295
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,300
now inside these guys is

296
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,780
essentially an arduino

297
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:10,020
And what some very smart person

298
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:15,060
Figured out was that the firmware callback that this makes when you first connect it to your wi-fi

299
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:18,980
Is trying to connect to tekken to do a firmware update

300
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:23,780
So what they did was they reverse engineered it and performed like a man in the middle attack

301
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:29,940
So using my raspberry pi its wi-fi chip and the ethernet to basically

302
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,180
Be the man in the middle

303
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:35,540
My raspberry pi turned into the tekken update server

304
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:39,620
Provided a bogus update file to this little white box in my hand

305
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:44,500
And so I was able to flash it with the tasmota firmware, which is completely open

306
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:48,340
I will never so long as I own this physical piece of hardware

307
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:52,740
Ever be beholden to tekken and their business model

308
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:55,860
And so I now own this piece of hardware

309
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:02,740
Completely there's no other business model at play here other than I paid 10 bucks for this piece of plastic

310
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:09,780
Okay, now let's get to the more advanced stuff because we keep mentioning voice control. However home assistant

311
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,500
Doesn't provide home

312
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:16,340
Automation via voice control out of the box. It's an actively developed project

313
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:23,700
Maybe it will one day, but how have you solved that problem? Because there's really two routes with home assistant google assistant is

314
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:29,780
Supported as is the the one that begins with the letter a it's supported

315
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:34,900
But it's really you have there's two routes you can take on how to actually make it work and you and I have gone

316
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:37,700
Very different ways on this. There are two routes. You're correct

317
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:42,420
There is an automatic setup via home assistant cloud and the other one is a manual setup

318
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:46,660
So I I went through the manual setup. Um, my home assistant is exposed through

319
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:53,060
A reverse proxy and there are some security implications to exposing your home automation system to the internet

320
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:55,620
If you're not comfortable with those then

321
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:57,540
Don't do it

322
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:03,300
And so if you don't go the manual route, you can go the home assistant cloud route and home assistant

323
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,840
partners with nebuchadnezzar

324
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:09,060
to provide essentially a

325
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:14,180
Way to run or control home assistant from anywhere

326
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:20,420
Without you needing to really understand or configure your own port forwarding or reverse proxy

327
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:24,820
So I can speak to that a little bit because that's the route I went for another reason

328
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:29,700
For another reason and that is I am behind some carrier grade double net

329
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:33,380
There's just no way I could punch a hole through even if I wanted to

330
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:37,220
plus I have taken it on as a challenge to just

331
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:42,820
Not allow anything from the outside to this network and I just assumed I would always use a wire guard vpn

332
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:45,220
but

333
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:52,260
Not ideal if you want some quick remote access or you want voice assistant integration. So this home assistant cloud is

334
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:59,060
Is you have partners? Maybe they're connected like it's it is a commercial arm of some of the people behind home assistant

335
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:01,780
and they seem to be

336
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:08,820
Essentially proxying and mirroring a home assistant setup in the cloud. There's a slight delay using the system, but it's not bad

337
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:11,460
and I decided to

338
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:13,460
pay after the trial because

339
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:16,020
The way the proxying works

340
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:18,740
I never have to expose my network to the outside system

341
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:22,660
But I can still get in I can still view my cameras. I can manage it as if I was at the land

342
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:24,660
It's 100 like i'm at the land

343
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:28,340
And by doing that I also get one button

344
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:29,780
click

345
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:32,660
Publishing to the echo or the google assistant

346
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:38,980
Which solves that which you had to kind of build a system including stand up some software on your server to enable that I believe

347
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:44,420
yeah, and then an nginx reverse proxy is is how I did it and then you have to go into

348
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:48,100
To the actions section of your google account console

349
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:56,020
Create a new smart home card a new smart home recommendation and build an action and it probably took me an hour or two

350
00:26:56,100 --> 00:27:00,820
To get it working in the end. Uh, it's not been a hundred percent reliable either

351
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:03,380
Like quite often I will say

352
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:06,180
Sync my devices to the google assistant

353
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:09,780
It will just say i'm sorry has is not available right now

354
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:13,540
Even though I can go straight to the has url and it's perfectly fine

355
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:19,700
I have actually had really great results with the home assistant cloud and the other thing it gives you which i'm not utilizing yet

356
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:23,220
But it gives you a public webhook url

357
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:27,540
So anything that can be triggered by a webhook can be given a publicly accessible url

358
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:30,340
So you can send data back to your home assistant

359
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:35,220
System from anywhere in the world without actually having to expose it to the internet itself

360
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:39,300
And that's really handy for collecting data outside my environment as well

361
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:41,620
um, but

362
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:46,900
Same time I could understand why people wouldn't necessarily want to pay five dollars a month and they might not necessarily want somebody else

363
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,060
hosting a instance

364
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,340
I don't know what they're doing

365
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:55,460
But the setup process takes a bit like they're building a system behind the scenes and it seems to be its very own

366
00:27:55,540 --> 00:28:00,820
Instance that's dedicated to you and they seem quite confident in the security. I I did look into it a bit

367
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:08,180
But once you've done either what what alex has done or this route you can then pair it with a voice assistant and it will

368
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:14,200
Integrate to some effectiveness enough that we can turn our devices on and off which is really all we want

369
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:19,320
I just want a dumb simple way to start off routines or automations or scripts or whatever. Yeah

370
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,280
Yeah, it's nice when your hands are full or whatnot or when you're in bed

371
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:25,640
So, okay, so that's that was one of my kind of more complicated ones

372
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,360
The other one I want to ask you about

373
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:34,280
It's going to come up as soon as you start digging in very far, especially in the home assistant communities

374
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:39,580
Mqtt there's a lot of answers on the internet that will be well, you should really be doing this with mqtt

375
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:44,520
You could get a zig beta mqtt device and bring it into home assistant that way

376
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:48,840
And I know you use mqtt for even those tasmota devices

377
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:54,120
You were talking about explain this to me because what i'm familiar with is like from the mainframe days

378
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,900
Mqtt is a message queuing transfer

379
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:04,080
Protocol I don't know what mqtt itself stands for but message queue is pretty much all you need to know

380
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:09,120
And I know it allows for publishing and subscribing to certain messages from devices

381
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,280
You can subscribe to something and always get updates on it once you have that set up, correct?

382
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,520
So if you're familiar with something like kafka

383
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:20,640
Or any other situation where you're sending a message into a queue to be processed by something else later

384
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,160
That's pretty much where you're at. Now. There's a few key

385
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:29,200
Uh concepts to be aware of you have as chris said the publish and the subscribe thing

386
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:32,640
But you also need what's called an mqtt broker

387
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:39,060
And in this situation you can enable that inside home assistant with one single line of configuration

388
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,360
And so where that becomes useful is let's say you have a sensor in my case. That is

389
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:48,320
These techin smark plugs that I talked about

390
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,180
these guys are

391
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:53,180
publishing to a topic

392
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:57,420
The amount of voltage the amount of amps being drawn

393
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:59,100
the

394
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:02,540
total cumulative kilowatt hours consumed et cetera

395
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:07,100
They're publishing all of that data to an mqtt topic

396
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:10,940
now until that topic gets subscribed to

397
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:13,820
It will just sit there and be

398
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:16,220
in the broker

399
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:21,600
So when you're writing your automations you want to consider that maybe you could subscribe

400
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:26,320
To a topic which is essentially like a push notification at that point

401
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:33,920
When you subscribe to that topic, you're in a situation where you're not having to go to the end device and say hi

402
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,880
What's the latest amp draw? What's the latest voltage?

403
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:42,000
the sensor is publishing that data to the broker and then

404
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:45,840
Maybe you have an led strip that will change color

405
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:49,200
based on the contents of that published

406
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:54,160
Topic. Yeah, like you were saying that the traffic was really bad on the tube

407
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,240
You could have a light strip turn red

408
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,840
You wouldn't have to look at your phone or anything

409
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,280
If that light strip is red, you know

410
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:05,680
You need to take your alternate route that day and the way it does it is through publishing usually a json payload

411
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,800
so, you know, you'll have key value pairs in there which you can

412
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:14,240
reference in pretty straightforward to write arduino code and then using

413
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:19,120
Off-the-shelf microcontrollers. You can do some pretty cool things. You can turn on ac you can

414
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:23,360
Stop a 3d print if the room's got too hot or something

415
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:28,480
You could turn a light on and off you could I don't know launch a locket to the moon if you wanted to

416
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:35,840
So if i'm following you in this case the small little lightweight iot device it it just gets its data off of it says

417
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,840
Here's my information. It sends it to the broker

418
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:45,040
The broker collects it home assistant itself is not a broker home assistant subscribes to the broker

419
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,040
Then brings that in as a sensor data point, which you can then build automations around

420
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,200
Yeah, there's so you can run an mqtt broker as a separate

421
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:58,240
Container on your system if you want to and just have a dedicated standalone mqtt instance

422
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:04,240
And do you use a particular one? No, I just use the one built into home assistant because it's stupid simple to enable

423
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:10,720
It's literally mqtt colon and then it's enabled in your config. That's it. I know other people use what is it mosquito?

424
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,760
I think is one that people use i've heard that's a pretty popular one

425
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:18,480
That's why I thought maybe you were using mosquito. There are performance concerns. I've never run into any

426
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:23,360
Let's say you've got I don't know a hundred of these smart plugs in your house and they're all

427
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,080
throwing updates every couple of seconds plus all of your lights plus everything

428
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,200
you know, you will end up in a situation where

429
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:37,840
Um, you might want to start considering an external broker, but for my needs the internal one has been absolutely fine

430
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:45,360
I think maybe in my setup being raspberry pies my home assistant pie does the most it does several other it runs like seven other

431
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,080
Containers that are kind of busy. So it has

432
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:53,200
Sort of the highest workload next to my shinobi pie, but my pie hole

433
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:57,760
Raspberry pie is just sitting there not really doing much. So I was thinking making that my network services

434
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:01,440
Pie and putting mosquito on there and putting

435
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:09,360
Grafana on there because I know grafana is another thing that I could get down the rabbit hole to get really good long-term pictures of data

436
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,980
How does grafana which is a incredible graphing?

437
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:15,760
Application, how does that?

438
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:21,200
Tie into home assistant because i've seen a lot of people do that. Yeah, so you can enable the influx db

439
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:27,120
Output from home assistant which writes pretty much every event that happens in the home assistant

440
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:31,200
database to the influx db time series database, so

441
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,520
you end up with a

442
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:36,080
a time series database in influx of

443
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:43,440
Every single event that happens. So every time motion is detected in a camera or every time you turn a light on and off or

444
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:50,080
Every time your thermostat detects the the temperature is changed by half a degree. It will write to a home assistant event log

445
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,960
That then gets pushed into influx db

446
00:33:52,960 --> 00:34:00,080
And then grafana supports a bunch of different time series databases influx is one prometheus is another there are there are lots

447
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:05,760
And you can then create queries which will graph your data out and make it look pretty

448
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:10,560
It's so neat because i've just done some graphing with the built-in stuff in home assistant

449
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:13,360
And I really feel like that combined with the event log

450
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:21,360
I get a I get a real complete picture of what's happened with my family and my home throughout the day in one single day

451
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,360
Home throughout the day in one spot

452
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:28,240
And I can kind of review it and see when things got cold and how things all respond and what levels of tanks were at

453
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,240
and for me, it's

454
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:32,080
It's a really nice way to kind of wind down in the evening

455
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:36,320
It's just see what my home was doing all day while I wasn't there doing the research for this episode last night

456
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:43,920
Um, I was talking with you after lup about the different integrations at home assistant has and I came across my electric supplier in

457
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:47,700
North carolina duke energy actually have a home assistant integration

458
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:52,660
So these guys have an api available for the smart meter on the side of my building

459
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:55,620
that must have a cellular modem in there to

460
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:59,860
Send my meter readings back to them every I don't know every day or whatever

461
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:05,140
um, so I turned that integration on last night in about 10 minutes and

462
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:13,060
now I have all of that meter data for my electricity supply in home assistant

463
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:19,780
In home assistant, I could do automations based on that. So let's say my energy usage has gone bit gone above a certain threshold

464
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:24,580
In a certain day, I could say right that's it. No more electric today turn everything off

465
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:30,660
More realistically what i'm going to do with that is take that data feed it into influx

466
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:38,420
And then create a grafana graph so that I can more accurately track my monthly and daily energy usage across the entire house

467
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:42,500
Not just where each of my smart plugs is at that's so cool

468
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:46,020
I plan to do something very similar because a future electrical system

469
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:50,980
I plan to get for as part of project off grid feeds off all of that information via bluetooth

470
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,820
So i'll capture it that way

471
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:56,980
This is an area where we could go on and on for hours

472
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:59,380
We could talk about

473
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:04,340
Z wave and zigbee and wi-fi we could talk about integrating motion and security sensors

474
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:10,260
Or we could talk about crazy great integrations and automations. I'd love to hear what the audience is doing

475
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:16,020
With their setups and what they'd like to know is possible. So go to self-hosted dot show slash contact

476
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:22,100
And let us know or of course, there's always that hashtag ask ssh. So I think that'll do it for today

477
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:28,500
I'm on twitter at ironic badger. I'm at chris las and the show is at self-hosted show

478
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:40,500
And as always you can find our show notes and all the rest of the information about this show on self-hosted dot show slash seven
