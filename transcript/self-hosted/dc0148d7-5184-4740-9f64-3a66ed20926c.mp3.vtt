00:00.000 --> 00:07.240
Think I've come upon the most American thing I buy on a regular basis that I should introduce you to is it a gun

00:08.480 --> 00:13.000
Related item. Well, you could definitely hold your gun. They're 511 tactical pants

00:13.760 --> 00:19.720
Tactical pants Alex all of the pockets you could ever need so, you know how you were saying you want to go on a walk

00:19.720 --> 00:22.400
But you don't like to bring your phone. It's because you need a pair of tactical pants

00:22.440 --> 00:27.040
They have pockets in places that distribute the weight so that you don't even feel it big old phones

00:27.040 --> 00:32.120
Like the big old phones you get all go in the tactical pants. You need to try some of these

00:32.120 --> 00:33.880
They're not that expensive

00:33.880 --> 00:36.480
Hashtag no sponsor. I'll put a link in the show notes

00:37.000 --> 00:42.720
What are they made out of though? Because I thought a lot of these tactical I can't say it tactical trousers

00:42.720 --> 00:46.760
I can't say I can't I can't call them pants these tactical trousers

00:46.760 --> 00:51.600
They they're often made out of the same material as like a sail, you know, like in a sailboat or something

00:51.680 --> 00:56.880
Sure, like really thick. Yeah real thick doesn't doesn't wrinkle, man

00:56.880 --> 01:04.100
These are constructed using a premium polyester cotton mechanical stretch tactile rip strop fabric. I don't know what that is

01:05.720 --> 01:09.680
Sounds like a fancy marketing term to me it is but it's really great

01:09.680 --> 01:14.440
I just I gotta say plus the other thing if you're like me they have elastic in the way

01:14.440 --> 01:17.040
So it expands and detracts with you

01:17.780 --> 01:21.120
Because that's something I'm always doing. Anyways, I'm just saying try it out. They're only 30 bucks

01:21.360 --> 01:25.860
Are they revolutionary and were they made with courage mine were I don't know about yours

01:25.860 --> 01:31.140
So I just think with your big phones. I think I think you'd appreciate it. I just one one American

01:32.180 --> 01:38.660
Bit of life that I've adopted is tactical pants. Okay, I quite like I mean, you know in Raleigh over here

01:38.660 --> 01:43.780
I need I need shorts from like March. I've been in perma shorts, which is lovely speaking of that

01:43.780 --> 01:46.740
I just had a chance to see you you and I just got back from visiting

01:47.300 --> 01:51.420
Wendell in Lexington and it was fantastic. We did some road tripping

01:51.420 --> 01:58.900
It was a lot of fun. And we had a chance to really kind of look at business setups small and medium-sized business setups

01:58.900 --> 02:04.620
So Wendell does some contracting and one of the things that he does for his clients is he backs up parts of their infrastructure

02:04.620 --> 02:09.800
On his own. So if they're in the cloud, he'll back it up locally. And if they're local he'll back it up to the cloud

02:10.220 --> 02:14.860
Well, we thought maybe we should chat about some lower cost setups today

02:15.220 --> 02:18.900
Because this is an area that I have recently got into I used to be a

02:18.900 --> 02:24.220
Build it as big and powerful as possible kind of guy, you know, I go to Unix surplus

02:24.220 --> 02:29.980
I got a huge super micro box put all of the Xeons put all of the RAM put all of the disk in there and

02:30.180 --> 02:32.840
Fire it up. You sent me the best text this week

02:33.580 --> 02:36.180
Alex I've accidentally ordered to service

02:37.580 --> 02:39.140
This is I really had a moment

02:39.140 --> 02:46.100
I saw the Raspberry Pi 4 shows up on my doorstep in an envelope and I'm just thinking well my server shut up in an

02:46.100 --> 02:52.100
Envelope, that's just that's just something else. I'm I'm picturing Steve Jobs MacBook Air manila envelope moment here, right?

02:52.100 --> 02:57.860
Yeah, and I so I rip open the envelope and I realized there's two raspberry pies in there

02:57.860 --> 03:04.020
And then I really was floored because not only had my home server been delivered in an envelope

03:04.700 --> 03:08.600
But I had accidentally ordered two of them and I wasn't financially ruined

03:09.860 --> 03:15.020
You know years ago I could spend for a client or for wherever I worked easily spend

03:15.020 --> 03:18.100
$15,000 on an x86 rack mountable server

03:18.980 --> 03:26.340
Easily sure. I mean even if you're looking at used enterprise gear the minimum price of entry is going to be three or four hundred dollars

03:26.340 --> 03:27.420
I would have thought

03:27.420 --> 03:32.220
Like an old think station maybe or you know anything with a Z on in it sure, you know

03:32.220 --> 03:35.540
you can build them for two to fifty but

03:36.260 --> 03:38.700
It's gonna be a bit of a potato at that point, right?

03:38.700 --> 03:44.300
Well depending how you do it you could probably for well under a grand get a decent NUC setup with some storage

03:44.300 --> 03:49.900
So there's a lot of ways you can go about this, but I actually am doing something kind of special

03:50.460 --> 03:54.060
Little excited to announce here on the show that I'm beginning a new personal project

03:54.060 --> 04:00.220
I am so serious about this that I'm actually taking time off throughout the rest of the year to work on this project and do little

04:00.220 --> 04:05.020
Bits, it's called project off-grid. Well, you know, it's serious when it has a name. I know I've named it

04:05.780 --> 04:10.660
As long time listeners will know I've got a I've got a 40-foot RV

04:10.660 --> 04:16.140
That over the years I've been I've been experimenting with I've had a QNAP NAS in there

04:16.140 --> 04:19.140
I've tried different things and I've really come to

04:19.860 --> 04:26.180
This idea that I want to build a system where I can go completely off-grid and I've set myself some goals

04:26.180 --> 04:32.460
But it starts at at the tech level. I want all of my home automation to be completely on the LAN

04:32.460 --> 04:37.980
No cloud connectivity required because I often travel places that don't have connectivity now

04:37.980 --> 04:43.300
That's an important thing right is not required. Although there are will be optional components

04:43.300 --> 04:47.940
Which will interface with cloud services on occasion, right? Yeah. Oh, yeah hundred percent. Yeah

04:48.060 --> 04:48.540
Yeah

04:48.540 --> 04:55.020
It's sort of like it's sort of like I'll come back online and I'll sort of soak up the things that I needed

04:55.020 --> 04:59.540
Maybe it's media files or articles and then and then as I drive down the road

04:59.540 --> 05:03.700
I can sync those offline and then when I get to my destination, they'll be available for me

05:03.700 --> 05:10.680
So this includes things like offline readers offline media and it means getting things like sensors and all of these that work on the LAN

05:10.820 --> 05:15.020
But it also needs to be because it's in a very small living space. It needs to be quiet

05:15.020 --> 05:21.420
It needs to be low power. In fact, ideally one day even run entirely off of DC which

05:22.100 --> 05:28.200
Eventually would be powered by solar all part of this project. It's a multi-phase project this project off-grid

05:28.900 --> 05:31.920
Currently, I'm trying to solve this traveling without signal issue

05:31.920 --> 05:38.320
Also, I'm often double netted either by a campground or even just the ISP

05:38.320 --> 05:45.080
I have in my hometown. I'm I'm on a 192 network all the time. It's horrible. It is so limiting

05:45.680 --> 05:48.720
So that's why I'm gonna do a wire guard relay server, but we'll get to that in the future

05:49.200 --> 05:51.200
because you have a really

05:51.640 --> 05:52.560
interesting

05:52.560 --> 05:54.720
Like life problem to solve here

05:54.720 --> 06:00.660
I mean most of us most of our houses don't drive down the freeway and suffer a was it

06:00.660 --> 06:05.860
A category 5 earthquake every time it does. Yeah, I think it's actually 4.7 on the Richter scales

06:05.860 --> 06:08.540
What they say the scale category is hurricanes. Sorry, bro

06:09.100 --> 06:10.900
Yeah, most of us don't have to deal with that

06:10.900 --> 06:14.900
So I think it's a really unique set of challenges you're gonna have to deal with but on top of that

06:15.220 --> 06:21.540
I've just solved my house in London. So I'm gonna be buying a house in America next year at some point

06:21.540 --> 06:24.060
So a lot of these things that you're gonna solve

06:24.060 --> 06:28.900
I'm just gonna lift and shift and copy and paste those into my my house solar is on my list

06:28.900 --> 06:34.620
For example, I want to do some DIY Tesla Powerwall style stuff with old laptop batteries and things

06:34.740 --> 06:36.740
So that that should be a lot of fun

06:37.220 --> 06:42.260
But I'm really curious about this setup from a networking standpoint

06:42.260 --> 06:48.620
So as it stands today you get your internet through a little antenna on your roof that comes from a hillside

06:48.900 --> 06:51.480
Like two miles away, right? Yeah. Yeah, it's a wisp

06:51.780 --> 06:56.780
So in my main what you could consider a home base where I've spent the most of my time and I have like full

06:56.780 --> 07:04.660
Hookups and everything. I have a monthly ISP. That's just a local ISP that comes in over a wireless link

07:04.660 --> 07:08.660
It's a decent. It's like a 15 megabit up and down connection

07:08.660 --> 07:13.440
So it's not amazing but I can get things in and off my LAN at reasonable speeds

07:13.940 --> 07:19.460
That thing comes into something that you tipped me off to that. I think it's a pretty great little device

07:20.220 --> 07:22.220
It's the GL AR

07:22.220 --> 07:29.140
750 s gigabit AC travel router. It's tiny or it's also called the slate. It's another term for it

07:29.340 --> 07:34.300
It's about the size of a pack of playing cards. I would say maybe a little bit bigger, but not much

07:34.820 --> 07:38.420
it's certainly in the same ballpark as a Raspberry Pi in a case and

07:39.660 --> 07:46.000
Yeah, this thing I tipped you off because I I stupidly left my predecessor to this in a hotel room in Florida last month

07:46.500 --> 07:51.540
So I had to buy a replacement and this this little travel router is is wicked, right?

07:51.540 --> 07:59.420
It has several cool features, but it supports out-of-the-box. No custom phone ways required wire guard. Mm-hmm

07:59.820 --> 08:04.960
Huge as things run in an open WRT. It has wire guard support plus it has

08:05.860 --> 08:08.500
BGN and AC 802 11 and

08:09.140 --> 08:13.460
3 gigabit network ports. So here's my use case for this device. I

08:14.340 --> 08:20.220
I'm traveling a fair bit. So I'm going around different hotels and things like that and I use this thing to

08:20.220 --> 08:23.980
Make the captive portal experience less painful

08:24.700 --> 08:26.420
so when I get to a hotel

08:26.420 --> 08:31.300
I'll plug this little device into a USB battery bank or a wall charger or whatever it might be

08:31.300 --> 08:33.300
it doesn't really need much power and

08:33.540 --> 08:38.780
Then I will connect to the SS ID that this little box spits out

08:39.180 --> 08:45.980
When I do that, I can connect to a local IP address, which I think is 192 168 8.1

08:45.980 --> 08:53.080
That's the subnet by default that it has I then log into the admin interface of this little travel router thing and

08:53.340 --> 08:56.260
Then go into what's called the Wi-Fi repeater section

08:56.260 --> 08:57.620
And when you do that

08:57.620 --> 09:02.980
What you're able to do is actually look at all the SS IDs are broadcast in the place that you're in

09:03.420 --> 09:10.380
Select the one that you want the router to associate with and then perform the captive portal on your laptop as if you were

09:10.380 --> 09:18.060
Connected directly to the access point and that has a few benefits because it means devices that don't support captive portals natively

09:18.340 --> 09:25.940
will pick up that authentication token via the router because it's the router effectively that's authenticated via its MAC address and

09:26.460 --> 09:31.140
Then it also means that hotels that try nickel and dime you through a two device limit

09:31.140 --> 09:35.340
I can connect 20 30 40 not that I have that of course

09:35.340 --> 09:41.660
But you know, I have five or six devices when I travel sometimes between my wife and I and a two device limits

09:41.660 --> 09:45.140
Just so annoying and this little device gets me around it

09:45.660 --> 09:51.280
But to add to all that as well when you add in a VPN support at the router level

09:51.340 --> 09:55.060
It means that any traffic that traverses through that device

09:56.020 --> 10:01.820
Then goes through a VPN as well. So most hotel Wi-Fi is open and leaky and

10:01.820 --> 10:07.500
This device just solves that problem perfectly. So it supports open VPN and wire guard

10:07.700 --> 10:14.820
So whatever your flavor is you can make it work with this device that wire guard supports a big deal for me because I'm often

10:14.820 --> 10:16.820
on what I consider

10:17.500 --> 10:22.460
Untrustworthy lands campground Wi-Fi is very commonly just sort of thrown together

10:22.740 --> 10:26.700
it's it's one flat LAN everybody just has at it and

10:26.700 --> 10:34.020
Being able to isolate my systems from that as well as use wire guard to protect the traffic is really nice

10:34.020 --> 10:35.900
So I have it in

10:35.900 --> 10:42.380
My standard home base mode. It's going into that wireless ISP over Ethernet

10:42.380 --> 10:48.300
It actually is you know, it comes off the back of the antenna as Ethernet that goes into the slate and that's how I'm using

10:48.300 --> 10:48.780
It right now

10:48.780 --> 10:54.180
But when I travel I use that Wi-Fi repeater mode to either connect to a MiFi and I will just choose

10:54.180 --> 10:59.300
Whichever MiFi has the best signal and then I just connect it to that or campground Wi-Fi and it's

11:00.020 --> 11:03.640
Surprisingly fast the specs of it aren't incredible. It it has a

11:04.780 --> 11:07.240
775 megahertz CPU, but

11:07.960 --> 11:10.120
you know open wrt doesn't need much and

11:10.860 --> 11:15.860
I've offloaded some of the larger network tasks to other devices, which I'll talk about here in a moment

11:16.220 --> 11:19.300
But it's pretty neat and again, it's DC

11:19.300 --> 11:25.420
So everything in my setup right now, although a lot of them are using AC to DC adapters, but all of them are

11:26.260 --> 11:31.820
Capable of doing just straight DC in the future because I essentially have a power wall built into my RV

11:31.820 --> 11:37.060
I've got two lithium ion batteries right now, which will last me about 16 hours

11:38.140 --> 11:42.740
It's amazing, but I plan to double that in in the future. Maybe when I go to solar

11:42.740 --> 11:48.740
So I could maybe get you know quite a bit of time and if I can save that cost of converting to AC

11:49.100 --> 11:51.100
I'll get even more time I can go off-grid

11:52.060 --> 11:56.580
Yeah, little 5 volt USB. I think it's it micro USB. It is all it needs

11:57.460 --> 12:02.140
It's great. And you know, it's so this this little box has a couple of other tricks up its sleeve

12:02.140 --> 12:05.480
It has three gigabit ports on the back

12:06.140 --> 12:11.920
Two of them are designated as LAN ports out the box. And the third is what's called a one port. So

12:11.920 --> 12:17.800
The example I gave in a hotel where you connect over a repeater to the Wi-Fi

12:17.800 --> 12:21.740
you just plug in an Ethernet cable and you can then use this router as a

12:22.800 --> 12:24.640
Wi-Fi to

12:24.640 --> 12:26.640
Ethernet adapter if you like. Oh, yeah

12:26.840 --> 12:28.920
Also has a USB port on the side

12:28.920 --> 12:35.840
So you could plug in a USB modem or an Android phone and use that to tether via this device to all of your other devices

12:36.680 --> 12:41.120
And then the last trick that it has up its sleeve is it has a micro SD slot in the side of it

12:41.120 --> 12:48.720
Additionally, it comes with a really easy to use GUI, but they include a more advanced power user GUI

12:48.720 --> 12:51.960
That's just in the advanced section. So they don't they don't bury it

12:52.320 --> 12:57.540
And then on top of that you can turn on SSH and then you're on the command line and you can do anything

12:57.680 --> 13:04.760
So it's not limited either. It looks like a very bootstrap kind of UI to me. So it's it's quite modern. It's responsive

13:04.760 --> 13:10.000
yeah, so this device I think I paid about 60 or 70 dollars for it and

13:10.000 --> 13:12.520
We'll have a link to it in the show notes

13:12.880 --> 13:15.360
It's a really great pickup to be honest

13:15.360 --> 13:20.480
And I think I'm gonna try and keep hold of this one and not leave it in a hotel this time

13:21.280 --> 13:23.060
Yeah, yeah, I really like it

13:23.060 --> 13:28.500
I have had some compatibility issues with an AT&T MiFi where the MiFi would crash

13:28.800 --> 13:33.480
But when I switched it over to use the 5 gigahertz Wi-Fi, it seemed to get a little bit better

13:33.600 --> 13:38.280
So just test it but I love it and I'm keeping it. It's part of my network arsenal now

13:38.280 --> 13:42.680
So that's I've got that set up and then I have a Wi-Fi system that I need to replace

13:43.560 --> 13:47.280
Eventually, but we can save Wi-Fi for a future episode because it it works right now

13:47.680 --> 13:52.680
What do you use at the moment? Can we name and shame it? I I really like it

13:52.920 --> 13:56.520
So I don't want to shame it. It just has a fatal flaw

13:56.960 --> 14:01.760
So I got before Amazon purchased them. I got the Eero system the Eero

14:01.760 --> 14:07.900
Oh, mm-hmm. It's fatal flaw is that it does require some level of cloud connectivity

14:08.440 --> 14:15.240
Occasionally to function properly. Is that not true of the ubiquity stuff as well? Because I know that I have to run my

14:16.240 --> 14:18.320
ubiquity controller in a container and

14:19.240 --> 14:24.560
To configure the access points. I mean I have never left it offline for more than a few days

14:24.560 --> 14:26.560
Is that true of the arrow too?

14:26.600 --> 14:29.560
Well, so here's the way it works with the arrow and that's why it's a fatal fall

14:29.560 --> 14:32.800
Like what you're talking about can be from like a licensing check-in or stuff like that

14:32.800 --> 14:38.440
But with the arrow if it loses its state for some reason and it loses power

14:39.240 --> 14:44.300
Which can happen when I'm say switching from one power source to another every now and then there's a hit to the system

14:44.300 --> 14:48.480
maybe I'm going from generator to battery or from shore to battery and

14:49.560 --> 14:55.960
That brief interruption can sometimes reset systems when that happens in some situations

14:55.960 --> 15:00.060
If arrow cannot contact their cloud servers, it won't start the LAN

15:00.160 --> 15:05.400
Why what possible reason could they have for that because it assumes its state is invalid

15:05.840 --> 15:10.680
Because there's some there's some signing that has to happen between the communication of the head unit and the nodes

15:10.680 --> 15:16.000
And when that signing can't be verified, it doesn't start up the LAN as a safety measure

15:16.640 --> 15:22.460
Safety, right? I'm not buying that. I'm sorry. It's just a telemetry thing. If ever I heard of it

15:22.460 --> 15:30.040
I knew this going in I knew was a bad call, but it is truly the fastest most reliable most problem-free

15:30.560 --> 15:33.160
Wi-Fi I have ever used so going forward

15:33.160 --> 15:35.920
It's the Wi-Fi systems I'll buy for all of my family

15:35.920 --> 15:39.560
Like if like as a Christmas gift if they need Wi-Fi every now and then like every like five years

15:39.560 --> 15:45.200
I'll do this. This is what I'm getting them and Amazon's bringing the price down even more now. It's so bulletproof

15:45.680 --> 15:50.800
However, I got to go with something that's offline and the and the funny thing is the RV has a lot of interference

15:50.800 --> 15:54.320
So I actually need a two node system to get great signal everywhere to do video streaming

15:54.760 --> 15:57.840
It's bulletproof unless your internet goes out and then you're screwed

15:57.840 --> 16:01.140
So, okay, I wasn't gonna go down that rabbit hole, but you made me do it

16:01.140 --> 16:05.480
But it's it's it's otherwise a good system, but it eventually has to get replaced if I'm gonna go off-grid

16:06.120 --> 16:13.040
But right now for the last few months almost coming on month three. I have I have gone down the route of

16:15.080 --> 16:19.580
Decloudifying the RV and bringing everything on to a single Raspberry Pi

16:19.580 --> 16:25.900
Of which I run home assistant smoke ping duplicati sync thing

16:26.420 --> 16:27.980
Plex and

16:27.980 --> 16:28.980
ranteo

16:28.980 --> 16:31.180
Alright, so let's put let's break these down one by one

16:31.180 --> 16:39.020
The one that stands out to me is being like a huh is plex because doesn't that need big CPU to transcode stuff

16:39.020 --> 16:41.740
I am taking advantage of the of

16:42.140 --> 16:47.940
Raspbian on the Raspberry Pi 4 and it does have hardware decoding and there is there is support now in plex for for that

16:47.940 --> 16:53.660
But when you're just talking three televisions and a max of six users ever it's really

16:54.380 --> 17:01.140
Surprisingly not that bad the Raspberry Pi has more overhead than you'd think with all of those services running on that

17:01.460 --> 17:03.460
I'm around eight percent

17:04.060 --> 17:11.140
CPU usage and then when I'm maybe doing like last night I was doing a docker compose update

17:11.880 --> 17:13.880
watching Star Trek the original series

17:13.880 --> 17:20.360
Blu-ray rip off of the Raspberry Pi plex direct play I assume a to an NVIDIA shield

17:20.360 --> 17:25.060
So I'm pretty positive was direct play as well as doing package updates after the docker stuff was done

17:25.060 --> 17:27.060
Like I was doing all of that on the host system

17:27.360 --> 17:32.080
While also watching plex and I was tearing down a container as well

17:32.080 --> 17:34.240
So I was doing quite a bit and it was really holding its own

17:34.240 --> 17:36.920
The the biggest bottleneck is really the SD card

17:36.920 --> 17:42.160
It makes all of the difference to spend a little bit more on that SD card. It really makes a difference

17:42.160 --> 17:48.600
So I was experimenting during a lot recording this week with with my pi 4 and I copied the root

17:49.480 --> 17:54.240
Directory so just slash like the bottom of root using our sink

17:54.240 --> 17:58.280
I think I did was our sink tack AVX or something like that

17:58.960 --> 18:04.080
And then you do slash and then the target of the SS USB SSD that I had attached

18:04.640 --> 18:07.760
And I noticed that when I was doing package updates and stuff like that

18:07.760 --> 18:13.840
It wasn't it wasn't night and day, you know, like going from a mechanical hard drive to an SSD was like, whoa

18:13.840 --> 18:18.080
Holy moly, this is I'm never going back to spinning rust as my boot drive

18:18.080 --> 18:21.520
It wasn't quite as night and day as I'd hoped on there

18:21.520 --> 18:25.920
But you are right that the SD card is the major bottleneck at this point

18:25.920 --> 18:29.680
Mm-hmm, and you can't yet USB boot the pie fully

18:29.680 --> 18:34.640
So I must I must make it clear that my slash boot was still on the SD card

18:34.640 --> 18:38.560
Even though slash was actually on the SSD, but yeah running you're running

18:38.560 --> 18:43.600
What this is that six or seven six different containers that are fairly active really?

18:43.600 --> 18:48.480
I mean they I mean including there's a couple of things on the host system like Samba and net data that aren't in containers

18:48.960 --> 18:52.240
And only 8% CPU usage. I remember on the first pie

18:52.960 --> 19:00.000
Trying to run. What was it called? XBMC with I think was RAS BMC with Sam Nazarko back in the day and

19:00.000 --> 19:03.680
You know trying to run just a single HD video stream

19:03.680 --> 19:08.640
It was so bad. The CPU was just pegged and I had the MPEG 2 decoder license

19:08.640 --> 19:10.640
I paid extra for and it was just pegged

19:11.200 --> 19:15.680
And yeah, we've come a long way with these pies how um, so I have a question for you about how warm

19:16.240 --> 19:21.360
That your pies getting yeah, there's that so I think a couple of caveats here

19:21.600 --> 19:24.400
I've gone with the flirt cases for my pies

19:24.400 --> 19:29.520
And not only because I think it's a really sturdy case, but because it has some thermal management built in it

19:29.520 --> 19:35.600
It comes with thermal paste and then the case actually makes contact with the CPU and that thermal paste and it acts as a heat

19:35.600 --> 19:37.040
spreader and

19:37.040 --> 19:43.040
I've watched a few reviews on YouTube and it you know brings it down an actual measurable noticeable worthwhile amount

19:43.280 --> 19:47.520
I'm also using the flicker case and the whole thing is made out of well

19:48.080 --> 19:50.320
The side of it is made out of aluminum

19:50.320 --> 19:57.040
Machined aluminum and the uh, the inside of the case actually dips down to touch the CPU with a thermal pad

19:57.040 --> 19:58.480
Yeah, that's a better way to put it

19:58.480 --> 20:04.720
Yeah, and then the top and bottom are made out of this kind of soft touch rubber material and the case itself was 15 bucks

20:04.880 --> 20:11.920
Which I paid 15 for a lego case a few years ago. So, you know price wise it's it's for what you're getting

20:11.920 --> 20:17.360
It's fantastic. It takes the raspberry pi which on its own naked to sort of fit into the case

20:17.360 --> 20:21.520
The raspberry pi which on its own naked just sort of feels like a hobbyist toy

20:21.680 --> 20:24.800
And you put it in this case and now it feels like a premium consumer product

20:25.120 --> 20:30.320
so I did that to help reduce heat also a big part of this is um,

20:30.720 --> 20:34.080
I I really think having the ethernet on its own bus

20:34.880 --> 20:39.680
And and having the network separate now from the disk made it wasn't just the cpu

20:39.760 --> 20:42.560
But that was the other piece that made this really doable for me

20:43.100 --> 20:44.480
gigabit is

20:44.480 --> 20:49.520
Closer now to full gigabit than it ever has been but also when you're doing network traffic

20:49.680 --> 20:54.640
It's not polluting the usb bus, which is where with a pie the majority of your storage is going to live

20:55.280 --> 21:02.000
So yeah, I totally agree with that now, um in your list of applications. You mentioned something called ranteo. I've never heard of this

21:02.000 --> 21:03.040
What is it?

21:03.040 --> 21:05.700
Oh boy, this is one of those life-changing

21:07.340 --> 21:11.200
Applications that I found uh-oh. It's like i've finally come home

21:11.200 --> 21:14.480
I'm I finally have a note system

21:15.280 --> 21:19.520
That truly works for me and it's fully offline

21:20.400 --> 21:22.400
It supports markdown

21:22.640 --> 21:27.520
I can bang out notes in any old dirty text editor. I want or I have a web ui

21:28.940 --> 21:36.080
Hallelujah, this is changing my life and the secret that really brought it to the next level was when I combined it with sync thing

21:36.400 --> 21:38.400
Oh, man. Oh

21:38.400 --> 21:42.160
Oh alex, this is such a game changer for me sync thing, huh?

21:42.720 --> 21:44.960
Not next cloud sync, you know, it's neck

21:44.960 --> 21:51.120
There's so many ways you can skin this cat really so that's perfectly acceptable if nextcloud works for you have at it

21:51.360 --> 21:53.760
I I use nextcloud for my work stuff. I wanted

21:54.320 --> 21:59.920
um something that was totally offline available as text in the rv at all times because i'm going to put

22:00.400 --> 22:02.320
maintenance logs in there

22:02.320 --> 22:06.160
Information about repairs all the documentation for my network

22:06.160 --> 22:10.320
Uh family notes that hidea and I need to keep track of like doctor's names all that

22:10.400 --> 22:12.400
I want to have available offline

22:12.720 --> 22:18.000
And the way my brain works if I can dump out something in text i'm much more likely to capture it

22:18.560 --> 22:20.560
And I prefer to use an actual text editor

22:21.360 --> 22:25.520
So rantio or however you say it rantio, whatever it is is a

22:26.640 --> 22:28.640
very simple web ui

22:29.440 --> 22:33.200
That sits on top of a directory structure of markdown files

22:33.200 --> 22:38.480
You can create arbitrary directories. You can just add markdown files. You can add markdown files to the root

22:38.800 --> 22:41.360
And it will render and display it like notes

22:42.160 --> 22:46.240
No database no database just flat files. That's great

22:46.480 --> 22:51.600
That's where sync thing comes in because then I sync those flat files to a notes folder on all my systems

22:51.760 --> 22:54.000
And wherever i'm at whenever something pops in my head

22:54.160 --> 22:59.600
I just toss in that notes folder and then it's on my rv either when it comes back online or like right now

22:59.600 --> 23:01.600
It's online. So it's just synced up immediately

23:01.600 --> 23:08.720
And then when I want to retrieve it or more importantly when I want high spousal approval factor for retrieving information

23:08.800 --> 23:13.520
It's got a nice web ui on top of it. I don't know why notes is such a difficult problem to solve

23:14.400 --> 23:17.680
It seems to me that evernote solved it a long time ago

23:18.160 --> 23:20.960
But you have to pay for that and it's a cloud service, right?

23:21.600 --> 23:25.760
But in terms of the self-hosted space for note taking there's a few options

23:25.920 --> 23:29.120
So there's joplin there's nextcloud has a notes thing built right in

23:29.120 --> 23:34.320
I mean you could use git if you wanted to I mean literally the the options are endless

23:34.400 --> 23:37.360
but I think a couple of things that you mentioned really

23:38.560 --> 23:42.960
Spiked my interest and one of those is there's no database. So it's a flat file structure

23:43.520 --> 23:47.600
A lot of apps seem to miss that fact because I want my notes to remain

23:48.540 --> 23:50.540
agnostic to the application

23:50.880 --> 23:55.520
Which they were written in or for or synced by also a perfectly usable

23:55.520 --> 24:01.280
Uh scenario for me would be issh into my server and I just cat the file to get a quick like command

24:01.360 --> 24:03.360
I need to copy or something totally

24:04.480 --> 24:10.160
Uh, and then also I guess you could back it up with git and it still remains viewable by rantao or whatever it is

24:10.880 --> 24:16.160
Does it support like rich stuff like pictures or screenshots or stuff like that?

24:16.320 --> 24:19.600
Yep, it has a content folder and you can toss it has content

24:19.600 --> 24:23.120
That's where you toss the markdowns and has images and that's where you toss the images and then you just you know

24:23.120 --> 24:26.400
You link back one folder and it just it figures it out. It's really easy

24:26.720 --> 24:28.720
Well, you might have gone and done it you might have gone and found it

24:30.480 --> 24:34.240
I think i've reached peak services to pie. Um a

24:34.880 --> 24:37.120
It's now becoming a little mission critical and b

24:38.080 --> 24:42.800
If any one of those were to go haywire could slow down the other so I think i'm going to stop about there

24:43.280 --> 24:47.680
And now i'm going to go to a second pie and my plan is to go to three pies total

24:48.320 --> 24:49.760
No more than three

24:49.760 --> 24:53.520
And you're not going to run kubernetes on those and do some fun stuff with that

24:53.760 --> 24:56.960
I might let you talk me into that in the future. I might we could

24:57.760 --> 25:01.520
I need to buy a couple so I can figure it out first and then make myself look clever by telling you

25:02.560 --> 25:06.320
Great good plan. I put my so I put my second pie into production last night

25:06.800 --> 25:11.360
This will be a dedicated network services pie. So this now runs pie hole

25:12.000 --> 25:19.120
And I may move smoke ping and a couple other just like network level infrastructure things to that pie

25:19.120 --> 25:23.520
Smoke ping is pretty cool. You put me onto this way before you knew who I was

25:23.680 --> 25:26.400
Um with the last episode about five or six years ago

25:26.960 --> 25:30.400
And it was actually one of the first containers that linux server did back in the day

25:30.720 --> 25:33.760
Such a good app you get the best insights and for me

25:34.240 --> 25:37.840
It's really interesting to see how the different networks that I go to perform

25:38.240 --> 25:43.120
I go to bed and I wake up in the morning. I check smoke ping and I go. Ah, okay. It's gonna be one of those days

25:44.640 --> 25:48.560
Now there's another one that's actually come onto the scene fairly recently called stat ping

25:48.560 --> 25:55.680
Um, so I have it running on a digital ocean droplet and I I use it to monitor things like service uptime. It's like a

25:56.400 --> 26:02.340
Alert genie ops genie type thing where it will ping a certain ip over either tcp or http

26:03.120 --> 26:05.120
And just tell you whether the service is up or down

26:06.000 --> 26:12.560
You can also use it to communicate with family members that there is planned maintenance coming on the plex server for example, which can be nice

26:12.640 --> 26:13.680
so

26:13.680 --> 26:17.120
you know if some if i'm needing to swap out a hard drive or um

26:17.120 --> 26:21.840
Um blow dust out of a fan or something and turn the server off for a half an hour

26:22.400 --> 26:26.240
I can just put a note into stat ping to say server off between these times

26:27.040 --> 26:30.160
Don't message me about this thing because it's it's not an accident

26:30.480 --> 26:35.280
The other really cool thing about stat ping is it's a really quick way to see the last time a service had an issue

26:35.280 --> 26:39.680
because it just tells you right there when you load the page the last time this went down was at this time and date and

26:40.320 --> 26:42.880
We use that here in the in the studio to check on our services

26:42.880 --> 26:47.280
If you want to see a quick demo, you can go to status.ktz.cloud. That's mine

26:47.920 --> 26:50.960
And you can have a little look at that. Um, so what else you got on that list?

26:51.040 --> 26:55.440
You've got home assistant, which I think definitely deserves its own episode. Yes

26:56.000 --> 27:00.880
That's the primary function of the pi 4 really but duplicati. What are you using that for?

27:01.120 --> 27:07.440
I'm using that to back up my docker compose files and my config files and a little bit of data

27:07.920 --> 27:10.800
to both dropbox and google drive

27:10.800 --> 27:13.280
I don't really use either one of those very much

27:13.600 --> 27:18.640
But this is kind of an I have you know amounts of storage in each one of them and we're talking text files here

27:18.720 --> 27:25.200
So it does a aes 256 encryption. It, you know wraps it all up into into a nice locally encrypted

27:25.280 --> 27:31.280
A bit bit of bundles essentially and then sends it up to the cloud and um, does it every single night?

27:31.280 --> 27:35.600
So if I make just even the smallest line change, I make sure that gets captured and sent off site

27:36.000 --> 27:39.680
I really like duplicati. I've been using it for over a year over here as well

27:39.680 --> 27:45.840
And it's it's pretty bulletproof. I mean the error message can error messages can sometimes be a little bit

27:46.400 --> 27:53.680
Vague but for the most part, it's it's pretty great and I use it to back up terabytes worth of data to google drive. So it's um,

27:54.240 --> 27:55.040
Pretty good

27:55.040 --> 28:00.560
I was considering putting my docker compose folders in the sync thing and then just syncing them to different folders on my laptop

28:00.640 --> 28:05.280
And then doing the changes there. I have to say when you're working with docker compose

28:05.280 --> 28:12.480
Which we'll talk about more in jupyter extras in the near future. We're going to do some container essentials in a future jupyter extras

28:12.480 --> 28:16.480
So extras dot show for that, but I have to say when i'm working with docker compose files

28:17.040 --> 28:23.600
Visual studio code blew my mind. I opened up the yaml file. It's like oh, hey, I noticed this looks like a docker compose file

28:23.600 --> 28:25.600
Would you like me to load docker support?

28:25.920 --> 28:32.800
And then it it really helps with identifying where things need to go in the yaml file because if you just have it on

28:32.800 --> 28:34.800
The wrong indent

28:34.800 --> 28:39.360
It'll break docker compose and it won't launch and so this gives you a visual guide when you're kind of new to yaml

28:39.360 --> 28:45.200
It's it's very nice. That's one of the primary complaints. I hear about yaml as a file structure is

28:45.920 --> 28:48.560
People don't seem to like the tabs

28:49.120 --> 28:54.960
Although without structure, there's no order and without order. It's just chaos. So yeah, quit whining because

28:55.520 --> 29:01.440
Yaml's amazing and i'm not i'm not listening. It's readable, right? It's at least readable. It's better than json

29:01.440 --> 29:05.840
It's better than json. Yes, which is the alternative. So yes very much

29:06.160 --> 29:07.280
So down the road, uh

29:07.280 --> 29:10.800
Which we'll do a future episode on I plan to set up my third and last pie

29:11.280 --> 29:16.400
As a shinobi local camera capture because I have a couple of cameras in the rv now they go off to cloud storage

29:16.480 --> 29:18.480
It's no good. It's going to go local

29:18.720 --> 29:23.360
Um, but that's down the road. There are a couple of caveats. I want to make clear to people

29:23.920 --> 29:26.880
I would not be able to do what i'm doing with raspberry pies

29:26.880 --> 29:32.240
If I didn't have a big old x86 rig here in the studio doing some of my heavy lifting

29:32.480 --> 29:37.600
Now that could have easily been a droplet or a linode vps. It doesn't have to be a local box

29:37.600 --> 29:42.100
But for me some of the large job extraction and data processing

29:42.560 --> 29:47.920
Is happening on the studio land and then i'm just syncing the essential bits that I need to the rv

29:48.400 --> 29:55.200
And the storage too because you know a usb two and a half inch hard drives limited to about four terabytes, I think

29:55.200 --> 29:59.840
Let's say I mean you could maybe have half a dozen on the pie, which is still impressive

30:00.480 --> 30:06.240
Granted, but it's not it's not going to match what you can put into a big x86 box, right with spinning disks

30:06.480 --> 30:13.360
That are you know, six terabytes or more each eight terabytes. Um, that is the other limiting factor

30:14.080 --> 30:17.440
What i've gone with is i've tried i've tried to find good deals on

30:18.000 --> 30:21.760
Uh usb3 ssds that are powered by the bus and I just hang that off the pie

30:21.760 --> 30:26.400
So there's that those are the caveats there as well as of course in my opinion

30:26.720 --> 30:30.080
Although feel free to tell me otherwise i'd love to know what's working for you out there

30:30.720 --> 30:32.720
I think on a raspberry pi

30:33.040 --> 30:35.040
for the for specifically

30:36.160 --> 30:38.640
Raspbian is really your only bet if you're going to use it in production

30:39.280 --> 30:45.840
For the moment anyway. Yeah, there's so many drivers and little itsy bitsy things here sentos just got basic boot support

30:46.080 --> 30:50.080
But it's still not very stable. Um, I have reason to believe that the

30:50.080 --> 30:52.880
Ubuntu folks may have some work in progress to make it

30:53.680 --> 30:56.960
Um a little more doable including gpu support and whatnot. But right now

30:57.600 --> 30:59.840
If you want to update the firmware on this thing

31:00.400 --> 31:01.680
if you

31:01.680 --> 31:07.520
Want to take advantage of the gpu and really have the most I think stable running linux system

31:07.600 --> 31:12.320
It needs to be raspbian right now, which is debian based. What do you mean gpu support?

31:12.640 --> 31:17.760
Oh, no, I just mean like the drivers for gpu acceleration are different. And in fact the architecture is completely different

31:17.760 --> 31:22.160
But it's it's a it is a different. It is a really different product from the three

31:22.800 --> 31:27.920
It it looks the same and it has it looks similar and it has a similar name

31:28.160 --> 31:31.360
But it is an entirely different beast. So it does have those caveats

31:31.360 --> 31:35.600
I don't want to come on here and say you can throw out your x86 box with a raspberry pi 4

31:35.920 --> 31:42.160
But I do want to say as somebody who was a big metal make it as fast and big as possible kind of guy

31:42.720 --> 31:46.320
I'm blown away what i'm doing with these two raspberry pies right now

31:46.320 --> 31:50.160
And at this point i'm going with multiple raspberry pies just to sort of isolate things out

31:50.160 --> 31:54.320
I I don't want my dhcp server and dns server to be on my application server

31:54.320 --> 31:56.480
So I i'm choosing I ran pie hole

31:57.040 --> 32:01.040
On my main raspberry pi for a bit just to see if I liked it and it worked perfectly fine

32:01.360 --> 32:03.920
and then the other thing to bear in mind as well, of course is

32:04.640 --> 32:10.720
Application availability the pi is of course an arm cpu not an x86 cpu

32:10.720 --> 32:16.640
So not every piece of software that's ever been written has yet been ported or built for arm

32:17.360 --> 32:22.640
Docker containers make it largely irrelevant to a certain degree these days

32:22.640 --> 32:25.120
Although it depends whether your container maintainer

32:25.840 --> 32:31.840
Supports arm builds, um most do but not all so that's just something to bear in mind as well

32:32.480 --> 32:36.320
But I think you know the the overall kind of impressions of this device for me

32:36.320 --> 32:41.760
Is that for the price you really are going to struggle to match this performance?

32:42.160 --> 32:47.920
Any other way that in in this particular form factor and that's what really wins out with the pie is that

32:48.480 --> 32:52.480
A couple of things is the form factor the price and the network effect

32:52.800 --> 32:56.320
There are dozens and dozens of other projects based around the pie

32:56.320 --> 33:02.400
So if you get bored of hosting these services on the pie, you could turn it into a full screen

33:02.400 --> 33:08.320
Calendar that hangs by your front door so that all your family know when you're coming and going and it is so much the network

33:08.320 --> 33:14.560
Effect like i i i'm really curious about systems like the atomic pie and other boards that are out there

33:15.280 --> 33:22.400
People are really focusing on raspbian and raspberry pi so you can like just google anything and put raspbian on it

33:22.400 --> 33:25.760
And you'll get a guide for it and that sort of um

33:26.480 --> 33:30.240
Network effect makes it so much more approachable for people that are not

33:30.240 --> 33:33.840
So much more approachable for people that are learning how to do this kind of stuff

33:34.560 --> 33:38.720
I I really can't underestimate it and I I can see myself down the road

33:38.720 --> 33:44.400
Maybe looking at things like atomic pie or or even saying ah, screw all these raspberry pies. I'm switching to a big knuck

33:45.200 --> 33:46.320
but

33:46.320 --> 33:53.280
Right now i'm i'm liking the set of compromises and advantages and with the pi 4 the price has really the price performance is just

33:54.160 --> 33:56.160
Blew my mind way beyond my expectations

33:56.160 --> 33:59.280
Part of taking these things offline in the rv

33:59.760 --> 34:03.680
It has been this feeling that I own this stuff again

34:03.680 --> 34:09.440
And i've never been bothered by not owning it like never really was I don't have an issue with that kind of stuff generally

34:10.080 --> 34:18.000
Having it back. I now appreciate it in a way that it gives me it sounds silly, but it gives me genuine happiness like I feel

34:18.560 --> 34:23.120
Proud and i'm happy to have this stuff like I feel like it's mine like i've created something

34:23.120 --> 34:28.400
But we're able to use technologies like containers to just stand up

34:29.280 --> 34:31.280
instances of applications

34:31.280 --> 34:33.280
exactly as the developer intended

34:33.680 --> 34:34.640
with

34:34.640 --> 34:37.520
almost no knowledge of the application itself, you know, so

34:38.140 --> 34:42.240
Technologies 10 years ago just didn't permit us to be able to do this kind of stuff

34:42.320 --> 34:46.560
No, it's it's it's enterprise grade stuff that i'm running on a raspberry pie

34:47.200 --> 34:49.040
in my rv

34:49.040 --> 34:54.800
Yeah going that can go that goes down the road at 65 miles per hour. It's it's mind-blowing and it's it's working

34:55.200 --> 35:02.240
And it's only getting better. Uh, we've talked about this before but we're really at a really special time where web applications are decent

35:02.720 --> 35:04.880
Container technology is prevalent

35:05.600 --> 35:07.600
The hardware is cheap enough

35:08.400 --> 35:13.680
And the motivation is there to self-host this stuff like it's such a great time to be doing this

35:13.680 --> 35:19.840
So you heard us mention it a couple of times but be sure to check out xers.show. We'll have a special on reverse proxy

35:20.320 --> 35:23.840
And a special on the basics of container technologies

35:24.080 --> 35:27.120
So if if you want to understand some of these fundamentals a little bit

35:27.120 --> 35:30.480
We wanted to cover those early in the in the lifespan of the show

35:30.720 --> 35:34.880
And we're publishing those in the off weeks of this show at xers.show

35:35.280 --> 35:42.160
And you can also join us in the jb telegram group. We're using a hashtag ask ssh both on telegram and twitter

35:42.160 --> 35:44.160
for user questions

35:44.160 --> 35:49.520
Um, we've had some really good ones come through and we will get to those over the next few episodes as well

35:50.080 --> 35:57.120
But uh on twitter, you can find me at ironic badger and chris i'm at chris las and so thanks everyone for listening

35:57.120 --> 36:12.480
That was self-hosted.show slash three
