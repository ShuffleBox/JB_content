00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,400
Since our last episode I have been just every single night building something new trying something new for my home server setup

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:15,820
I feel like I've I've really rebounded from the death of my Raspberry Pi and now I'm just like trying out different setups

3
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:21,080
I'm really just going out having fun live in life experiencing different things

4
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:28,900
I'm not getting committed to any serious configurations or setups. I'm just dabbling and experimenting and really enjoying myself

5
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:32,300
Sowing your seed in the field of Linux. I take it

6
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:36,440
Absolutely, and things were just going really great

7
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:39,820
Until last night. Oh

8
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:42,100
But we'll get to that we'll get to that in the show

9
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:47,020
There's so much to get into today that I want to save it for a little bit because I know you've been at an event

10
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:53,220
Recently, we also have been thinking about doing a little shout out to the community trying to get somebody who might be a discord

11
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,960
Bot wizard to help us come up with a title bot for the show

12
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:01,920
So there's a lot to cover today plus towards the end of the show. We've got some great feedback some good questions

13
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,760
I've got some new hardware updates. So I said, well, I'll tell you about it later. Okay. Oh, it's such tease

14
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,560
I think I'll stick around see see what see what's been happening. Stay tuned and find out Alex

15
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,900
Exactly. Well very quickly. Let's just cover the title bot first shall we very simple requirements

16
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,640
We want something that you type, you know bang, you know

17
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:29,340
Exclamation mark start show and that starts the timer running and then ideally publishes any any bang suggest

18
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,040
Titles to a little web page which we can rank by a number of votes

19
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,760
I can add a voting thing if you've been with JB for a while

20
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:42,080
You remember JB titles comm something like that that we used to have in IRC

21
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,220
but for the modern age in discord would be

22
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:52,620
Bang tidy. Yeah, cuz we've been live streaming now for weeks over at Jupiter tube every other Wednesday, and we put our discord up there

23
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:56,380
we've got a live chat room in our discord and

24
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:05,020
The thing is we've been podcasting for so long our title making happeners are broken and we just cannot title these things

25
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:09,460
So we need to crowdsource that and it gives people a chance to participate live and come up with a title if you want to

26
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:13,380
Help us build a bot reach out and let us know. Yeah, if it was up to me every episode would be called

27
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,380
Linux and stuff

28
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:22,020
Our buddy Joe's approach and just drop titles all together. He convinced me to do that with Linux action news best thing ever

29
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:27,140
Yeah, well news is kind of yeah, that's what I different. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right

30
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:30,260
So I'm a little jelly you've been at all things open today

31
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:34,380
I have right on my right on my doorstep a great big open source for

32
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:40,940
5,000 person open source conference right on my doorstep for four to five thousand. Yes

33
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:46,820
That's what I've been told. Yeah, I kind of almost feel like maybe this is the new Linux fest. Am I right?

34
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:50,980
Is it worth going to should I travel to this? Give me your take well, it's a sort of semi

35
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:55,580
Commercial conference. It's it's in a bit of a weird spot. If you ask me it's not like

36
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:03,340
Linux fest Northwest which is completely hippie and free open-source love fest and it's not something like kubecon

37
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:08,660
Which is just almost entirely sales pitches. It seems to be to be somewhere in the middle

38
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:15,940
like it's it's mostly commercial sponsored stuff and there's a handful of talks given by real people and

39
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:20,660
The rest are given by employees of companies who would like you to go and use their service mesh

40
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:27,140
Implementation for example, or whatever it might be but on the whole the quality of the sessions was okay

41
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:34,740
I think probably about half of the sessions I went to were good and the other half were really not good

42
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,740
What made them really not good?

43
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:42,020
Were they sales pitches? Yeah, a mixture of stuff like that. Like it was clearly just I mean a

44
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:50,500
45-minute long infomercial or the presenter was an intern and had never spoken to an audience before

45
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:56,900
Or you know that those kinds of things really so maybe the bar was a little low on who was accepted to speak

46
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:02,420
Yeah, well, I mean the reason I was interested in going was because Jim Salter was down to talk about ZFS

47
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,420
And who doesn't want to go and listen to Jim

48
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:08,420
Say how bad every other file system in the world except ZFS is, right?

49
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:12,340
Poor guy wasn't feeling terribly well though. So he pulled out at the last minute and

50
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:19,540
We were left hanging unfortunately, no Jim Salters ZFS lovefest. You got to get your updated ZFS talking points

51
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:24,340
What are you gonna do? Yeah, I know. Well, what I could do instead is talk about WSL 2

52
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,300
Scott Hanselman who is a Microsoft employee

53
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:32,980
I have to say was probably the best presenter that was at the conference and he did a great job

54
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:36,820
at the conference and he just had this wonderful way with him where

55
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:44,580
He was funny and actually engaging and obviously clearly knew that the subject he was talking about extremely well

56
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:51,540
And he did a very slick demo of how WSL 2 and github and vs code and windows

57
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,700
are actually

58
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,180
the perfect developer platform these days

59
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,500
And who would have thought who had on their bingo card 10 years ago

60
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,020
that Microsoft would nail the developer experience

61
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:05,620
on

62
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:09,940
Linux on windows and just make it all work seamlessly together. I mean

63
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,500
mind blown

64
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,940
well

65
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:18,660
Yes, and no, I mean they have I I think actually to give credit where credit is due

66
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,780
I think Microsoft's pivot to focus on

67
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:25,780
Linux open source and I would say broader

68
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:32,420
Development tools and development platforms, which I think is really what they've done. That has been very impressive

69
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:37,300
They deserve all the credit. You very rarely see these empires these

70
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,860
massive corporations make these huge pivots

71
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:47,380
a lot of times companies just get locked into a way of doing business and they just

72
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:52,180
Only have tunnel vision and they fight everything else to try to protect that business model

73
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:55,300
Microsoft figured out that they had to sacrifice a little bit of windows

74
00:05:55,940 --> 00:06:00,900
And adopt and embrace a little bit more Linux open source and things like that to that to that end

75
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:04,580
I give them total and absolute compliments. I think they've done very well

76
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,300
And I think it's legitimate in a lot of ways

77
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:12,920
But I think the Achilles heel to this dream fantasy that they're saying where you can have windows with your compatibility

78
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:19,460
And your corporate integration and you have WSL and you just using github and vs code and everything's great because edge is based on chrome

79
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,980
So let's have fun

80
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,980
the problem is

81
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:28,100
It's still windows. It's still got the registry. It's still using NTFS

82
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:34,020
It still has an onion layered approach to the control panel and all the legacy stuff that comes in there

83
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:38,180
It still does all of the things that windows does it's still

84
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:46,580
Absolutely subject to the corporate tax strategy of Microsoft and whatever thing they're pursuing for that particular release cycle

85
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:52,980
for that particular release cycle windows is absolutely still influenced by it and as a user you have to put up with it and

86
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:56,340
Wait for the next fad so they can swap it out and put the other thing in there

87
00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:02,500
I mean like right now right they're bundling in teams or the bundle in Cortana or they'll put ads in the start menu

88
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:07,640
It just doesn't matter because they're always doing something else because one of the fiefdoms in Microsoft

89
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:14,260
Has finally gotten their chance their moment and they're going to get the numbers and they get something built into windows and you will always

90
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:19,160
Always have to put up with that corporate strategy tax with the windows workstation

91
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:26,180
And despite what they say the driver model on windows still blows the printing subsystem on windows still blows

92
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:29,380
The disk io subsystem on windows still blows

93
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:36,180
The windows ui is still bloated old and has lots of legacy if you go just one layer below their new lacquer

94
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:42,100
And so yeah, you can you can run a linux kernel in a really great hyper virtualized environment good for you

95
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:45,780
And vs code is a pretty good product, but I could run vs code on linux

96
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:50,820
I could have a real linux subsystem with a real linux kernel that has real file systems

97
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:58,100
And doesn't have all that windows legacy bullcrap. And so it's close. Yeah, but your your audio wouldn't work though. Yeah. Yeah, right

98
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:05,140
I mean you're right and there are absolutely there are situations where like linux doesn't cut it and I acknowledge that

99
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,140
And that's why I think it is really great. The wsl is as good as it is

100
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:11,620
Because there are people that just have no choice, too

101
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:15,300
And I have to use windows and for them the subsystems there

102
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:19,700
Well, if I want to run flight sim, there is no other way for me to run flight sim than to run windows

103
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:22,740
Yeah, and there's uh, you know, like, uh, I can't remember the name of it

104
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:28,900
But there's some game that my son dylan loves and so he's you know, he's snuck in a dual boot into windows now

105
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:32,900
so that way you can play that one game and it kills me, but I have to acknowledge like

106
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:37,540
If you want to run that application, you got to have windows. So it absolutely has its place

107
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:39,940
But this utopia that they're painting for developers

108
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:45,860
You know, I just can't I can't I can't subscribe to it. I can't say as I disagree with anything you said

109
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,900
but uh, they did they have solved an

110
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:54,180
Absolutely huge problem, which is encapsulated development environment. So

111
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:59,160
Uh scott in his talk showed us something called development containers

112
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:06,260
And these essentially are a json manifest of all the requirements. You need to develop a specific project in his example

113
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:09,220
It was uh, an oh, oh my posh

114
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:13,860
Power shell kind of candy looking to a terminal pretty fire thing

115
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:18,340
And he downloaded the he cloned the git repo

116
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:23,140
Vs code automatically picked up the json file that was stored in the correct folder

117
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:29,060
It pre-installed all the dependencies in the container a docker container on windows running in the linux subsystem

118
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,900
For windows or whatever the hell it's called. Yeah, and uh,

119
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:39,060
Within, you know a minute of cloning this repo. He was working or well hypothetically presentation working

120
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:43,140
You know what? I mean that that does sound really slick. I gotta be I mean that does sound slick

121
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:46,660
I mean a good part of my master's degree sort of five six seven years ago was

122
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:54,180
Trying to solve this encapsulated development environment thing and that was what led me to docker containers back then and uh, you know

123
00:09:54,180 --> 00:10:00,020
We were looking at packer vms and and you know sending q cow two images around to people and having like a special

124
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:04,340
university version of linux just for this, uh computer science course and

125
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:10,340
God damn it microsoft went and figured it out microsoft. It's crazy. They did

126
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:16,100
Uh, it's pretty legit and I have to say too like they recognized they needed a better terminal

127
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:19,860
They absolutely did they created the windows terminal. They made it an open source project

128
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:26,100
And it seems like it's a pretty good terminal like directx accelerated terminal. I mean, it's crazy. Yeah

129
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:30,820
That's so funny. It really it truly is it's I have to mention that this is something my buddy

130
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:36,500
Michael dominic and I have been talking about for a while on coder radio because we often talk about the tooling for development workstations

131
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:39,300
And he's kind of been through this whole journey

132
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:42,020
mac to windows

133
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:50,260
Wsl and like the mecca that that opened up for him and also of course vs code and also integration with azure and just like

134
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,020
He went all in for a bit

135
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:56,500
And now he's actually back on linux as his primary development workstation. And so the whole journey

136
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:01,380
I I think has been really interesting at coder.show if you are interested

137
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,100
But I want to hear about the meetup. I know you had a chance to

138
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:09,860
Go say hi to some audience members you guys coordinated in the matrix chat. It sounded like it went pretty well

139
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:13,220
Absolutely. Yeah. Well, I I bumped into a couple of listeners

140
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:17,780
Throughout the the day who somehow recognized me from my voice like it's distinctive

141
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:21,940
Uh, so we've got a little clip from a couple of listeners that we met up with for lunch

142
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:26,740
So i'm here at all things open with reed and john. How are you like in the conference so far john?

143
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:30,820
It's been pretty good learned a lot. Uh been to a bunch of different

144
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,620
sessions and

145
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:38,660
Gotten to meet some cool people and meet up with uh, the the jb crowd here

146
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:42,980
Yeah, and we've been working on a lot of stuff. We've been working on a lot of stuff

147
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:47,460
uh and getting a lot of people and meet up with uh, the the jb crowd here

148
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,940
Yeah, and we use the element

149
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:54,820
To jb matrix to kind of have a little mini meet up in the lobby of the conference. Didn't we?

150
00:11:55,540 --> 00:12:00,660
And uh reed. I know you've been listening for a little while. How are you liking the conference as well? Oh, it's great. Yeah a very

151
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:09,220
wide range of people here from uh, community to corporate uh, and and lots to learn lots to

152
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,680
Lots to see and lots of great people to meet.

153
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,920
Any standout sessions for either of you?

154
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:20,120
There was a beer brewing with IoT and JavaScript

155
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:24,400
that I knew almost nothing about any of those subjects.

156
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,600
And now I know a little bit about all of those subjects.

157
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,760
You're at the Dunning-Kruger effect style moment, right?

158
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,000
Where you don't realize how little you actually know.

159
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,520
You feel vaguely competent.

160
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,400
Completely.

161
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,560
How about you, John?

162
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,800
There was a great, it was half of a two for one

163
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,120
that was on burnout.

164
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:43,600
And it was a really good just kind of think

165
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,760
about not burning out and ways to kind of handle that stress

166
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,200
and take breaks and things like that.

167
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:50,840
Yeah, very good.

168
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:55,240
I've certainly found burnout myself at times

169
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,240
can be quite challenging to deal with,

170
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,160
particularly during the last couple of years.

171
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,080
So it's very good.

172
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,920
Well, I wish you all the best for the rest of the afternoon.

173
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,840
And I hope you enjoy the rest of the conference.

174
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,680
Thank you.

175
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,560
I do hear what you're saying in there, though,

176
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,120
that it's a pretty wide range that All Things Open

177
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,120
is trying to cover.

178
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,880
Although I like the idea about having sessions on burnout.

179
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,280
And who doesn't like a session about automating beer brewing

180
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:21,840
with Linux and open source technologies, huh?

181
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:25,200
So the nice thing was the Raleigh downtown

182
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,880
is a pretty small little place if you've never been.

183
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:31,240
And Red Hat Tower, as we call it, The Tower,

184
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,200
is only two blocks from the convention center,

185
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,320
a short five minute walk.

186
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:39,240
So I was able to meet up with these listeners, Reed and John,

187
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,920
and take them to lunch at The Tower today, which,

188
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,360
as we record, is Wednesday.

189
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,400
Oh, good, did you get more sauce while you were there?

190
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,200
Alex likes to pick up a little extra sauce

191
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,880
while he's at the Red Hat Tower.

192
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,000
So I think what Chris is referring to there

193
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,240
is Boar's Head, you know the sandwich company?

194
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:56,920
You think.

195
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,320
You know what I'm referring to.

196
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,800
Make this absolutely delicious, gourmet, spicy mayonnaise,

197
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,400
chipotle mayonnaise style thing.

198
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,480
Yeah, no, it's great.

199
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:05,960
It is.

200
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,600
And I cannot get enough of it on turkey and provolone sandwiches

201
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,000
when I'm at home during the day.

202
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,960
So what I used to do at The Tower before COVID

203
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,400
was any time I went in The Tower,

204
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:17,000
I used to go in and buy a bottle of this sauce off the vendor

205
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,360
for, I don't know, like $10.

206
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,200
To put it in context, a tiny little tub of this stuff

207
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,320
from the supermarket is $5.

208
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,160
But a commercial catering size bottle of this sauce,

209
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,200
he gave me for $10 a time.

210
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,280
So I used to just slather this stuff on.

211
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,920
Whereas now I have to treat it like gold dust

212
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,720
because we've got different vendors now after COVID.

213
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,320
That's a bummer.

214
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,400
OK, all right.

215
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,760
So lunch at The Tower, that's awfully nice.

216
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,640
That sounds great.

217
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,480
Yeah, it was nice.

218
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,120
We also met up with Jay from Learnernix TV.

219
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,040
Not going to mess up the creative process.

220
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,240
I'm here with Jay from Learnernix TV.

221
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:53,760
Hello, Jay.

222
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,360
How are you?

223
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:54,880
Doing well.

224
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,640
How are you?

225
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:59,080
Yeah, I went to your talk yesterday on RetroPie

226
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:03,040
and how you're saving retro gaming from oblivion.

227
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:07,920
Yeah, so basically my setup is such that sync thing

228
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,640
syncs all of my RetroPies together.

229
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:13,000
So if I'm on my handheld RetroPie or the one on the TV,

230
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,720
I could play a game, save the game, then go to the couch.

231
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,080
And it's the same save file.

232
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,360
The ROMs and everything all sync to each other.

233
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,880
So it's just like this thing where my save files just

234
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,680
follow me around.

235
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,640
It's just one of the amazing things

236
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,680
that you could do with technology that you might not

237
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,120
think about right off the top of your head.

238
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,000
But if you put your mind to it, a little bit of creativity,

239
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,160
you'd be surprised what you could come up with.

240
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,320
Turns out if you try hard enough, you can, huh?

241
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:34,720
Yeah.

242
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,520
You're one of the few people on planet Earth

243
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:39,400
that's got their hands on the CM4 module, right?

244
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,600
How's that working out for you?

245
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,200
What are you using that for?

246
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,040
So actually, I have a Turing Pi.

247
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,760
So I have four of those in there.

248
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,040
And then I have one in the handheld RetroPie.

249
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,680
So it's actually working out really well.

250
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,600
And the one that I have in the RetroPie,

251
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,120
if it wasn't for Jeff Gehrling, I

252
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,840
wouldn't have it because he actually

253
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,560
messaged me on Twitter like, hey, they have inventory over here.

254
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,400
So if it wasn't for him, I wouldn't have it.

255
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,760
But I actually got the first ones before they got hard to find.

256
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,280
And then later on, like right now, what are they going for?

257
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,520
Some crazy amount of money?

258
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,320
I dread to think.

259
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,240
I haven't looked.

260
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:13,560
But it's more than double, I think, MSRP.

261
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,560
It's ridiculous, especially the people

262
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,360
that just want to have fun, set up something in their home lab.

263
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,320
They have to navigate scalpers and everything

264
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,040
just to work on the fun projects that they want to work on.

265
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,080
I think that's terrible.

266
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,960
We just want to have fun with our technology.

267
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,580
So how are you finding all things open?

268
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,240
Is this your first one?

269
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,080
Very first one.

270
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,920
So it is very fun.

271
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,000
We have a lot of cool people here.

272
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,960
System76 is here, Red Hat, AlmaLinux,

273
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,960
like a bunch of open source projects.

274
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,320
There's GitLab, Moodle, like countless others.

275
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:44,640
It's just so much fun to just network with people,

276
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,260
especially you.

277
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:47,120
I haven't met you in person until this time,

278
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,360
until this event too.

279
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,160
So I'm meeting really cool people.

280
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,320
And I wouldn't trade it for anything.

281
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,840
Yeah, there's something special about an open source

282
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,600
conference, is there?

283
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,040
Well, thank you very much, Jay.

284
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,160
And enjoy the rest of your conference.

285
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,960
I agree with Jay.

286
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,760
SyncThing for the win.

287
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:05,160
Absolutely one of the MVPs of the last few years for me

288
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,400
has been SyncThing.

289
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,840
Just my background ambient file system sync.

290
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:11,640
I have Dropbox.

291
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,600
You know, I have Nextcloud.

292
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,100
I've tried these different things.

293
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:18,480
I think of that as active, persistent syncing.

294
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,040
You see it.

295
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,160
It's got a status.

296
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,880
You know it's happening.

297
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,960
You can bring up the app.

298
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,520
You can look at what's synced.

299
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,680
I kind of look at SyncThing.

300
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,600
You can do all those things with SyncThing.

301
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,560
There's even system tray icons you can get.

302
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:33,360
But I kind of think of SyncThing as this ambient background

303
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,440
sync that's actually syncing file systems around.

304
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,480
And it doesn't care where you store something.

305
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,400
It doesn't have to be in a particular directory

306
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,440
like Nextcloud or Dropbox does.

307
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,380
It can be anything, anywhere on your file system.

308
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,040
It's pretty cool.

309
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:50,400
And Jay was using it to sync his Steam Deck emulator

310
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,160
progress with his RetroPie TV emulator progress.

311
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,720
So that no matter where he was, his retro games

312
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,400
were in sync, which is pretty cool.

313
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,800
That's a great idea.

314
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,880
That's a great idea because you don't

315
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,320
want to lose progress when you move between devices.

316
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,840
So maybe next year, I'll see you at all things open.

317
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,460
And in the meantime, keep an eye on the Meetup page

318
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:16,160
at meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

319
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,280
lino.com slash SSH.

320
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,600
That's where you go to get $100 on a new account

321
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,520
and support the show.

322
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,680
lino.com slash SSH.

323
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,400
We were just talking about events.

324
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,320
That's how I discovered Linode.

325
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,360
It was at a Texas Linux Fest many years ago

326
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,160
in the before times.

327
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,520
And I could tell Texas Linux Fest was special

328
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:39,480
because it was small, but the signal was very strong.

329
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,360
You know what I mean?

330
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:43,880
The talks were by heavy hitters who knew their stuff.

331
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,040
They were passionate about their projects.

332
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:49,560
But the vendors weren't taking it very seriously,

333
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,600
except for Linode.

334
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,900
Linode had a real serious setup.

335
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,200
They were clearly participating.

336
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,440
They would swap so somebody could be at the booth

337
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,180
while somebody could actually attend the sessions.

338
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,080
You could tell they were into it.

339
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,000
And that's when I made a mental note.

340
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,560
I need to check out Linode.

341
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,880
That's almost four years ago now.

342
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,900
And now here they are, right?

343
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,360
They've been sponsoring the self-hosted podcast

344
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,800
from the get-go because it's just the perfect combination

345
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,560
of performance, features, price.

346
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,240
I mean, 30% to 50% cheaper than all the hyperscalers

347
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,080
out there.

348
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,600
And if you like to go to events, and I know you might,

349
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,800
if you're gonna go to the Web Summit,

350
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,360
November 1st through the 4th, Linode's gonna be there.

351
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,320
IT Nation Connect in Orlando, Florida,

352
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,880
the 9th through the 11th, Linode's gonna be there.

353
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,840
There's actually a whole list of events

354
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,060
that Linode's going to.

355
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:38,900
But try it out.

356
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,400
Even if you're not going to an event, try it out

357
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,720
because it's great performance.

358
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,280
They have systems with super fast CPUs,

359
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,680
MVME hard drives, 40 gigabit connections,

360
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,760
and they're spinning up like a dozen new data centers

361
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,300
next year, so there's just gonna be more and more choice.

362
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,880
So go get the $100 and actually kick the tires

363
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,960
because with that $100, you can actually try it.

364
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,200
You can really see what works and what doesn't work.

365
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,080
Like, you really can try any feature you want

366
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,280
with that $100.

367
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,060
So go with just about, I would imagine.

368
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:06,900
I don't know.

369
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,360
If you're out, you could probably come up with a way

370
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,000
to spend that $100 in like one day.

371
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,840
But you could also stretch it out for like 60 days.

372
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:16,480
So go to linode.com slash SSH, sign up, try it out,

373
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,600
and support the show.

374
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,100
Linode.com slash SSH.

375
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:26,880
Rumor has it that the HA Yellow is in production?

376
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,960
It's here, Alex.

377
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,920
It's here, it's live, and it's glorious.

378
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,580
The Home Assistant Yellow finally arrived

379
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:37,260
about a year after I crowdfunded it.

380
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,720
I decided, when I saw that it was shipping,

381
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,580
I decided to order an MVME drive for it.

382
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:46,240
Mine came with a CM4.

383
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,080
I could have sworn I ordered it without a CM4,

384
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,020
a Compute Module 4, but it came with one, which is okay.

385
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:57,440
My CM4s have eight gigs of RAM, but whatever.

386
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,280
So this one only has four, but that's fine, or maybe two.

387
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,380
I don't know what it is.

388
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:04,720
It's not enough, but we're getting by.

389
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,400
I hit that, but the first thing I did

390
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,480
is I put that MVME disk in there.

391
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:13,220
I powered the thing up and discovered very quickly

392
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:16,400
that it was just running off of the built-in eMMC

393
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,760
and wasn't using my MVME disk.

394
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:23,160
And I thought, well, now, what am I supposed to do with this?

395
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,320
Just throw it in the garbage.

396
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,160
Get rid of it.

397
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:26,980
Bye-bye.

398
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:29,200
And I was digging through the system settings,

399
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,860
and I go in the storage area,

400
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:33,440
and in the hamburger menu, there's this migrate option.

401
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,960
So I hit that, and it says,

402
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,920
we're gonna move your data over to another disk.

403
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,560
What disk would you like to use?

404
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:42,760
And the only disk I had available was the new MVME,

405
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,640
about a terabyte.

406
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,700
It says, okay, well, this will take about 15 minutes,

407
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,720
and then we're gonna reboot, and we'll see you then.

408
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,820
So I say, okay, go ahead.

409
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,440
I hit that button.

410
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,560
Little thing starts spinning.

411
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,400
And I just couldn't watch it.

412
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,280
I couldn't, it was too stressful,

413
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,280
because I didn't know what it was doing.

414
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:06,200
Because again, when it's all like web UI and their own OS,

415
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,940
I have no idea what's happening.

416
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:10,160
If they told me to go like, you know,

417
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:13,360
repartition a disk and format it, mount it,

418
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,400
and then update your configuration file

419
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,000
to point to the new mount point,

420
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,240
I'd feel like really solid.

421
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,380
Like, okay, all right, I know I'm done.

422
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:23,320
But you know, that's not gonna work for most people.

423
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,900
They wanna make it all a gooey option.

424
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,520
So okay, I'll try it.

425
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:30,460
So I go to bed, and I wake up the next morning,

426
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:33,320
and I go to the storage area in the settings.

427
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,800
Everything's working, by the way.

428
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,320
I go to the storage area in the settings,

429
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,720
and now it just says like 900 gigs free.

430
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,760
I think it moved everything off of the eMMC,

431
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:45,040
and it moved everything to the MVME.

432
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:48,320
I'm not sure exactly what happened,

433
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,120
because it's kind of, it's all kind of abstracted for me.

434
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:57,040
But the performance is so much better.

435
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:01,280
And I have to say, I am very happy with the results.

436
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,560
I could not ask for anything better.

437
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,660
And I also decided to just start fresh.

438
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:08,720
I went clean, I did not restore my backups.

439
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,040
I didn't try to import my old settings.

440
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:15,040
I just said, I'm gonna burn three or four days straight,

441
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,440
and I'm just gonna reset it up.

442
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:20,620
And I literally probably spent three days resetting it up.

443
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:22,180
There is a good argument to, you know,

444
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:24,880
nuking and paving systems every now and again.

445
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,140
I remember back in the day,

446
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:30,560
I used to nuke and pave windows every six weeks sometimes,

447
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:33,080
you know, because it was just that crusty.

448
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,880
You still have to, hasn't changed.

449
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,160
And then, you know, when I get a new phone these days,

450
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,280
still out of force of habit,

451
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,560
I'll start from scratch with a new phone.

452
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:45,000
But I don't know, like my MacBook here

453
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,720
has got the same install on it as when it came with it.

454
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,460
Like, I don't feel the need to do that anymore.

455
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:55,340
But Home Assistant, huh, there's so much stuff in there

456
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:57,120
that I've painstakingly created.

457
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,900
I don't think I could do it.

458
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,280
I don't think I could do it.

459
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:03,200
I had a couple of moments, I think, that saved me.

460
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,080
One was, I downloaded my old backup

461
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,120
from the Raspberry Pi that died,

462
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,760
and I extracted it manually,

463
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,140
and I opened up my configuration YAML,

464
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:15,840
and I kind of grabbed a few key things

465
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:20,060
that I knew I wanted, like my generic thermostat stuff,

466
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:22,620
all of my integrations for my cameras.

467
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,320
I just grabbed that stuff.

468
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,020
So I didn't take the whole config file,

469
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,560
but I just took the bits

470
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:30,200
that I didn't want to have to recreate from whole cloth.

471
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,080
That was one thing that I think helped a lot,

472
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,960
is I still used my old config file quite a bit.

473
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,540
But the other thing was,

474
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,040
the Z-Wave migration turned out

475
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,460
to be a lot easier than I expected.

476
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,620
The Z-Wave controller had everything

477
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,380
on the network paired to it.

478
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:47,360
And so when I took that USB dongle,

479
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,520
and I plugged it into the new Home Assistant Yellow,

480
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:56,160
all of the nodes were still paired to that controller.

481
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:00,480
They all showed up as brand new devices to Home Assistant.

482
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,280
But all of the networking was already done.

483
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:06,880
All the node order, all of that was already done.

484
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,160
And so Home Assistant, just using the new integration,

485
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:14,160
just said, oh, look at all these Z-Wave devices you have.

486
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:17,400
This is incredible.

487
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,920
And so the only part that was a pain in the butt

488
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,640
was I did have to sit there,

489
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:24,640
and this was one of the seriously labor-intensive tasks,

490
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,440
and rename every entity, every device entry,

491
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,520
just sit there and rename them,

492
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,960
because it just generates these stupid-ass names.

493
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,760
You know what would be really great?

494
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,600
Imagine if Home Assistant had this paperclip in the corner

495
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,560
that popped up and said,

496
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:42,200
hey, I noticed you've got some new devices.

497
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,080
Do you wanna set those up?

498
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,800
I mean, super helpful.

499
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,120
I don't think anyone's done that before, have they?

500
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,080
Just something that said,

501
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,520
hey, would you like to just say what you wanna call it now,

502
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,360
so that way you don't spend the next two days

503
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,200
renaming all these things?

504
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,120
Because of course, my sensors,

505
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,680
every single one of my sensors

506
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:01,600
has eight different entities that it puts in there, right?

507
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,240
All of my power switches

508
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,040
have three or four different entities

509
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:05,880
that they put into there.

510
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,800
So it's just so, so many items.

511
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,640
That's a good point.

512
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,360
The onboarding workflow of a new device,

513
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,200
I think, could actually use some work in that respect.

514
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,680
Some kind of a wizard or something.

515
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,760
I should say.

516
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,840
So that's my criticism, but I should say,

517
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:25,360
wow, it has gotten so much easier to set up Home Assistant.

518
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,480
There's so many more UI options for stuff now.

519
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,040
Like scripts, when you're writing a script,

520
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,360
you know, the script thing.

521
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,280
You can just reorder items now.

522
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:37,040
Oh God, I used to have to rewrite the script

523
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,120
or I'll do it in YAML in the past.

524
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,400
Now you can just reorder items.

525
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,560
It's incredible, the stuff,

526
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:47,600
just the friction that they, over time, have smoothed out.

527
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,680
It reminded me of like, if you've been playing an MMO

528
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:53,080
since it launched, like say, Star Trek Online,

529
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,800
and you've been playing it since it launched,

530
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,560
and you've been playing it for like 10 years.

531
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,920
And so like, you're just at the end game

532
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,880
and you've been at the end game for years.

533
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,780
And then you decide to go create an alt account

534
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:04,200
and you start over from the beginning

535
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,760
and you realize they've completely redone

536
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,040
the beginning of the game.

537
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,600
A totally new tutorial,

538
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,480
a totally new introduction to the game,

539
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,760
a whole new story arc.

540
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,340
And you're like, wow, this is so much better

541
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:17,440
than when I tried this years ago.

542
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,160
That's where Home Assistant is at now.

543
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,600
It is so much easier to set up.

544
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,440
Interesting.

545
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,240
Well, maybe I should do a new compave.

546
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,120
Just in the interests of science and the show

547
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,120
and stuff like that, huh?

548
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,120
I feel like it was a lot simpler.

549
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,120
I mean, yeah, I had to go through the whole rename thing.

550
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,480
Here's the other thing that's been a lot easier

551
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,000
this time around.

552
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,440
As of right now, I don't have a single automation.

553
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,480
You look smug about that.

554
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,720
Why do you look smug about that?

555
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,560
Oh, I don't know.

556
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:43,240
My last box, I probably had like 15 automations

557
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,120
and now I don't have a single automation.

558
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,960
And I mean, if you think about it,

559
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,800
I'm sure I will have one eventually.

560
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,600
It's so much simpler.

561
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:54,960
So I have used the scheduler card custom component

562
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,080
that lets me schedule things in a UI

563
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,960
that is so much more intuitive than using an automation,

564
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,760
that controls the lights and the outdoor stuff,

565
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,160
so much simpler.

566
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,520
And then I've gone all in on thermostat.

567
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,840
So I use the generic thermostat,

568
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:12,440
which combines a temperature sensor with a smart plug.

569
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:17,080
So the temperature sensor is used as the thermostat data

570
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,480
and the smart plug gets toggled on and off.

571
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,720
And I just set the temperatures

572
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:26,000
using generic thermostats now, it's so much easier.

573
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,920
My first pass, they didn't have generic thermostats.

574
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:32,600
And so I was doing automations based on temperature ranges

575
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,240
and sensor data and it was all manual.

576
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,560
And now it's just so smooth.

577
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:40,200
And so that made it a lot easier too.

578
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,880
Not having to like rebuild my automations

579
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,120
was a huge time saver.

580
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,360
And so using the scheduler card,

581
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,920
which I will link in,

582
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,280
it's not the scheduler integration,

583
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,520
that's something different.

584
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,840
You want the scheduler card,

585
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,480
I'll have a link to that in the show notes.

586
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,760
And the generic thermostat,

587
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,000
that is just something built into Home Assistant.

588
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,320
Those two things together saved me a ton of ache.

589
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,520
And because the scheduler card allows for things

590
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:08,880
like presence detection, sunset information,

591
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,720
those types of things,

592
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,040
I was able to avoid creating automations

593
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,440
for things that I used to do all the time.

594
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,280
Nice.

595
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,880
Yeah, oh, it's so great.

596
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,200
It's so great and it's so fast, Alex.

597
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,360
Well, that's what happens when you have real storage,

598
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,640
like an NVMe disk.

599
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:26,960
Home Assistant is making a lot of little transactions,

600
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:31,160
which an SD card or even something hanging off the USB bus

601
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,920
just isn't optimized for.

602
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,680
It didn't feel like a problem,

603
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:37,600
but now it's so fast that like,

604
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,440
have you ever had that thing

605
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,480
where you accidentally like double tap

606
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,320
or something like that?

607
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,360
Like you just kind of like have a finger spasm

608
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,120
and you tap twice when you mean to tap once

609
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,880
or something like that?

610
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,720
Yes.

611
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,920
It's so fast that like, it'll hit it.

612
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,760
It'll boom, boom.

613
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,240
Like when I do that double tap spasm,

614
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,120
light on, light off, just boom, boom.

615
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,480
It's incredible.

616
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:59,160
There's just, there's literally no delay at all.

617
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,440
And I am so happy with the Home Assistant Yellow

618
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,240
using NVMe storage.

619
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,480
I don't even mind that it's running

620
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,640
its own operating system.

621
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,600
I'm all in right now.

622
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,440
And it's been funny watching my snapshots

623
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,960
as I've configured this thing

624
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:15,040
when I first started like a 300 kilobyte snapshot

625
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,560
and then a megabyte.

626
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,600
And then two megabytes.

627
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,600
And now my snapshots are like 60 megabytes, right?

628
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,600
It's just as I keep building the system out,

629
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,040
like the backups keep getting bigger and bigger.

630
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,640
I love it, but you are such a nerd.

631
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,920
On my old Pi, I think like the Home Assistant backups

632
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,160
were like 1.2 gigabytes.

633
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,720
And now they're like 70, 80 megabytes

634
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,560
or something around there.

635
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:38,720
They're just totally, it's a totally leaner, meaner system.

636
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,320
Well, there's a lot of advantages to that.

637
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,560
And I had to take some remedial action

638
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,760
with one of my shellies this week.

639
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,840
My Shelley 2.5 that Brent, the wonderful Brent

640
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,320
helped me install whilst he was here,

641
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:54,160
that controls my outdoor rear floodlights.

642
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,280
We were down at the fire pit

643
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,840
and I had the lights on the back of the house.

644
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,120
So it was lighting up the yard a little bit.

645
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:03,360
Every 30 to 60 seconds, they would just turn off

646
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,080
for a second and then turn back on for 30 seconds

647
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,360
and then turn off and then turn back on.

648
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,760
And I'm like, what are you doing?

649
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,160
That's not good, no.

650
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,400
So I go in the Shelley app and then for some reason

651
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,360
the device is rebooting and resetting itself.

652
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,480
So I have to catch the Shelley app just at the right time

653
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,000
where the device is on the network

654
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,800
to even get network connectivity,

655
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,920
to get it to load in the app properly

656
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,200
before it resets itself.

657
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,760
Turns out it only did that when it was under load

658
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,600
with the lights on.

659
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,520
So my guess is there was some kind of a threshold

660
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:37,600
of maybe temperature, I don't know, being met.

661
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,760
So I did a bit of research and this led me to

662
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,840
something I've done in the past

663
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,160
on a couple of my other shellies,

664
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,320
which is replace the stock firmware,

665
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,960
the Mongoose OS that comes on the Shelley

666
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,280
with one of the more open firmwares,

667
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,360
Tasmota or an ESP home.

668
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,600
There's a link in the show notes,

669
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,240
but essentially the gist is this.

670
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,780
The Shelley is shipped with non-standard

671
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:04,360
Dupont pin-sized, I don't know what you call it,

672
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:07,880
jumper pins, where you see you can connect them over USB

673
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:10,780
with a serial device and reprogram the Shelleys that way

674
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:13,520
and manually flash the firmware onto them that way.

675
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:16,760
But this Shelleys already in my wall neatly tucked away

676
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,660
and I don't want to be pulling it out

677
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:21,960
and doing that kind of thing, really, if I can avoid it.

678
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,640
So I thought I'd try and find a way

679
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,560
that does it over the air.

680
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:30,120
And in the linked blog post, there is a tool called MG2X.

681
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:35,100
And this thing allows you to put Tasmota

682
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,980
directly onto the Shelley,

683
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:39,880
just by using an over the air firmware upload.

684
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:44,880
And within about 45 seconds, I'd replace the default OS

685
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:47,640
with a single command in my browser.

686
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,480
That's great.

687
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:52,160
Is it using a built-in tool or is it an exploit?

688
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,000
I think it must be.

689
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,120
There's no, you know, we've talked about

690
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,640
two-year convert in the past,

691
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,940
which basically created a man in the middle

692
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:02,020
for these third-party updating things,

693
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:04,840
which then spoofed the update server.

694
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:05,920
None of that stuff is needed

695
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,400
because the Shelleys are a lot more open than that.

696
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,760
So I think all it was doing was just providing through,

697
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,080
you know, when you go to a website

698
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,240
and you have like the question mark

699
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,960
and then a few parameters after the question mark,

700
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,160
essentially what it was doing was providing the URL

701
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:21,680
for the update to this custom firmware, minimal firmware,

702
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:25,360
to the over the air URL update feature

703
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,080
built directly into the web server of the existing Shelley.

704
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:32,040
So no weirdness, no hackery going on.

705
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:34,400
It's just a really cool project.

706
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,880
I see the Shelley plug S is supported.

707
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:40,080
I actually wasn't really planning to say this,

708
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,960
but I have noticed my least reliable device

709
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,640
in my new setup right now is my Shelley smart plug.

710
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,080
I've just had it go offline a couple of times.

711
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,320
None of my other devices have done that.

712
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,800
And I wonder if it isn't the OS

713
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,920
because the hardware seems pretty solid.

714
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,640
Well, I thought I'd put Tasmotor on there

715
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,600
because it has a temperature monitoring.

716
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,760
And that was, you know, where my mind went to originally

717
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:03,080
was well, is this device resetting

718
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:06,880
because there's a temperature limit set in the Mongoose OS

719
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,520
that Shelley ship on these things.

720
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:11,640
Uh oh, is my house about to catch fire and burn down.

721
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,920
Don't ignore this.

722
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:16,320
And when I, you know, throw both the light switches on

723
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,400
and put all the juice through this thing,

724
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,920
the maximum temperature it gets to is about 50 Celsius.

725
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,320
So it's totally fine.

726
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,800
It's nothing to worry about from what I can tell.

727
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,840
I don't really have anything negative to say

728
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,880
about Tasmotor on this thing.

729
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:31,800
I think my original goal was to actually put ESP home

730
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,400
on the Shelley, but I like Tasmotor so much,

731
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,680
I'm just gonna leave it there.

732
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,440
Yeah, why not, right, if it works.

733
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,560
Sometimes you compromise.

734
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,720
I did that.

735
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:44,560
There was one device that I completely forgot about this,

736
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,400
but it did happen.

737
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,680
There was one device I just had to toss out.

738
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,320
It was a HomeKit device.

739
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,640
It was an LED light strip I bought

740
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:52,640
that worked with HomeKit.

741
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:53,680
But you know what the issue was,

742
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:56,160
is I lost the HomeKit pairing code.

743
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:59,100
Not only did I lose the HomeKit pairing code,

744
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:01,480
but I cannot figure out for the life of me

745
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,680
how to get this thing to try to like reintroduce itself

746
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,640
to the HomeKit network.

747
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:09,200
And I just, I didn't want Wi-Fi, ZigBee, Z-Wave,

748
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,520
and HomeKit, right.

749
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,200
Like I just don't need all of it.

750
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,160
And so I went over to Amazon

751
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:20,460
and I picked up the Zengled ZigBee smart LED light strip.

752
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:25,260
It's a 16.4 foot smart light strip.

753
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:29,700
Now I know guys, I know, I know.

754
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:34,640
There are ways you can build Z-Wave or ZigBee devices

755
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,320
for pennies on the dollar compared to this.

756
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,000
I understand that.

757
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,180
Here's the situation.

758
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:44,320
I deployed my new system and the kitchen light strip,

759
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,560
this is the one that my wife uses

760
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,800
while she's cooking to get a little extra light,

761
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,440
wasn't working.

762
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,000
Cause it's a HomeKit one.

763
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,760
And she wanted something fast.

764
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,040
And the wife approval factor was declining

765
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,200
with the new server quickly.

766
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:03,040
So I snapped up this Zengled ZigBee smart LED strip.

767
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,200
I don't know if I'm saying it right.

768
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,800
It's got LEDs in it and it's got smarts in it.

769
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,560
And it says it's for Alexa and Google.

770
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,940
It's just a ZigBee device.

771
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:15,720
And so you just, if you have a ZigBee controller,

772
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:18,600
you just get it, you know, doing the ZigBee thing

773
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,960
and you can control it immediately with Home Assistant.

774
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:21,980
It picks it up.

775
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:24,640
You can control the colors, the brightness,

776
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,520
everything works, talks to it natively.

777
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,680
It's 60 bucks from Amazon,

778
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,460
but it is one of these things that you can just buy

779
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,840
and pair immediately natively to Home Assistant.

780
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:37,680
And we got it up and running in 15 minutes.

781
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,840
And man, did that solve the problem.

782
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,580
And now she's a hundred percent in on the new system.

783
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:44,080
So I just wanted to give that a plug.

784
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,640
If you're looking for an LED light strip

785
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,620
that you can hook to a ZigBee network

786
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:49,200
that works with Home Assistant,

787
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,760
I can vouch for this guy

788
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,520
and I'll put a link in the show notes.

789
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:56,920
It also comes with a remote, which I have not tried yet,

790
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,840
but I believe is also a ZigBee device.

791
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,760
It's just an on and off and brightness.

792
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,000
So it's a little physical remote

793
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,680
that you can mount anywhere.

794
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,760
And I would imagine once you tie it to Home Assistant,

795
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,880
it could control anything.

796
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,760
And the kit I got from Amazon for 60 bucks includes that.

797
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,280
It also includes a ZigBee hub, which I do not need.

798
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,440
Well, tell me about your jellyfin exploits this week.

799
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,620
You've been a busy boy.

800
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:18,720
Oh, geez.

801
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,540
Oh, geez, you wanna hear about this?

802
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:21,380
I mean.

803
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:22,320
Well, I don't know, do we?

804
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,160
You tell me, you tell us, let the audience be your guide.

805
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,200
All right, so it was going real well.

806
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,880
I mean, I thought to myself, here's what I'm gonna do.

807
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,040
I got this whole no container theory.

808
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,300
I think this is gonna work really well.

809
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:37,400
I'm gonna just install everything natively on Nix.

810
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:41,240
I'm gonna use the Nix package manager to manage everything.

811
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:44,080
And I wanted to get a sense of what this would be like

812
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,620
before I actually deployed it on my Odroid,

813
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:49,200
because I was waiting for an SSD hard drive

814
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,200
and a power cable for that hard drive,

815
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,760
which was a custom order piece.

816
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,920
So I thought in the meantime,

817
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,960
I'll deploy it on my HP dev one,

818
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,520
which already runs Nix OS.

819
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,760
And I'll just start reconfiguring that dev one,

820
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:05,760
like I would configure a home server.

821
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,580
So I took a external SSD that I had

822
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:12,680
from the old Raspberry Pi, and I connected that.

823
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,240
So that way I'd have some storage to work with

824
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,800
for a little bit, because it's just an experiment.

825
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,680
And I got that all mounted,

826
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:21,300
set up with ButterFS like a gentleman,

827
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:24,760
and set up Jellyfin on Nix OS,

828
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:27,340
set up Infuse on the Apple TV,

829
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,400
and I was really, really in a good spot.

830
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,960
I tried out Infuse this week because of you.

831
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:34,940
Oh yeah.

832
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:36,480
We went to the mountains last weekend

833
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,200
and LNE did a bit of entertainment in the car on the way.

834
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,840
So I thought, oh, well, Chris recommended Infuse on iOS.

835
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,720
So I downloaded a few YouTube videos

836
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,960
and copied a few files across.

837
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,840
Infuse is great.

838
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,240
Oh, you like it, good.

839
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,320
I really like it, yeah.

840
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,160
It's nice.

841
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,120
It is so nice.

842
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:58,160
And for me, it was a big, I felt like this was a,

843
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,900
this was my best shot for a Jellyfin adoption,

844
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:05,900
because we're using Infuse on Apple TV for Plex.

845
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,360
And so if I just changed the backend out to Jellyfin,

846
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,520
it's the same exact UI for the family members.

847
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,400
Like nobody would probably notice, right?

848
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,960
And now I could be using Jellyfin, right?

849
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,940
Ooh, you're a smart cookie.

850
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,320
I set it all up on the Nix box.

851
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,640
I got it all working with Infuse.

852
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,480
It was great.

853
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:25,960
Then one night, we spent one night out in the woods,

854
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,860
just recently, just like a couple of days ago.

855
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:29,160
We had one night to spend out,

856
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,720
just the wife and I in the woods,

857
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,560
between Halloween and other things going on.

858
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:36,900
And we get it all set up, candles are lit.

859
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:40,840
We had an excellent dinner, shared a bottle of wine.

860
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:45,040
We go back in the bedroom, turn on the television,

861
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,360
decide to watch a little TV.

862
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:50,920
I launched the Jellyfin app, and it auto-discovers,

863
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,560
like it has on all my other devices,

864
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,120
auto-discovers my Jellyfin instance.

865
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,160
I select the Jellyfin instance.

866
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,000
The wife looks over at me,

867
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
appreciating my hard work on setting all this up,

868
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,720
thinking how great I am.

869
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,600
I say, select that server,

870
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,960
and I get back an error message that says,

871
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,660
incompatible server version.

872
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,600
Now I'm in the woods where there's really no cell signal,

873
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,800
so there's no streaming.

874
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,480
I've got the room in romantic mode.

875
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,600
The wife's back there, she's thinking I've done great

876
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,140
getting this whole system rebuilt,

877
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:22,420
and I cannot get anything to play.

878
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,600
And the Jellyfin app just says, go screw yourself,

879
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,280
your server is out of date.

880
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,360
Because of course, and this happens every now and then,

881
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:33,940
Nix is really pretty much a bleeding edge

882
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:38,300
rolling distribution, but it depends on maintainers.

883
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:42,060
And Jellyfin is just currently out of date on Nix OS.

884
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,720
It's close to getting updated.

885
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,820
They have the next version in testing right now,

886
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:48,800
as of two days ago, it's really close.

887
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:52,280
I could technically install it if I wanted to right now.

888
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:55,160
But you know, if I wanna start playing with goodies,

889
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:57,040
like skip intro,

890
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,380
well, I'm gonna have to play with plugins,

891
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:02,440
because Infuse may not even support it if I do,

892
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:05,000
but Jellyfin doesn't seem to really have native support,

893
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,780
so I'm gonna have to get a plugin that does intro detection

894
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:11,520
and then automatically skips it server side

895
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,360
and then just streams that to Infuse.

896
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:15,840
I gotta like hack it around to get it all working

897
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:19,320
and to do that, I also need their fork of FFmpeg

898
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,960
and I also need everything

899
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,200
to be the absolute latest version.

900
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,080
All of a sudden, I'm pretty much just looking

901
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,240
at like the Linux server IO Jellyfin container

902
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,200
and thinking, why don't I just deploy that?

903
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,820
I'm right back at the container situation.

904
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:32,920
I'm right back where I began.

905
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:35,900
And then on top of that, I kinda missplex.

906
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:38,920
Like the skip intro stuff, huge for me.

907
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:42,280
I'm watching Star Trek Enterprise right now and I refuse.

908
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:45,240
I refuse to watch that intro.

909
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:48,920
I will never watch that intro again, ever.

910
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,680
I've watched it twice in my life,

911
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:53,980
when it premiered and when I played it for my wife.

912
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:56,040
And after that, I will never watch that intro again,

913
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:56,920
I refuse.

914
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:59,320
And the third time when you loaded up Jellyfin

915
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,160
and there wasn't this skip intro button.

916
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:03,040
Yes, yeah, oh my God, I came running across the room

917
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,680
for the remote, I'm like, no.

918
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:08,380
Yeah, and I had to fast forward like an animal.

919
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:09,800
And so, like I missed that.

920
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:12,400
Also, if you're using the native apps,

921
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,240
and I think you'll agree, Alex,

922
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,120
the Plex app is way better.

923
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:19,240
It's not perfect, but yeah, it is better.

924
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:22,420
Just the layout's better, the design, everything.

925
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:23,260
It's a shame.

926
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:25,360
If you're using Infuse, it's exactly the same.

927
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:29,440
But yeah, so I realized that this NixOS package

928
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,840
is gonna get updated.

929
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:33,160
And this won't be an issue for much longer.

930
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:35,200
But it could be an issue again.

931
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:40,200
And sometimes the TV breaks at absolutely

932
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:43,160
the worst moment possible.

933
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,400
And that's what happened to me, you know?

934
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,840
You know, and that's why I adopted Plex

935
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,320
and the Nvidia Shield as kind of like

936
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:52,300
the default media setup in the house.

937
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:58,560
Most of the time, and I would say more than 95% of the time,

938
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:03,920
Plex and the Nvidia Shield just get the job done reliably.

939
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:07,880
I am enjoying the real-time updates of Adia's face

940
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:10,840
in the Discord chat, are you enjoying that too?

941
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:13,760
They're having a good time, aren't they?

942
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,720
For the listeners, there's a picture of a lady,

943
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:20,720
it's not Adia, but just pulling a completely straight face

944
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,920
of, I asked him to put on Netflix.

945
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:24,840
He glances at me and starts fumbling

946
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:27,440
with some weird cable on his TV and laptop.

947
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:30,480
We sit there while he does something on his laptop

948
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,800
with a trembling finger and mumbles something

949
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,200
about torrents.

950
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,640
This one's hitting close to home.

951
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:38,480
Yes, it is.

952
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,080
Yeah, yeah, oh man.

953
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:42,840
Yeah, so, you know, the ironic thing is,

954
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:44,120
I mean, I do follow what you're saying,

955
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:46,520
but the ironic thing is, if we were watching

956
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:48,240
on the Apple TV with Infuse,

957
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,200
it wouldn't have been a problem,

958
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,800
but because we are on the Nvidia Shield

959
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:54,720
and it had auto-updated the Jellyfin app,

960
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,720
I just got this incompatible error.

961
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:00,760
But I will say, every time I try Jellyfin,

962
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:02,340
it gets a little bit better.

963
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:04,440
Of course, Plex is moving on as well at the same time,

964
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:05,680
which doesn't help.

965
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:09,200
But, you know, I think in the next year or two,

966
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,640
the tipping point will come.

967
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:14,280
We're really close to where Jellyfin will be good enough

968
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:16,480
to have that Chrome, you know, like skip intro,

969
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:20,000
that, you know, those little things that I really value.

970
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,480
And once we're there, I won't look back when I switch,

971
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:26,120
you know, when it's ready, it's gonna be amazing.

972
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:28,880
I think it's there for me now, we're using Infuse.

973
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:32,320
And so my plan is to absolutely deploy it

974
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:35,680
at home and then keep Plex at the studio.

975
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,520
So I'm like not giving up Plex,

976
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,340
I'm gonna have Plex running here at the studio

977
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:41,560
on the studio server where we have like,

978
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:45,520
JB Media, My Archived Media, we share it with people,

979
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,000
like that'll be the core Plex setup.

980
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,920
But then at my home setup,

981
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:50,920
that I'm gonna keep with Jellyfin.

982
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:52,400
And I haven't tried it yet,

983
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:57,400
but there is a plugin that lets you scan and skip intros.

984
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:00,200
It has a couple of limitations, but I think it makes sense.

985
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:04,700
The intro has to be within the first 25% of an episode

986
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:06,240
or the first 10 minutes.

987
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:09,720
And the intro has to be between 15 and two minutes long,

988
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:11,960
15 seconds and two minutes long.

989
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:13,120
And if it meets those criteria,

990
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:15,360
supposedly it can detect it and then mark it.

991
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:18,000
And then on the setting side,

992
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,440
you can just tell the Jellyfin server

993
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:22,840
automatically just skip it.

994
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:25,560
Don't even ask the client, just skip the intro.

995
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:28,280
And I think that'll be fine, that'll work for me.

996
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:29,720
And if that's the case,

997
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:32,000
then overall I'm very happy with Jellyfin.

998
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,040
I think it'll be good.

999
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:35,440
A lot of the work that Plex did

1000
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,560
with their sonic fingerprinting

1001
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:40,360
and all that kind of stuff to detect the intros

1002
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:42,740
was extremely impressive,

1003
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:45,720
but I think just given a bit more time.

1004
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:47,960
And Jellyfin is not a commercial project like Plex,

1005
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:50,560
of course, so they are gonna be in a different class

1006
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:54,600
of speed of development and polish and all that kind of stuff.

1007
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:57,080
I'm willing to accept those compromises

1008
00:45:57,080 --> 00:46:01,920
for my media library being air quotes free.

1009
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,720
And perhaps not monitored.

1010
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:05,240
I mean, I can't make that claim.

1011
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:06,480
I don't know if Plex is gonna monitor,

1012
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:07,960
but I could see how commercial interests

1013
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:11,760
would persuade them to, but also just that aside,

1014
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,160
Jellyfin works a little better offline than Plex does.

1015
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:17,200
And I am ultimately always trying to build this system

1016
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:20,440
to operate as seamlessly as possible

1017
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:22,460
with no internet connection.

1018
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:25,200
And with Plex, that sometimes falls down.

1019
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:28,080
Well, like we talked about with Rune last week,

1020
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:32,160
for you, where your internet connectivity comes and goes,

1021
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,720
something like Rune where it just has zero minutes

1022
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:39,680
of guaranteed offline playback is just not an option.

1023
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,140
I didn't renew my Rune.

1024
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:44,120
I didn't buy Rune after my free trial, by the way,

1025
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:45,360
in case anybody was interested.

1026
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:47,500
I thought about it long and hard after the episode,

1027
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:50,120
but in the end, I just couldn't do it.

1028
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:53,240
Yeah, Jellyfin is just that, it's like, what was it?

1029
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:57,480
Kodi, XBMC, it's like what that project could have been,

1030
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:00,120
you know, turned into, it's like the modern version of that.

1031
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:01,760
And I'm so happy to see it's moving

1032
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,440
from strength to strength.

1033
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,780

1042
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:31,440
All right, time for some feedback, I think.

1043
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,800
Julian F. writes in via matrix,

1044
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:36,860
I was excited to hear about the Mycroft Mark II,

1045
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:39,840
but then discovered Mycroft STT service

1046
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:42,400
is a proxy for Google's STT.

1047
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,840
I think that means speech to text.

1048
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:47,760
Has anyone found a comparison of various home assistants

1049
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:51,560
and how relatively good and private each system is?

1050
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:53,400
I noticed there's a Mycroft integration

1051
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:56,160
for home assistant, but is it any good?

1052
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,160
This is a tough problem.

1053
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:03,160
The voice assistant stuff is kind of necessary in my house.

1054
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Like that's how my kids prefer to interact

1055
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,080
with home assistant, and honestly,

1056
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:13,200
I'd say my wife probably 50% of the time-ish,

1057
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,480
somewhere in that range,

1058
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:17,840
she likes to interact with home assistant through voice.

1059
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:20,400
You guys know my solution has been the HomePod.

1060
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:24,840
The downside there is HomePods require internet

1061
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:26,160
to do the voice transcription,

1062
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:29,040
and they're doing it on Apple servers.

1063
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:33,300
The upside is that once it figures out what you're saying,

1064
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:35,180
it executes that over the LAN,

1065
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:37,200
where some devices use like an API

1066
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,360
and a cloud system and all that.

1067
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:41,080
I don't know if that's same for Mycroft,

1068
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:42,320
other than it sounds like they're using

1069
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:44,560
Google speech to text, which that's not ideal.

1070
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:46,080
Do you have a sense of this one, Alex?

1071
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:49,040
There are zero voice assistants deployed in production

1072
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:52,200
in this house, because as we've talked about several times,

1073
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:55,280
they are just getting worse and more annoying

1074
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:57,480
and more naggy, and hey, by the way,

1075
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:59,640
did you know that you, no, no, shut up.

1076
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:01,120
I just want to know what the weather is,

1077
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:04,240
or I'm not interested, okay?

1078
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:05,520
I've never really played around with it

1079
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,520
until just this most recent build,

1080
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:10,960
but when you subscribe to Nebuchadnezzar Cloud

1081
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:14,120
for Home Assistant, one of the features you get

1082
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:18,040
is their text-to-speech service.

1083
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:19,720
I don't know if you've tried it,

1084
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:22,040
but it sounds better than Google's.

1085
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:24,580
I did a little A-B comparison and had the family say

1086
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:25,880
which one they liked better.

1087
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:28,840
They all picked the Nebuchadnezzar text-to-speech service,

1088
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:30,640
and I mean, it's on their servers,

1089
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,320
so I don't know how, maybe they're just

1090
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:35,160
proxying somebody else, but I've been using that,

1091
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:37,120
so I have nighttime scripts,

1092
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:39,000
like we've talked about in the show before,

1093
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,620
and now, when the script kicks off,

1094
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:45,680
it uses the Nebuchadnezzar text-to-speech service

1095
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:49,160
to play on all the HomePods that the bedtime mode

1096
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:50,720
is starting, and everybody's got 15 minutes

1097
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:54,000
to get their ass to bed, and it sounds great,

1098
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,460
but it's not local.

1099
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:58,260
I imagine it's more private than using the Google one,

1100
00:49:58,260 --> 00:49:59,600
but it's not local.

1101
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:01,460
I'd love something local.

1102
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:03,520
It's something that could tie into a speaker.

1103
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:05,680
I don't care if I have to build the device for it,

1104
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:07,280
a little microphone.

1105
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:09,760
In fact, in a way, I'd prefer to build my own device

1106
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,480
because I could build it with badass microphones

1107
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:12,920
positioned right where I need them.

1108
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:15,920
That's the key, isn't it, local, local, local.

1109
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,320
Yeah, absolutely.

1110
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:20,600
We did link to the integration for Mycroft

1111
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:23,440
that Julian also included.

1112
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:25,400
If you know, let us know.

1113
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:28,880
If you've seen a comparison of Home Assistance,

1114
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:31,040
if you have a little bit of experience you've done,

1115
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:33,000
or if you have a Mycroft that you've tried

1116
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,120
with Home Assistant, let us know.

1117
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:37,780
Selfhosted.show slash contact,

1118
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:40,140
or you can send us a boost with a new podcast app,

1119
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:43,960
and speaking of boosts, Gene Bean came in this week

1120
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:48,480
with a really generous 20,480 SATs,

1121
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,360
and Gene has a question.

1122
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:52,240
How do y'all back up your Nextcloud?

1123
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:55,560
I'm running the snap version on Debian for now,

1124
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:58,400
it's just simplicity, but I'm totally game to change it

1125
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:01,240
as I have to migrate servers at some point anyways.

1126
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:02,680
So how do you back up your Nextcloud?

1127
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:03,920
Well, all of my containers,

1128
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:06,680
and I run Nextcloud in a container, of course,

1129
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:09,840
is they're all backed, all of their app data,

1130
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:11,960
which is what I call a kind of persistent data

1131
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:15,320
of these containers, they're all ZFS volumes,

1132
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:17,680
and then I just replicate those across the world

1133
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:19,160
to various different servers that I have.

1134
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:23,040
I've got one upstairs, so my main server's in the basement.

1135
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:26,920
I use ZFS Send, which is wrapped in Jim Salter's

1136
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:30,680
Sanoid and Syncoid tooling, to send it to a box

1137
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:32,120
that I have under my desk up here,

1138
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:34,700
which has just got a couple of 10 terabyte drives in it,

1139
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:37,920
as a full ZFS replication of what's in the basement

1140
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,480
in case of a pipe burst or something,

1141
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,360
and then I don't have to rely on the internet

1142
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:44,080
to get that data back.

1143
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:46,720
If this house blows down for whatever reason,

1144
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:48,680
then I've got stuff on the other side of the Atlantic

1145
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:50,200
that I can recover from.

1146
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:54,000
And then as a third prong to that backup strategy,

1147
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,640
I use Autoresstick as a wrapper around RESTIC

1148
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:00,640
to send my stuff over to Synology as well,

1149
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:03,120
and that does all the app data on a file level

1150
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,080
as opposed to ZFS's block level.

1151
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:08,080
So I've got kind of a two-prong approach

1152
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:10,480
to how I back up that data.

1153
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:12,720
I'm wondering what people do when they want to back up

1154
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:16,180
like 25 terabytes of data.

1155
00:52:16,180 --> 00:52:18,800
Well, the only option realistically

1156
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:21,320
is to either pay through the nose for Glacier

1157
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:23,480
or something like that with AWS,

1158
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:26,240
or to build a server and stick it at a friend's house.

1159
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:29,880
I mean, once you're getting above the sort of 20, 50,

1160
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:33,440
100 terabyte numbers, the monthly payments on that

1161
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:36,120
would pay for a server somewhere else pretty quickly.

1162
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:37,120
I think you're right.

1163
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:38,200
I think you're right.

1164
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:40,480
GeneBean also sent another 2048 SaaS just

1165
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:43,020
to say that he's really been enjoying the random live feeds

1166
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:45,720
over at jupyter.tube, and he's looking forward

1167
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:47,600
to deets on the Odroid.

1168
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:49,360
We don't mention it all the time.

1169
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:50,960
I hope we've mentioned it frequently,

1170
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:53,480
but if you don't know, we have been live streaming over

1171
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:58,080
at jupyter.tube, which is our own JB self-hosted instance

1172
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:00,840
of PeerTube, which is like a YouTube in a box.

1173
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:03,920
We mostly just use it to just record

1174
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,800
how we make the live show, or how we record

1175
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:07,000
the shows live and all that.

1176
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,240
But you could use it if you are an open source

1177
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:14,000
project, or a church, or like a city council,

1178
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,600
or a school district.

1179
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:18,300
You could use it as your own private YouTube instance

1180
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:21,480
with playlists, and accounts, and all that kind of stuff.

1181
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:25,760
User 9014, using Fountain, hasn't set their username.

1182
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:27,240
Boosted it with 1,200 sats.

1183
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:29,200
Tinkers will be tinkers.

1184
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,200
I'm trying to boost thing with the Fountain app.

1185
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:32,900
So far, I'm not really a fan of the app.

1186
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:34,800
I love the concept of value for value,

1187
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,920
but the app coming from Pocket Casts, to me,

1188
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:38,180
it's just not the same.

1189
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:41,080
Maybe it's just me being an asshole Android developer.

1190
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:43,080
I'll keep trying the other 2.0 apps.

1191
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:44,280
Thanks for the shows, though.

1192
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:44,880
I love them all.

1193
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:46,680
Sending love from Spain.

1194
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:49,680
Una Cerveza, por favor.

1195
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:52,560
I agree, it's an uphill adoption.

1196
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:53,920
I'm not going to lie to you.

1197
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:57,680
It took me a solid month to wrap my head around Fountain.

1198
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:00,600
Really, what made Fountain stick for me is I started discovering

1199
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:02,720
new podcasts through their clips feature.

1200
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:04,560
And then I was like, I was on board.

1201
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:06,120
But I've been hearing from some people,

1202
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:07,720
they'll stick with their favorite app,

1203
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:10,080
and they'll use Podverse.fm, the web app,

1204
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,360
to boost into the show.

1205
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:14,440
User 1692 wrote in with 1,500 sats.

1206
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:17,280
I just wanted to let you know that the Rune Lifetime used

1207
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:20,320
to only be $499.

1208
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:22,460
The CEO has threatened to pull it at some point,

1209
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:23,840
as it's not sustainable.

1210
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:26,560
And so I buckled and bought the Lifetime.

1211
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:30,040
A one-off purchase for me is way better than $10 a month.

1212
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:31,800
I just thought you'd like to know.

1213
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:33,880
I'm a bit more inclined for that kind of thing, too.

1214
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:36,080
I mean, $499 is a little rich for my blood.

1215
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:37,640
Well, it's $699 now.

1216
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:39,040
Yeah, and sometimes every now and then,

1217
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:40,680
those things have a Black Friday sale.

1218
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:46,120
Probably not Rune, but $500 for a Lifetime, I'd have to use it.

1219
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:49,520
I'd have to use it for at least five years consistently for me

1220
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,260
to start to at least.

1221
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:53,760
In the time since the last episode,

1222
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:56,360
my free trial has expired, as I mentioned.

1223
00:54:56,360 --> 00:55:02,160
But the feature voting section of the Rune forum,

1224
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:06,240
re-enabling offline grace period for the server

1225
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:09,040
has become their most requested feature ever

1226
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:11,600
in the space of a week, which I just think is amazing.

1227
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,400
That tells you something, doesn't it?

1228
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:15,700
It does, and it will be really interesting to see

1229
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:16,960
whether they listen or not.

1230
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:20,320
And that will dictate, for me, the posture of the company

1231
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:21,720
and the product moving forward.

1232
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:22,440
Huge signal.

1233
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:23,920
Depending on how they react to this

1234
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:26,440
will depend as to whether I become a customer or not.

1235
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:28,080
Yeah, you're right.

1236
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:29,840
This is a defining moment for them.

1237
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:31,120
It really is, yeah.

1238
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:34,000
I'm really grateful DexSword boosted in with 901 SATs,

1239
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,300
because I probably heard about this five times

1240
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:37,640
in this last week since I started

1241
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:38,680
talking about the Odroid.

1242
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:41,380
He says, have you guys looked at the Ximura board?

1243
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:44,320
I've been tempted to get one instead of a Raspberry Pi.

1244
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:47,060
I think we've talked about this on the show before, Alex.

1245
00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:48,960
We've had some feedback about it, definitely.

1246
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:52,480
It's one of those boards that just looks really cool,

1247
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:55,720
but I don't personally have a use case for it,

1248
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:57,000
so I haven't bought one.

1249
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,400
But the more of you becomes SREs,

1250
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:03,440
maybe we can think about buying one.

1251
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:04,840
How about that for a plug?

1252
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:05,720
There you go.

1253
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:11,440
I am just too skeptical to spend my own hard-earned money

1254
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:12,600
on this thing.

1255
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:14,800
I don't know, I think I've been burned too many times.

1256
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:19,780
It is a Intel quad core based system

1257
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:24,160
that is wrapped inside a, like it

1258
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:27,600
looks like it's a ruggedized case that has

1259
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:29,400
a heat sink that's built into it.

1260
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:30,960
And so it's almost something like you

1261
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:32,280
could install in a vehicle, which

1262
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:34,840
I think is one of the reasons why people have hit me up

1263
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:36,240
so much about it, because it looks

1264
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:39,480
like it's meant to be installed in a vehicle,

1265
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:41,240
because it's so ruggedized.

1266
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:43,880
So a company like Odroid has a track record,

1267
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:46,480
but the Zima people, Z-I-M-A, I don't

1268
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:47,680
know anything about them.

1269
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:48,760
I don't know if they're going to be around.

1270
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:50,720
It doesn't seem like many people have this.

1271
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:52,920
And if this thing isn't successful,

1272
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:55,440
does the company begin and end right here?

1273
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:57,400
Like I have so many questions about this device,

1274
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:59,520
too, in terms of performance and storage.

1275
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:02,640
And I just don't trust it enough to spend my own money

1276
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:04,280
to try it.

1277
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:06,560
I agree, it looks perfect for somebody like me.

1278
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:10,960
And it does have a PCI slot, which I would love.

1279
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:12,600
It's really strange, isn't it?

1280
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:19,600
So it's got a PCI 2.0 X4 PCIe slot, and two SATA ports,

1281
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:21,520
and two gigabit LAN ports.

1282
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:22,680
Yeah, it looks really good.

1283
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:26,320
So it would make a pretty good NAS kind of brain.

1284
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:27,840
I agree.

1285
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:30,600
It's just that the Odroid looks like a complete solution that's

1286
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:31,160
ready to go.

1287
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:33,480
And to this, this just looks like it's a Kickstarter.

1288
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:34,280
But I know it's not.

1289
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:35,760
Well, it was.

1290
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:36,840
Yeah, it was.

1291
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:39,360
It was, but it's been fulfilled now, I think,

1292
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:42,400
which is not guaranteed with Kickstarter, is it?

1293
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:44,000
I've just been burned so many times

1294
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,400
to spend $120 on something like this.

1295
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:49,920
But I really like the look of it.

1296
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:52,960
If the Odroid wasn't a thing, I may be tempted.

1297
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:54,760
It is close to that.

1298
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:56,680
But now, it just feels silly.

1299
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:57,680
I don't need it.

1300
00:57:57,680 --> 00:57:58,680
And yeah.

1301
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:02,440
I mean, with a PCIe 4X slot, you could do quite a lot

1302
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:03,120
with this thing.

1303
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:07,200
You could stick a couple of extra SSDs in there.

1304
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:10,640
You could put a 10 gig ethernet in there.

1305
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:12,800
I mean, you could do a lot of cool stuff with it.

1306
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:14,640
It's a bit of a weird form factor as well.

1307
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:16,640
It's kind of like got a heat sink built into it,

1308
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:18,840
and then the PCI slots hanging off the side.

1309
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:23,040
And what form factor is this designed for?

1310
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:27,240
It looks a little bit odd in that respect.

1311
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:29,880
But it's certainly something I'm keeping an eye on.

1312
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:30,400
All right.

1313
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:32,080
I'm going to try to move fast because we

1314
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:32,880
got some great ones.

1315
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:35,840
But I want to give a mention to MG boosted

1316
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:38,640
in a row of ducks, 222 SATs.

1317
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:41,480
So they've been very happy with LMS and Squeeze Light

1318
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:42,720
running on Pi's.

1319
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:44,760
So there's some more feedback there.

1320
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:46,640
J Cube sent their first boost this week,

1321
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:49,520
and they just started the show at episode 73.

1322
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:51,000
That's amazing.

1323
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,680
Neve came in with 2004 SATs.

1324
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:55,960
2004 is the year of NGINX.

1325
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:57,240
That's when it was created.

1326
00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:59,360
Ubuntu's first release.

1327
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:01,160
I didn't realize those two things.

1328
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:03,480
Gen 2 was not for weirdos at the time.

1329
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:06,260
That was the year Neve's car was built,

1330
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:08,880
and the first time they ever saw a terminal emulator.

1331
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:11,000
And they just wanted to share.

1332
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:14,320
And then Acorn wanted to know your favorite terminal app.

1333
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:17,600
They say they like Lazy Docker Project, Htop,

1334
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:18,520
those types of things.

1335
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:20,640
Do you have a terminal app that's

1336
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:23,600
one of your go-tos, besides the obvious Emacs?

1337
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:27,480
I think it must be Hollywood, that kind of one

1338
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:29,720
that makes me look like a legit hacker

1339
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:32,080
in the background with some of my live streams.

1340
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:33,200
That's a great answer.

1341
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:34,440
We got to put a link to that.

1342
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:35,280
Hollywood snap.

1343
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,440
I'll put a note right there.

1344
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:38,000
Check it out.

1345
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,120
There's a snap for it that makes your computer look

1346
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:41,760
like it's doing amazing things.

1347
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:43,120
That's a great answer.

1348
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:45,920
Bashtop is also a really great one,

1349
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:49,080
just in terms of just visualizations and whatnot.

1350
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:53,240
And then Thumbs comes in with our last boost, 10,000 SATs.

1351
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:56,880
Do you guys ever have memories of what you were listening

1352
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:59,560
to at a specific place?

1353
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:01,840
I just pulled into a parking lot I haven't

1354
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:03,860
been to in a couple of years, and I

1355
01:00:03,860 --> 01:00:05,560
was taken back to the moment.

1356
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:08,440
I was listening to episode two with Wendell.

1357
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:10,720
Thanks for the years of memories and great content.

1358
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:12,120
I'm a network member, but I thought

1359
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:14,600
you deserve some extra value for that memory.

1360
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:17,040
You know, for me, I can think of a JB memory.

1361
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:19,240
This was when I was doing my computer science masters

1362
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:23,880
back in 2015, 13, 14 period.

1363
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:26,080
And I was listening to you and Mike on Coda

1364
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:28,240
talk about whatever nonsense it was you

1365
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:30,000
were talking about at the time.

1366
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,360
And I thought, you know what?

1367
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:33,240
I actually know a little bit about this stuff.

1368
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:34,760
Maybe I should get a career in it.

1369
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:36,120
The funny thing about Coder, that

1370
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:38,880
might have been around the time we were interviewing

1371
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:41,320
the two co-founders of Docker before it was called Docker.

1372
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:42,120
I remember, yeah.

1373
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:44,920
And that is an old, if somebody can find that in the archives,

1374
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:47,520
that's a great, that's a really great old interview.

1375
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:48,840
Before it was even called Docker,

1376
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:49,920
I forget the name right now.

1377
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:51,720
Yeah, Mike always remembers.

1378
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:53,240
So that's my job is just to remember

1379
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:54,280
that we did the interview, and then he

1380
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:55,600
remembers what they called it.

1381
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:57,720
But they didn't start with Docker.

1382
01:00:57,720 --> 01:00:59,640
It's fascinating, too, because we asked them

1383
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:01,520
a little bit about their business ideas.

1384
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:03,240
People are still asking some of the questions we

1385
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:06,120
asked them in that interview.

1386
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:10,520
Thank you to Hannegan, or Hannegan, don't know,

1387
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:13,480
sent 3,000 sats, 5,000 sats from a Ninja Mort.

1388
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:14,560
No messages with those.

1389
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:16,200
They just sent them in when they were listening.

1390
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:17,400
We also got a few other boosts in there

1391
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:18,560
that didn't quite make it to the show,

1392
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:19,960
because we got to keep it tighter.

1393
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:21,840
But I just want to say thank you, everybody.

1394
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:22,760
It's a big motivator.

1395
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:25,160
It really is a nice boost to morale,

1396
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:27,160
and it's also a great way to show value.

1397
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:30,800
Go get a new podcast app at newpodcastapps.com,

1398
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:32,200
or become a member.

1399
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:35,360
You can go to selfhosted.show slash SRE,

1400
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:37,200
and invest in the ongoing production.

1401
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:39,000
A boost is a great way to say good job,

1402
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,840
or get a message on the show.

1403
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:42,400
And the membership is a great way

1404
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:44,120
to invest in ongoing production.

1405
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:46,840
Selfhosted.show slash SRE.

1406
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:48,520
We should probably mention The Matrix.

1407
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:49,920
I mean, we do have a Discord, too.

1408
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:51,520
That's been rocking the whole episode

1409
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:53,160
at selfhosted.show slash Discord.

1410
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:55,320
But maybe honorable mention for The Matrix,

1411
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:58,600
because it was useful for the meetup.

1412
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:03,360
Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash Matrix for deets on that.

1413
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:07,040
Thank you, Alex, because I know early this morning,

1414
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:10,080
when the OpenSSL patches went out,

1415
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:13,080
you got out and got the JB infrastructure all updated.

1416
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:14,600
So thank you for doing that for us.

1417
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:16,920
By the time this comes out, people know about that.

1418
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:17,480
Yeah.

1419
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:19,280
Well, there was a big vulnerability released

1420
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:21,160
this morning in OpenSSL.

1421
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:25,960
Only the second ever, I think, critical marked CVE,

1422
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:28,720
something to do with remote code execution.

1423
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:30,560
Actually, it turned out I didn't have to do a whole bunch,

1424
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:33,040
because I had already set up unattended upgrades

1425
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:35,200
in all of our Ubuntu boxes that we use.

1426
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:37,120
So by the time I'd logged in, it had already

1427
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:39,400
gone and done the unattended upgrade

1428
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:41,200
for the security patches.

1429
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:44,600
It was just an example, I suppose, of good sysadmining.

1430
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:47,080
But I went on to check anyway, just in case.

1431
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:48,240
You heard it here.

1432
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:49,640
You heard it here, everybody.

1433
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:52,680
Alex recommends using Ubuntu systems with auto updates.

1434
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:57,160
Yeah.

1435
01:02:57,160 --> 01:02:57,680
All right.

1436
01:02:57,680 --> 01:03:00,160
Well, it's still good to have it done, so thank you.

1437
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:02,360
If you'd like to send us your feedback, like I said,

1438
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:06,240
new podcast app or self-hosted.show slash contact.

1439
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:09,080
And you can go and find me over on Elon's latest play

1440
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:10,520
thing at Twitter.

1441
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:12,240
I am at Ironic Badger.

1442
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:14,720
I'm over there at Chris LAS.

1443
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:17,400
And the podcast is at Self-Hosted Show.

1444
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:20,480
$44 billion for a toy.

1445
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:21,280
Can you imagine?

1446
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:22,880
For a pain in the neck.

1447
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:24,800
Yeah, crazy.

1448
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:26,280
Anyway, thanks for listening, everybody.

1449
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:56,240
That was self-hosted.show slash 83.
