WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.300
Well, I'm pretty excited because I get to geek out this week.

00:02.300 --> 00:06.940
Matt, from Adventurous Way, a YouTube channel that Alex and I watch, is joining us.

00:06.940 --> 00:10.980
And Matt, you've got a ton of videos about RV travel, automation, self-hosting.

00:10.980 --> 00:17.320
And just recently, you and the wife bought 40 acres of raw land in central Vermont

00:17.320 --> 00:22.480
and are starting the long work of building a smart home from the ground up.

00:22.480 --> 00:23.780
Matt, welcome to the show.

00:23.780 --> 00:25.280
Thank you so much for having me.

00:25.280 --> 00:26.520
Are you crazy?

00:26.520 --> 00:31.920
I watch your videos and it looks like years of work ahead of you.

00:31.920 --> 00:32.920
It really is.

00:32.920 --> 00:36.600
Yeah, this is the start of a pretty long journey, I think.

00:36.600 --> 00:38.980
We are just at the very beginning of it.

00:38.980 --> 00:42.920
And yeah, I think we are probably a little bit crazy.

00:42.920 --> 00:46.120
I'm sure you've noticed, Chris, that I managed to coerce another Brit onto the show.

00:46.120 --> 00:50.360
I wanted to bring the average, you know, raise the standard a bit.

00:50.360 --> 00:52.000
Yeah, it wasn't lost on me.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.520
It wasn't lost on me at all.

00:53.520 --> 00:57.200
But, you know, Alex, there's like a ton of stuff we could talk to Matt about.

00:57.200 --> 01:00.300
But I thought maybe we'd start with what he and I have in common.

01:00.300 --> 01:04.840
When I first started watching your channel, you were doing a smart RV system similar to

01:04.840 --> 01:07.720
mine, Home Assistant, Victron, the whole work.

01:07.720 --> 01:10.320
So can you walk us through a little bit of what you built?

01:10.320 --> 01:15.000
Yeah, so we've been living full time in our RV now for about three years.

01:15.000 --> 01:20.680
We moved out of a perfectly good four bedroom home in the Bay Area, California, and into

01:20.680 --> 01:24.320
a 180 square foot box on wheels.

01:24.320 --> 01:29.760
So imagine about half the size of the average like master bedroom in the US.

01:29.760 --> 01:33.160
And that's been our entire home for the last three years.

01:33.160 --> 01:38.720
And so pretty quickly, we realized that we're both technologists, my partner and I are both

01:38.720 --> 01:44.200
sort of former software engineers and tech people, we kind of realized there's an opportunity

01:44.200 --> 01:48.120
here to use technology to make ourselves more comfortable.

01:48.120 --> 01:51.840
And that was really where this whole journey began.

01:51.840 --> 01:56.300
And so what started off as just like a hobby, it's pretty hard to have hobbies when you

01:56.300 --> 02:01.360
live in such a small space, if they're physical, we also don't have a backyard go and do gardening

02:01.360 --> 02:04.040
and I've given up my woodworking shop and things.

02:04.040 --> 02:07.520
So we really focused on digital hobbies.

02:07.520 --> 02:14.220
And so although I've been into some elements of self hosting and tech for many, many years,

02:14.220 --> 02:21.200
this for me really was an opportunity to go deep into into tech and the home automation

02:21.200 --> 02:22.200
side of things.

02:22.200 --> 02:28.140
So starting almost three years ago, I had a Raspberry Pi, and I loaded Home Assistant

02:28.140 --> 02:29.140
onto it.

02:29.140 --> 02:31.700
And that was kind of where I started.

02:31.700 --> 02:38.320
And within a matter of weeks, I was already overwhelming the Raspberry Pi, it must have

02:38.320 --> 02:44.400
been a model three, I guess back then, completely overwhelming what it was able to do.

02:44.400 --> 02:48.960
And I was like, I think it's I think it's time for an upgrade.

02:48.960 --> 02:52.720
Again, space, big concern for us here, as you know, living in an RV.

02:52.720 --> 02:53.720
And power draw as well.

02:53.720 --> 02:54.720
Right.

02:54.720 --> 02:55.720
And that's the nice thing about the Pi.

02:55.720 --> 02:56.720
Yeah.

02:56.720 --> 02:59.500
And the Pi was great because it could run off the DC voltage.

02:59.500 --> 03:02.380
And that was something that I wanted to stick with.

03:02.380 --> 03:06.860
So we upgraded to an eighth gen Intel NUC.

03:06.860 --> 03:09.360
It runs an i3 processor.

03:09.360 --> 03:13.700
And because it runs, I think it's like 19 volts that it actually runs on, I was able

03:13.700 --> 03:20.080
to avoid using the normal AC power brick, and instead run it straight off DC, using

03:20.080 --> 03:22.520
a DC boost converter.

03:22.520 --> 03:27.720
That has been running flawlessly now for almost three years, 24 seven.

03:27.720 --> 03:28.720
Nice.

03:28.720 --> 03:34.520
It's interesting you say that Matt, I think a few years ago, maybe five plus Plex was

03:34.520 --> 03:37.600
the gateway drug for a lot of people that got them into self hosting.

03:37.600 --> 03:40.000
I know you're a proponent of that as well.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.600
Home Assistant is the new gateway drug, don't you think?

03:42.600 --> 03:44.120
I think it is.

03:44.120 --> 03:49.380
And it's, it's literally the hub of the entire experience in our RV.

03:49.380 --> 03:53.280
It is even when we're consuming media, I've got Plex plugged into Home Assistant.

03:53.280 --> 03:57.400
And so it really is that that kind of entrance point for me.

03:57.400 --> 04:03.680
But I think it's becoming so accessible, and so easy to get up and running with the it's

04:03.680 --> 04:07.600
just attracting more and more people to this this kind of lifestyle and this this hobby.

04:07.600 --> 04:10.240
Well, I have a ton of questions for you, Matt.

04:10.240 --> 04:12.680
And in fact, I want to get into some of the details about your system.

04:12.680 --> 04:15.360
But I want to mention this episode is brought to you by a cloud guru.

04:15.360 --> 04:18.960
They are the leader in learning for cloud Linux and other modern tech skills, hundreds

04:18.960 --> 04:23.440
of courses and 1000s of hands on labs, get certified, get hired, get learning at a cloud

04:23.440 --> 04:24.440
guru.com.

04:24.440 --> 04:30.000
Matt, something you said there was that it was what struck you as well, we could use

04:30.000 --> 04:35.680
some of this technology to make life more comfortable in our tiny home.

04:35.680 --> 04:37.040
That's kind of how I got into it, too.

04:37.040 --> 04:39.800
And I'm curious, what was some of your very first automations?

04:39.800 --> 04:42.040
Was it was it around enabling boondocking?

04:42.040 --> 04:43.040
Was it around heating?

04:43.040 --> 04:44.040
Where did you start?

04:44.040 --> 04:49.320
Yeah, so for us, the scarcity of resources was one of our biggest challenges.

04:49.320 --> 04:54.640
Much like you, we have battle born lithium batteries, we have solar, but they're still

04:54.640 --> 04:55.640
finite.

04:55.640 --> 04:59.680
In three years on the road, we do not and have never owned a generator.

04:59.680 --> 05:03.520
So one of my big first priorities was how do I get power?

05:03.520 --> 05:07.420
We prefer to boondock rather than stay in RV parks.

05:07.420 --> 05:12.000
I think started last year, we did 100 days in a row of boondocking, just totally off

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
grid.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
Wow.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
100 days.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
That's impressive.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
Very nice.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
Wow.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.820
So when the pandemic first hit, we were just every 10 to 14 days, we would run into town

05:20.820 --> 05:24.600
to go and dump our tanks and fill up again and then back out into the middle of nowhere

05:24.600 --> 05:25.600
and carry on.

05:25.600 --> 05:29.620
Oh, look at you, you big show off.

05:29.620 --> 05:35.640
So one of the priorities with the home automation was how do I make this more achievable?

05:35.640 --> 05:41.920
And for me, I've never got into the script so much, just the trigger thing and then things

05:41.920 --> 05:44.180
happen all at once.

05:44.180 --> 05:49.200
I was always into the how can I make the RV smarter in the first place so I don't have

05:49.200 --> 05:51.760
to interact with it at all.

05:51.760 --> 05:57.200
So one of my favorites, I call it the auto dump feature and has nothing to do with dumping

05:57.200 --> 05:58.440
tanks.

05:58.440 --> 06:05.360
This is all about electricity and the idea is to say, let's say it's a sunny day outside.

06:05.360 --> 06:10.080
It's spring, I'm in the desert, I've got plenty of solar coming in.

06:10.080 --> 06:12.400
At some point, my battery is going to fill up.

06:12.400 --> 06:14.400
So what do I do with that excess?

06:14.400 --> 06:16.560
How can I use it?

06:16.560 --> 06:20.640
So I set up an automation that as the batteries reached higher and higher voltage levels and

06:20.640 --> 06:26.720
higher and higher percent charge, it would begin to turn on or enable certain devices.

06:26.720 --> 06:31.760
So as you've probably noticed, the Victron inverter has a fairly high background power

06:31.760 --> 06:36.120
draw and so we keep it turned off most of the time.

06:36.120 --> 06:40.800
Once the batteries reach 80%, I would turn the inverter on automatically.

06:40.800 --> 06:47.360
Once the batteries reached 90%, it would switch the fridge over from propane to AC electric.

06:47.360 --> 06:53.080
And once the batteries reached 95%, it would switch the electric water heater on.

06:53.080 --> 06:58.840
So on a good sunny day without us doing anything at all, we would end the day with full batteries,

06:58.840 --> 07:03.600
a full tank of hot water and having saved some propane from the fridge.

07:03.600 --> 07:04.800
I love that.

07:04.800 --> 07:05.800
That's so great.

07:05.800 --> 07:06.800
That's really cool.

07:06.800 --> 07:11.560
You must be then going through and replacing those basic DC switches that came with the

07:11.560 --> 07:13.200
RV with something smarter.

07:13.200 --> 07:17.840
One of the challenges in the RV is nothing is designed for RVs in the smart world.

07:17.840 --> 07:21.400
So we don't use a lot of 110 volts.

07:21.400 --> 07:23.120
DC is king.

07:23.120 --> 07:27.560
And so the Sonoff SV has been my choice for a lot of this and a couple of the other Sonoff

07:27.560 --> 07:28.560
devices.

07:28.560 --> 07:32.240
The 4Chan Pro has been another one I've used.

07:32.240 --> 07:38.760
And then a couple of things are running on Sonoff, I think it's the POW R2, the energy

07:38.760 --> 07:43.320
monitoring hardwired one or the Sonoff S31.

07:43.320 --> 07:45.280
And those have really been the heart of it.

07:45.280 --> 07:51.200
I started off with TAS motor running on those and then switched over to ESP home a little

07:51.200 --> 07:52.200
while later.

07:52.200 --> 07:56.520
I actually use one of those Sonoff SVs and I'm holding up to the camera for you both

07:56.520 --> 07:57.960
for my garage doors.

07:57.960 --> 07:59.920
And yeah, it's worked absolutely flawlessly.

07:59.920 --> 08:01.560
It's got a little relay on it.

08:01.560 --> 08:04.040
It runs on low voltage, like you said, Matt.

08:04.040 --> 08:05.040
I really like it.

08:05.040 --> 08:08.480
I put TAS motor on mine, of course.

08:08.480 --> 08:09.680
Fantastic little board.

08:09.680 --> 08:14.220
And then another, it sounds like another key piece of insight that's coming into Home Assistant

08:14.220 --> 08:18.800
is you are making Home Assistant aware of your electrical system.

08:18.800 --> 08:23.000
Sounds like battery state, power generation from solar.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.640
Home Assistant must be getting a lot of information off of your Victron setup.

08:26.640 --> 08:28.840
How are you supplying that to Home Assistant?

08:28.840 --> 08:29.840
Yeah, you're right.

08:29.840 --> 08:36.440
So we are using the Victron CCGX, the Color Control GX, which is one of their family of

08:36.440 --> 08:40.260
products that has a built in MQTT broker.

08:40.260 --> 08:45.900
So this is actually one of the original reasons, I guess, that we chose Victron versus some

08:45.900 --> 08:50.720
of the other vendors out there that do solar for RVs.

08:50.720 --> 08:56.140
We basically schlep up all of that MQTT data, throw it into Home Assistant, and also then

08:56.140 --> 08:59.400
collect it all in InfluxDB as well.

08:59.400 --> 09:03.360
And for me, it was actually the data collection side of things that was really why I started

09:03.360 --> 09:05.040
this in the first place.

09:05.040 --> 09:11.440
We wanted to see the long term trends of our batteries, of our solar, all these sorts of

09:11.440 --> 09:12.440
things.

09:12.440 --> 09:17.680
We've now got, I think, almost three years worth of data at about a one to ten second

09:17.680 --> 09:23.000
resolution across dozens and dozens and dozens of data points on the electrical system.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.560
So you're getting real insights to how the health of your batteries are, if they're still

09:26.560 --> 09:31.040
delivering the same way, and probably even like you could start to see maybe something's

09:31.040 --> 09:33.800
wrong with one of our solar panels because of this data.

09:33.800 --> 09:34.800
Exactly.

09:34.800 --> 09:41.080
So we've used it ourselves to answer questions like, if we added 200 more watts of solar,

09:41.080 --> 09:43.400
what would that do to our system?

09:43.400 --> 09:47.280
Or how many watts of solar do we need to get through winter at a given latitude?

09:47.280 --> 09:53.200
Because we can graph the location of the RV versus the amount of power that we bring in

09:53.200 --> 09:54.200
during the day.

09:54.200 --> 09:55.200
I love this.

09:55.200 --> 10:01.000
You've got to come on board as a road trip consultant for me, you know, running operations.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.240
So a lot of the stuff that we've done in that sense has been quite selfish.

10:04.240 --> 10:08.760
It's informed decisions that we've made ourselves.

10:08.760 --> 10:12.360
But I think one of the things that's really excited me the most is being able to share

10:12.360 --> 10:14.140
this data with others.

10:14.140 --> 10:19.240
So we've actually shared all of our electrical data with Battleborn, who make our batteries,

10:19.240 --> 10:24.340
with Dennis, the CEO, and he's then able to look at that data and from that get real world

10:24.340 --> 10:28.240
insight into how their batteries actually perform in the wild.

10:28.240 --> 10:36.280
Because no lab can recreate an RV in temperature fluctuations and casually turning on the AC

10:36.280 --> 10:38.000
and then boondocking for-

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
A hundred days.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
Exactly.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.680
So we've been able to share all that data with them and that really helps them to then

10:43.680 --> 10:48.680
understand how their batteries perform in different conditions and hopefully then improve

10:48.680 --> 10:49.680
their products.

10:49.680 --> 10:52.760
Yeah, I could show them how their batteries perform while they're cooking because it's

10:52.760 --> 10:53.880
so dang hot here.

10:53.880 --> 10:58.180
But something else that strikes me is that you could do is you could watch for the total

10:58.180 --> 11:02.600
draw of the RV and prevent tripping a breaker when you're set up to shore power and you're

11:02.600 --> 11:06.000
actually maybe not boondocking, but you're at an RV park or something like that.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.960
So there's utilities for when you're not off grid as well, I would imagine.

11:08.960 --> 11:13.160
We actually added that exact automation about 10 months ago.

11:13.160 --> 11:17.400
We arrived here in Vermont, we had full hookups and we knew we were going to be here during

11:17.400 --> 11:23.680
the winter and we're only in a 30 amp RV, which means that our main breaker in the RV

11:23.680 --> 11:28.900
can only handle 30 amps, which means it's really, really easy for us to trip that breaker.

11:28.900 --> 11:34.220
If we ran an electric water heater, an electric space heater, if we then happened to turn

11:34.220 --> 11:39.560
on the microwave or electric kettle or something else, that would trip the breaker.

11:39.560 --> 11:46.200
So I was able to use a home assistant automation to look at what I'd set the Victron system

11:46.200 --> 11:51.840
to allow as the input current, so 30 amps usually, and then deduct from that whatever

11:51.840 --> 11:54.880
the current total power draw was.

11:54.880 --> 12:00.380
And then if I was exceeding the 30 amps, it would then automatically pause either the

12:00.380 --> 12:05.240
electric water heater or the electric space heater so that I can run the microwave or

12:05.240 --> 12:12.000
run the electric kettle because I need my cup of tea and pause those things until the

12:12.000 --> 12:15.920
microwave or the kettle has shut off and then return them back to their original state.

12:15.920 --> 12:19.280
And thanks to that, we didn't trip a breaker all winter long.

12:19.280 --> 12:26.560
So Matt, are you telling me that my color control GX is collecting all the information

12:26.560 --> 12:31.880
I need and I just need to go into the settings and tell it an MQTT endpoint or something?

12:31.880 --> 12:32.880
Do I already have it?

12:32.880 --> 12:33.880
It's even simpler than that.

12:33.880 --> 12:36.360
It actually has a built-in MQTT broker.

12:36.360 --> 12:37.360
No.

12:37.360 --> 12:44.160
So you can just connect to it on port 1883 and pull the data straight off.

12:44.160 --> 12:45.440
You're doing it right now, aren't you, Chris?

12:45.440 --> 12:46.440
Be honest.

12:46.440 --> 12:52.520
I just don't understand why nobody's built a Victron integration for a home assistant.

12:52.520 --> 12:53.520
Get on it, somebody.

12:53.520 --> 12:54.720
So I actually looked at doing it.

12:54.720 --> 13:00.040
I posted on the Victron forums late last year and said I'd be really interested in making

13:00.040 --> 13:01.920
a Victron integration.

13:01.920 --> 13:04.600
That was probably your forum post I read.

13:04.600 --> 13:06.280
I don't know Python.

13:06.280 --> 13:11.900
And so for me, there's a decent barrier to entry to go straight from not knowing a language

13:11.900 --> 13:15.720
to writing an integration with this massive kind of project.

13:15.720 --> 13:18.040
But yeah, all the data's there on MQTT.

13:18.040 --> 13:22.420
It feels like this is a great example of if you had somebody who was a Python developer

13:22.420 --> 13:28.280
and had a Victron system, it wouldn't take long until we had an integration.

13:28.280 --> 13:31.680
But those two paths have not yet crossed.

13:31.680 --> 13:40.280
But these Victron systems are crazy popular in van builds, bus builds, modern RVs.

13:40.280 --> 13:41.560
These things are going everywhere.

13:41.560 --> 13:43.260
And Victron makes some great stuff.

13:43.260 --> 13:44.260
They really do.

13:44.260 --> 13:48.400
And one of the things that I like the most about Victron is they are open sourcing nearly

13:48.400 --> 13:49.920
all of their software.

13:49.920 --> 13:55.800
So all the APIs they use are all completely publicly documented, but all the source code

13:55.800 --> 13:56.800
is also there as well.

13:56.800 --> 13:57.800
Hell yeah.

13:57.800 --> 13:59.480
And you'll like this one.

13:59.480 --> 14:04.720
They've even got a literal how-to guide on GitHub along with all the software you need

14:04.720 --> 14:09.040
to run the CCGX software on a Raspberry Pi.

14:09.040 --> 14:10.200
Yeah, I really like that.

14:10.200 --> 14:14.440
I know some of their boxes internally are running Linux too, which I think is just great.

14:14.440 --> 14:15.880
I'm a huge fan of that as well.

14:15.880 --> 14:19.720
We should reach out to Victron and have them on the show.

14:19.720 --> 14:20.720
We should.

14:20.720 --> 14:21.720
You're right.

14:21.720 --> 14:25.280
I should give them enough publicity on there, for heck's sake.

14:25.280 --> 14:26.280
But yeah.

14:26.280 --> 14:27.280
All right.

14:27.280 --> 14:28.280
Well, yeah.

14:28.280 --> 14:35.480
So I am setting up MQTT and pointing it at my ColorGX right now, so I'm going to get

14:35.480 --> 14:36.480
that going.

14:36.480 --> 14:41.720
Top tip, if you want to, my favorite MQTT kind of tool is something called MQTT Explorer.

14:41.720 --> 14:42.720
Ah, OK.

14:42.720 --> 14:46.120
This thing lets you log into a broker and see all the messages that it's getting in

14:46.120 --> 14:47.120
real time.

14:47.120 --> 14:48.120
Oh.

14:48.120 --> 14:51.360
And I see it's a Mac app, is that a Mac app?

14:51.360 --> 14:54.620
Brew install MQTT-Explorer, I think.

14:54.620 --> 14:55.620
No kidding.

14:55.620 --> 14:56.620
Really?

14:56.620 --> 14:57.620
OK.

14:57.620 --> 15:01.480
Actually, so you can use Brew to install practically everything these days.

15:01.480 --> 15:08.880
When I set this, I got an M1 Mac about a month ago, and I've religiously used Brew for absolutely

15:08.880 --> 15:14.640
everything, including Chrome, VS Code, Audacity, everything.

15:14.640 --> 15:15.640
Yeah.

15:15.640 --> 15:16.640
I legitimately had no idea.

15:16.640 --> 15:17.640
No, I know.

15:17.640 --> 15:20.800
It's been a really, really long way in the last five years or so.

15:20.800 --> 15:21.800
Yeah.

15:21.800 --> 15:27.160
I have to say, my Mac experiment here on the road trip, it's been good.

15:27.160 --> 15:31.320
Once I got, and Matt, I don't know if you've ever run into this, but I had this problem

15:31.320 --> 15:37.760
where NSURLSessionD just would consume all of my bandwidth, because I was in a pretty

15:37.760 --> 15:42.840
crappy signal area, and I had hardly any signal.

15:42.840 --> 15:46.840
And I'd fire up the Mac, and it would just sit there and run and run and run, in part

15:46.840 --> 15:49.640
because the download speeds were slow, so it took longer.

15:49.640 --> 15:53.200
And I'm sitting there trying to do a live show.

15:53.200 --> 15:54.200
It's just horrible.

15:54.200 --> 15:58.920
So once everybody yelled at me to try Little Snitch out again, which I had tried out 100

15:58.920 --> 15:59.920
years ago.

15:59.920 --> 16:05.140
I gave Little Snitch a go and set up an outbound firewall and blocked basically everything

16:05.140 --> 16:07.480
except for the apps I'm using to do the shows.

16:07.480 --> 16:09.280
It's been pretty solid since then.

16:09.280 --> 16:11.360
Seemed a little hacky, but sure works.

16:11.360 --> 16:15.800
Yeah, there's a load of little tricks like that you can use when you're in a really constrained

16:15.800 --> 16:21.520
bandwidth situation, just to make sure that your devices are only doing the things you

16:21.520 --> 16:26.320
really, really want them to do, and not just those background tasks that can wait.

16:26.320 --> 16:29.840
Are you doing any of that at the firewall level now?

16:29.840 --> 16:32.360
The big one for us is actually just the ad blocker.

16:32.360 --> 16:36.040
Just having AdGuard Home on there just cuts out so much stuff.

16:36.040 --> 16:38.340
I will say we are completely spoiled.

16:38.340 --> 16:44.500
Having been running on bonded cellular connections for the past couple of years, we actually

16:44.500 --> 16:49.000
have cable internet plugged into the side of our RV.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.680
So we're sitting on 400 meg cable internet right now.

16:51.680 --> 16:52.680
Nice.

16:52.680 --> 16:53.680
Yeah, that's a treat.

16:53.680 --> 16:54.680
Yeah.

16:54.680 --> 16:58.640
Yeah, the one nice thing about this spot we are in Tucson right now is we have pretty

16:58.640 --> 16:59.640
dang good signal.

16:59.640 --> 17:03.840
It's not like that good, but it's not wired good, but it's been pretty good.

17:03.840 --> 17:08.280
So that's been nice because some points on this trip I have just had horrendously bad

17:08.280 --> 17:09.280
signal.

17:09.280 --> 17:11.980
It's amazing what you can actually still get done.

17:11.980 --> 17:16.320
We actually found that in all our time boondocking around the Southwest, I think there was only

17:16.320 --> 17:21.680
one spot we ended up in where we didn't have usable cellular internet.

17:21.680 --> 17:23.400
And we sort of knew that going into it.

17:23.400 --> 17:27.840
So we just made sure that all the work we had to do, we didn't need anything online.

17:27.840 --> 17:34.480
But a big part of living in the RV is you find all of these challenges, I think, a lot

17:34.480 --> 17:37.720
quicker than when you live in a house.

17:37.720 --> 17:38.720
No kidding.

17:38.720 --> 17:39.720
Yeah.

17:39.720 --> 17:43.200
And one of those is when I want to update our website, let's have a new Docker container

17:43.200 --> 17:44.960
I want to push.

17:44.960 --> 17:49.200
If you're sitting in an office, you think nothing of going Docker push and uploading

17:49.200 --> 17:50.340
that image.

17:50.340 --> 17:51.340
Of course.

17:51.340 --> 17:52.340
Right.

17:52.340 --> 17:56.720
I spent a long time optimizing ours so that it was pushing just the tiniest little delta

17:56.720 --> 17:59.900
of that layer at the top that had to change.

17:59.900 --> 18:02.960
And it was otherwise as static as possible.

18:02.960 --> 18:04.560
And all these little things you find.

18:04.560 --> 18:05.560
That's a great point.

18:05.560 --> 18:10.040
Well, like, boy, sometimes updating Docker images takes frickin forever over cellular.

18:10.040 --> 18:12.560
Like it's clearly not many people doing that.

18:12.560 --> 18:15.760
Hey, Alex, hot, hot update here.

18:15.760 --> 18:21.280
It looks like MQTT Explorer is available for Linux as an app image and a snap.

18:21.280 --> 18:25.640
So you can get it on Linux and a Mac and the App Store and a DMG.

18:25.640 --> 18:26.640
And of course, on Windows.

18:26.640 --> 18:32.080
So I think I've spent more time nodding and smiling and looking impressed in the last

18:32.080 --> 18:36.280
20 minutes than I have in the last 20 months.

18:36.280 --> 18:38.080
Some seriously, seriously cool stuff.

18:38.080 --> 18:41.720
I wonder how much we could apply to people's houses and make people more cognizant of the

18:41.720 --> 18:48.500
energy they're using and maybe make that into some kind of sustainable movement.

18:48.500 --> 18:49.500
Really interesting.

18:49.500 --> 18:52.820
So what's your favorite automation that you've done?

18:52.820 --> 18:58.260
The untrippable breaker has probably been the most impactful day to day.

18:58.260 --> 19:03.400
One of the ones that was so simple yet made a huge difference to our quality of life was

19:03.400 --> 19:09.200
we have a GPS dongle that we have plugged into the Victron CCGX, which means the Victron

19:09.200 --> 19:12.880
system is aware of the trailer's location at any point in time.

19:12.880 --> 19:19.080
It can use that for some geofencing and things through the Victron software, through their

19:19.080 --> 19:20.080
dashboard.

19:20.080 --> 19:25.200
But once you then plug that GPS dongle in, it's then also exposing its data on the MQTT

19:25.200 --> 19:29.800
broker, which means I can then collect that data with Node-RED.

19:29.800 --> 19:36.320
And Home Assistant, about maybe 18 months or so ago, I guess, added a new service allowing

19:36.320 --> 19:40.960
you to set the home location through the Home Assistant API.

19:40.960 --> 19:45.440
So then as we're driving down the road, every 60 seconds, Node-RED will ping Home Assistant

19:45.440 --> 19:48.440
and say, oh, by the way, we're now here.

19:48.440 --> 19:53.240
And that way, as we cross time zones or state borders or whatever, Home Assistant always

19:53.240 --> 19:58.080
has our latest information, schedules based on time or continue to work.

19:58.080 --> 20:01.200
Yeah, that was a real simple one, but really worked well.

20:01.200 --> 20:04.560
I know that's a problem you've been trying to solve, Chris, for some time now.

20:04.560 --> 20:05.680
Yeah, it's so silly.

20:05.680 --> 20:11.640
Here I am in Tucson right now, and my evening automation for lighting is based on the sunset

20:11.640 --> 20:13.360
in the Pacific Northwest.

20:13.360 --> 20:16.240
And I used to go in there and update it, but I just kind of stopped.

20:16.240 --> 20:17.480
I just kind of said, screw it.

20:17.480 --> 20:18.680
I'm done updating it.

20:18.680 --> 20:19.680
It's close enough.

20:19.680 --> 20:23.120
It's about an hour off.

20:23.120 --> 20:26.040
I should totally look into that.

20:26.040 --> 20:27.920
linode.com slash SSH.

20:27.920 --> 20:32.640
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on your account and go there to support this show.

20:32.640 --> 20:37.400
You know, Linode started in 2003 as one of the very first companies in cloud computing

20:37.400 --> 20:39.200
before we called it cloud computing.

20:39.200 --> 20:42.840
And now 18 years later, they haven't like launched a trillion different services.

20:42.840 --> 20:46.080
They've remained focused in building out their core service.

20:46.080 --> 20:49.560
Not only do they have the best servers in the business with incredible performance,

20:49.560 --> 20:54.640
that's networking 11 data centers around the world, but they've added services that matter.

20:54.640 --> 20:59.600
Things that impact the quality of your life, like DDoS protection, VLAN support, a powerful

20:59.600 --> 21:05.000
DNS manager, and of course, block storage and S3 compatible object storage, which I

21:05.000 --> 21:06.600
absolutely love.

21:06.600 --> 21:10.000
But I know there's people, you know, like Alex, who like things like the Terraform support

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
and the Kubernetes support.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:12.440 --> 21:14.480
I'm sure that's great for some of you out there.

21:14.480 --> 21:15.480
So shoot me.

21:15.480 --> 21:21.560
But what I like about Linode is they have really just remained focused on building something

21:21.560 --> 21:25.840
really great for those of us who want something fast and reliable, and then they back that

21:25.840 --> 21:30.040
with the best customer support in the business, phone, ticket, email, even social.

21:30.040 --> 21:31.520
They're going to take care of you.

21:31.520 --> 21:33.080
And there's tons of one click deployments.

21:33.080 --> 21:36.720
If you just want to get started with something, that can be a great way to learn.

21:36.720 --> 21:40.440
You can also just DIY, which is often the way I prefer to go.

21:40.440 --> 21:44.560
Or sometimes I'll do something in the middle where I'll deploy a base system that has just

21:44.560 --> 21:48.640
the runtime for the container information, all installed, all that all that junk that

21:48.640 --> 21:49.640
you'd normally have to set up.

21:49.640 --> 21:51.160
And it has the right repos.

21:51.160 --> 21:54.760
You're getting the right versions of the packages and the GPG keys, and it'll just build on

21:54.760 --> 21:55.760
top of that.

21:55.760 --> 21:58.260
And that takes like, I don't know, eight seconds to deploy.

21:58.260 --> 21:59.260
It's pretty fast.

21:59.260 --> 22:00.260
It's pretty amazing.

22:00.260 --> 22:05.200
So go over to linode.com slash SSH, get that one hundred dollars, support the show and

22:05.200 --> 22:06.840
see what we've been talking about.

22:06.840 --> 22:11.000
Every time we're working on a project, we'll try something out on Linode real quick.

22:11.000 --> 22:14.380
It's a great way to R&D stuff and, you know, that hundred dollars can help you do that

22:14.380 --> 22:15.380
as well.

22:15.380 --> 22:16.660
So you got to go check it out for yourself.

22:16.660 --> 22:20.880
Take advantage of that one hundred dollars and see why Linode is better than the rest.

22:20.880 --> 22:29.040
There's a lot of choices out there, but nobody does it like Linode, linode.com slash SSH.

22:29.040 --> 22:30.040
Right then.

22:30.040 --> 22:34.080
So the ultimate conclusion of self-hosting, at least in my opinion, is probably to self

22:34.080 --> 22:39.160
build, you know, a house or somewhere you're going to live, right?

22:39.160 --> 22:43.840
Tell us a little bit about your plans, Matt, for the 40 acres in Vermont that you've just

22:43.840 --> 22:44.840
bought.

22:44.840 --> 22:45.840
Yes.

22:45.840 --> 22:50.440
So I am, like you, sort of a Brit here in the US.

22:50.440 --> 22:53.600
And as we've been traveling around the US, we've been looking for where we might want

22:53.600 --> 22:55.400
to live one day.

22:55.400 --> 23:00.000
We don't have family in the US, so we're really free to kind of choose wherever it is we want

23:00.000 --> 23:01.560
to live.

23:01.560 --> 23:03.920
And we have spent a lot of time in a lot of different places.

23:03.920 --> 23:07.320
We've eventually settled on Vermont as a place.

23:07.320 --> 23:14.840
So about two or three months ago, we closed our sale or our purchase on 40 acres of completely

23:14.840 --> 23:18.000
raw land in central Vermont.

23:18.000 --> 23:22.000
And when I say raw land, this is literally like trees and dirt.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.480
There really is nothing there.

23:23.480 --> 23:24.720
It's a hill with some trees on it.

23:24.720 --> 23:30.000
You know, you can say, you can be honest, it's a hill with some trees on it.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.340
It really is.

23:31.340 --> 23:32.760
And there is not a lot there.

23:32.760 --> 23:36.960
But when we went into this, we had some very specific requirements of what we wanted.

23:36.960 --> 23:40.980
We didn't want to be in a city or a town, we wanted to be somewhere more rural.

23:40.980 --> 23:44.440
And one of the things that made that requirement a little bit more challenging is we said a

23:44.440 --> 23:47.240
must have is fiber internet.

23:47.240 --> 23:52.640
So even though we're in the middle of nowhere in central Vermont, we will have 800 meg symmetric

23:52.640 --> 23:54.000
fiber to the property.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
You bastard.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
Good for you, man.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.480
Nice one, Dan.

23:58.480 --> 24:00.880
In the woods with fiber, yes, please.

24:00.880 --> 24:01.880
Yeah.

24:01.880 --> 24:04.320
So we are now at the start of this journey.

24:04.320 --> 24:08.380
Last week, we had a driveway put in we're building the house site about 1000 feet back

24:08.380 --> 24:09.760
from the road.

24:09.760 --> 24:13.320
And building that driveway was just beyond what what Diana and I could possibly take

24:13.320 --> 24:14.320
on.

24:14.320 --> 24:15.320
I don't know.

24:15.320 --> 24:16.320
I've been watching your videos, dude.

24:16.320 --> 24:20.280
You have been felling trees like a proper lumberjack.

24:20.280 --> 24:21.280
Really impressive.

24:21.280 --> 24:23.520
There's a lot of new skills that we're picking up.

24:23.520 --> 24:27.640
It's it's kind of surreal to like today, I was out there with a chainsaw, working on

24:27.640 --> 24:33.480
the property and then came home writing a blog post, compiling some stuff and working

24:33.480 --> 24:36.000
on some some programming and some automations and things.

24:36.000 --> 24:40.880
It's a very surreal kind of contrast, I guess, between the two two things.

24:40.880 --> 24:42.320
What a cool existence there.

24:42.320 --> 24:44.060
Yeah, we have a lot of fun doing it.

24:44.060 --> 24:48.360
And how great that you have the RV there with you with all this stuff kind of done and now

24:48.360 --> 24:51.160
taking care of itself so you can focus on other stuff.

24:51.160 --> 24:52.160
Yeah, exactly.

24:52.160 --> 24:56.680
And in many ways, this house that we want to build, it should probably go without saying

24:56.680 --> 25:01.380
that we want to have a load of smart technology in there and things and obviously self host

25:01.380 --> 25:03.480
a lot of things inside there.

25:03.480 --> 25:07.680
The RV in many ways has been our test lab and still continues to be our test lab for

25:07.680 --> 25:08.940
a lot of those things.

25:08.940 --> 25:13.040
So even though we're running with just like one little Intel NUC and could serve that

25:13.040 --> 25:17.720
all with like a little travel router and would probably be fine in here, we sort of push

25:17.720 --> 25:21.020
the boundaries to learn some of the things we might need for the house.

25:21.020 --> 25:22.480
The RV is staging.

25:22.480 --> 25:23.480
It basically is.

25:23.480 --> 25:28.080
Yeah, I'm sure you're already daydreaming of ideas for the new house, but this is something

25:28.080 --> 25:29.360
you get to build from scratch.

25:29.360 --> 25:34.460
So I imagine you're thinking Ethernet throughout your picture in a spot where you'll probably

25:34.460 --> 25:35.460
run a server.

25:35.460 --> 25:38.540
Walk us through a little bit of what you are now considering now that you've got a crack

25:38.540 --> 25:41.480
to build something from scratch, even if it is a bit off.

25:41.480 --> 25:45.600
I'm learning so much and I think the community around the self-hosted Discord and things

25:45.600 --> 25:48.080
has been a fantastic resource already.

25:48.080 --> 25:51.500
As I as I learn more, I keep evolving my plans.

25:51.500 --> 25:56.520
But some of the things that I've picked up so far are things like if you want to run

25:56.520 --> 26:03.240
your own hardware, there's usually a trade off of like heat and noise and cost and power

26:03.240 --> 26:05.440
efficiency in these things.

26:05.440 --> 26:08.320
We've learned so much about resource management in the RV.

26:08.320 --> 26:10.760
We want to have a completely net zero house.

26:10.760 --> 26:15.000
We're trying to build a passive house and hit the living building challenge, which are

26:15.000 --> 26:21.560
a set of requirements that basically mean a very, very high quality, sustainable, comfortable

26:21.560 --> 26:22.560
home.

26:22.560 --> 26:27.000
So how do I now then host servers and things within that is kind of the challenge.

26:27.000 --> 26:31.740
So one of the things that we're going to do because we're self-building, the priority

26:31.740 --> 26:33.900
is to get utilities onto the property.

26:33.900 --> 26:37.680
So electricity and fiber, bring those up the driveway.

26:37.680 --> 26:40.620
Make sure we've got our solar and our batteries installed.

26:40.620 --> 26:44.120
Bring the the well truck up and dig a well, all those sorts of things.

26:44.120 --> 26:46.480
I love that water came after Internet.

26:46.480 --> 26:47.480
I noticed that too.

26:47.480 --> 26:51.840
Someone asked us a few days ago if we had a phone line at the property and I'm like,

26:51.840 --> 26:53.040
I have no idea.

26:53.040 --> 26:54.040
I have never checked.

26:54.040 --> 26:55.040
No.

26:55.040 --> 26:58.560
No, I would just say it's gone now.

26:58.560 --> 27:04.280
But but no, so because we need to bring those things on and get them done quickly, most

27:04.280 --> 27:06.400
people would put those in a basement.

27:06.400 --> 27:09.840
But to have a basement implies you already got a house and we don't.

27:09.840 --> 27:13.840
So we're actually going to build a separate standalone mechanical building.

27:13.840 --> 27:17.680
Bring all of the utilities into there, which gives us this big advantage that we've then

27:17.680 --> 27:24.880
got a separate building where noise and environmental controls can be tailored to whatever we want

27:24.880 --> 27:25.880
inside.

27:25.880 --> 27:28.760
And that's where we're going to run all of our servers and switches and all that kind

27:28.760 --> 27:29.760
of stuff.

27:29.760 --> 27:32.240
And it can be as loud as it wants to be.

27:32.240 --> 27:33.240
Doesn't matter.

27:33.240 --> 27:35.200
We can then have a separate building for that.

27:35.200 --> 27:36.200
Right.

27:36.200 --> 27:37.640
With an Ethernet cable going to the house.

27:37.640 --> 27:42.880
So that's where you're going to put all your solar batteries and inverters and electric

27:42.880 --> 27:45.280
grid tie off points and...

27:45.280 --> 27:46.400
Exactly.

27:46.400 --> 27:49.000
So it'll have as much power as it needs.

27:49.000 --> 27:54.160
We're thinking because the property is quite large, the distances between some of the buildings

27:54.160 --> 27:55.960
could also therefore be quite large.

27:55.960 --> 27:59.920
For example, we want to run cameras along the driveway.

27:59.920 --> 28:02.960
We're sort of pushing the limits of what Ethernet can do.

28:02.960 --> 28:07.260
So we're then probably going to run fiber as a backbone between the buildings and run

28:07.260 --> 28:11.920
fiber from the road to the house site and then our own fibers back down to the road

28:11.920 --> 28:14.440
and then tap in there.

28:14.440 --> 28:15.440
Might as well.

28:15.440 --> 28:19.600
Because at this stage, and if you're building this property in 2021, actually fiber does

28:19.600 --> 28:20.880
seem like a pretty smart way to go.

28:20.880 --> 28:22.640
It sort of future proofs it a bit.

28:22.640 --> 28:23.640
Yeah, exactly.

28:23.640 --> 28:26.920
And it's one of those things where we have a YouTube channel.

28:26.920 --> 28:30.600
We're moving around big media files all the time.

28:30.600 --> 28:35.280
And so having an ability to do that at greater than one gig speed is something that we would

28:35.280 --> 28:37.240
actually really find valuable.

28:37.240 --> 28:40.080
Can I rent some space in your mech room?

28:40.080 --> 28:41.480
Yeah.

28:41.480 --> 28:43.000
Forest data center colo hosting.

28:43.000 --> 28:44.800
I can see it now.

28:44.800 --> 28:45.800
Vermont rural.

28:45.800 --> 28:46.800
Yeah.

28:46.800 --> 28:47.800
Yeah.

28:47.800 --> 28:48.800
What are we calling it on Discord?

28:48.800 --> 28:49.800
VT Rural?

28:49.800 --> 28:53.680
That's pretty great.

28:53.680 --> 28:58.400
That sounds like almost exactly, although at a larger scale and distance than what I

28:58.400 --> 28:59.640
had envisioned.

28:59.640 --> 29:05.060
My ultimate goal for our RV Lady Jubes would be to park her on a piece of property that

29:05.060 --> 29:11.800
we've bought with a shed that has solar, it has the inverter, it has the batteries, maybe

29:11.800 --> 29:17.960
it has a washer and dryer in it, and it has some on-premises servers that have been theoretically

29:17.960 --> 29:21.920
sinking over Starlink or something with media ready to go or whatever.

29:21.920 --> 29:26.200
And I love the idea of separating out the noisy stuff into its own building.

29:26.200 --> 29:27.720
I mean, why not?

29:27.720 --> 29:29.920
That's such a great way to go.

29:29.920 --> 29:34.280
And so I imagine you're considering a whole new generation of home assistant build.

29:34.280 --> 29:36.000
You're not going to take the one out of the RV.

29:36.000 --> 29:37.000
You're going to leave that.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.120
And I would imagine a whole new build.

29:39.120 --> 29:40.120
Yeah.

29:40.120 --> 29:42.560
So this is an area now that I'm learning so much about.

29:42.560 --> 29:47.480
The hardware side of running servers is pretty new to me.

29:47.480 --> 29:53.880
And although I'm comfortable with the concepts, the specifics of exactly what to run is all

29:53.880 --> 29:54.880
new.

29:54.880 --> 29:58.040
But you actually touch on something there that's a real challenge that I'm battling

29:58.040 --> 29:59.040
with.

29:59.040 --> 30:03.880
The concept of self-hosting is that you have your own little private island of stuff.

30:03.880 --> 30:08.560
It doesn't matter what goes on elsewhere, out in the cloud or whatever.

30:08.560 --> 30:12.080
You are insulated from that because you have your own little private island.

30:12.080 --> 30:17.560
Well, when we have a house, we sort of then have two islands.

30:17.560 --> 30:20.200
You have things like, take Plex as an example.

30:20.200 --> 30:25.680
Do I run Plex in the house, in the RV, both?

30:25.680 --> 30:27.600
How do I sort of manage those things?

30:27.600 --> 30:28.600
Right.

30:28.600 --> 30:29.600
In there.

30:29.600 --> 30:30.600
Yes.

30:30.600 --> 30:31.600
Yeah.

30:31.600 --> 30:32.600
So that's an area for me that's, I think, really exciting.

30:32.600 --> 30:36.080
There's some places where it's a huge asset, like backups, great.

30:36.080 --> 30:38.400
I've now got a really easy way to do that.

30:38.400 --> 30:42.080
But for things like media sharing, do I have two copies?

30:42.080 --> 30:43.600
It becomes tricky.

30:43.600 --> 30:47.360
And then there's the angle as well of, for you in particular, I think this will be a

30:47.360 --> 30:54.760
unique challenge, is when you are driving around in your RV for potentially six months

30:54.760 --> 31:01.360
and you're leaving the rural pad empty for six months, you want to make sure that that

31:01.360 --> 31:07.360
stuff is reliable and has decent redundancy and all that kind of stuff.

31:07.360 --> 31:11.420
And I think one of the things that I've heard you struggling with, you sort of brought up

31:11.420 --> 31:14.040
on the Discord, is how good is good enough?

31:14.040 --> 31:16.320
And do I need to have dual power supplies?

31:16.320 --> 31:22.420
And how many SSDs do I need to put in RAID to make sure that that doesn't kick things

31:22.420 --> 31:23.520
over and that kind of thing?

31:23.520 --> 31:26.040
So there's a lot to consider.

31:26.040 --> 31:29.720
And I'll add to that, Alex, lesson learned here.

31:29.720 --> 31:32.120
I thought I had a fairly good setup.

31:32.120 --> 31:38.240
And as I'm on the road at this point, my main server at the studio is offline, which does

31:38.240 --> 31:43.920
a ton of lifting for me and then syncs the results to the RV.

31:43.920 --> 31:49.320
And I feel like I'm operating with one hand tied behind my back while that server is down.

31:49.320 --> 31:53.000
And now I'm running through my head of like, what am I going to do to rebuild that?

31:53.000 --> 31:54.760
Because it really is a tricky problem.

31:54.760 --> 32:00.880
And this is on a pretty nice actual server box.

32:00.880 --> 32:01.880
It's a nice little box.

32:01.880 --> 32:07.000
So the thing is, I don't think we really fully admit to ourselves just how much light tinkering

32:07.000 --> 32:12.640
we do on the average week to these servers to keep them tended, to keep the leaves in

32:12.640 --> 32:17.920
the correct space, to coin a gardening kind of analogy.

32:17.920 --> 32:22.200
I probably SSH into my server just out of habit, at least once or twice a day.

32:22.200 --> 32:23.640
I don't really know why sometimes.

32:23.640 --> 32:24.640
I just do.

32:24.640 --> 32:25.640
Yeah.

32:25.640 --> 32:31.440
I mean, you touched on it there with the dual PSUs and I would just say, imagine the situation

32:31.440 --> 32:36.400
where you don't have physical access to your server, nor would anybody else have physical

32:36.400 --> 32:39.060
access to your server for three months.

32:39.060 --> 32:43.740
How do you give yourself the best chance of being okay and everything working?

32:43.740 --> 32:47.600
I've gone through exactly this this week, because as you both know, I'm going back to

32:47.600 --> 32:49.760
England at the weekend.

32:49.760 --> 32:53.160
It will be probably the day after this airs actually.

32:53.160 --> 32:58.400
And the server that lives in England for me has been running on an old super micro board

32:58.400 --> 33:02.320
with a Java based IPMI KVM built in.

33:02.320 --> 33:06.680
Works okay, but I prefer it was a little more modern, that kind of stuff.

33:06.680 --> 33:10.600
And I thought to myself, could I just make do by taking a Raspberry Pi 4 over there and

33:10.600 --> 33:12.040
put Pi KVM on it?

33:12.040 --> 33:20.520
And I'm like, no, actually, I need this to be 100% as close as is possible, reliable.

33:20.520 --> 33:24.440
Because the last thing I want to do is have to call my dad up and say, Hey, can you go

33:24.440 --> 33:28.480
and push this widget into this particular orifice?

33:28.480 --> 33:33.940
And you know, wave your hands at three o'clock on Sunday, you know, and make it work.

33:33.940 --> 33:38.600
So I've bought, I've bought a new ASRock board, which is I've written a blog post about which

33:38.600 --> 33:40.160
I'll put a link to in the show notes.

33:40.160 --> 33:44.000
I think that might be the perfect media server motherboard for me moving forward.

33:44.000 --> 33:45.000
We'll see.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.640
But it's that there's just so much to consider.

33:47.640 --> 33:53.100
And I think you have to get to a point where you're like, okay, I'm willing to risk a single

33:53.100 --> 33:55.280
power supply in this system.

33:55.280 --> 33:58.040
If that goes boom, okay.

33:58.040 --> 33:59.040
What's my plan B?

33:59.040 --> 34:05.800
You know, my plan B might be Linode, something like that with some ZFS data sets replicated

34:05.800 --> 34:07.200
or something like that.

34:07.200 --> 34:11.960
It's too bad about the Pi KVM though, because that was one of my thoughts was if I had Pi

34:11.960 --> 34:16.160
KVM at the studio, I could at least see what's going on on the console right now.

34:16.160 --> 34:18.760
But I really an IPMI system would be better.

34:18.760 --> 34:22.880
I was actually thinking, although I don't really know how to pull it off is like a redundant

34:22.880 --> 34:27.540
Pi KVM system or a redundant Pi system for WireGuard.

34:27.540 --> 34:32.520
When I'm back, when I do get back to Washington, addressing that redundancy is one of my to

34:32.520 --> 34:35.200
do items because I know exactly what you mean, Matt.

34:35.200 --> 34:39.400
It's like I'm sort of helpless down here in Tucson when the server is up in Seattle.

34:39.400 --> 34:43.440
Yeah, I mean, one of the technologies I've been researching and playing with some more

34:43.440 --> 34:45.560
recently is Karp.

34:45.560 --> 34:50.920
So this gives you essentially the ability to have two devices that can fight between

34:50.920 --> 34:54.200
themselves, let's say, for an IP address on the network.

34:54.200 --> 34:56.260
So OpenSense supports this out of the box.

34:56.260 --> 34:59.880
You can run two separate machines with OpenSense on.

34:59.880 --> 35:05.080
And if one of them dies, the other will automatically kind of pick up and run with that.

35:05.080 --> 35:08.580
And maybe there's a similar thing you can do with Raspberry Pis with other services.

35:08.580 --> 35:13.240
You can have essentially a redundant Raspberry Pi sitting there idle.

35:13.240 --> 35:17.680
And if the first one drops off the network for any reason or just doesn't respond, the

35:17.680 --> 35:18.920
second one would pick up.

35:18.920 --> 35:23.000
Don't you got this vision of two fish flopping around on the deck fighting each other?

35:23.000 --> 35:24.000
Right.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.040
Might be fun.

35:26.040 --> 35:29.040
That could be good to watch.

35:29.040 --> 35:34.240
Well, Matt, there's so many things we could talk about, but we should probably leave some

35:34.240 --> 35:35.760
of it for your YouTube channel.

35:35.760 --> 35:39.240
But thank you for coming on the show today and chatting with us about some of this.
