00:00.000 --> 00:06.880
Have you noticed lately that the self-hosted and homelab subreddits freaking love their

00:06.880 --> 00:07.880
dashboards?

00:07.880 --> 00:11.640
Yes, it's dashboards all day, are you kidding me?

00:11.640 --> 00:16.720
Every third post is, oh, I'm just humble bragging about all the self-hosted services I've got.

00:16.720 --> 00:20.960
And I always feel like my dashboard is not as pretty as it could be.

00:20.960 --> 00:24.920
I mean, they're not even as nice as your dashboards and these dashboards are like, they look like

00:24.920 --> 00:27.920
you should be controlling a starship with some of them.

00:27.920 --> 00:30.200
The word dashboard has become a sound to me.

00:30.200 --> 00:31.440
You've just said it too much.

00:31.440 --> 00:32.440
Dashboard, dashboard.

00:32.440 --> 00:33.440
Yeah.

00:33.440 --> 00:35.480
I mean, there's lots of options, right?

00:35.480 --> 00:40.160
There is Homer, there is Heimdall, there is, I mean, there's dozens of them.

00:40.160 --> 00:46.440
I get why people like them, but they're just another thing to become out of date.

00:46.440 --> 00:53.480
And I find that even if I set one up, the entropy to keeping it up to date is too high.

00:53.480 --> 00:57.280
And six months later, I haven't opened it for a while and, oh, I don't even run that

00:57.280 --> 00:58.280
service anymore.

00:58.280 --> 00:59.400
Why is that still on there?

00:59.400 --> 01:03.280
And it gets worse the more devices you have or you remove or add.

01:03.280 --> 01:08.560
And in some cases I have devices that go offline or online depending on my location.

01:08.560 --> 01:11.720
And then the dashboard's like messed up temporarily while I'm traveling.

01:11.720 --> 01:14.680
And then I just like debate the entire time if I should remove it.

01:14.680 --> 01:17.280
And God forbid I take something out and then I have to go everywhere and make sure I've

01:17.280 --> 01:20.580
got it removed from my Lovelace dashboard and my Heads Up dashboard.

01:20.580 --> 01:23.540
It's just like, it's dashboard overload for me.

01:23.540 --> 01:30.200
But I get that people like, they like sharing them and I kind of like, I like viewing them

01:30.200 --> 01:32.960
sort of like I enjoy viewing desktop screenshots.

01:32.960 --> 01:36.120
Oh, that's an interesting way to do it.

01:36.120 --> 01:38.920
And sometimes I'm like, never going to do that.

01:38.920 --> 01:41.360
I'm just never going to go that far.

01:41.360 --> 01:45.640
It's discovery, you know, oh look, this person's got 47 apps.

01:45.640 --> 01:46.640
What's this one do?

01:46.640 --> 01:47.640
Yeah, that's true.

01:47.640 --> 01:48.640
That's true.

01:48.640 --> 01:50.540
Well, go see what you can do at the all new, a Cloud Guru.

01:50.540 --> 01:54.320
They are the leader in learning for the cloud, Linux and other modern tech skills, hundreds

01:54.320 --> 01:56.600
of courses and thousands of hands-on labs.

01:56.600 --> 02:00.040
Get certified, get hired, get learning at a cloudguru.com.

02:00.040 --> 02:01.840
Did you see the Plex Amp update?

02:01.840 --> 02:06.320
Wow, Alex, I was wondering if you caught this, I was going to ask you if you saw the new

02:06.320 --> 02:07.320
Plex Amp.

02:07.320 --> 02:12.440
Yeah, it's a big update for iOS and Android.

02:12.440 --> 02:16.880
And I think at least the iOS one will be released soon, but there's a desktop version of Plex

02:16.880 --> 02:19.460
Amp now as well, which I didn't even know.

02:19.460 --> 02:25.300
And they've added one feature that I've wanted since the very first time I tried Plex Amp

02:25.300 --> 02:26.900
and it's the shuffle button.

02:26.900 --> 02:28.400
So happy to have a shuffle button now.

02:28.400 --> 02:30.400
I don't know what to say to that.

02:30.400 --> 02:34.480
And I know you're going to be elated to see that they've also added Siri support.

02:34.480 --> 02:38.840
So now you can play music on Plex Amp through Siri, which I'm sure you're going to use all

02:38.840 --> 02:39.840
the time.

02:39.840 --> 02:46.040
And as you know, as being a heavy iOS user, I'm not, I'm still on Android.

02:46.040 --> 02:50.840
I tried to switch to iOS in January, but was wearing a lot of face masks in the hospital

02:50.840 --> 02:55.400
and face ID and all that, I ended up going back to Android.

02:55.400 --> 02:59.960
So I was delighted to see that they've now added Siri support.

02:59.960 --> 03:00.960
That's true.

03:00.960 --> 03:01.960
That's true.

03:01.960 --> 03:04.320
And it works, you know, it's very simple.

03:04.320 --> 03:05.540
It's nothing really to write home about.

03:05.540 --> 03:08.520
That's probably stuff that I should have had a long time ago.

03:08.520 --> 03:17.480
I think in general, Plex Amp is probably one of my favorite Plex adjacent ecosystem applications.

03:17.480 --> 03:21.040
We get people that write into the show and they'll say, why do you guys use Plex?

03:21.040 --> 03:23.560
There's Jellyfin, there's other alternatives.

03:23.560 --> 03:28.080
There's just this ecosystem around Plex now between the friends that I can share with

03:28.080 --> 03:33.880
like Alex for library sharing options, but also these apps around Plex that break off

03:33.880 --> 03:38.440
like the music experience into this individual app that's dedicated to just music.

03:38.440 --> 03:42.960
It's just wonderful and it's nice to see it get updated to version 3.4.5.

03:42.960 --> 03:47.920
It really makes the music experience in Plex quite pleasurable, to be honest with you.

03:47.920 --> 03:53.240
And the design language they've used for the application brings it up to the same sort

03:53.240 --> 03:56.080
of polish as something like Spotify or something like that.

03:56.080 --> 04:01.920
It is just a 100% native looking music app and I think it's freaking great.

04:01.920 --> 04:04.020
There's some things that aren't so freaking great though.

04:04.020 --> 04:08.520
Good and bad, I suppose Plex revealed that it recently completed a growth equity round

04:08.520 --> 04:13.480
of $50 million from an existing investor.

04:13.480 --> 04:17.800
And the company intends to invest its money in a mission to become a one stop shop for

04:17.800 --> 04:27.080
movies and TV and it aims to do this by addressing one of the most frustrating aspects today

04:27.080 --> 04:32.880
in the legal streaming market, they say, and that is fragmentation, all the different streaming

04:32.880 --> 04:33.880
services.

04:33.880 --> 04:38.600
They want to bring it all into Plex, including your pirated content or whatever else you

04:38.600 --> 04:39.600
might have on there.

04:39.600 --> 04:40.600
Like your home.

04:40.600 --> 04:43.960
Like for me, we use Plex for just home videos that we record that we don't want to put up

04:43.960 --> 04:49.160
like on YouTube or something and they want to bring it all into one UI and you can search

04:49.160 --> 04:53.480
all of it from the stuff in your own library to the stuff that's on Hulu to Netflix and

04:53.480 --> 04:58.620
Amazon Prime and Plex is they're going to work with these companies to get API access

04:58.620 --> 05:02.540
and integrate it all in there and try to try to make an experience where you go to one

05:02.540 --> 05:04.240
app and you get all the streaming services.

05:04.240 --> 05:08.080
I mean, I understand why they're doing this.

05:08.080 --> 05:14.800
The revenue streams of a few Plex Pass subscribers surely can't self sustain the company.

05:14.800 --> 05:22.200
I mean myself, as an example, I paid $75 for a lifetime Plex Pass half a decade ago, more

05:22.200 --> 05:25.460
than probably, and they haven't seen a penny from me since.

05:25.460 --> 05:33.960
And so I can understand how Hulu and Disney and Prime and Netflix are juicy targets for

05:33.960 --> 05:35.820
them to try and integrate into one place.

05:35.820 --> 05:43.520
But if I was Netflix or Prime or Disney, I'm not sure I would want people going outside

05:43.520 --> 05:49.160
my walled garden because the whole reason that these companies have dedicated gardens,

05:49.160 --> 05:52.920
walled gardens for their content is so that they can do analytics on it and they can track

05:52.920 --> 05:57.520
you through minute by minute, second by second of what you're watching.

05:57.520 --> 06:01.240
I mean, the Grand Tour is a great example of this.

06:01.240 --> 06:05.120
Old Top Gear turned into the Grand Tour with Jeremy Clarkson and all that, one of my favorite

06:05.120 --> 06:07.920
TV shows of all time.

06:07.920 --> 06:14.000
And a couple of years ago, Amazon decided to kill the studio part of the Grand Tour,

06:14.000 --> 06:18.400
which was my favorite part, in favor of just doing these epic specials.

06:18.400 --> 06:23.640
And now we only get two or three episodes, well, less, a couple of episodes a year of

06:23.640 --> 06:24.640
the Grand Tour.

06:24.640 --> 06:28.600
And they're these grand expeditions where they go to Madagascar and they put tank tracks

06:28.600 --> 06:33.280
on a Ford Fiesta and stupid stuff like that.

06:33.280 --> 06:37.080
Whereas what I watched the Grand Tour for was the cocking about between three old men

06:37.080 --> 06:39.640
sort of taking the Mickey out of each other.

06:39.640 --> 06:45.040
But the reason they did that, Amazon, was because their analytics showed that most people

06:45.040 --> 06:48.320
didn't watch the studio segments.

06:48.320 --> 06:51.920
You know, I can understand why they would make that change.

06:51.920 --> 06:57.640
But if you're Amazon and you're giving away API access to Plex, presumably you would bake

06:57.640 --> 07:01.240
in some of those analytics through the Plex client.

07:01.240 --> 07:06.640
But one of the benefits of having people in your app is that they're not going to exit

07:06.640 --> 07:10.320
that app to go to Netflix to go and watch a specific show over there.

07:10.320 --> 07:14.040
They're just going to carry on browsing in the portal they're already in.

07:14.040 --> 07:20.840
If Plex presents all of these different things in one place, the value prop to subscribe

07:20.840 --> 07:25.880
to these different services becomes just too generic at this point.

07:25.880 --> 07:27.960
And I just don't see it working, do you?

07:27.960 --> 07:32.840
I have to say, I completely agree, Alex, and it goes just beyond like analytics and whatnot.

07:32.840 --> 07:34.460
But there's also a technical angle.

07:34.460 --> 07:37.640
Perhaps they want to tweak how the playback engine works with their particular type of

07:37.640 --> 07:42.620
CDN, or maybe they want to feature content for some special show they've just released

07:42.620 --> 07:43.620
or some big movie.

07:43.620 --> 07:48.800
I just read this morning that Paramount Plus is planning to do a movie a month on their

07:48.800 --> 07:51.560
Paramount Plus streaming service.

07:51.560 --> 07:54.960
And I got to imagine that every time one of those movie drops, they're going to do some

07:54.960 --> 08:00.400
sort of big presentation in a carousel that lets everybody know our new content is here.

08:00.400 --> 08:03.960
I just can't imagine Plex accommodating all of those whims.

08:03.960 --> 08:07.480
All of these companies just got to become their own cable network essentially with their

08:07.480 --> 08:08.960
streaming service.

08:08.960 --> 08:12.880
And we've just gone through the last 10 years of them figuring out how to actually stream

08:12.880 --> 08:16.200
video and they're just starting to get good at it now.

08:16.200 --> 08:18.560
You know, Netflix had to set the example.

08:18.560 --> 08:22.600
And so I just don't really see this taking up.

08:22.600 --> 08:28.160
Maybe if Plex was willing to do something where they got access to the search API, and

08:28.160 --> 08:32.120
then if you selected a video, say it was the Grand Tour, it would then just launch the

08:32.120 --> 08:33.120
Amazon app.

08:33.120 --> 08:34.120
But how valuable is that?

08:34.120 --> 08:37.140
And how do you even do that, say, like in a web version or something?

08:37.140 --> 08:41.920
My Google Assistant does that already with voice search on the Nvidia Shield.

08:41.920 --> 08:44.160
It'll search through all the apps for me.

08:44.160 --> 08:45.160
Right.

08:45.160 --> 08:47.520
And Roku's trying to do the same thing and Apple wants to offer the same thing with the

08:47.520 --> 08:48.800
Siri remote.

08:48.800 --> 08:49.800
Absolutely.

08:49.800 --> 08:50.800
Yeah.

08:50.800 --> 08:52.920
And $15 million isn't enough to do this.

08:52.920 --> 08:56.120
So they raised 50 million from an existing investor.

08:56.120 --> 09:00.520
And as part of that, it includes 15 million in new capital for Plex, which they're going

09:00.520 --> 09:02.240
to invest in in this mission.

09:02.240 --> 09:04.120
That's nowhere near enough, is it?

09:04.120 --> 09:08.720
I can't imagine unless they see a way of monetizing this maybe through affiliate links or something

09:08.720 --> 09:10.720
like that with the streaming providers.

09:10.720 --> 09:11.720
Maybe.

09:11.720 --> 09:15.160
You know, Alex, that doesn't even touch on what I don't like about this.

09:15.160 --> 09:17.540
And that is this whole single pane of glass.

09:17.540 --> 09:20.000
They actually use that term experience.

09:20.000 --> 09:23.680
I use Plex intentionally for a curated experience.

09:23.680 --> 09:26.620
I don't want to see everything because it's a family, sir.

09:26.620 --> 09:27.940
It's something that we use for our family.

09:27.940 --> 09:33.460
That's why I take the time to put things on there individually, myself as the dad or when,

09:33.460 --> 09:39.360
you know, the mom requests something, I have a UI where they can go in and they can request

09:39.360 --> 09:40.360
things.

09:40.360 --> 09:43.400
It is intentionally separated from everything else.

09:43.400 --> 09:44.840
And there is an app on the screen.

09:44.840 --> 09:47.440
They launch it, they go in there and now everything's safe.

09:47.440 --> 09:52.400
I have parent stuff separated out from kids stuff and I have really no interest in mixing

09:52.400 --> 09:53.400
it on.

09:53.400 --> 09:57.520
I can't tell for sure at this stage, but reading between the lines, it does look like they're

09:57.520 --> 10:02.400
going to give you the option to not mix everything together, but it will be mixed by default.

10:02.400 --> 10:04.400
I mean, I guess time will tell on this one.

10:04.400 --> 10:08.000
I kind of hope we're proved right because I really agree with you.

10:08.000 --> 10:13.120
I don't want to see this stuff, like the reason I have Plex is because I want to control what

10:13.120 --> 10:14.120
I see.

10:14.120 --> 10:15.600
So yeah, I'm with you on that one.

10:15.600 --> 10:16.600
Yeah.

10:16.600 --> 10:20.280
It gets my head spinning immediately on, well, what would I go to?

10:20.280 --> 10:25.480
Well, what I transitioned to because I've got a lot of time invested in my Plex library.

10:25.480 --> 10:31.560
And so one of the things I've already done on our Apple TV is I've switched to using,

10:31.560 --> 10:34.880
I've talked about it before on the show, I switched to using Infuse and I'm going to

10:34.880 --> 10:36.040
put a link to it again.

10:36.040 --> 10:37.440
It's a paid app.

10:37.440 --> 10:41.080
It's like Kodi for Apple TV and I don't use that lightly.

10:41.080 --> 10:44.680
I have a lot of respect for Kodi, but this is like Kodi for Apple TV.

10:44.680 --> 10:52.160
It can bring together multiple servers over network connections, Google Drive, Dropbox,

10:52.160 --> 10:54.400
and it supports Plex.

10:54.400 --> 10:58.840
It'll do your watch status and everything that you would need to track in Plex.

10:58.840 --> 11:04.600
And it's just a, it's a fantastic UI and it has much better AirPlay support.

11:04.600 --> 11:09.800
So if you use HomePods with an Apple TV or you're using some kind of crazy AirPlay setup,

11:09.800 --> 11:14.420
Infuse does it perfectly where the actual Plex client on Apple TV and iOS is not actually

11:14.420 --> 11:15.560
great at that stuff.

11:15.560 --> 11:17.040
It sometimes has issues.

11:17.040 --> 11:22.440
And so when I see this news about one meta search engine for all streaming, I think,

11:22.440 --> 11:26.040
yeah, that's all good guys, but you're not even, you're not even enticing me to use your

11:26.040 --> 11:27.040
own app these days.

11:27.040 --> 11:31.000
Like there's other things to focus on and I have a lot of respect for the Plex folks,

11:31.000 --> 11:35.440
but it is just what it is now is I'm using Infuse and you can get it at firecore.com

11:35.440 --> 11:40.440
slash Infuse and they've just recently released a Mac desktop version too, which is kind of

11:40.440 --> 11:41.440
a neat idea I suppose.

11:41.440 --> 11:46.460
I know lots of the audience are frantically screaming at their, their podcast devices.

11:46.460 --> 11:47.560
What about Jellyfin?

11:47.560 --> 11:48.560
What about MB?

11:48.560 --> 11:52.520
Well, maybe one day, maybe you and I eventually will become Jellyfin guys in the future.

11:52.520 --> 11:53.520
It could happen.

11:53.520 --> 11:56.360
I do, uh, I do experiment it with from time to time.

11:56.360 --> 11:58.280
Have you ever kicked the tires with Jellyfin?

11:58.280 --> 12:01.120
I have, and I went back to Plex.

12:01.120 --> 12:02.120
Okay.

12:02.120 --> 12:03.120
Sorry.

12:03.120 --> 12:05.600
I mean, it's a, it's pretty good for what it is.

12:05.600 --> 12:10.960
Uh, it's just Plex as a headstart and, uh, the, the fit and finish of the UI and the

12:10.960 --> 12:17.500
experience I have there is, is much better on, uh, on Plex than Jellyfin.

12:17.500 --> 12:19.280
What would it take for you to switch?

12:19.280 --> 12:24.560
I think when it's, uh, suitable for my family members, you know, that they have a lot of

12:24.560 --> 12:29.360
time invested in learning Plex's various UI changes over the years.

12:29.360 --> 12:32.960
And they kind of figured out how it works now for the most part.

12:32.960 --> 12:38.720
Once Jellyfin's at that kind of level of, of polish, it's just not yet though.

12:38.720 --> 12:40.680
Linode.com slash SSH.

12:40.680 --> 12:43.400
Linode is the largest independent cloud computing provider.

12:43.400 --> 12:49.520
And when you go to linode.com slash SSH, you'll get $100 in 60 day credit towards a new account.

12:49.520 --> 12:51.620
And you can go there to support the show too.

12:51.620 --> 12:53.360
We were just talking about media servers.

12:53.360 --> 12:56.960
Well, Linode has a one click application deployment for Plex.

12:56.960 --> 12:59.560
If you want to get a Plex server up in the cloud, which is a great way to share with

12:59.560 --> 13:01.680
friends and family at super fast streaming speeds.

13:01.680 --> 13:05.040
Of course, you could just build your own stack and deploy Jellyfin or anything you'd like.

13:05.040 --> 13:09.080
And no matter what skill level you're at or what technology stack you're familiar with

13:09.080 --> 13:11.640
using, Linode will help you get it going online.

13:11.640 --> 13:14.520
They have a really easy to use dashboard.

13:14.520 --> 13:18.780
And if you have any trouble getting things going or run into any kind of problem, Linode

13:18.780 --> 13:23.840
has amazing, fantastic, great, outrageously good customer support.

13:23.840 --> 13:25.760
By phone or ticket, they're going to help you get it solved.

13:25.760 --> 13:30.520
If you've got one rig or you're like me and you're crossing like the 15 rig mark or something.

13:30.520 --> 13:33.880
I mean, it's getting crazy because we use Linode for everything and it's not just like

13:33.880 --> 13:36.040
haphazardly.

13:36.040 --> 13:39.820
We think about every machine we deploy and we decide, okay, is this going to be the machine

13:39.820 --> 13:41.740
that is just a dedicated box?

13:41.740 --> 13:45.200
Maybe it only runs one application or it runs just a couple of things.

13:45.200 --> 13:47.220
Or is this going to be something like an application server?

13:47.220 --> 13:51.080
We have a couple of these too, where these are more powerful Linodes and we run multiple

13:51.080 --> 13:58.000
containers on them running multiple applications from mail to encoding services to matrix to,

13:58.000 --> 14:00.080
well, really you run the gamut.

14:00.080 --> 14:03.360
Anything we're just talking about on the show, we pretty much hosted on Linode.

14:03.360 --> 14:04.360
People ask me, why Chris?

14:04.360 --> 14:05.680
Because there's a lot of places to host.

14:05.680 --> 14:09.600
Well, the reason for that really comes down to a few core things that I think are pretty

14:09.600 --> 14:10.680
important.

14:10.680 --> 14:12.760
Number one, it is a really good product.

14:12.760 --> 14:13.760
It's very fast.

14:13.760 --> 14:15.320
They have 11 data centers worldwide.

14:15.320 --> 14:16.840
The interconnects between the data centers.

14:16.840 --> 14:20.280
I think beat what everybody else has, hands down.

14:20.280 --> 14:24.280
Linode is their own ISP, so they just have a networking opportunity that people that

14:24.280 --> 14:26.880
haven't been around as long don't have.

14:26.880 --> 14:29.600
Additionally, they're dedicated CPU rigs.

14:29.600 --> 14:31.960
They're just faster than other people's dedicated CPU rigs.

14:31.960 --> 14:33.460
I like that.

14:33.460 --> 14:36.840
Then you factor in that they're really just good Linux loving folks.

14:36.840 --> 14:41.360
They have been since 2003 and that factors into some of the decisions and how they've

14:41.360 --> 14:45.020
built the product and those things appealed to me.

14:45.020 --> 14:49.060
They make it easy for me to use and I feel like it's very simple, but when I need power

14:49.060 --> 14:51.400
in that dashboard, it's there.

14:51.400 --> 14:54.600
Then there's services like their S3 compatible object storage.

14:54.600 --> 15:00.000
Now, this is great because I can use S3 object storage for backup, for configs that I want

15:00.000 --> 15:04.620
to store off-site, or we use it as the backend storage mechanism for our next cloud instance

15:04.620 --> 15:08.600
so we're not having to sit there and fiddle with different disk sizes like amateurs.

15:08.600 --> 15:11.200
We just throw it on the S3 storage.

15:11.200 --> 15:16.000
But Linode's so fast that it really is very performant and it's a great way to build a

15:16.000 --> 15:17.360
static website.

15:17.360 --> 15:18.920
There's so much you can do there.

15:18.920 --> 15:23.220
If you just need something simple like a portfolio website, or if you want to run the backend

15:23.220 --> 15:27.920
infrastructure for your team collaboration or for your e-commerce website, Linode's going

15:27.920 --> 15:29.240
to be able to do it all.

15:29.240 --> 15:31.520
So go to linode.com slash SSH.

15:31.520 --> 15:37.480
Get that $100 60-day credit on your new account and then just see what it can do.

15:37.480 --> 15:40.840
See what we've been talking about and see why we use it for everything.

15:40.840 --> 15:44.400
linode.com slash SSH.

15:44.400 --> 15:47.240
Now what do you do for home assistant wall panels?

15:47.240 --> 15:50.880
I recall you bought a fire tablet a while ago, right?

15:50.880 --> 15:52.400
I have a couple of them now, yep.

15:52.400 --> 15:57.680
I have a 10-inch one and a seven-inch one that I have mounted in the in the lady juke's

15:57.680 --> 15:58.680
RV.

15:58.680 --> 15:59.680
How are they working out for you?

15:59.680 --> 16:00.680
Do you like them?

16:00.680 --> 16:01.680
Pretty good.

16:01.680 --> 16:02.680
Pretty good.

16:02.680 --> 16:04.160
Not very good performance.

16:04.160 --> 16:10.120
And also one of them, even though I bought the no ads model, has ads on the lock screen

16:10.120 --> 16:12.320
and I find that frustrating.

16:12.320 --> 16:16.280
So the performance is not fantastic, but just sitting there with a web page up and after

16:16.280 --> 16:21.120
I install an app, after I sideload an app like an animal to keep the screen on, they

16:21.120 --> 16:22.120
get the job done.

16:22.120 --> 16:23.120
All right.

16:23.120 --> 16:24.120
Well, I've got a solution for you.

16:24.120 --> 16:34.040
My wife has or had, it's mine now, a fire seven-inch HD tablet from 2015.

16:34.040 --> 16:40.520
We paid 35 pounds for this tablet six years ago.

16:40.520 --> 16:41.520
The battery is crap.

16:41.520 --> 16:44.040
I mean, the battery was crap when it was new.

16:44.040 --> 16:45.120
The screen is bad.

16:45.120 --> 16:48.820
It was bad back then, so it's really bad now.

16:48.820 --> 16:53.840
It's just not a great device, let's be honest, but it was 35 pounds six years ago.

16:53.840 --> 17:00.880
And I thought to myself, wouldn't it be cool if I had a wall-mounted tablet dashboard?

17:00.880 --> 17:01.880
Good for you.

17:01.880 --> 17:07.600
In my workshop, I've been doing some automation around the woodworking blast gates that I

17:07.600 --> 17:08.600
have.

17:08.600 --> 17:10.440
We'll talk about that more in an upcoming episode.

17:10.440 --> 17:15.120
And then basically I just wanted a touchscreen panel that I could just jab my fat fingers

17:15.120 --> 17:17.400
on and just open a certain blast gate.

17:17.400 --> 17:21.920
I didn't want to spend any money because it's already, woodworking is already expensive

17:21.920 --> 17:22.920
enough.

17:22.920 --> 17:25.720
Did you think about going with a voice tube out there before this or do you already have

17:25.720 --> 17:26.720
one?

17:26.720 --> 17:28.160
Well, I have a voice tube out there.

17:28.160 --> 17:34.320
It's the lady cylinder and I, I don't know, I've kind of really gone off shouting orders

17:34.320 --> 17:37.400
across the room at these things.

17:37.400 --> 17:42.560
In the rental house last, before we bought this one, everything was on the Google voice

17:42.560 --> 17:48.440
system, but I didn't set any of that up once we moved and I haven't since and I just don't

17:48.440 --> 17:49.440
miss it.

17:49.440 --> 17:52.400
I'm mixed on it myself because there's sometimes you have to restate yourself and you always

17:52.400 --> 17:55.040
feel like a fool when it gets it wrong.

17:55.040 --> 17:58.600
There's always that thing where you're making eye contact with the cylinder waiting for

17:58.600 --> 17:59.600
it to light up.

17:59.600 --> 18:00.880
And I'm like, Oh yeah.

18:00.880 --> 18:05.600
And then in my situation you add every time we're off grid, of course the voice transcription

18:05.600 --> 18:06.600
doesn't work.

18:06.600 --> 18:09.560
So that's really where I was like, okay, we got to have tablets.

18:09.560 --> 18:12.760
And also it's nice to glance at it and just see what's on and what's off.

18:12.760 --> 18:14.640
So how did you go about accomplishing this?

18:14.640 --> 18:19.720
Well, I put Lineage OS, which is an open source version of Android.

18:19.720 --> 18:24.720
I think it's what came out of the cyanogen mod project a few years ago.

18:24.720 --> 18:33.120
I put Lineage OS 12 on this tablet and performance is better than the Amazon OS that was on there

18:33.120 --> 18:36.960
before, but it's still a six year old device.

18:36.960 --> 18:37.960
You know what I mean?

18:37.960 --> 18:40.320
Well, any performance improvement would be good.

18:40.320 --> 18:41.960
This has crossed my mind before.

18:41.960 --> 18:43.080
I have thought about doing this.

18:43.080 --> 18:46.240
I just wasn't sure if it was really worth the bother.

18:46.240 --> 18:47.560
It was a bit of a pain, right?

18:47.560 --> 18:52.800
I had to unlock the bootloader, which involved, I had to take the back off the tablet, bridge

18:52.800 --> 18:59.200
a couple of pins on the motherboard to ground the bootloader out so that it would boot into

18:59.200 --> 19:01.600
the bootloader mode for Android.

19:01.600 --> 19:05.880
I don't know if you've ever done anything with ADB and fast boot.

19:05.880 --> 19:07.000
A while ago, but yeah.

19:07.000 --> 19:12.120
I had to use those tools to put a custom recovery partition on there.

19:12.120 --> 19:17.840
So I used Team Win Recovery Project, TWRP and sideloaded on there a bunch of different

19:17.840 --> 19:22.160
APKs and the Lineage OS ROM.

19:22.160 --> 19:26.660
This process probably took me an evening of mostly futzing about and getting into that

19:26.660 --> 19:28.600
bootloader mode was the hardest part.

19:28.600 --> 19:31.720
Are you using Windows to do any of this?

19:31.720 --> 19:35.960
I have all three in this room, so between the different devices.

19:35.960 --> 19:37.800
Does it require Windows is what I'm asking?

19:37.800 --> 19:38.800
Do you need Windows?

19:38.800 --> 19:40.440
Because I'm out.

19:40.440 --> 19:42.160
That's a disqualifier for me right there.

19:42.160 --> 19:44.880
I think this one works best under Linux.

19:44.880 --> 19:47.920
I actually just used a Raspberry Pi in the end.

19:47.920 --> 19:48.920
Oh, okay.

19:48.920 --> 19:49.920
I have those.

19:49.920 --> 19:50.920
I know you do.

19:50.920 --> 19:56.480
I ended up just using a Raspberry Pi with Ubuntu on so all right, now you're talking

19:56.480 --> 20:01.320
about language, so it took you a little bit of an evening, but it sounds like if I followed

20:01.320 --> 20:03.560
some tips from you, maybe it wouldn't take me that long.

20:03.560 --> 20:09.040
Well, this is for the specific revision of the 2015 7 inch Fire tablet, so I don't know

20:09.040 --> 20:11.920
if the newer ones have a more locked down bootloader.

20:11.920 --> 20:16.520
That's the key is once you can get a custom recovery software on there, you can install

20:16.520 --> 20:17.960
whatever image you like.

20:17.960 --> 20:22.200
My first question, once you get the OS on there is do you do G apps and do you need

20:22.200 --> 20:24.600
G apps for this for this tablet?

20:24.600 --> 20:28.420
No, you definitely don't anymore because of F Droid.

20:28.420 --> 20:33.280
So my use case was to use this thing exclusively for home assistant, right?

20:33.280 --> 20:40.240
And so linear Joe s out of the box ships with no Google software whatsoever, which is awesome

20:40.240 --> 20:42.640
on such an underpowered device.

20:42.640 --> 20:43.960
And then so I just loaded F Droid.

20:43.960 --> 20:50.880
I went to the F Droid website, enabled unsigned or unknown sources for APK installation, installed

20:50.880 --> 20:56.440
the F Droid APK, and now I have a Google-less app store and home assistant is available

20:56.440 --> 20:57.440
in that app store.

20:57.440 --> 20:59.240
So happy days.

20:59.240 --> 21:00.400
And how are you doing the screen?

21:00.400 --> 21:01.400
Are you letting it sleep?

21:01.400 --> 21:03.080
Are you leaving it on all the time?

21:03.080 --> 21:08.280
Because it's going to be used very infrequently, uh, I have just used the standard lock and

21:08.280 --> 21:12.480
unlock and it's going to take me a couple of taps to unlock the screen, but I use it

21:12.480 --> 21:14.440
a couple of times a day.

21:14.440 --> 21:15.440
If that so.

21:15.440 --> 21:16.440
Yeah.

21:16.440 --> 21:17.440
Yeah, that makes sense.

21:17.440 --> 21:22.000
Now, the other question I have is, are you using the web dashboard or did you load the

21:22.000 --> 21:24.640
home assistant app and interface with it that way?

21:24.640 --> 21:28.320
Yeah, I loaded the app through F Droid and, uh, the, the performance.

21:28.320 --> 21:33.600
So I have a lot of experience with how long it takes to load that up on my phone and it

21:33.600 --> 21:41.680
can take a beat sometimes performance of Lovelace and, uh, the, the interface of home assistant

21:41.680 --> 21:44.160
should be better, shall we say, even on modern hardware.

21:44.160 --> 21:49.480
So you can imagine on this six year old device, it takes a good 10 seconds to load.

21:49.480 --> 21:50.640
Once it's loaded, it's fine.

21:50.640 --> 21:55.120
And it works just fine, but it's that initial load that can take a while.

21:55.120 --> 21:57.440
If you have a guide or anything like that, there's something we could share in the show

21:57.440 --> 21:58.440
notes.

21:58.440 --> 21:59.440
Yep.

21:59.440 --> 22:00.440
It's already in there.

22:00.440 --> 22:03.000
That'll be at self hosted dot show slash 44.

22:03.000 --> 22:06.960
We talked about health checks IO last episode and in there I asked you about monitoring

22:06.960 --> 22:12.880
if API's or services are up and you mentioned Prometheus, well, I want you to tell me more

22:12.880 --> 22:16.160
about it because we got a few people that bit via email.

22:16.160 --> 22:17.720
Yeah, we did actually.

22:17.720 --> 22:22.600
And I was quite surprised to see just how many people either already use Prometheus

22:22.600 --> 22:27.280
and wanted to tell me all about how awesome it was or didn't use it and wanted to know

22:27.280 --> 22:28.280
more.

22:28.280 --> 22:29.880
So here's a little primer.

22:29.880 --> 22:35.960
Essentially Prometheus scrapes data on remote servers, gathers it into one place.

22:35.960 --> 22:43.440
You write queries to query that data and present it in a dashboard or forward on certain things

22:43.440 --> 22:46.960
to something called alert manager, which can then alert you.

22:46.960 --> 22:52.480
So if your disc percentage, for example, on a remote system goes above 80% used, you could

22:52.480 --> 22:57.780
have it notify you of that and say, Hey, you should probably go and delete some stuff before

22:57.780 --> 22:59.460
this server fills up.

22:59.460 --> 23:06.640
Now what I ended up using it for is my VMware box downstairs, it's now just my home lab.

23:06.640 --> 23:07.920
It's not actually my main server.

23:07.920 --> 23:14.240
It's just performing OpenShift home lab duties for me and I put it into a case where fan

23:14.240 --> 23:16.460
control was a bit of an issue.

23:16.460 --> 23:22.440
And so I mentioned in the previous episode about a fan controller, the Corsair commander

23:22.440 --> 23:27.160
pro that is usable on Linux now.

23:27.160 --> 23:33.360
But one of the things I wanted to do was actually get a feel for how the CPU temperatures were

23:33.360 --> 23:38.160
in that system over time, because I've got a couple of hard drives in there and you know,

23:38.160 --> 23:41.420
if things are getting toasty, hard drives tend to die pretty quickly.

23:41.420 --> 23:48.380
So what I wanted to do was monitor that VMware vCenter instance with Prometheus and have

23:48.380 --> 23:49.920
it alert me if there was a problem.

23:49.920 --> 23:55.960
I ended up using this thing called VMware exporter and there's a link to the Docker

23:55.960 --> 23:58.620
compose snippet in the show notes.

23:58.620 --> 24:06.440
And this thing, basically what it does is it logs into vSphere's API every pre-prescribed

24:06.440 --> 24:07.440
interval.

24:07.440 --> 24:12.200
I think I've got it set to like 15 seconds or something, scrapes a bunch of data available

24:12.200 --> 24:18.240
through the vCenter API, which includes stuff at the host level like CPU temperature, but

24:18.240 --> 24:22.700
also includes the IPMI data like the voltages and all that kind of stuff.

24:22.700 --> 24:26.820
So it's pretty granular and pretty detailed if you want to know that stuff.

24:26.820 --> 24:30.600
And then it imports it into the Prometheus real time database.

24:30.600 --> 24:35.080
And from there, once it's in Prometheus, I can query it using Grafana or whatever else

24:35.080 --> 24:36.080
I want to.

24:36.080 --> 24:44.640
And I use a container called PryOrder, I think is how you say it, PryOrder VMware exporter,

24:44.640 --> 24:47.260
super simple little Python app and just does the job.

24:47.260 --> 24:50.020
What kind of hardware utilization, I guess, is what I'm asking.

24:50.020 --> 24:54.220
So if I have a system, I have an existing Xeon box here at the studio.

24:54.220 --> 24:58.280
It's probably about 30% utilized CPU wise and memory wise.

24:58.280 --> 24:59.280
Do I need something more powerful?

24:59.280 --> 25:02.000
Do I have enough headroom for running these kinds of services?

25:02.000 --> 25:05.240
A Prometheus itself is pretty lightweight.

25:05.240 --> 25:10.420
With any real time metrics gathering system like this, we'll probably want to put it on

25:10.420 --> 25:12.580
some kind of a flash based storage media.

25:12.580 --> 25:18.200
So you'll need a few gigabytes scratch disc for that to use.

25:18.200 --> 25:22.800
But then once you've done that, you need to create what are called scrape jobs, which

25:22.800 --> 25:27.280
is how you tell Prometheus what to look for and what to kind of gather in terms of metrics

25:27.280 --> 25:29.480
on remote systems.

25:29.480 --> 25:34.680
You can figure that in my favorite language of them all, in a YAML file.

25:34.680 --> 25:39.500
And once you've done that with Prometheus, you kind of set it, forget it and never worry

25:39.500 --> 25:40.780
about it ever again.

25:40.780 --> 25:43.680
And then how long does it collect for forever?

25:43.680 --> 25:44.800
How long do you do it for?

25:44.800 --> 25:46.320
I haven't really worried about it.

25:46.320 --> 25:48.760
I just sort of forever keep them forever.

25:48.760 --> 25:49.760
Yeah.

25:49.760 --> 25:53.800
I mean, I guess if you're in an enterprise situation where you're scraping 10,000 servers,

25:53.800 --> 25:58.440
that might be an issue, but I'm not so yeah, so maybe not a big deal.

25:58.440 --> 25:59.440
You could be.

25:59.440 --> 26:00.440
That'd be kind of fun, wouldn't it?

26:00.440 --> 26:02.000
Go back 10 years and look at stuff.

26:02.000 --> 26:05.800
Oh, well, I mean, look, this is how these big guys do it.

26:05.800 --> 26:11.080
I mean, Kubernetes clusters the world over and monitored by Prometheus.

26:11.080 --> 26:14.360
OpenShift actually ships a bunch of stuff with Prometheus built in.

26:14.360 --> 26:18.320
And so this is one of those technologies that if you're thinking about getting into DevOps

26:18.320 --> 26:24.080
and that kind of space of site reliability engineering, these are the sorts of tools

26:24.080 --> 26:27.640
that you should be mucking about within your home lab and trying to figure out how they

26:27.640 --> 26:31.200
work and understand them because you'll be able to take that knowledge and use it to

26:31.200 --> 26:32.200
get a better job.

26:32.200 --> 26:33.200
Yep.

26:33.200 --> 26:34.200
Great skill to have.

26:34.200 --> 26:35.200
I just like the idea.

26:35.200 --> 26:39.680
I just like the idea of picturing you like 10 years from now looking back at some graph

26:39.680 --> 26:44.680
analogs and just kind of getting nostalgic from graphs and logs.

26:44.680 --> 26:47.920
My CPU is 33 degrees on May the 5th, 2021.

26:47.920 --> 26:48.920
Hey, great.

26:48.920 --> 26:51.560
Ah, I remember that.

26:51.560 --> 26:55.320
Those were the days.

26:55.320 --> 26:56.440
Cloudfree.shop.

26:56.440 --> 27:01.960
Head over there and buy from a community member who has built a business out of creating devices

27:01.960 --> 27:05.200
that are ready to go without any cloud restriction.

27:05.200 --> 27:11.520
And they posted an update in February and you got to mention in here, he says, did we?

27:11.520 --> 27:12.520
How cool is that?

27:12.520 --> 27:15.600
He says, I need to also thank Alex and the self-hosted podcast.

27:15.600 --> 27:20.360
I've listened to Jupiter broadcasting podcast for over seven years and without our partnership,

27:20.360 --> 27:22.880
Cloudfree would not have grown nearly as fast as it did.

27:22.880 --> 27:27.040
And I got to say it hit me in the feels because the picture they have in that looks a lot

27:27.040 --> 27:30.520
like what we're doing for the Jupiter garage shipping right now.

27:30.520 --> 27:34.760
And I just totally realized like I'm learning a lot of the same stuff that they had to learn

27:34.760 --> 27:37.480
to do Cloudfree right now.

27:37.480 --> 27:41.120
And so I felt very like, like I had a kinship all of a sudden and I thought that was really

27:41.120 --> 27:44.800
great that they, they had a really, this is a really good, this is a really positive update.

27:44.800 --> 27:48.640
It looks like things are going really well for Cloudfree and that's why we like to mention

27:48.640 --> 27:49.640
them.

27:49.640 --> 27:51.320
It was an idea that I think needed to happen.

27:51.320 --> 27:55.760
And it's, it's a great way to go get devices at a very reasonable price, like outdoor and

27:55.760 --> 28:03.440
indoor smart plugs, Zigbee dongles, temperature sensors, motion sensors, Z-Wave buttons, door

28:03.440 --> 28:06.720
sensors, all that kind of stuff that you might want to, you might want to hook up to home

28:06.720 --> 28:10.180
assistant, but you know, you don't want to have to bother with the reflashing yourself

28:10.180 --> 28:14.880
or worrying about the required cloud connectivity that they ship with by default.

28:14.880 --> 28:16.240
Cloudfree just takes care of all that.

28:16.240 --> 28:19.320
That's why we like to give them a mention at cloudfree.shop.

28:19.320 --> 28:22.560
And when you're over there, don't forget to use the coupon code self-hosted so that they

28:22.560 --> 28:24.120
know we sent you.

28:24.120 --> 28:29.040
All right, feedback time, I think Daniel writes in, I'm currently using a Synology

28:29.040 --> 28:33.480
216J with an EXT4 volume mirrored on two drives.

28:33.480 --> 28:38.920
I'm curious about how I might go about upgrading here and prioritize backup ergonomics.

28:38.920 --> 28:45.200
Right now I don't have snapshots and I'm considering switching to ZFS or ButterFS, brackets, please

28:45.200 --> 28:47.600
don't fight.

28:47.600 --> 28:51.720
How can I do this without purchasing a huge external hard drive to move everything over

28:51.720 --> 28:54.040
whilst I build a new volume?

28:54.040 --> 28:59.520
So NFS seems kind of antiquated and I'm wondering if this is the fastest way to mount things

28:59.520 --> 29:00.520
over the network.

29:00.520 --> 29:01.520
Is there a better option?

29:01.520 --> 29:02.520
Hmm.

29:02.520 --> 29:04.000
A little NFS hate there, huh?

29:04.000 --> 29:05.840
No, I used to think that too.

29:05.840 --> 29:08.880
You know, actually that's sort of the beauty of NFS is that it's so simple.

29:08.880 --> 29:13.600
It is extremely efficient, but there are lots of ways to transfer files over the network.

29:13.600 --> 29:19.840
It is old, but you know, one way you could look at old is tested, you know, reliable.

29:19.840 --> 29:20.840
Right.

29:20.840 --> 29:21.840
Boring.

29:21.840 --> 29:23.100
And it's still in production.

29:23.100 --> 29:24.400
So this is an interesting question.

29:24.400 --> 29:29.000
It's like I want to do something that's kind of risky, like switch to ZFS or ButterFS,

29:29.000 --> 29:34.340
but I don't want to have to purchase an external hard drive to back everything up to.

29:34.340 --> 29:37.280
And there's definitely part of me that's like, that's just not how it works.

29:37.280 --> 29:41.040
I just want to say, you know, when you're messing with important data, you do kind of

29:41.040 --> 29:47.760
want to externalize it because you can convert an extended for partition in place to ButterFS.

29:47.760 --> 29:49.480
I've done it a couple of times actually.

29:49.480 --> 29:54.520
I was just having a conversation with somebody earlier this morning about just that thing.

29:54.520 --> 29:58.840
And it'll work, but I can't tell you it's risk-free.

29:58.840 --> 30:00.640
It is absolutely not.

30:00.640 --> 30:02.280
And so I don't know how you get around that.

30:02.280 --> 30:06.540
Do you have any ideas on maybe like pulling other disks on your LAN or I mean something

30:06.540 --> 30:07.880
out of the box?

30:07.880 --> 30:08.880
Not really.

30:08.880 --> 30:13.520
I mean, it goes back to that whole RAID is not a backup type thing.

30:13.520 --> 30:19.520
So even if you have a volume mirrored on two drives, unless that data exists somewhere else

30:19.520 --> 30:24.580
as well, I would pretty much say that data doesn't actually exist at all because if that

30:24.580 --> 30:27.260
mirror was to go pop, that data is gone.

30:27.260 --> 30:33.720
So this is probably not what you want to hear, but I would buy that external hard drive,

30:33.720 --> 30:37.360
mirror everything onto that external hard drive, free up the two drives that you want

30:37.360 --> 30:42.920
to put ZFS or ButterFS onto, and then you should be good to go.

30:42.920 --> 30:44.600
That I completely agree with.

30:44.600 --> 30:49.220
And now as an aside, I want to just acknowledge that I do feel like we go about our daily

30:49.220 --> 30:54.680
lives totally underutilizing lots of free space on the systems on our LAN.

30:54.680 --> 30:59.440
And I know there's a couple of projects out there to crack this nut, but if anybody listening

30:59.440 --> 31:03.960
is using something and it has been using it for a little bit to take advantage of maybe

31:03.960 --> 31:09.800
a machine over here that's connected via Ethernet that has 120 gigs free and this machine over

31:09.800 --> 31:13.080
here that has a terabyte free and I have a machine over here that has 500 gigs and a

31:13.080 --> 31:19.040
machine over here that has four terabytes free, and I just need temporarily, I just

31:19.040 --> 31:22.760
need somewhere to store an extra seven terabytes a day, it's like, could I pool everything

31:22.760 --> 31:29.480
somehow together and then somehow trust that this network file system would work?

31:29.480 --> 31:34.120
And there's ways you could hack it together, especially on Linux with different mount points

31:34.120 --> 31:37.140
and all of that, but I just don't know of a solid one.

31:37.140 --> 31:42.900
So selfhosted.show slash contact, if anyone out there has something just out of curiosity,

31:42.900 --> 31:46.160
just be a fun thought experiment to pool the storage on my network.

31:46.160 --> 31:50.000
I don't think I'd use it for anything in production or for backup though.

31:50.000 --> 31:51.640
Just don't think I would.

31:51.640 --> 31:56.880
The next one comes from Mike and he's responding to a question I proposed last week about using

31:56.880 --> 32:02.720
home assistant automations to cycle the charging of batteries on and off so that way devices

32:02.720 --> 32:09.380
don't sit at 100% charged for days or they don't stay at 0% charged, maybe something

32:09.380 --> 32:11.840
in the 40 to 60% range.

32:11.840 --> 32:16.240
It'd be lovely to have an option to say, today I want everything charged to 100% because

32:16.240 --> 32:19.080
we're going on a road trip today and we need everything charged up.

32:19.080 --> 32:23.000
And we got a couple ideas suggested and I liked Mike's and I wanted to give it a read

32:23.000 --> 32:24.000
here.

32:24.000 --> 32:28.520
He says, since there's really no out of the box solution right now, I'm creating a script

32:28.520 --> 32:32.400
that scrapes my laptop's battery info and then we'll publish it to my home assistant's

32:32.400 --> 32:38.400
MQTT broker and then home assistant will act on that data to power cycle my laptop's power

32:38.400 --> 32:39.680
supply.

32:39.680 --> 32:40.680
Keep up the show.

32:40.680 --> 32:41.680
Thanks.

32:41.680 --> 32:42.680
And Mike, good idea.

32:42.680 --> 32:44.400
That's great for the laptops.

32:44.400 --> 32:50.760
The impossible nut that I'm trying to crack is like iOS devices, maybe even drone batteries,

32:50.760 --> 32:55.520
things that don't even have an OS to scrape from, but you'd almost need like a time-based

32:55.520 --> 32:56.840
system I suppose.

32:56.840 --> 32:58.800
I'm still chewing on it right now.

32:58.800 --> 33:04.920
I just kind of do it manually and it's not bad, but an example of a system that I probably

33:04.920 --> 33:10.620
don't unplug and cycle the battery as frequently as I should are those fire tablets that are

33:10.620 --> 33:11.920
plugged in and mounted on the wall.

33:11.920 --> 33:16.500
I do power cycle them on occasion, but not regularly.

33:16.500 --> 33:20.120
And with the home assistant app on Android, like there is something I could do there,

33:20.120 --> 33:22.560
but I'm not looking for onesy-twosy solutions.

33:22.560 --> 33:25.120
I'm kind of looking for something that would work for everything.

33:25.120 --> 33:30.600
I'm going to plug something that our community started about six months ago called Halcyon

33:30.600 --> 33:33.740
Home Assistant Linux Companion App.

33:33.740 --> 33:37.360
And there's a link in the show notes, halcyon.casa.

33:37.360 --> 33:43.900
It's a Rust-based application designed to run on Linux systems to present those metrics

33:43.900 --> 33:45.680
to home assistant.

33:45.680 --> 33:49.640
It's early days and it needs some love and some work still, but if you're interested

33:49.640 --> 33:54.320
in that, check out, there's a dedicated channel in the Discord for Halcyon as well.

33:54.320 --> 33:55.320
And it's written in Rust.

33:55.320 --> 33:56.320
So what more could you want?

33:56.320 --> 33:57.320
I love that.

33:57.320 --> 34:02.360
Now, Brad writes in, I'm looking into moving off Google Photos like everybody else, it

34:02.360 --> 34:03.360
seems.

34:03.360 --> 34:05.960
I've landed on Plex Photos as my solution.

34:05.960 --> 34:11.600
I have some friends that are also self-hosters and I've given them WireGuard access and they

34:11.600 --> 34:18.040
said I can have a few hundred gig of storage on their networks for my photos and vice versa.

34:18.040 --> 34:21.800
What I'm stuck on though is an encrypted backup method for backups.

34:21.800 --> 34:23.280
I've tried Duplicati.

34:23.280 --> 34:26.480
I've tried some other backup solutions.

34:26.480 --> 34:31.240
I don't really care about how it backs up file changes as the library is growing.

34:31.240 --> 34:35.040
I'm not editing the photos, so only incremental is needed.

34:35.040 --> 34:39.280
They do need to be encrypted though, because they're going to be on a remote LAN.

34:39.280 --> 34:42.520
Now I haven't done a lot of research on this yet, but do you know of any software that

34:42.520 --> 34:48.240
does an automated one-way backup, phone to server for example, to get the photos off

34:48.240 --> 34:52.400
my phone and onto the server where I can delete them off my phone and they will stay on the

34:52.400 --> 34:53.400
server.

34:53.400 --> 34:54.760
Looking forward to future episodes.

34:54.760 --> 34:55.760
Thanks, Brad.

34:55.760 --> 34:57.800
This is a good question.

34:57.800 --> 34:59.440
Duplicati is not quite cutting it.

34:59.440 --> 35:01.960
And so what do you step up to essentially?

35:01.960 --> 35:04.760
And you don't want something probably that's a lot to manage either.

35:04.760 --> 35:08.520
Oh, Duplicati's just wound me up over the years.

35:08.520 --> 35:13.080
You know, it just silently fails and stuff just breaks and there's no way to monitor

35:13.080 --> 35:16.100
it and you can only configure it through the GUI.

35:16.100 --> 35:17.100
It's a great app.

35:17.100 --> 35:21.960
It just isn't very reliable, which is not really suitable for a backup system.

35:21.960 --> 35:22.960
Yeah.

35:22.960 --> 35:28.080
I don't know where the failure process, when my backups failed, when my Google Drive payment

35:28.080 --> 35:32.080
expired or it was switched, I don't know where the failure was exactly.

35:32.080 --> 35:34.800
I don't know if there wasn't a notification, but I don't know what.

35:34.800 --> 35:36.440
It was ultimately it was my fault.

35:36.440 --> 35:42.040
I thought about recommending Borg, which is a really solid backup, open source solution.

35:42.040 --> 35:43.920
It's pretty space efficient.

35:43.920 --> 35:46.080
It gives you good encrypted backups.

35:46.080 --> 35:51.440
It supports compression and it'll use fuse too, so you can do kind of creative ways to

35:51.440 --> 35:54.400
mount file systems, which could be kind of nice.

35:54.400 --> 35:55.760
And it has a pretty large community.

35:55.760 --> 35:57.880
You can find it at borg-backup.org.

35:57.880 --> 35:59.840
That might be worth looking into.

35:59.840 --> 36:01.760
Borg is an alternative.

36:01.760 --> 36:02.760
Restik is another one.

36:02.760 --> 36:05.720
We mentioned Auto Restik and Restik last episode.

36:05.720 --> 36:06.880
That's another one.

36:06.880 --> 36:11.680
But for getting the things off your phone, I've just been really happy with the NextCloud

36:11.680 --> 36:13.140
app.

36:13.140 --> 36:18.180
It backs up everything off my phone in full quality to my NextCloud instance.

36:18.180 --> 36:20.880
And then from there, I can do with them whatever I want to.

36:20.880 --> 36:25.360
That's the one we hear the most often from the audience, too, is the NextCloud solution.

36:25.360 --> 36:29.600
We have gotten a recommendation a couple of times into the show about Photosync as well,

36:29.600 --> 36:32.520
which is in the Android Play Store, Photosync, one word.

36:32.520 --> 36:37.720
And the nice thing about Photosync is it supports various different kind of network backup

36:37.720 --> 36:41.180
options, even Samba, if you want to go that route.

36:41.180 --> 36:43.600
You could just back up your photos over Samba from Android.

36:43.600 --> 36:45.680
So I'll put a link to that in the show notes as well.

36:45.680 --> 36:50.520
Now you mentioned in your question about Plex photos, and this is a really bad time to be

36:50.520 --> 36:54.960
adopting Plex photos as a solution, unfortunately.

36:54.960 --> 37:00.640
Plex document on their support pages that as of June 2021, camera upload is going to

37:00.640 --> 37:01.640
be discontinued.

37:01.640 --> 37:02.640
Womp, womp.

37:02.640 --> 37:03.640
Yeah, boy.

37:03.640 --> 37:09.340
And I think a lot of us are just getting, we're just getting a little Plex skeptical.

37:09.340 --> 37:12.620
We're still Plex hopeful, but we're getting Plex skeptical.

37:12.620 --> 37:19.800
And I do have to admit personally that Plex skepticism I'm feeling right now would probably,

37:19.800 --> 37:23.440
would hesitate from using Plex photos myself for back, and I'm not using it because of

37:23.440 --> 37:24.440
that reason.

37:24.440 --> 37:28.060
Dare I say Plex are becoming the Google of the self-hosted world, just killing stuff

37:28.060 --> 37:33.160
randomly and not focusing on the core products like they should be.

37:33.160 --> 37:34.160
I don't know.

37:34.160 --> 37:35.360
I guess I feel it's kind of mean.

37:35.360 --> 37:40.940
They are such a smaller team that they do have to be a little more conservative about

37:40.940 --> 37:44.720
where they spend their time and money where Google's like this, you know, this just financial

37:44.720 --> 37:48.840
monster powerhouse supplied by an endless amount of ad money.

37:48.840 --> 37:51.960
So it's like, come on, you know, maybe you could keep this going.

37:51.960 --> 37:55.520
Maybe you could invest a little more in Stadia, you know, like right now they're killing Stadia.

37:55.520 --> 37:56.520
Drives me crazy.

37:56.520 --> 37:58.720
I know it's not a self-hosted thing, but dang it.

37:58.720 --> 38:02.120
Well, everybody knew that was going to happen even before it launched.

38:02.120 --> 38:03.120
I know.

38:03.120 --> 38:06.840
Like did you see like some big exec just left, like the top Stadia exec just left Google

38:06.840 --> 38:07.840
or something.

38:07.840 --> 38:08.840
Oh, really?

38:08.840 --> 38:09.840
Yeah.

38:09.840 --> 38:10.840
Not good.

38:10.840 --> 38:11.840
Not good.

38:11.840 --> 38:14.320
I was a big fan of it, even though I often have no internet when I'm out traveling.

38:14.320 --> 38:19.560
I just love the idea of being able to play Stadia on any machine I want, Alex, you know,

38:19.560 --> 38:21.880
games on a machine with just a really crappy video card.

38:21.880 --> 38:22.880
I don't care.

38:22.880 --> 38:24.200
Here's some neat ideas.

38:24.200 --> 38:27.720
Well, I'm actually thinking about building my own self-hosted gaming setup here in the

38:27.720 --> 38:31.320
studio just using Steam though, you know, just have it on the LAN and just stream it

38:31.320 --> 38:32.320
to the boxes that way.

38:32.320 --> 38:37.320
Use Steam, use Parsec, Moonlight, all these different streaming protocols, lots of different

38:37.320 --> 38:38.320
ways to skin that turkey.

38:38.320 --> 38:42.360
I want to say thanks to our members at selfhosted.show slash SRE.

38:42.360 --> 38:43.840
Become a site reliability expert.

38:43.840 --> 38:45.280
Keep the show on the air.

38:45.280 --> 38:50.700
And as a thank you, as a special thank you, as a golden thank you, a limited ad feed,

38:50.700 --> 38:52.700
just nice, tight production.

38:52.700 --> 38:54.360
It's a nice, tight, quicker show.

38:54.360 --> 38:55.360
Isn't that great?

38:55.360 --> 38:58.040
All the Drew Lovin, just less ads.

38:58.040 --> 39:03.440
And you also get extra content, a post show, you get a post show where I'm going to try

39:03.440 --> 39:05.920
to propose, Alex, try something new for the summer.

39:05.920 --> 39:06.920
We'll see how that goes.

39:06.920 --> 39:07.920
Oh, no.

39:07.920 --> 39:09.120
How much is this going to cost me?

39:09.120 --> 39:11.840
Oh, yes, it will cost you.

39:11.840 --> 39:13.000
Also thank you to a cloud guru.

39:13.000 --> 39:14.400
You can find them on social media.

39:14.400 --> 39:17.040
They're just slash a cloud guru everywhere.

39:17.040 --> 39:18.520
Pretty easy to find them.

39:18.520 --> 39:21.680

39:21.680 --> 39:24.800
