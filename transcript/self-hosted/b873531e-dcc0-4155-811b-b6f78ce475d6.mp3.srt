1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
well i've made it down to southern oregon to get lady jubes ready for a summer road trip and she

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:09,440
had a little bit of work she still needed done from the last road trip so i'm down here i might

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,360
sound a little different might sound a little off because i'm actually like just in a parking lot

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:18,880
i'm just i'm not like in a studio i'm not in some nice place with good signal and quiet sounds nope

5
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:24,160
i'm just in a parking lot while i get some work done but the show must go on alex and what could

6
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,800
go wrong with that particularly with the starlink situation you've got right now yeah my starling's

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,840
busted too the motor the dish works so i can rabbit ear it you know i can i i've done this

8
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,880
i've gone out there and tried to point it at the northern sky and try to figure out where the

9
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:42,160
satellites at and it'll work for a bit but finally after about like a week and change maybe a little

10
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,360
almost two weeks they finally got back to me they're going to send me a replacement that's

11
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:51,440
good good don't forget to buy an ethernet adapter if you're getting the square one now right i think

12
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,240
i probably will i'm going to go from the round dishy to the square dishy i went shopping today

13
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:01,120
while i was killing time while they were working on the rig i haven't gone to best buy since the

14
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,040
pandemic started i just haven't had a chance to go in so i was curious what are they doing

15
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,960
for their home automation gear now and they're they're really big of course on the amazon

16
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:19,200
ecosystem and the google ecosystem huge on arlo and a lot of the video lights that you can attach

17
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,920
to your house that have like motion detection they sell a whole bunch of those like i said i haven't

18
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:29,440
been in a long time and i'm sure a lot of people listening know this but i didn't really realize

19
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:34,480
or appreciate that they're doing e-ink displays for all the prices and stuff for most things

20
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,040
have you seen this you've probably seen this because you've probably gone in more recently

21
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,600
than i have it's pretty cool isn't it it works right some of them are a little hard to read

22
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:48,080
but i like it i think it's a nice touch it's cool and then the one device that really impressed me

23
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:54,080
out of all the stuff there that i saw i didn't pick it up but the pricing on the lenovo smart

24
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:59,200
clock stands that have google assistant built in it looks like an alarm clock but it has google

25
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:05,600
assistant 29.99 for this thing yeah that is nice open box 25 bucks and then they have one with a

26
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,880
screen that has the google cards on it and stuff like that for 89.99 i was at best buy just this

27
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:17,920
week buying a new hard drive but let's not let's not spoil the show oh yeah yeah yeah it was good

28
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,400
to go in there you know do a little shopping get a sense of where the pricing's at and honestly

29
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,280
doesn't seem like the the tech pricing's really changed much everything's going up in price except

30
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,400
for a lot of the tech stuff still seems like it was priced it was a year or two ago i feel like

31
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:38,400
walking into best buy is how like harry potter must feel walking out of diagon alley or something

32
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,560
like this is this is how normal people live this is like how muggles live i would have loved to

33
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,480
have seen the starlink kit at best buy i mean i knew it just wasn't going to happen but imagine

34
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,640
if i could have walked in there and bought a new dish tonight with a working motor imagine this

35
00:02:52,640 --> 00:03:00,640
imagine if starlink made a dish that was repairable oh whoa like maybe i could open it up

36
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:06,320
and replace the motor no and then i could just carry spare parts on board and then like install

37
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:12,000
them when it goes wrong that's just that's crazy alex it's so frustrating you know it's going to

38
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,720
be like a three dollar part that's broken yeah i'm actually a little concerned about how i'm

39
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,480
going to transport it in the future because as far as i know it was just transporting it going

40
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:26,080
down the road maybe the jar a jarring bump something broke the motor and uh so now i'm

41
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,560
thinking about when i do get a replacement dish like do i need to get like a case for this thing

42
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,880
like a pelican case like i don't know i'm curious what the audience might do if they have a starlink

43
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:40,320
and they're transporting it are there starlink cases for safe transport is that a thing we'll

44
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:44,880
build you a wooden crate between me and brent i think we can make that happen there you go that

45
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:50,160
looked pretty nice what we're live tonight somehow i don't know how the cellular signal is mostly

46
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:56,400
holding on i've dropped 6 000 packets so it's not perfect but it's holding good enough dude we've

47
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,720
got folks in the discord the self-hosted discord is going like always at selfhosted.show slash

48
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:08,800
discord hit a milestone recently we did we just passed 4500 members which is crazy that is so

49
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:13,680
great you got to admit it was a little awkward when we decided to go with discord since it is

50
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:19,200
not a self-hosted chat platform but you can't deny the networking aspect of it well i just

51
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:25,200
look at the uh palava that you and wes have been through on linux unplugged with your matrix server

52
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:30,800
and i just i feel completely vindicated in that decision yeah you might be right you might be

53
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:36,960
right the matrix server has been a real learning process i like to think of it as a long-term

54
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:43,440
investment right something like that something like that now speaking of long-term planning it's

55
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:49,440
not that far away but i'm going to be in the uk in august early august so i'm kind of floating

56
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,080
the idea of a uk meetup because several people messaged me when we were talking about the rally

57
00:04:54,080 --> 00:05:00,320
one saying that they were jealous the vague very vague plan at this point is uh the weekend of

58
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:06,640
august the sixth somewhere in london so that people can fly in from ireland and europe more

59
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:10,800
easily somewhere in london we'll have a meetup maybe a pub maybe a community center something

60
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,240
like that i don't know we're going to figure it out but if you're interested send me a message

61
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:23,200
on the discord or hit me up on twitter at ironic badger uh i want to go so bad i bet august is a

62
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:28,160
great time to be in london too it could be it could be a good time or it could be snowing and

63
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:36,000
raining sideways in august who knows i mean no maybe not snow but i mean honestly it could be 35

64
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,080
celsius or it could be 10 who knows do you want people to send you uh suggestions via emails maybe

65
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:47,200
the contact page contact page anything like that if you've got a venue in mind i was i was thinking

66
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:52,640
we did a few events for redhat consulting when i was in london at brewdog those pubs are quite

67
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:57,440
hip and trendy and modern they've got like a whole area upstairs that you can kind of rent out some

68
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,680
some of them so maybe something like that would be nice because they're sort of half open half

69
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,480
inside type thing so kind of hedge our bets on the weather that's probably a pretty good idea

70
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:11,840
let's be honest man i'm so jealous please take pictures i want to i want to see it maybe one

71
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:17,200
of these days we'll get you out there huh maybe uh fosdom i'd love to definitely on my list it

72
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:22,080
kind of got set back the last couple of years but it's definitely on my list this is one of those

73
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,960
episodes we have them i think about every other episode i'm gonna have a bunch of work after uh

74
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:32,560
this this episode i just i just know it i know it and it's gonna be it's gonna be because my wife's

75
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:38,720
gonna demand it you have come across something i i feel like either you talked to me about it before

76
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,600
off air or someone did it just doesn't seem right that we haven't talked about this on air yet well

77
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:49,280
a couple of weeks ago the tandoor project a self-hosted recipe manager released version

78
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:54,960
1.4 so they've been in in development for a year plus at this point so it's very possible you've

79
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,760
seen it on reddit at some point before yeah maybe but the 1.4 release has got some notable changes

80
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:06,080
in it there's a whole new shopping list feature built in which is pretty darn cool and so just

81
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,680
to be clear this is a recipe manager that you would run on your own system where they offer

82
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,080
a self-hosted version and if we if we haven't talked about on the show before we should have

83
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:19,120
well we've talked about chow down and i'm fairly sure we've talked about mealy before if we haven't

84
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:26,880
i use both of those equally i still love chow down because it's a simple markdown based system

85
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:33,600
there's no database there's no craziness it's just a stupid simple markdown plain text files

86
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:39,200
but having a database gives you some nice features like in tandoor for example

87
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,760
when you import a recipe you can then add it into a meal plan so you could have a

88
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:51,040
family-facing meal plan dashboard take it one step further the app knows which ingredients go

89
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:56,640
into those recipes so you can say excuse me tandoor could you please add that to my shopping list and

90
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:02,000
then pull that shopping list up when you're at the grocery store and just buy everything you need for

91
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,600
that specific thing now what i saw in reddit as a particularly interesting idea was some kind of

92
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:13,120
like self-hosted hellofresh someone suggested to the developer that he integrates with instant

93
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:21,120
carts api with those recipes to order three green peppers and some chicken and whatever else you

94
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:26,560
need for that that recipe so you end up with this like self-hosted hellofresh type thing which i

95
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:34,240
thought would be an amazing amazing thing no kidding brilliant idea this has another feature

96
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,240
that you're probably about to touch on but i just have to talk about because this is what won me

97
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:45,040
over and it is one of the newer features they just recently implemented and it's this really slick

98
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:51,760
import feature where you can give it the url of a website that has a recipe i threw one of those

99
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,840
one of those like essentially a blog post where they tell you their whole life story just to give

100
00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:01,760
you a recipe and they have pictures and oh i hate those so much i found like the worst one man where

101
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:09,600
it has like slide over javascript and just all kinds of junk and i i i gave the url to tender

102
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:15,920
and it actually processed the page it pulled out all the individual steps all of the individual

103
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:21,600
ingredients and it itemized it all just perfectly i threw some simpler ones out it did great too but

104
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,720
i was really impressed that it got that that really complicated one and so it's like you just

105
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:32,240
take this really really long three-page post and condense it down into just a good block

106
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,800
information you need and then you add it to your database and now you got that recipe it's amazing

107
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:42,960
it will import the images from the website it will also pick out keywords yes yes yes it will

108
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:48,720
figure out the steps you need the ingredients uh everything so the the import stuff is really slick

109
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,280
and you can do one recipe at a time or you can just give it a list of urls with a line

110
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:59,920
a new line per link and it just it just works i mean that's the best kind of works right i had

111
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:06,880
the wife use it because she was just yesterday talking to me about how you know my grammy used

112
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:11,840
index cards and when i when i first started cooking i created a binder she said and i had all

113
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:17,360
my recipes in this binder that i'd printed out but that's gone now and she wanted to start collecting

114
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:23,920
her recipes again and so i had her sit down and input a few of them into this and i'd say within

115
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:29,520
15 minutes she probably had four recipes added and she was testing the shopping cart feature

116
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:33,760
to see how that works and then she was visualizing okay well how would this work if i'm

117
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:39,440
if i'm at if i'm at the grocery store and i have my phone with me how would the ui look so she like

118
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,440
resizes the browser to see if it works okay on mobile it totally did it looks like it's going to

119
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,080
render just fine and so she had herself a list that she could just go down the aisle and check off

120
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:52,320
as she buys and she experimented with seeing what happens if multiple recipes call for the

121
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,440
same ingredient and if it gets the right amounts correct in the shopping cart and it does it just

122
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,080
does a really good job with all that and it supports markdown for your cooking notes that is

123
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:06,560
cool yes i was going to touch on the comment feature at the bottom there's also another option

124
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:13,440
to log a specific cook so i'm thinking for my barbecue grilling like if i put the brisket recipe

125
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,560
that i use in there i can link things like the youtube video but then i can also give myself a

126
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:23,920
rating out of five and a specific date and time that's in there and then tie that into a specific

127
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:29,280
comment on a specific day to say i let's try say i tried a new technique that day with uh with

128
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:32,720
grilling it's a serious business don't you know you got to make sure you get it right and if you

129
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:39,040
got if you nailed it you got to note down what you did or if you mess it up exactly exactly now the

130
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:43,920
the other thing that i really really like is it has a servings option at the top of the page with

131
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,800
like a plus and a minus and in the ingredients thing here let's say you've got two pounds of

132
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:54,400
chicken in your recipe and it's four servings i can just hit the plus button and double that to

133
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:59,600
i don't know seven let's go with seven servings now i mean the mental maths isn't too difficult

134
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:06,000
on that one but how many times have you had to do some weird fractional maths on a cup of flour or

135
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,280
something weird like that and and the servings thing in here it works flawlessly yeah and it's

136
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:15,520
again that's also nice when you're using it to generate the shopping list so you know how much

137
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:20,720
you need of something in there the other thing that i didn't get a lot of time to use but i think

138
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:26,960
was really interesting to my wife was it has a meal planner in there and uh you get a calendar

139
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:30,880
and you can plan out your meals of course you can use you can select the recipes that you've

140
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:36,480
already input to the system then if you would like it will actually export you out a calendar

141
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:41,040
file an ics file or whatever they are and you can import that meal plan into your calendar

142
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,560
app of choice so you have it somewhere outside tandoor as well which i thought that was a really

143
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:50,960
nice touch now for hadia's thing there is a whole cookbooks feature so you could kind of group

144
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:57,200
recipes you know like grandma mom wife whatever you know for me i could have a barbecue cookbook

145
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,280
for example that would be pretty cool there's so many features in this thing i feel like we could

146
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:06,880
spend an hour on it almost but if you're interested it's obviously free and open source software over

147
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:13,360
on github there'll be a link in the show notes it's at tandoor recipes recipes in github yeah

148
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,040
definitely worth checking out i mean when's the last time we get this excited about a recipe app

149
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,840
i mean maybe we just like recipe apps but this is a whole management suite but what was the process

150
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:26,320
like of getting it installed because i tried their online demo since i'm on the road i didn't want to

151
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,920
get go through all the process of loading it up but i think i'm going to have to do that when

152
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:35,600
i get home so give me an idea of what i'm looking at it's not too bad three containers there's a

153
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:42,720
database so postgres there's the app itself which is a jango based application and then there's an

154
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,760
nginx front end i mean you can switch out the nginx front end web server if you like with

155
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:55,280
your web server of choice personally i would prefer if the developer shipped the tandoor

156
00:13:55,280 --> 00:14:01,600
application with a simple web server built in the g unicorn stuff that's built into the app that

157
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:07,040
ships is not really fit for purpose in terms of public hosting and he mentions that in the

158
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,920
documentation he's very clear about that and that's why he suggests people spin up nginx

159
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:17,600
but i'm a fairly experienced docker administrator at this point a container guy and i got a couple

160
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,520
of my file paths wrong so some of it's on me admittedly but it took me about an hour to get

161
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:26,000
this going simply because i had to link three containers together and make sure everything was

162
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,760
just so and there's an environment variables file and all that kind of stuff it's not too difficult

163
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:37,600
honestly if you don't copy paste the wrong paths but it could be easier if it was just an all

164
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:43,280
self-contained app like for example plexus i understand there's a bit of a debate there

165
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:48,160
some people have the philosophy you just do the core application and then you do one instance of

166
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:53,920
nginx and one instance of your database and maybe whatever else you might have and don't run multiple

167
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,400
copies of that software in a container and i definitely think that's probably an appropriate

168
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:02,400
setup for production you know anything that's in a business or enterprise or anything that's going

169
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:07,920
to scale beyond a dozen users probably worth considering but for this sort of scenario the

170
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,680
one that you're talking about now where you're going to run it on your home server it's going

171
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:18,240
to be you and your wife and maybe me and maybe brent they're going to use it total right and so

172
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,320
there it does make a lot of sense to just have something that is maybe just a single docker

173
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:27,520
container you pop it on your machine and you go particularly it's not a super heavy application

174
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:35,280
right it's a small dango app and an nginx web server like that's that's very tiny also i mean

175
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:39,520
i know this is easy for me to say but wouldn't be impossible to have two types of containers one

176
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:43,520
that's just the application core and one that includes maybe the full suite of everything you

177
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:50,320
need yeah so mr developer man vabine 1111 if you're listening that's pretty much the only

178
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:55,200
feedback i have for you really the application's great the stuff you've done over the last year plus

179
00:15:55,200 --> 00:16:01,680
improving this application is to be commended truly but the setup process i know i saw in reddit

180
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:06,960
that you don't understand why people find it difficult i hope just what we've articulated

181
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:12,000
there helps a little bit of me on that particular bone it's it's just linking different things

182
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,320
together in people's different setups you know some people are running unraid some people are

183
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:22,480
running true nas i'm running docker compose through an ansible templating thing that i created so you

184
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,400
know there's lots of different strokes for different folks and anything you can do to reduce

185
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:30,960
that deployment complexity is going to increase your adoption it's as simple as that definitely

186
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:34,720
well said and i'm looking forward to getting this running this is going to be something you know the

187
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,760
wife and i are really going to going to enjoy but i don't think i'll be setting it up on my proxmox

188
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:44,720
system not yet but i am planning to build one soon and it sounds like we've got a brand new release

189
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:50,720
that looks great we do 7.2 now the headline feature for me besides you know fun stuff like

190
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:56,640
the linux kernel getting a bump and qemu and lxc and zfs and all those things getting bumps to the

191
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:04,480
latest versions is support for the accelerated vert io gl display driver i know it sounds

192
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:10,560
thrilling right but hear me out the this particular display driver is in software and i went from

193
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:16,400
about 13 frames per second we all know what that feels like that's what the traditional vm in a

194
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:23,600
browser has felt like for a decade i went from about 10 or 15 frames a second to over a hundred

195
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:31,040
hey whoa really just changing that feature and there was no drivers required on the guest i had

196
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:36,160
to install a couple of packages on proxmox itself but it tells you what they are in the documentation

197
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,880
and it was that was it i was done and suddenly i've got 10 times performance improvement how

198
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:47,120
often does that happen that's huge i can tell you i've experienced that on parallels on the m1 max

199
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:53,280
when they added support for the m1 platform they added vert io and vert iogl for the graphics

200
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:59,600
pass-through and it makes the desktop on linux responsive like it's on the metal it's really

201
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:04,800
really great and so how are you accessing this it through proxmox is it is it through the web

202
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:10,080
console through the web browser yeah nothing crazy at all so there's a spice client that connects

203
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:15,920
to the vm's console in the browser there's no hardware pass-through going on here i want to be

204
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:20,320
absolutely clear this is all in software you know traditionally we did a whole episode of linux

205
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:26,400
unplugged a long time ago now on gpu pass-through and how much of a bitch it can be to get the right

206
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:31,520
hardware and get the right software and everything all lined up just tickety-boo it's a lot easier

207
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:37,840
these days now nvidia have kind of capitulated there but i digress this is all software and

208
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:43,440
you know i can't overstate like just a 10x performance improvement right in front of my eyes

209
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:50,000
and so now i've gone from needing a spare laptop to test linux desktop distros to get the feel

210
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,960
right to get that high frame rate feel of what a new gnome release feels like what a new kde plasma

211
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:02,480
release feels like i can do this now in the browser from proxmox and it's so great that's

212
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:09,280
awesome i'm oh i've decided proxmox is going on the studio servers we put a pull out to the

213
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:15,360
audience again and said what do you think of a proxmox with nick's combo probably some open

214
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:20,720
suits in there too just to make the lizards happy and uh we're gonna have three systems and at least

215
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,880
two of them are gonna be running proxmox gonna start with 7.2 out of the gate so we're gonna

216
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:31,120
get this feature out of the gate proxmox is a great choice there's uh it's a debian user space

217
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:36,960
with a modified ubuntu kernel which means that you get zfs support as well no dkms

218
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:43,360
nonsense to mess around with it's just there and you get a nice little gooey on top to manage your

219
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:49,200
vms i mean there's some other stuff too like they've got a pretty slick backup server and

220
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,600
you know the community around proxmox is really starting to gather steam i've really noticed in

221
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:59,360
the last i would say two to three years it's gone from being a kind of niche project it's

222
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:04,640
it's really up and coming right now you know they've been consistent they've delivered over

223
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:09,200
and over and over again with it and i think that makes a difference i've i've just seen their

224
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:14,080
reputation get stronger and stronger you know if they're ever looking to sponsor hit us up

225
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:19,120
we basically just gave them a pretty good plug right there for free huh i know they're good for

226
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,400
a while aren't they one other thing i want to point out that i thought was pretty cool and this

227
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:28,080
is a very minor annoyance but if you're a proxmox user you will appreciate it you can now send

228
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:33,920
it you can now set your default vm id range so when you go and click the button that says create

229
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:40,240
vm it normally assigns a three-digit number like 100 102 whatever and it'll just do it sequentially

230
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:46,560
based on the next number that's available a bit like a dhcp reservation now i can select start

231
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:53,840
that range and end that range of the auto kind of like vm id dhcp requests for one of a better idea

232
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:59,440
i can select a range to put those numbers in and i can have my kind of normal vms sit at the top

233
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,120
where i see them all the time and then my more ephemeral stuff sits at the bottom out of the way

234
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:11,280
where i use it for testing linode.com slash ssh go there to get 100 and 60 day credit on a new account

235
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:16,000
and you go there to support this here show that's right it's made possible by you taking advantage

236
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:22,320
of our sponsor and of course linode is one that we enthusiastically endorse they started in 2003

237
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:27,520
and they have been building the best service to run applications on linux since and you can also

238
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:32,560
use as part of a multi-cloud strategy like i do this i have some servers on my lan and i have the

239
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:37,680
bulk of all of our audience facing systems on linode and we also have some of our work systems

240
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:41,440
on there too so i kind of pick and choose based on the workload and what i love about it is they've

241
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:47,200
got pricing that makes that really accessible so some systems they start at just five dollars a

242
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:52,800
month other systems they have a lot more options like amd epic processors we have one box that has

243
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:59,520
96 gigs of ram right i mean you can really max this stuff out 48 cpu cores in that box mvme hard

244
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,840
drives they're great and then of course they have 11 data centers for you to choose from so you're

245
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:08,000
going to find something close to you or your customers don't know how you're doing it they've

246
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,240
also got a great dashboard they got the best support in the business we hear that all the time

247
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,680
the other thing that we hear from the audience all the time is that they'll deploy themselves

248
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:21,200
a server for just like their family for like a gaming server or next cloud or photos or whatever

249
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,520
it might be uh recently and i never really thought about doing this but recently i heard from an

250
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:30,560
audience member he runs piehole up on linode and then he points all the systems to that even his

251
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:35,280
laptop and stuff and his family member's laptop so when they're traveling they're always using his dns

252
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:39,600
system and they're getting the filtering up on linode that's great and when you get a hundred

253
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:44,320
dollars you can play around with stuff like that see what sticks see if the value is really there

254
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:51,440
and it's a great way to support the show and learn something so go to linode.com slash ssh you go

255
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,360
there you get that hundred dollars you go deploy something you go learn something you support the

256
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:04,000
show it's a win-win linode.com slash ssh now after my buddy brent went home the other day

257
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:11,280
i was sat in my basement by myself billy no mates we did a shot of my server just doing some

258
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,360
tinkering around because we did some electrics down there and i wanted to automate uh something

259
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:20,080
that we put in with one of the shellys in a light switch and i was sat next to my server

260
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:29,840
and i could just hear oh no i was like oh no dead disk turns out it wasn't the cable people

261
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:36,000
oh right last time you thought it was the cable oh no it really was going it really was the drive

262
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:42,080
so quick trip to best buy the next morning bought a new 14 terabyte easy store ripped that bad boy

263
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:48,960
out of the case and it's now in my backup server doing my whole like pre clear ritual testing

264
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:55,200
burning thing no data loss no luckily i was able to just copy all the data from the failing drive

265
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:01,920
onto the rest of my merger fs array i actually had more than 10 terabytes free so i was lucky

266
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:06,160
there really i could do that i just removed it from the array and copied everything across with

267
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:12,640
rsync what do you think it would take for a new file system to work its way into your life for you

268
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:17,840
to find a new love for a file system um just say hypothetically like bcash fs comes out

269
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:23,680
it's so great it's xfs meets butter fs meets cfs and it's just next level performance too

270
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,000
what would it take for you to switch would it be would it be a matter of years would it be

271
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,960
something you'd start experimenting with sooner than later i don't know as i have a need for

272
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:39,600
anything new my needs through merger fs have been met so comprehensively back in the day that if you

273
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:44,000
look at the perfect media server kind of blog post series you can kind of see my transition

274
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:54,080
over the years from i think it was a ufs to mhd dfs to md raid through zfs even for actual media

275
00:24:54,080 --> 00:25:01,360
files and then i ended up with just ext4 and xfs on the drives themselves uh kind of bridged with

276
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:07,200
merger fs on top it's just been so reliable for what six or seven years when i don't even know

277
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:12,800
when i wrote that first post it was a long time ago i don't know like i felt the need to add zfs

278
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:19,120
into the setup for data i truly care about mostly for replication ease and stuff like that but i've

279
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:25,280
kind of solved that now with uh restic as well so i've got a couple of ways i back stuff up for the

280
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:31,520
important data but for media files that are right once read a couple of times probably merger fs

281
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:36,800
does everything i need what are you uh what are you hinting at there chris well so the word on

282
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:40,880
the street although we'll see if this really pans out but the word on the street is that we're going

283
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:46,160
to see bcash fs hit the linux kernel in about the next six months or so maybe a little bit longer

284
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:52,720
but it's nigh and the developer kent overstreet recently said that his goal is to essentially

285
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:59,200
make a file system that does just that it kind of replaces or it offers uh the advantages of xfs

286
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:05,600
which xfs is a very solid very tried and true file system and with some of the benefits of butterfs

287
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:11,120
like copy on write snapshots stuff like that that's pretty cool he was asked recently who's

288
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:16,720
using bcash fs is anybody using it in production and he said well i do know that a lot of video

289
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:23,280
shops that are dealing with multiple 4k streams are using bcash fs and it made me think like i

290
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:29,360
think every time i've switched a major file system it's been to solve a performance problem or a

291
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:36,240
scalability problem like i i really finally gave in and tried butterfs for real when i needed to

292
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:41,840
solve storage issues on a raspberry pi and i just wasn't going to use the fs i had no choice so i

293
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:46,640
had to learn butterfs and then i learned that i actually liked it quite a bit but i only did it

294
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:52,240
when i was trying to solve like a new problem and i just wonder you know like bcash fs is going to

295
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:58,400
come along one day it's going to be great no doubt about it but i i i'm kind of of the uh

296
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:04,400
school of thought that when it comes to my data i like to give that stuff years you know years of

297
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,320
cooking years of people other people using it in production that's just one area where i'll

298
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:12,320
i'll kind of tap the brakes a little bit and that's why it took me a while to come around

299
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:17,040
about our fest to be honest that's really what i love about the zfs i know it has a bit of a

300
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:24,000
learning curve and a bit of an aura around it but are you laughing an aura i think a bit of an aura

301
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,120
is a funny way to put it yeah it does i mean just listen to you and alan back in the day on text

302
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:33,680
snap like you made it sound like this massive complex beast and actually it's not it's just

303
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:40,080
two drives in a mirror right i mean it's that's it that's what i use anyway yeah it does it can

304
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:46,400
be very complex but yeah um that's not so bad really so i'm glad that you got it found i'm

305
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:50,480
sorry there was actually the drive and not the cable though that does stink well so this presents

306
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:55,840
an interesting opportunity for content actually so this will be the first shut drive i've had fail

307
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:00,960
on me i don't have the plastic casing anymore i chucked that out as a matter of principle

308
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:05,760
so i'm really interested to see what happens when i send this 12 terabyte drive which is only about

309
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:10,800
15 months old back to western digital it came with a two-year warranty and there's apparently

310
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:15,600
something called the magnuson moss act i think that's what it is if they try and play funny

311
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:20,000
buggers with it i can quote them and say that and apparently then they'll just capitulate and send

312
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,600
me their replacement reconditioned drive because they can't prove that my shucking it broke it or

313
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:31,600
something let's talk a little ansible one of our favorite topics here and i think maybe one we

314
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:36,640
should should probably share a little more on the show as brent begins his journey down the ansible

315
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:42,560
lane but in the meantime before we go down ansible lane maybe we should stop off uh on uh bit warden

316
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:47,440
drive what do you got here what about if i put some peanut butter with the chocolate yeah that

317
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:52,720
sounds perfect for me and bring ansible together with bit warden how about that right that sounds

318
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:59,920
good actually there was a chat happening on discord i think it was this morning where orange uh jake

319
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:05,840
who was on the show a little while ago was talking about how he uses ansible vault crossed with bit

320
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:12,800
warden there is a reference to one of my favorite bash.org moments where the part his demo password

321
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:19,600
is hunter 2 those that know know about that one and but essentially what this allows me to do

322
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:27,520
is use bit warden as my credential store for my ansible vault encryption password so all of my

323
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:34,160
secrets remain encrypted using ansible vault with 256 bit blah blah blah as a file that i store

324
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:39,280
version controlled in git what i'm doing now is rather than having a clear text file sitting on

325
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:47,200
disk to decrypt that file i am now using the bit warden cli to connect the vault password that i've

326
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:54,480
now put in bit warden to unlock that uh encrypted file in ansible this feels like it could be pretty

327
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:59,840
powerful i think i'm understanding but um so essentially as ansible is setting up a machine

328
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:05,680
if it needs to deploy software that needs some sort of secret password or key instead of having

329
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:11,680
to put that somewhere in the ansible config or whatever there's now an option to have as ansible

330
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:17,840
is deploying use the bit warden cli to look that password up and sort of insert that password as

331
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:23,040
it's being deployed is that right you could do that using the lookup plugin i think but the way

332
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:28,240
that we're doing it right now at least is using a so you can actually this is a really neat trick

333
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:36,320
that i didn't know until this morning you can put in your ansible config the vault file location as

334
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:43,520
a script and in that script you can actually have it do the bit warden cli export lookup thing of

335
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:50,000
the password and then it returns it as a string which then feeds into the the rest of the process

336
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:55,200
so all i'm doing i haven't moved any of the secrets themselves out of ansible out of the

337
00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:01,520
vault in ansible but i've moved the vault password from a local text file on my laptop

338
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:08,720
into bit warden and now i've connected the two together using oranges post very nice we'll have

339
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,720
links to this so you can follow along we'll have links to this in the show notes of course at

340
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:17,520
self-hosted dot show slash 71 i thought it'd be really difficult but it turned out to be about

341
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:22,720
a five or ten line change there'll be a commit in the show notes if you're curious as just to

342
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:31,680
how easy it is easier than getting the recipe app going much easier uh we love you tandoor we love

343
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:35,760
you we've been having a lot of fun on the discord over the last couple of weeks with ansible and

344
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:40,720
infrastructures code talk as you can probably tell from how much of it's in the show one of

345
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:47,360
the things i decided to do when brent was here he just flippantly asked me can you do dns from your

346
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:53,040
docker compose generator and i was like sure knowing full well i couldn't but how hard could

347
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:59,520
it be right turned out to be quite the operation it took me about two or three days with the help

348
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:06,080
of about four or five people on discord to write possibly one of the most i dare i say over

349
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:12,640
engineered ansible tasks ever this thing essentially takes a traffic label strips out

350
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:20,000
strips out with regex a bunch of stuff surrounding the bit of data i want which is you know the host

351
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:26,080
name of like test.jupyterbroadcasting.com that's the bit i actually want but i had to find a way

352
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:32,240
to iterate over all the labels in the nested list that i have in ansible and then extract them and

353
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:40,000
do what i need to do and then only act on them when the item in the list was set to active equals

354
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:47,120
true there's a lot of logic in there anyway the upshot is we can now specify for all of the

355
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:55,680
self-hosted jb infrastructure simply by adding a container with a traffic label into our compose

356
00:32:55,680 --> 00:33:04,800
definition file we add the dns record automatically into cloudflare hmm that is pretty damn slick so

357
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:10,000
just by having the label for traffic yeah it figures out from there what the what the host

358
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,600
name should be and all of that absolutely yeah that's it and what's particularly fun is you know

359
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:20,560
let's say i wanted to spin up an nginx just to test for example i just copy and paste that in there

360
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:25,360
and if i put test. as long as the domain's in my cloudflare account or i have permissions like

361
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:31,440
you've given me yeah delegated permissions on jb.com i can add something into that git repo

362
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:36,560
and we could then theoretically have a continuous integration github action that would pick up that

363
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:42,480
change and deploy that new container and also the dns records in cloudflare automatically for us

364
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:48,960
that's what i'm talking about alex that is awesome it's really cool that is awesome and

365
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:55,600
that is such a great example of we recently were talking about nix and nix packages and managing

366
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:01,600
nix os and all of that being a deterministic system and how it compared to ansible and this

367
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:05,200
is such a great example where you can go much further with ansible you can go much beyond just

368
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:11,200
just what you can do with nix very exciting and it makes me pumped to kind of redo some of this

369
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:17,440
infrastructure stuff and do it like this from the beginning because like down the road it's

370
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:22,640
just going to make future deployments so much simpler right that's that's really when you spin

371
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:28,400
up a new show or decide you're going to have a garage sale or whatever it is it's all automatic

372
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:35,600
that's so great yeah and done once and now it's done one of my favorite tricks in this particular

373
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:42,480
task and there are a couple one is to use json query to create a dictionary that i can then

374
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:49,680
split and join and what have you within the task itself the other one is to use what's called a

375
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:56,800
ternary operator now ginger which is the templating language that ansible has is is pretty amazing and

376
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:02,720
you can do a lot of cool stuff but i was running into an issue where my item dot active contents

377
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:09,440
was either true or false and the ansible module was expecting the phrase present or absent now

378
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:15,120
you as a human can work out that true equals present and the absent equals false computer

379
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:21,120
is stupid you have to tell computer this thing turns out with the ternary operator we can actually do

380
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:27,280
that so if we pass in a true or false statement into the ternary operator and then specify just

381
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:32,960
a couple of other values present and absent in this case we can have true or false actually be

382
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:41,760
any other string that we require very simple very cool tailscale.com slash self hosted go there to

383
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:48,160
get a free personal account for up to 20 devices and you support the show tailscale is a zero config

384
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:53,200
vpn you get it on any device in minutes it'll manage your firewall rules it'll help with

385
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:59,920
double carrier grade crazy nat all of that i'm using tailscale right now in fact alex and i

386
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:04,320
were using tailscale earlier today as well in a way that i haven't really used it before tell

387
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,840
me about the fanciness that we were doing share share it with the people actually well i span up

388
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:12,640
tandoor on my lan and i thought it'd be pretty cool if i could just share this demo instance

389
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:17,200
with chris because you're having some issues with their public demo so i went into my tailscale

390
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:23,760
dashboard and i click sharing settings got a link to share one of my specific hosts my docker host

391
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:29,200
with you you accept a couple of things in your tailscale dashboard on your end straight away

392
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:34,880
you've got access just to that specific host but you could also use it as an exit node as well so

393
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:41,760
let's say you have a friend geographically in a useful place for you you could ask that friend

394
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:47,360
to share just that vm or whatever it is and you won't have access to the rest of that person's lan

395
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:53,520
only to that specific host and only as an exit node if they permit it yep it is a superpower

396
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:59,440
and it's something that just makes collaborating with people so great and the way tailscale works

397
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:05,360
is it uses wire guard's noise protocol to create a flat mesh network between all of your machines

398
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:10,320
and if you've got two machines on the same lan and you're talking to their tailscale ips

399
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:14,000
it figures that out and it actually will just go over your lan it doesn't like need to go through

400
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,440
some central proxy or anything like that they have a authorization backplane that they use to

401
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:23,040
proxy the connection to set everybody up to get them established but then you're talking directly

402
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:28,320
to each other after that they also work with your single sign-on provider which means they also

403
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:32,320
support two-factor if you've got that going you got to go try tailscale because once you have it

404
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:39,280
set up in a couple of minutes you've got an always on vpn protected by wire card it's so slick and

405
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:44,800
i've got it running now on my family's machines as well as my raspberry pi's my servers my vms

406
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:50,960
it brings it all together and you can try it for yourself for free for up to 20 machines at tailscale

407
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:55,440
dot com slash self-hosted that's where you got to go to support the show and try it out for 20

408
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:03,840
machines for totally free at tailscale dot com slash self-hosted scott writes in looking for

409
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:09,760
chip shortage alternatives with this continuing on through the foreseeable future and raspberry

410
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:15,440
pi's becoming the new unobtainium i would like to hear some ideas from you both as to what to look

411
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:20,960
for in alternatives i'd also love to hear from other insiders what they're using through feedback

412
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:25,760
of their own specifically this is a problem for me since i like having dedicated systems for

413
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:33,360
certain tasks for example a pie hole is a dedicated appliance for me and i want my dns to be reliable

414
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:37,120
i just want stuff to work with minimal administration i've got loads of other

415
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:42,320
hobbies and i don't want to spend all my free time being my own it admin as they're always

416
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:48,560
overworked underpaid and usually grumpy after business hours can relate scott can relate

417
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:52,640
he may be right about that got to admit you know scott the first thing that came to mind for me

418
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:59,440
and this is something that i've already done once is low power cheap used laptops on ebay

419
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:06,000
often they have more horsepower than a raspberry pi some of them even have features like quicksync

420
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,320
so they make it great for plex the only real challenges that i've run into and why i haven't

421
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:17,280
really talked about it a lot on air is because i'm almost always hitting some kind of ios limited

422
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:22,880
some kind of ios limitation that just drives me crazy maybe it's usb or ethernet or something

423
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:28,080
like that but depending on what your needs are like if you get if you could find a laptop

424
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:32,160
like some of these thinkpads that support two discs and maybe you're okay with just that amount

425
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:36,800
of storage you can actually make a laptop work pretty well in place of a raspberry pi what do

426
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:41,120
you think alex you got any ideas well something like an old thinkpad you can have pretty cheap

427
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:49,600
like i've just had a quick look now t450 which is fifth gen intel 100 140 depending on the spec and

428
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:53,760
how much ram and disk and have what have you that's in there but we've also been talking

429
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:59,920
about this on the discord a fair bit recently with the uh like tiny mini micro stuff that kind

430
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:04,720
of stuff like um serve the home i've been doing a whole series on this stuff now they typically

431
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:10,320
buy the higher end stuff the newer stuff or they get sent it anyway we've been talking about the

432
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:14,880
kind of the lower end of that market there are some old thin client boxes that have been knocking

433
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:23,440
around for a long time i i think it's is it wise spelt w y s e these guys uh they do thin clients

434
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:28,960
for enterprise so they they've got boxes knocking around by the thousand and you can get them super

435
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:34,880
cheap on ebay and often they've got ethernet built in and usb depending on the model you go

436
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:39,040
for you might be lucky to get one with some sata space in there you know maybe you could have a

437
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:45,360
sata ssd in there or an m.2 if you get really lucky uh so that's the i'd probably go yeah we

438
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:50,240
looked at a couple of those recently and um those could be really awesome too for low power i think

439
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:54,960
like the biggest bottleneck there was memory on those units like they're usually pretty but

440
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:58,800
depending again what you're doing that might not be that might not be an issue just kind of depends

441
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:04,720
on your workload these wise boxes are about the size of two or three cd cases maybe so they're

442
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:12,400
very very small and they're very very cheap they can be had for as low as 15 20 something like that

443
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:17,280
some of them don't include memory at that kind of price but some of them do and they're x86 they're

444
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:23,440
atoms right i mean they're you could just run anything some are atom some are amd all right

445
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:27,760
well oliver writes in he says hi guys thanks for the show i've been listening from the beginning

446
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:32,960
and i've learned a lot i've been struggling to find a great self-hosted podcast solution for a

447
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:38,400
while now audiobook shelf has recently blown up and it's been really actively developed and the

448
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:44,560
podcast feature is probably the most excited i've been for a self-host application for a long time

449
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:48,240
but there's still some work to be done it's amazing what's been accomplished already though

450
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:53,760
it's now my primary podcast listening app i wonder alex have you played it all with podcast and

451
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:58,640
audiobook shelf i've still got it spun up from the episode we talked about it a couple of weeks ago

452
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:05,200
did you try a podcast in there i haven't done any podcasts but we could do a live we could

453
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:12,400
do a live test right now if you like oh all right let's oh that's exciting i know this is a common

454
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:18,160
question that comes into the show is hey how can i can i self-host my own podcast and i never really

455
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:24,080
feel like we have a super great answer because i think a great aspect of podcasts in my opinion

456
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:29,760
is that now i know not everybody does it this way but for me is that the mp3 file is actually locally

457
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:36,240
on the storage device of my phone and so i can listen to a podcast without using data or when i

458
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:41,840
don't have signal or when i just don't want to use much battery life either and so i really like

459
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:48,240
having podcasts locally on my phone so that's why i've ended up trying to use podcast apps at sync

460
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:54,560
but i yeah i don't love any of it i found it so i have to create a new library so i've just added

461
00:42:54,560 --> 00:43:00,960
a new folder to my um audiobook shelf container so i'm going to have a dedicated podcasts folder

462
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:07,280
okay that container is now spun up so i'm going to just load up audiobook shelf add a new library

463
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:14,400
select podcasts from the list i've got to give it the correct icon that's very important now

464
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:21,040
interestingly enough the metadata provider is itunes so even though it's a self-hosted podcast

465
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:29,520
um server for want of a better word still using uh internet-based metadata that's a real shame

466
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:33,760
you know they could be using the podcast index and they could also use pod ping and they wouldn't

467
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:39,200
even need to use the index that's a bit of a shame oh i see so i can have a oh i can put an rss feed

468
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:47,120
in there all right so where's the self-hosted rss feed self-hosted.show rss rss yep it's real simple

469
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:51,840
all right let's put that in there let's see what happens when i click submit oh that's pretty cool

470
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:57,040
it's found the album art it's got the genres correct it's got the description auto download

471
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:04,880
episodes check add podcast all right hmm let's see what happens all right all right that doesn't

472
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:10,400
seem too bad i gotta be honest okay this is pretty great yeah this is the this is the way you know

473
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:15,360
you're just saying you don't have a great way this is it i think anyway okay all right all right

474
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:20,160
maybe we got to give this more serious go then because this would be nice to just have a solution

475
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:25,440
for people because they're writing all the time okay thanks oliver i'm gonna gonna try that out

476
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:31,760
i think that'll be pretty great we got some boost into the show first one came from x thumb sx who

477
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:38,320
sent us a boost using a new podcast app 5000 sats he mentions that there are silicon wedding bands

478
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:42,640
that solve the issue of like uh i think we were talking about getting them in the cases or getting

479
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:47,360
them uh you know problems with working with electricity he says this is also great when

480
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:52,000
installing smart devices they don't dig into your finger when gripping tools or sports equipment

481
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:59,680
that's pretty awesome i didn't realize they made silicone wedding rings i'm such an idiot

482
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:04,480
i never even checked you know it's not something that occurred to me i just took mine off and

483
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:12,000
didn't think about it yeah cosp land sent us a boost for 3690 sats he always comes he always

484
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:17,600
sends us in like numbers that i think mean something and he says yes the numbers are tesla

485
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:24,560
numbers and he also wants to know if we have any sue servers do you have any sue servers i do not

486
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:31,360
hmm all right i didn't think so not surprising really uh i have uh one in production and i have

487
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:39,760
one on a on a raspberry pi cm4 so not a lot but i have some for 500 sats gin for matique writes in

488
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:45,280
hi chris i just stumbled upon a french blog discussing about podcasting 2.0 the article

489
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:50,880
is translated to english and here's what they did as podcast lovers for over two decades we have

490
00:45:50,880 --> 00:46:02,640
founded ad auras a u r e s a ruse a ruse yeah my french pronunciation is uh poo poo shall we say

491
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:06,960
anyway they're aiming to build a fair and sustainable ecosystem for everyone in the

492
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:13,120
podcasting industry they've developed castopod a free and open source solution

493
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:19,280
for hosting your podcasts in order to facilitate access to podcasting 2.0 for everybody yeah

494
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:24,880
castapods actually pretty neat there's a there's another one out there too that's being created

495
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:30,480
and they're supporting all of the podcasting 2.0 spec out of the gate which means things like the

496
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:37,920
alternative enclosure tag transcripts uh clips and um things like that and the idea is is that

497
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:41,600
you could just kind of use their out of the box solution i mean if you're looking to start a

498
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:49,040
podcast right now and you want something that's kind of like an all-in-one back end package like

499
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:57,280
a hosted fireside that's what castapod is and i've looked at it because it is enticing it'll

500
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:01,680
support clips it'll generate video clips and it supports the podcasting 2.0 namespace stuff for

501
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:06,720
that it does the value for value stuff so you can do boosts and it supports the transcript stuff

502
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:12,240
there's a lot in that spec and they're one of the like premiere places that are supporting it so

503
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:16,400
that's pretty cool i haven't tried it myself because we're already you know we already have

504
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:21,200
a whole system built out but if i were starting today and i didn't have anything i'd be pretty

505
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:29,120
tempted to try castapod i have to say toxic safety 89 wrote in two days ago with 3333 sats i feel

506
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:33,920
like that's a lucky number all threes that's got to be a lucky number thing i swear to god

507
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:39,600
my alexa and siri are getting worse and worse at understanding me i love the home pods like you

508
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:45,040
chris but it's a 50 50 hit rate these days do you guys have these problems is there anything better

509
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:51,680
out there well i can't tell you the number of times i have to put on a very bad american accent

510
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:56,480
in order to make my google home understand me oh really it is have you tried changing the voice to

511
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:01,120
the british voice i have in fact when brent was here we had a good giggle because we were doing

512
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:06,400
some youtube searches and i searched for something like tool danny carey drumming videos or something

513
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:12,880
and it came up with something completely random and i was like cool drumming danny carey videos

514
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:18,720
and it just worked first time so that's your american that's so great yeah it is say what

515
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:25,040
you will but that's my american accent what of it bro i have to be honest i feel like the echo the

516
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:32,880
amazon devices their hit rate for me remains the same but their annoyance rate has skyrocketed so

517
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:38,000
i don't have any echoes in the rv where i'm at now and i don't have any anywhere else except for in

518
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:45,280
one spot and that is in the studio proper like the main studio the jb one studio where i'm

519
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:50,480
live streaming anyways i don't care if there's an echo in there and that thing is inserting ads and

520
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:56,400
by the ways and did you knows and would you like all the time now it's so frustrating that i've

521
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:02,000
stopped using it by the way did you know you can ask for groceries in nine different languages

522
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:07,120
yeah okay great cool it's not what i asked for and then on the flip side with the home pods

523
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:12,640
which i too you know i like them i like them like you toxic but the thing is i swear to god

524
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:17,280
they're getting stupider i agree with you like i i don't know what it is but the hit rate is so

525
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:24,080
bad these days that i stop i enunciate really clearly i speak directly at it and it used to

526
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:30,320
be one when i i swear when i got the home pods and set them up i could just bark into the air

527
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:34,880
no matter what noise was going on and they would hear me and it was such a neat parlor trick i

528
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:39,040
would show it to people like we could have it super loud in here and i would say something

529
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:45,200
quietly to the home pod and it would still hear me and everybody was so impressed and now i would

530
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:51,520
never dare doing that i i swear it's gotten worse so um i'm in the same boat as you toxic if anybody

531
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:56,960
out there is using another system besides one of these commercial systems that are doing a cloud

532
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:01,040
dictation and all of that please let me know how it's working for you and if the hit rates are any

533
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:07,840
better real time feedback in the discord one of our australian buddies tells me that almond and

534
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:13,360
ada powered by home assistant are some good alternatives so maybe we should give those a go

535
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:17,760
but how how accurate like that i hear that i don't know but how are the hit rates compared to

536
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:21,920
the commercial ones that's what is it is it a downgrade because when you're the dad and you've

537
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:26,560
deployed all this stuff and then your family goes to use it and it fails them you always i take it

538
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:31,440
personally every time i'm embarrassed for the home pods when they fail to recognize what the wife is

539
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:35,440
asking for it's embarrassing send us a boost and let us know if you'd like to send us a boost

540
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:41,600
get a new podcast app a new podcast apps.com good news sats are on sale especially today they're on

548
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:24,240
device i think i was podverse i was just trying this out this is an interesting one so their whole

549
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:33,120
thing with podverse is a full featured web client that syncs to a mobile device client so that and

550
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:37,600
it also supports it doesn't do boosts but it supports all the other podcasting 2.0 features

551
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:41,840
which is pretty great been playing around with audiobook shelf whilst you've been talking a
