WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.520
Well, joining us on the show today, we have a colleague from Red Hat of mine, Josh Lascar.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.800
But before we introduce Josh, I just need to warn anybody, like a trigger warning.

00:11.600 --> 00:15.040
This man has more raspberry pies than Chris Fisher.

00:15.040 --> 00:18.080
I know, I think there is some discussion about creating a law

00:18.080 --> 00:20.400
against owning this many raspberry pies.

00:20.400 --> 00:24.320
Well, we have a leaderboard for the amount of storage people have.

00:24.320 --> 00:27.600
I think we might need to create a new leaderboard for the number of pies.

00:27.600 --> 00:29.520
Anyway, welcome to the show, Josh.

00:29.520 --> 00:33.280
Thank you so much. Long time listener and excited to be here.

00:33.280 --> 00:37.680
Very good. Before we get into the show proper, let's just do some housekeeping stuff, shall we?

00:37.680 --> 00:41.440
The London Meetup is coming up fast on August the 5th.

00:41.440 --> 00:46.960
We have finally nailed down a location that everybody seems to be happy with.

00:46.960 --> 00:52.640
So we're going to go for the Jubilee Gardens right underneath the London Eye

00:52.640 --> 00:57.520
Hungerford Bridge down by the River Thames in London, next to Waterloo Station.

00:57.520 --> 01:02.880
There is a big grassy area with a bunch of paths kind of winding their way through it,

01:02.880 --> 01:05.440
right next to the South Bank River frontage.

01:06.000 --> 01:11.440
I think if we just all meet up there around about six o'clock, British Summer Time.

01:11.440 --> 01:16.080
There's been some consternation in the group about GMT versus BST.

01:16.960 --> 01:19.760
Sounds like a load of BS to me, but there we go.

01:19.760 --> 01:26.320
It's six o'clock. As you look at your watch in British Summer Time is when we'll be meeting

01:26.880 --> 01:28.800
down in the Jubilee Gardens in London.

01:28.800 --> 01:30.960
I am super happy that you have found a location.

01:31.520 --> 01:35.760
I know that was a bit of consternation, especially because you're doing it from afar.

01:36.800 --> 01:39.120
So that's really good. It's like getting real now, Alex.

01:39.120 --> 01:41.600
Yeah. Well, I mean, when we were here, we did the one in Raleigh.

01:41.600 --> 01:43.600
I could go and check it out and make sure it was all good.

01:44.160 --> 01:47.360
But in London, it's a lot more tricky. And I actually had several offers from folks.

01:47.360 --> 01:51.120
There was a lovely venue near Covent Garden. There was another one in Woolwich that we were

01:51.120 --> 01:55.520
offered, but they were indoors. And some of the folks who are meeting with us,

01:55.520 --> 01:57.040
just that's a hard line for them.

01:57.920 --> 02:01.200
You know, Friday night in London, there aren't too many outdoor options.

02:01.200 --> 02:04.480
So I thought we'd just keep it simple and do something fairly central

02:04.480 --> 02:09.920
that is fairly touristy and therefore reasonably safe so far as London goes.

02:09.920 --> 02:12.880
And yeah, that's where we ended up.

02:13.440 --> 02:16.800
Meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting for the deets on that.

02:16.800 --> 02:18.320
And of course, you guys have been organizing this.

02:18.320 --> 02:23.120
This really was birthed in the self-hosted matrix itself, self-hosted Discord at

02:23.120 --> 02:26.080
self-hosted dot show slash Discord.

02:26.080 --> 02:30.880
The Freudian slip on the matrix there was because this did inspire us to realize and

02:31.680 --> 02:36.960
take action. And that was we created a JB Meetups matrix space.

02:36.960 --> 02:41.200
So at Matrix, there's this concept of a space where you can have like a bunch of

02:41.200 --> 02:45.680
collection of rooms. So we have a meetup space and then in there,

02:45.680 --> 02:50.080
we're going to have location specific chat rooms that are going to be standing chat rooms.

02:50.080 --> 02:52.800
So that way we can build crowds like I'd like to create a Raleigh one.

02:52.800 --> 02:54.480
I want to create a California one.

02:54.480 --> 02:58.560
We already have a London colony, a Pacific Northwest colony and the Mumble colony.

02:58.560 --> 03:01.920
So we can also do virtual events. But I could see more in the future.

03:01.920 --> 03:03.520
I'm just kind of feeling it out right now.

03:03.520 --> 03:06.720
And there is already folks organizing in the London colony.

03:06.720 --> 03:08.480
We'll have a link in the show notes to that as well.

03:08.480 --> 03:12.640
Because what we were talking about was potentially going for some air quotes,

03:12.640 --> 03:18.960
pre drinks or pre eats before the main meetup somewhere nearby as a smaller group.

03:18.960 --> 03:20.880
Because I know, you know, we pick six p.m.

03:20.880 --> 03:26.080
because then anybody that's got to travel after work or has work in the London area

03:26.080 --> 03:28.000
can still make it at the official time.

03:28.560 --> 03:31.040
But I don't know, like three, four o'clock, something like that.

03:31.040 --> 03:34.400
Maybe a few of us might meet up a little bit earlier and go and get some food or

03:34.400 --> 03:37.920
something like that and and then head over at six p.m. proper.

03:37.920 --> 03:42.000
Very good. I want to say thanks to Tim for filling in last episode.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.920
Did a great job while I was out sick, which was horrible timing.

03:45.920 --> 03:47.360
I hope you're feeling better.

03:47.360 --> 03:49.040
Yeah, I'm like 90 percent better.

03:49.040 --> 03:53.760
I still have some junk in my chest and in my in my sinuses, but I'm like 90 percent better.

03:53.760 --> 03:56.400
The worst timing ever, really, is just a horrible time to get sick.

03:56.400 --> 03:58.800
So I was doing prerecords. We were trying to do this show.

03:58.800 --> 04:02.240
I was trying to travel. It was like the worst possible time to get sick.

04:02.240 --> 04:06.160
Well, when we had Tim on, we turned it into the Kubernetes action show in your absence.

04:06.720 --> 04:09.760
Yeah, yeah, I enjoyed it. I enjoyed it a lot.

04:09.760 --> 04:13.520
And we got some nice comments, too. So thank you to Tim for filling in.

04:13.520 --> 04:15.680
For those of you that have been following along with the show,

04:15.680 --> 04:18.800
I sent in I think it was probably about six weeks ago now.

04:18.800 --> 04:23.120
I sent into Western Digital a failed, shucked hard drive.

04:23.760 --> 04:26.400
I finally got the replacement through yesterday.

04:26.400 --> 04:29.040
OK, well, OK. Do you know how long it was, Alex?

04:29.040 --> 04:32.160
I've lost track of how long it actually took for the replacement to come.

04:32.160 --> 04:34.720
Well, I removed the drive from the server when Brent was here.

04:34.720 --> 04:40.320
So I should give you some idea. It was a while ago, six, eight weeks, something like that.

04:40.320 --> 04:43.600
So all I did was I took the failed drive, which was a shucked drive,

04:43.600 --> 04:47.760
about two years old, out of the server, wrapped it in some bubble wrap in a box

04:47.760 --> 04:52.640
from reuse from Amazon, sent it across to Western Digital.

04:53.200 --> 04:57.200
And then a few days later, the RMA said completed.

04:57.200 --> 05:00.640
I got an email. It didn't give me any problems whatsoever.

05:00.640 --> 05:04.720
It just changed from we've received your item to completed.

05:04.720 --> 05:05.920
There was no other updates.

05:06.880 --> 05:09.760
And a few days later, what arrives?

05:09.760 --> 05:14.800
I get a brand new drive in a box, an unshucked hard drive.

05:14.800 --> 05:17.360
I got a Western Digital my book delivered.

05:17.360 --> 05:18.560
Unshucked, ready to go.

05:18.560 --> 05:21.840
So you sent them a shucked drive and they so they must have realized

05:22.640 --> 05:25.280
and they sent you back a my book.

05:25.280 --> 05:28.560
It feels passive aggressive almost like they know what you're up to.

05:28.560 --> 05:29.840
And here's the thing, right?

05:29.840 --> 05:33.280
The drive that I sent them was originally an easy store drive,

05:33.280 --> 05:35.280
which is a Best Buy exclusive.

05:35.280 --> 05:38.800
And they send me back a my book, which is not right.

05:38.800 --> 05:43.360
So there's been conjecture and guesswork on the internet for eons

05:43.360 --> 05:45.200
about the fact that they're the same drive.

05:45.200 --> 05:47.280
I guess we have some proof now.

05:47.280 --> 05:50.480
Yeah, it does seem like it is a data point, at least.

05:50.480 --> 05:54.000
Josh, have you tried this shucking thing that Alex talks about all the time?

05:54.000 --> 05:54.960
Most definitely.

05:55.600 --> 05:58.880
I've done it both for my Synology boxes when I've grown over time.

05:58.880 --> 06:02.480
I've got three up to this point, one at my local place of worship

06:02.480 --> 06:04.240
and then two here in the lab.

06:04.240 --> 06:07.520
So both a four bay and a two bay and I've had success with it.

06:07.520 --> 06:11.680
I have one drive right now that is actually my it's my one shucked drive.

06:11.680 --> 06:12.400
It's been great.

06:13.040 --> 06:15.440
That's been in production since Brent was here,

06:15.440 --> 06:17.920
which is even longer than since Brent was at Alex's place.

06:19.360 --> 06:20.960
We measure things in Brent time now.

06:22.400 --> 06:23.520
Brent standard time.

06:24.080 --> 06:24.800
BST.

06:24.800 --> 06:26.640
What could go wrong using that acronym?

06:26.640 --> 06:28.720
But I mean, you got a disk, right?

06:28.720 --> 06:29.920
I mean, you got to shuck it.

06:29.920 --> 06:30.160
Yeah.

06:30.160 --> 06:32.640
I mean, to be honest with you, I already bought the replacement

06:32.640 --> 06:35.920
because I don't like being down for that long.

06:35.920 --> 06:38.560
So I'll probably throw it up on eBay.

06:38.560 --> 06:42.640
If somebody wants a 12 terabyte drive for cheap, send me a message and

06:42.640 --> 06:44.800
you're not keeping it as a backup.

06:44.800 --> 06:46.560
Oh, what about a hot swap?

06:46.560 --> 06:47.440
Come on, Alex.

06:48.480 --> 06:50.320
I've already got one of those in there.

06:50.960 --> 06:53.680
I don't need I don't need a backup for my hot spare.

06:54.320 --> 06:54.720
Mr.

06:54.720 --> 06:56.480
I don't need 12 terabytes over here.

06:56.480 --> 06:58.160
Okay, here's the thing, right?

06:58.160 --> 07:00.960
I went through and so I used, I use radar a lot, right?

07:00.960 --> 07:04.640
I know we don't talk about this stuff very much, but I use radar a lot too much.

07:05.120 --> 07:09.360
If I'm being perfectly honest, and I added some automations to

07:10.160 --> 07:13.200
automatically the based on lists, right?

07:13.200 --> 07:21.760
So in any given week, 50 to a hundred movies appeared on my system and I just

07:21.760 --> 07:25.520
had no idea where I was going to find the time to watch all this stuff.

07:25.520 --> 07:29.520
So about, about when that drive failed, actually, I just went through and

07:29.520 --> 07:33.120
deleted terabytes and terabytes of stuff.

07:33.120 --> 07:37.120
So I, my, my array, let me have a look merger FS.

07:37.120 --> 07:37.680
Here it is.

07:38.160 --> 07:44.000
Uh, 71 terabytes right now used 25 remaining 47.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.440
So I think I'll be all right without the extra 12.

07:47.440 --> 07:48.560
I think, yeah, you'll be all right.

07:48.560 --> 07:49.440
You'll be all right.

07:49.440 --> 07:50.880
I just recently did that too.

07:51.360 --> 07:54.240
I was getting ready for the trip or something like that.

07:54.240 --> 07:57.440
I wanted to grab some shows and I realized I was down to like two

07:57.440 --> 08:02.480
terabytes of free space and I had like four terabytes in my queue.

08:02.800 --> 08:06.720
And, uh, I, I knew as I was looking at everything, I was like, before this

08:06.720 --> 08:11.920
finishes, I'm going to run out of disk space, you know, one of those moments.

08:11.920 --> 08:14.000
And I just went on a deleting rampage dude.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.440
And it felt so good.

08:15.440 --> 08:17.200
Like it felt so good to just delete stuff.

08:17.200 --> 08:18.480
I know I'm never going to watch.

08:18.480 --> 08:20.000
I got a bunch of stuff on there.

08:20.000 --> 08:24.080
There was like, just, I, I, if I had it on DVD, I backed it up.

08:24.240 --> 08:27.120
Or if somebody, like a friend wanted to request something, the system

08:27.120 --> 08:27.920
would go grab it for them.

08:27.920 --> 08:31.760
And there was so much stuff that I was, nobody was watching ever.

08:32.480 --> 08:33.600
It felt so good to purge.

08:33.600 --> 08:34.480
It felt so good.

08:34.480 --> 08:38.000
Now I've really refined it down to like the stuff that I've either handcrafted

08:38.480 --> 08:41.040
or, you know, the stuff that is like in the watch queue or

08:41.040 --> 08:42.080
something like that right now.

08:42.160 --> 08:43.760
Let the internet be your backup.

08:43.840 --> 08:44.400
How about that?

08:45.040 --> 08:48.240
See, I was still kicking it old school to where I bought my DVDs and

08:48.240 --> 08:51.760
Blu-rays, rip them across, put them onto my Plex media server.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.960
And then when, and if something were to happen, yeah, I could

08:54.960 --> 08:56.160
always re-rip those down.

08:56.160 --> 08:57.760
So I haven't made that next step.

08:57.840 --> 09:03.840
You know, I have to say proudly, proudly that the Blu-rays that I have

09:03.840 --> 09:08.640
ripped are always better than the ones that you can get off the internet.

09:08.640 --> 09:10.640
Like, I don't know, man.

09:10.640 --> 09:14.560
Maybe it's, maybe it's just because I know what the FFmpeg commands do.

09:14.560 --> 09:16.800
I don't know what the difference is, but.

09:16.800 --> 09:19.600
It always, my encodings years later, like I'll come back.

09:19.600 --> 09:22.960
Like we're watching, my wife and I are re-watching Star Trek Enterprise.

09:23.440 --> 09:26.160
I hand ripped every one of those episodes.

09:26.160 --> 09:26.640
Right.

09:26.720 --> 09:31.040
And I did it meticulously with, with two passing coding and like all the

09:31.040 --> 09:32.320
right, all the right settings.

09:32.320 --> 09:34.400
And it just, it holds up, it holds up.

09:34.560 --> 09:35.920
And I did that work years ago.

09:36.320 --> 09:37.120
Very proud of that.

09:37.120 --> 09:38.560
So that kind of stuff I did not purge.

09:38.560 --> 09:40.720
With the setting, make my CPU hurt, huh?

09:43.520 --> 09:44.000
All right.

09:44.000 --> 09:48.160
So I, I have to ask the audience and Josh, you too, you know, I've talked

09:48.160 --> 09:52.080
positively about the HomePods as a voice control mechanism for Home Assistant.

09:52.800 --> 09:53.600
I like them.

09:54.160 --> 09:58.080
Not only do I think they are the best sounding Home Assistant, but the commands

09:58.080 --> 10:02.080
to interface with Home Assistant using the HomeKit API are all done over the LAN.

10:02.720 --> 10:06.560
The voice transcription is done remotely, but once it figures out what you've

10:06.560 --> 10:12.640
requested, the HomePod executes that request locally over the LAN, and then

10:12.640 --> 10:16.480
over the LAN to your Home Assistant server using the HomeKit API.

10:16.480 --> 10:17.440
It's very nice.

10:17.760 --> 10:18.720
It's more private.

10:19.520 --> 10:20.560
I just have preferred it.

10:21.280 --> 10:26.960
I don't know what's changed, but Siri has lost it, like lost it.

10:26.960 --> 10:32.720
Like if I say, Hey, lady tube, turn off the entry bar, her response after she

10:32.720 --> 10:37.120
thinks about it will be, okay, I've turned off the Apple TV 4k.

10:37.760 --> 10:38.400
I'm sorry.

10:38.480 --> 10:40.400
The Apple TV 4k is not responding.

10:41.280 --> 10:42.400
I didn't say anything about that.

10:42.400 --> 10:47.040
If I say, Hey, Siri, turn off the bed skirt, she just won't say anything.

10:47.040 --> 10:47.840
Like nothing happens.

10:47.840 --> 10:51.120
Like commands that I used to do on a daily basis as I was coming and going

10:51.120 --> 10:55.200
from my home just in the last week, quit working.

10:55.200 --> 10:57.920
She just thinks I've said something completely different than what I've

10:57.920 --> 10:59.920
said, completely different.

10:59.920 --> 11:02.400
And then I don't know how, I don't know if my wife tapped something or

11:02.400 --> 11:06.480
what happened, but somehow personalized results have been turned on and now

11:06.480 --> 11:08.320
it's doing voice recognition.

11:08.320 --> 11:11.520
And of course it like sees a different set of devices for some reason.

11:11.520 --> 11:16.000
When my wife has a command versus when I have a command, this just changed.

11:16.000 --> 11:20.640
And it feels like somebody came into our home and moved all the light

11:20.640 --> 11:23.360
switches around and hooked them up to different stuff.

11:24.320 --> 11:28.480
And it's super frustrating because like the wife approval factor, which

11:28.480 --> 11:32.320
has been very high on this entire system is on a decline right now.

11:33.680 --> 11:36.320
Have you guys experienced this with any of these voice assistants?

11:36.320 --> 11:37.920
Is this something unique to Siri?

11:38.640 --> 11:39.680
Is anybody in the audience?

11:39.680 --> 11:42.880
I'm like, I'm lost for words and I don't know what to do because of course

11:42.880 --> 11:46.000
I've got these stupid home pods all over the place and now they're working

11:46.000 --> 11:48.880
for crap and it might actually be home assistant's fault.

11:48.880 --> 11:52.880
That's the other thing is I opened up my home app and the home assistant

11:52.880 --> 11:53.760
stuff didn't look right.

11:54.400 --> 11:55.520
I don't know what was going on.

11:55.520 --> 11:59.360
So it may actually be something in home assistant, but more troubleshooting

11:59.360 --> 11:59.920
needed.

11:59.920 --> 12:02.960
You got to warn us when you're getting your site box out, dude.

12:02.960 --> 12:05.120
I know, I know.

12:05.120 --> 12:06.720
Josh, have you experienced this?

12:06.720 --> 12:08.880
So I'll be honest with you, Chris.

12:08.880 --> 12:12.720
I've just put my big toe finally into the home automation side of the house

12:12.720 --> 12:15.600
and I still don't trust any of the voice command stuff.

12:15.600 --> 12:19.600
I want to make sure it's all here locally toward the point where I put that

12:19.600 --> 12:20.640
entire thing on pause.

12:20.640 --> 12:22.080
I didn't own my home yet.

12:22.080 --> 12:24.080
I now have bought my first home.

12:24.080 --> 12:27.920
The issue was I needed to make sure I could segment my network correctly to

12:27.920 --> 12:29.440
where I had an IOT network.

12:29.440 --> 12:32.320
I had a home computer network.

12:32.320 --> 12:36.160
I had a security system network completely separated to make sure they

12:36.160 --> 12:41.280
can't see each other and then just then, literally last week after listening to

12:41.280 --> 12:43.840
you guys forever on using home assistant.

12:44.400 --> 12:47.680
That's what's running on the silver pie behind me is I've got that in the

12:47.680 --> 12:52.640
combi running and I started playing with that and they can't see other than

12:52.640 --> 12:55.520
what I told it to because it's only on that network.

12:55.520 --> 12:57.360
Yeah, I like that you started with the security first.

12:57.360 --> 12:58.320
That's a great idea.

12:58.320 --> 13:03.600
You know, the utility of the voice commands, especially because home family

13:03.600 --> 13:08.160
members don't want to walk to tablets every time, has been really like crucial,

13:08.160 --> 13:13.040
I think, in the approval factor by the whole family because, you know, everybody

13:13.040 --> 13:16.720
from, you know, kids to new people that are visiting can do it really quick.

13:16.720 --> 13:20.240
But now it's gone totally sideways and it makes the whole system look loony.

13:20.240 --> 13:23.600
I'm hoping that my craft gets a little bit better and where we get more to

13:23.600 --> 13:26.560
where we're doing it locally again, because like one of the things that

13:26.560 --> 13:29.760
I've got is the re speaker with the four mic set up.

13:29.760 --> 13:35.040
And when I tried testing that about a year and a half ago, it wasn't great.

13:35.040 --> 13:36.560
Not that the hardware wasn't great.

13:36.560 --> 13:38.480
Software wasn't great.

13:38.480 --> 13:42.400
So I think it's coming, but it's not there yet.

13:42.400 --> 13:43.840
So I'm not going to hit that button.

13:43.840 --> 13:46.640
I must say, I'm not particularly surprised to hear Josh hitting the

13:46.640 --> 13:51.120
security angle pretty hard from the get go because you're involved with the

13:51.120 --> 13:53.920
Defcon scene, aren't you?

13:53.920 --> 13:54.400
I am.

13:54.400 --> 13:56.560
I've been going to Defcon for a few years now.

13:56.560 --> 13:58.480
I enjoy the security aspect of it.

13:58.480 --> 14:00.240
So Defcon is coming up here.

14:00.240 --> 14:02.640
It's not like it's in 45 days and so many hours.

14:02.640 --> 14:03.200
This is fine.

14:04.480 --> 14:05.280
I see.

14:05.280 --> 14:05.680
I see.

14:05.680 --> 14:07.600
Well, it's a good angle to look at this stuff.

14:07.600 --> 14:11.120
I think you should always start from a position of not trusting these devices

14:11.120 --> 14:11.520
at all.

14:12.560 --> 14:17.920
And I'm sure like you guys, before I buy anything these days, I tend to do a

14:17.920 --> 14:23.520
lot of research on if it can be locally controlled, what it's built on,

14:23.520 --> 14:25.120
information about the company.

14:25.120 --> 14:29.760
Buying a device these days feels like you have to like almost get in a

14:29.760 --> 14:31.280
relationship with a company.

14:31.280 --> 14:33.360
That's one of the things I really appreciated about local control.

14:33.360 --> 14:36.160
Anytime there's a local API, that's a big win for me.

14:36.160 --> 14:39.600
I feel like that was one of the things I liked about the HomePods.

14:41.360 --> 14:42.800
Another thing, I just got a Nanoleaf.

14:42.800 --> 14:43.280
Nice.

14:43.280 --> 14:44.800
And these are really nice.

14:44.800 --> 14:45.280
They're wood.

14:45.280 --> 14:46.880
They look like wood on the wall.

14:46.880 --> 14:47.840
But you got the wood ones.

14:47.840 --> 14:48.320
Sweet.

14:48.320 --> 14:49.040
They look really great.

14:49.040 --> 14:51.760
They almost look like art on their own, even when they're off.

14:51.760 --> 14:55.760
And true to the documentation, when you power that thing and you get it on

14:55.760 --> 14:59.680
your Wi-Fi, Home Assistant automatically detects it and suggests,

14:59.680 --> 15:02.960
hey, would you like to install the Nanoleaf integration?

15:02.960 --> 15:06.320
And it was just a little wonky at first, but it's been totally solid since.

15:06.320 --> 15:09.840
All local API, no cloud account, no nothing like that.

15:09.840 --> 15:11.280
It's very nice.

15:11.280 --> 15:13.360
So there's wins and losses.

15:13.360 --> 15:19.200
So I feel like the Nanoleaf win offset the HomePod loss recently.

15:19.200 --> 15:22.320
But now I've just kind of equalized everything out.

15:22.960 --> 15:26.720
I recently picked up the Nanoleaf hexes and absolutely love them.

15:26.720 --> 15:30.400
Exact same experience to where once you turned it, connected it to the network,

15:30.400 --> 15:32.640
then from there, Home Assistant just picked it up, no problem.

15:32.640 --> 15:33.920
And they're just neat looking.

15:33.920 --> 15:39.040
Against my better judgment, I bought some LEDs from Govi recently.

15:39.040 --> 15:40.960
I say recently, it's probably six months ago.

15:41.440 --> 15:46.480
And when I got them, the integration was cloud polling integration,

15:46.480 --> 15:48.240
and it just worked just fine.

15:48.240 --> 15:54.400
About two months ago, Govi just decided to rate limit the API requests.

15:54.400 --> 15:58.640
And suddenly all of the lights just stopped working with Home Assistant.

15:59.280 --> 16:01.680
I opened a support ticket and they were like, well,

16:01.680 --> 16:02.880
we don't know what you're talking about.

16:02.880 --> 16:08.320
Like the support people just had no clue what even an API probably was sadly.

16:09.120 --> 16:13.200
But thankfully I was able to go into the integration and update the polling rate,

16:13.200 --> 16:16.640
which meant that now they work, they're a bit slower than they were,

16:16.640 --> 16:21.200
but they work at least. So yeah, let that be a lesson, kids.

16:21.200 --> 16:23.920
You know, if they don't want to handle the API requests,

16:23.920 --> 16:27.680
maybe they could just let the API requests go locally.

16:27.680 --> 16:29.760
Hmm. I mean, I'm just going to put that out there,

16:29.760 --> 16:32.560
but if your cloud service can't handle the customer demand,

16:32.560 --> 16:36.400
maybe you should re-architect it so it doesn't require your cloud service.

16:36.400 --> 16:39.680
How would you collect the data then, Chris? That's the real question.

16:39.680 --> 16:40.800
Right.

16:40.800 --> 16:46.080
What data are you collecting on how many minutes my LED strip underneath my bed is on?

16:46.080 --> 16:48.400
My bed is on four. I mean, really.

16:48.400 --> 16:51.440
Because we need to calculate how much longer it's going to be

16:51.440 --> 16:53.920
until you buy the next set of LEDs, Alex.

16:53.920 --> 16:58.720
Well, there's that, but also there is sort of like this metadata information of,

16:58.720 --> 17:00.640
now they don't know if it's not automation,

17:00.640 --> 17:02.880
but most people probably are not automating these things.

17:02.880 --> 17:05.200
So they can kind of probably assume Alex was home

17:06.320 --> 17:08.320
during these times or something like that. I don't know.

17:08.960 --> 17:12.960
I don't think it's so much about collecting data with these types of vendors.

17:12.960 --> 17:18.560
I think it's more about an ecosystem that they build this mode around

17:18.560 --> 17:20.800
and they try to get you. Every one of these vendors,

17:20.800 --> 17:23.680
even Nanoleaf does this, has like a million products.

17:24.720 --> 17:28.000
Have you looked at the Wyze store recently?

17:28.000 --> 17:28.960
Oh, yeah.

17:28.960 --> 17:30.720
Have you looked at that thing, dude?

17:30.720 --> 17:35.040
They went from selling cameras to like, now they sell scales and stuff,

17:35.040 --> 17:39.440
like weight scales and stuff. They're just like everywhere, man.

17:39.440 --> 17:42.800
Everybody does this. They all want to make a million products.

17:42.800 --> 17:46.080
The Wyze store is like walking into one of those markets in Taiwan

17:46.080 --> 17:49.280
where you've got like 15 different stores at all moments.

17:49.280 --> 17:51.520
And they've just gone, yeah, we'll have that. We'll have that.

17:51.520 --> 17:54.560
Yeah, we'll stick our logo on that. Yeah, we'll throw our logo on that too.

17:54.560 --> 17:57.840
And yeah, that's fine. That'll do.

17:57.840 --> 17:59.120
We're not going to worry about the support.

17:59.120 --> 18:01.360
Like, you know, with the first gen cameras or anything,

18:01.360 --> 18:03.360
we're just going to slap a sticker on it, right?

18:03.360 --> 18:06.080
Talk about a Trojan horse company.

18:06.080 --> 18:09.440
I think that's sort of the overall motive with these companies

18:09.440 --> 18:11.760
and their cloud-only APIs and whatnot.

18:11.760 --> 18:14.240
But like, that's not how you get my loyalty.

18:14.240 --> 18:17.120
That is the business model. You're right.

18:17.120 --> 18:18.480
It is. I have to agree.

18:20.640 --> 18:23.520
Tailscale.com slash self-hosted.

18:23.520 --> 18:27.680
Go there to get a personal account for up to 20 devices for totes free.

18:27.680 --> 18:29.120
And you support the show.

18:29.120 --> 18:31.920
Tailscale is a zero config VPN.

18:31.920 --> 18:33.280
It's like a ninja VPN.

18:33.280 --> 18:36.720
You install it on any device in minutes. It takes care of the firewall rules.

18:36.720 --> 18:38.880
It takes care of the crazy NAT you might be on.

18:38.880 --> 18:42.320
And I'm saying it takes care of the crazy, crazy NAT.

18:42.320 --> 18:43.840
I can attest to that.

18:43.840 --> 18:45.680
Your devices connect directly to each other.

18:45.680 --> 18:50.480
Creates this mesh network based around WireGuard's noise protocol.

18:51.440 --> 18:56.320
They're using like the best VPN technology in a super, super clever way.

18:56.320 --> 19:01.040
You can quickly and easily create a flat mesh network where your devices get a static IP.

19:01.040 --> 19:05.760
And if you're a maniac, you could throw like a pie hole box or a DNS server in that mix.

19:05.760 --> 19:09.040
And you can actually start doing name resolution on that network.

19:09.040 --> 19:10.080
It's so great.

19:10.080 --> 19:14.400
You can also do things like share one machine with a friend like Alex and I do for some of

19:14.400 --> 19:16.480
these testings we'll do here on the shows.

19:16.480 --> 19:20.080
But you know what else they've recently introduced, which blows my mind?

19:20.080 --> 19:24.880
Is they've introduced a new product, a new feature, I guess, called TailScale SSH.

19:25.600 --> 19:29.360
You can now easily manage your SSH connections with TailNet.

19:29.360 --> 19:33.920
TailScale SSH allows you to establish SSH connections between your devices in your

19:33.920 --> 19:37.680
TailScale network and authorized by your access controls.

19:37.680 --> 19:41.280
You don't have to sit around and copy your keys like a caveman anymore.

19:41.280 --> 19:45.120
And it authenticates your SSH connection using WireGuard.

19:45.120 --> 19:46.880
It's so great.

19:46.880 --> 19:50.400
TailScale is a breakthrough VPN technology.

19:50.400 --> 19:53.360
It's the kind of thing I knew they'd build once WireGuard was a thing.

19:53.360 --> 19:58.000
That's why I wanted it to be mainline for so many years because I knew we get cool stuff

19:58.000 --> 19:59.280
like this.

19:59.280 --> 20:00.320
I've got to run on everything.

20:00.320 --> 20:05.680
My arch servers, my su servers, my x86 boxes, my Raspberry Pis, my portable devices.

20:05.680 --> 20:06.800
It's on my phone right now.

20:06.800 --> 20:10.720
I always leave it connected to because the client is really smart about what it routes

20:10.720 --> 20:14.160
to your TailScale network versus what it routes out to the internet and stuff like that.

20:14.160 --> 20:17.520
You're not accidentally sending every single web page load over your TailScale or something

20:17.520 --> 20:18.000
like that.

20:18.720 --> 20:19.680
So go try it.

20:19.680 --> 20:23.680
Support the show and get it for free up to 20 devices when you go to TailScale.com

20:23.680 --> 20:25.040
slash self-hosted.

20:25.040 --> 20:30.320
Imagine one flat network for all your devices, your containers, your VMs, your physical devices,

20:30.320 --> 20:35.920
your mobile devices, friends, family, colleagues, all protected by WireGuard that you get up

20:35.920 --> 20:37.200
and running in minutes.

20:37.200 --> 20:39.840
TailScale.com slash self-hosted.

20:42.160 --> 20:48.320
Now I teased at the top of the show that we have a, dare I call it a Raspberry Pi hoarder?

20:48.320 --> 20:50.000
I don't know if that's a correct word.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.280
Collector.

20:51.280 --> 20:52.080
Collector.

20:52.080 --> 20:53.120
OK, let's go with that.

20:53.120 --> 20:55.040
Yeah, I mean, I don't know, Josh.

20:55.040 --> 20:58.880
I feel like you could almost create a currency based on how many Raspberry Pis you have.

20:58.880 --> 21:00.240
I don't have that many Pis.

21:00.240 --> 21:01.280
Come on now, Chris.

21:01.280 --> 21:03.120
And they are getting hard to get a hold of.

21:03.120 --> 21:04.960
OK, tell the people, Josh.

21:04.960 --> 21:08.000
Tell the people, how many Raspberry Pis do you have?

21:08.000 --> 21:14.240
So I've currently got 43 Pis and eight Pi Picos.

21:14.240 --> 21:19.360
When we actually list these things off, it's one compute module for 13 Raspberry Pi 4s,

21:19.360 --> 21:25.440
seven Raspberry Pi 3s, three Raspberry Pi 2s, six Raspberry Pi 1s, 11 Raspberry Pi 0s,

21:25.440 --> 21:28.960
and one Raspberry Pi 0-2.

21:28.960 --> 21:31.680
And a partridge in a pear tree.

21:31.680 --> 21:34.080
I forgot there was a 400 in there as well, hanging.

21:34.080 --> 21:36.000
Oh, sure, yeah, gotta have a 400.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.920
Gotta have a 400, right?

21:37.920 --> 21:41.120
That's what you can actually get a hold of nowadays, too, so you can still find those

21:41.120 --> 21:42.160
at a decent price.

21:42.160 --> 21:43.200
Those are great machines.

21:43.200 --> 21:48.160
That is a lot of Raspberry Pis, whatever way you split them.

21:48.160 --> 21:50.400
Whatever way you slice it.

21:50.400 --> 21:53.760
How are you going to justify having so many to us?

21:53.760 --> 21:54.560
Please.

21:54.560 --> 21:57.920
So I have been collecting these literally from the beginning.

21:57.920 --> 21:58.880
I was super excited.

21:58.880 --> 22:03.520
Before I was in working for my current employer, I wanted to get into Linux.

22:03.520 --> 22:06.480
And the Raspberry Pi was a great way to do that.

22:06.480 --> 22:11.040
And playing with Linux on the side was always fun, but you never had a dedicated machine

22:11.040 --> 22:11.680
for that.

22:11.680 --> 22:15.280
Or you'd be dual booting and wiping Windows and Linux and going back and forth.

22:15.280 --> 22:17.600
Hey, the Pi's filled that need, which was awesome.

22:17.600 --> 22:23.440
So creating their own cases, I was one of the early adopters to where when I bought

22:23.440 --> 22:28.720
them, they actually have the misprint on there to where it's the 10M on there instead of

22:28.720 --> 22:32.240
the 100 megabit to where it was super, super early days.

22:32.240 --> 22:36.960
So I've just been buying a couple per time they come out with a new one and then finding

22:36.960 --> 22:38.160
tasks for them.

22:38.160 --> 22:43.040
So it started off with just a thin client.

22:43.040 --> 22:49.840
And from there, I was able to use the thin client OS to go over to my ESXi instance,

22:50.480 --> 22:55.040
my Proxmox instance, early days, 10 years ago, back when these came out back in 2011

22:55.040 --> 22:55.920
and 2012.

22:56.480 --> 23:01.520
And then from there, I made myself a lap deck, which was the old school Motorola flip up

23:01.520 --> 23:05.360
to where you could use to go through and plug in like your own cell phone back before that

23:05.360 --> 23:06.320
was a thing.

23:06.320 --> 23:12.000
And I built my own cables to where I could have a portable Linux Raspberry Pi laptop,

23:12.000 --> 23:13.680
went to my hackerspace, went and talked about it.

23:13.680 --> 23:15.680
And that just kept on growing from there.

23:15.680 --> 23:20.640
So what was it about the Raspberry Pi platform that seems to have drawn you so early on?

23:20.640 --> 23:25.760
Because for me personally, I think it really took to the Pi 3 and definitely once the Pi

23:25.760 --> 23:30.160
4 landed where I said to myself, this is really something I can use now.

23:30.160 --> 23:33.200
And but you kind of it seems like you honed in on a lot earlier than I did.

23:33.200 --> 23:37.840
So early adopter with it because I was young and dumb at that point because I wanted to

23:37.840 --> 23:40.000
always try the newest, latest and greatest.

23:40.000 --> 23:45.360
And hey, Raspberry Pis with SD cards instead of being able to afford full up machines,

23:45.360 --> 23:50.720
even if you were trying to get them refurbished from like a thrift shop or whatnot, you had

23:50.720 --> 23:55.280
more ecosystem, more of a community behind the Raspberry Pis than anything else you could

23:55.280 --> 23:55.760
do.

23:55.760 --> 23:56.240
Very true.

23:56.240 --> 23:59.920
There was that network effect very early on in a way that most devices didn't get.

23:59.920 --> 24:02.800
You must have experimented with Pi alternatives, though, right?

24:02.800 --> 24:07.120
Because as a Pi user, you're constantly being told there's a much better device out there

24:07.120 --> 24:08.320
if you just bought the right device.

24:08.320 --> 24:12.080
I completely agree with that. And I was young and dumb and stupid and bought many of them.

24:12.080 --> 24:15.040
And then I finally figured out there's not the community.

24:15.040 --> 24:19.600
And even with like the Libre boards that were out there, I backed those on Kickstarter.

24:19.600 --> 24:23.520
And when trying to get them up and running, the Pi just had it.

24:23.520 --> 24:25.760
And it comes down to open source.

24:25.760 --> 24:27.600
It comes down to the open community.

24:27.600 --> 24:31.200
And when you bridge those together, that's where you've got the magic sauce.

24:31.200 --> 24:33.120
So that's what Raspberry Pi just did.

24:33.120 --> 24:34.960
And it kept on hitting it off for me.

24:34.960 --> 24:36.560
And then I agree with you, Chris.

24:36.560 --> 24:38.560
Early days, I was like, oh, I'm going to implement this.

24:38.560 --> 24:40.560
This is going to be my full time desktop.

24:40.560 --> 24:41.840
Yeah, not powerful enough.

24:41.840 --> 24:44.160
Oh, I can do my Plex server on this.

24:44.160 --> 24:46.240
Yeah, no, that's not powerful enough either.

24:46.240 --> 24:51.520
So I quickly learned over the years the performance that the Raspberry Pi could do

24:51.520 --> 24:54.800
would most of the time not meet the need that I needed.

24:54.800 --> 24:56.960
So when the new one came out, oh, let's try this again.

24:57.520 --> 24:59.280
Hey, it worked better.

24:59.280 --> 25:01.520
We went from a single core to a quad core.

25:01.520 --> 25:03.920
But that RAM, oh, that RAM hurts.

25:03.920 --> 25:07.040
I know, so I agree.

25:07.040 --> 25:11.600
Once we got to the Raspberry Pi 4, that's why I've got 13 of them.

25:11.600 --> 25:15.200
Because they got so much more powerful.

25:15.200 --> 25:17.920
So here's the thing for me, Josh.

25:17.920 --> 25:26.960
And I just wouldn't a single virtualization server replace all of these?

25:26.960 --> 25:28.960
So that is a good question.

25:28.960 --> 25:33.680
Back when I was still when I was not working from home, I went through that point

25:33.680 --> 25:35.280
and saying I'm going to virtualize everything.

25:35.280 --> 25:36.720
I got the pizza box.

25:36.720 --> 25:37.920
Everything was happy-go-lucky.

25:38.480 --> 25:42.160
Until my wife called and said, hey, this service is down.

25:42.800 --> 25:49.040
Oh, why don't you go ahead and just SSH and then just, you know, I'll be home and I'll fix it.

25:49.040 --> 25:52.800
Versus, hey, go unplug the Pi, plug the Pi back in.

25:52.800 --> 25:53.760
It's working now.

25:53.760 --> 25:56.000
Have you heard of our Lord and Savior, Tailscale?

25:56.000 --> 25:58.720
You could just VPN in and fix that bitch.

25:58.720 --> 26:02.720
That should be their slogan.

26:05.680 --> 26:09.360
So the significant other buy-in was part of that, to be honest with you, Alex.

26:09.360 --> 26:14.800
So some things, yes, we do virtualize other things like when you're just getting into

26:14.800 --> 26:19.600
a network and you're trying to find out more about your home network, throwing in a Raspberry

26:19.600 --> 26:24.000
Pi 4 for Pi-Hole gives you so much more insight of how many devices are reaching back out to

26:24.000 --> 26:28.960
the internet that you would have to buy like ubiquity grade or more enterprise grade gear

26:28.960 --> 26:30.560
to start getting that insight.

26:30.560 --> 26:35.120
But let's be honest, you can buy a hundred dollars worth of Raspberry Pi kit, plug it

26:35.120 --> 26:36.800
in and get that information now.

26:36.800 --> 26:40.320
So how many dollars do you think you're deep into this hole in?

26:40.320 --> 26:47.120
I don't want to even think about that, but I've only ever paid the MSRP.

26:47.120 --> 26:49.520
I've not gone through and supported the scalpers.

26:49.520 --> 26:50.640
That's all I got to say.

26:50.640 --> 26:51.520
Good for you.

26:51.520 --> 26:52.080
Good for you.

26:52.080 --> 26:57.280
All right, if we ignore the dollars and cents, let's talk about something a little more tangible

26:57.280 --> 26:58.480
because you live in the desert, right?

26:58.480 --> 27:00.240
Where heat is a problem.

27:00.240 --> 27:04.880
These things are going to consume, I don't know what, 5 to 15 Watts, depending on what

27:04.880 --> 27:05.920
they're doing each.

27:05.920 --> 27:07.440
Yes, yes, they will.

27:07.440 --> 27:11.120
And that's why I've had to go through and pick my favorite cases because I've been collecting

27:11.120 --> 27:11.840
for so long.

27:11.840 --> 27:17.440
I buy a lot of cases, I buy a lot of hats, all the Raspberry Pi cameras and I've got

27:17.440 --> 27:23.840
to say, honestly, for my area in the desert is the Vilarose all aluminum cases are by

27:23.840 --> 27:27.040
far the best because it's completely passive.

27:27.040 --> 27:29.200
You're not having to worry about dirt getting into it.

27:29.200 --> 27:32.880
They actually come with thermal paste to where you could go through and apply it on the case

27:32.880 --> 27:38.560
itself and touch all the parts and it keeps it clear and cool.

27:38.560 --> 27:42.240
And that's literally what I have running on every single Raspberry Pi when it comes to

27:42.240 --> 27:43.200
the force.

27:43.200 --> 27:46.880
Have you tried the flirt case that also comes with a little thermal pad and

27:46.880 --> 27:52.960
I have their previous flirt cases for the three and I still honestly prefer the Vilarose.

27:52.960 --> 27:55.600
Yeah, because I was thinking, you know, I definitely have been in situations where it

27:55.600 --> 27:59.200
gets really, really hot and those Raspberry Pis are definitely at like thermal throttle

27:59.200 --> 28:00.000
levels.

28:00.000 --> 28:00.800
So that would be good.

28:00.800 --> 28:02.080
All right, send me a link to that.

28:02.080 --> 28:03.680
I'll try to add that to the show notes.

28:03.680 --> 28:08.640
There's a geek worm one that I really like that is all aluminum as well and that does

28:08.640 --> 28:13.760
completely passive cooling and that's what's just there on the live stream running that

28:13.760 --> 28:16.080
3D printer back there doing octo print.

28:16.080 --> 28:20.080
Speaking of the live stream, I loved Foss accountants comment in here.

28:20.080 --> 28:24.800
I no longer need to feel bad about having an unused eight gigabyte Pi four in my drawer.

28:26.640 --> 28:32.160
So used pies versus if they're actively being if they're just sitting in a drawer sad or

28:32.160 --> 28:34.400
if they have a project waiting for them.

28:34.400 --> 28:38.080
How many you have in production versus how many you have just sitting around are two

28:38.080 --> 28:38.640
different things.

28:38.640 --> 28:42.240
So I mean, there's still naming and shaming that should be going on there if they're just

28:42.240 --> 28:42.960
sitting in a drawer.

28:43.760 --> 28:44.320
I agree.

28:44.320 --> 28:45.600
I agree.

28:45.600 --> 28:46.400
I got I agree.

28:46.400 --> 28:48.720
I got I got more projects than I got pies at this point.

28:48.720 --> 28:49.600
I need more pies.

28:49.600 --> 28:51.280
So speaking of projects, right?

28:51.280 --> 28:52.480
We've talked about pie hole.

28:52.480 --> 28:54.080
We've talked about thing clients.

28:54.080 --> 28:56.400
There must be some other stuff you use these things for.

28:56.400 --> 29:00.240
Like I said, the the lap deck was one of them being into the security side of the house

29:00.240 --> 29:05.600
as well standing up your own pen testing box or a Cali instance where you can slap that

29:05.600 --> 29:07.680
in there before Kelly was officially supported.

29:07.680 --> 29:11.840
There are other earlier spins that was like called the Pwn Pi or sticky fingers.

29:11.840 --> 29:13.760
There's also the damn vulnerable pie.

29:13.760 --> 29:16.640
So if you needed to pen test against something, you could do that as well.

29:17.200 --> 29:21.200
If you're more into the Wi-Fi hacking and tracking, you've got the kismet pie, lots

29:21.200 --> 29:23.600
of different projects when it comes to the security side of the house.

29:23.600 --> 29:27.520
There's a link to all these different projects in the show notes, by the way, along with

29:27.520 --> 29:32.560
that, getting my kids also into computing that was their onboarding process to where

29:32.560 --> 29:37.440
we went from from going to a Maker Faire to hey, here's the older Raspberry Pi.

29:37.440 --> 29:38.800
So I'd get the brand new one.

29:38.800 --> 29:44.480
It would be implemented into my my new project and then I'd give them the old one.

29:44.480 --> 29:46.640
They'd have to learn to go plug in all the cables.

29:46.640 --> 29:51.920
I wasn't going to completely cry over if they plugged in the HDMI wrong and broke something

29:51.920 --> 29:55.920
to where it was a spare pipe, but they got real life experience with it.

29:55.920 --> 29:58.880
And then that actually helped them later on to where they could build up their full up

29:58.880 --> 30:04.560
machines and then move it, unplug it, replug it back in and know the components well.

30:04.560 --> 30:08.960
So talk to me a little bit about this SDR monitor station that's in the list.

30:08.960 --> 30:12.240
I've kind of wanted to get into software defined radio for some time.

30:12.240 --> 30:13.280
What do you do with it?

30:13.280 --> 30:17.440
So these ones are set up for different use cases on the field, like you're tracking aircraft.

30:17.440 --> 30:21.040
I'm also curious to have more of these implemented now that I'm starting with Home Assistant

30:21.040 --> 30:22.960
and using the Zigbee side of the house.

30:22.960 --> 30:28.240
When you get into SDR, you can start with the RTL SDR, which is like starts at 20 bucks.

30:28.240 --> 30:32.560
Those are my understanding as over in Europe, you would go through and use these to receive

30:32.560 --> 30:33.600
TV signals.

30:33.600 --> 30:37.200
But here in the States, you can go through and pick those same things up.

30:37.200 --> 30:40.960
Use a couple of specialized pieces of software and track aircraft.

30:40.960 --> 30:45.280
You can go through and see other things that are talking, anything from some cell phone,

30:45.280 --> 30:49.840
depending on which bandwidth that you're looking at, which antennas that you have, all the

30:49.840 --> 30:55.360
way up to you can buy a dedicated software defined radio like the HackRF, and then you

30:55.360 --> 31:00.320
have a huge area that you can go through and listen to where anything from the FM, like

31:00.320 --> 31:04.560
900 or the 90 megahertz all the way up to the six gigahertz range.

31:04.560 --> 31:07.440
For me, I'm only listening because I don't have my hand license.

31:07.440 --> 31:11.360
So I'm not going through and injecting anything that goes to the you need to go have a hand

31:11.360 --> 31:12.960
license if you want to start transmitting.

31:12.960 --> 31:19.360
So what can you do with that once you've listened to a certain frequency and got some information

31:19.360 --> 31:24.720
like I get the fact that you see the pretty graph with the nice colors and the and the

31:24.720 --> 31:28.800
shadow traces of all the stuff, but then what what do you do with it?

31:28.800 --> 31:33.520
What I want to go through and do with it is set up a tracking tour with something is moving

31:33.520 --> 31:35.040
within my yard.

31:35.040 --> 31:36.480
This is one of the ways to go through and do that.

31:36.480 --> 31:37.520
You can do that partly with Wi-Fi.

31:37.520 --> 31:39.200
You can do that with these other ones as well.

31:39.200 --> 31:40.400
Oh, cool.

31:40.400 --> 31:44.480
So making more of that map to where you can go through and find out how closely can you

31:44.480 --> 31:45.440
track this?

31:45.440 --> 31:48.800
If I've got an evil mother-in-law walking under the property, I want alarms to be going

31:48.800 --> 31:51.600
off.

31:51.600 --> 31:54.880
I mean, I was thinking, actually, you know, if you had an F-16 land in your front yard,

31:54.880 --> 31:56.160
you'd probably notice.

31:56.160 --> 31:59.440
Yeah, I mean, most likely, but I tell you what, when I've gone through and used the

31:59.440 --> 32:05.440
SDRs, when I've been like in larger metropolitan areas, like San Diego, LA and such, seeing

32:05.440 --> 32:10.000
all the flights, I was rocking those back on my old school netbook.

32:10.000 --> 32:14.400
And after like 250 flights, the thing would crash because there was so much data going

32:14.400 --> 32:18.880
on because it does not only them taking off their airspeed, their tail numbers and such,

32:18.880 --> 32:19.920
but also their destination.

32:19.920 --> 32:23.040
So you can actually see it mapped across the entire situation.

32:23.040 --> 32:24.080
So that's one step.

32:24.080 --> 32:28.960
You could also go to like starting to track Zigbee, Z-Wave and seeing the actual traffic

32:28.960 --> 32:30.000
going on there.

32:30.000 --> 32:34.320
If you have the right sensors as well, you can also then start looking at your water

32:34.320 --> 32:36.880
meters, your electrical.

32:36.880 --> 32:42.240
And there are things that we can hook into like Home Assistant now that you buy a product

32:42.240 --> 32:43.840
that goes through and does that.

32:43.840 --> 32:47.280
What I want to learn more about is actually doing it for myself versus going and just

32:47.280 --> 32:48.320
buying a product to do it.

32:48.320 --> 32:50.320
See, Chris, you've got some catching up to do, brother.

32:50.320 --> 32:52.640
I could use that to maybe measure tanks.

32:52.640 --> 32:56.800
As far as aircraft tracking goes, too, you know, it'd be great there for recording, Alex.

32:56.800 --> 33:00.720
Whenever the system could tell us when a plane is about to be overhead, we could stop recording

33:00.720 --> 33:02.000
so we don't have bad audio.

33:02.000 --> 33:06.720
What is your absolute favorite Raspberry Pi project that you've either done or want to

33:06.720 --> 33:07.520
do?

33:07.520 --> 33:09.760
My favorite Raspberry Pi project I've done.

33:09.760 --> 33:13.600
The one I'm most proud of is probably the lap deck, to be honest with you.

33:13.600 --> 33:16.640
It's one of my first ones, and it was done a long time ago.

33:16.640 --> 33:19.280
I'll have to include some pictures, update the show notes.

33:19.280 --> 33:24.800
But the one that I'm most looking forward to is doing Kubernetes on the Pi.

33:24.800 --> 33:30.640
I ended up getting three Raspberry Pi for eight gigs for that purpose, doing some more

33:30.640 --> 33:36.960
studying up on that, making sure that we've also got the external USP something drives

33:36.960 --> 33:40.960
to where your USB is going to pass through the four 400 megabit per second.

33:40.960 --> 33:45.840
If you go watch Jeff Gerling's video on it, he's got certain adapters that he recommends

33:45.840 --> 33:49.440
going down that route to make sure you're getting the full read write speed from the

33:49.440 --> 33:50.960
SSD.

33:50.960 --> 33:53.760
That guy basically is a Raspberry Pi engineer at this point.

33:53.760 --> 33:54.240
Right?

33:54.240 --> 33:55.520
Absolutely.

33:55.520 --> 33:56.560
Absolutely.

33:56.560 --> 33:58.480
So how are you going to go about running Kubernetes?

33:58.480 --> 34:03.120
We should have had you on last time with Tim, and we could have had a Kubernetes nerd down.

34:03.120 --> 34:07.760
So I'm still learning about it, because that's partly where I'm pivoting to in my day job

34:07.760 --> 34:13.360
as well with more of the what used to be StackRocks, but that's a whole nother kit and caboodle.

34:13.360 --> 34:17.840
Well, we don't talk about OpenShift very much on this show, but Josh is a colleague of mine

34:17.840 --> 34:18.640
at Red Hat.

34:18.640 --> 34:23.440
I'm a technical account manager by day, and so is Josh, but you focus on a slightly different

34:23.440 --> 34:25.440
area of technologies, right?

34:25.440 --> 34:25.840
Right.

34:25.840 --> 34:32.240
I'm more of the platform Tim, and I've gone down the Ansible side of the house as well.

34:32.240 --> 34:37.760
But there is a need for my team to be able to bring up ACS or the advanced cluster security.

34:37.760 --> 34:39.440
So that's where I'm starting to deep dive now.

34:39.440 --> 34:42.080
So with that, sure, you can run that in Kubernetes.

34:42.080 --> 34:46.160
You can run that on K3, K8, and on OpenShift.

34:46.160 --> 34:49.760
So it's like, oh, it's just a small, small little, you're just going to learn just a

34:49.760 --> 34:51.440
little bit to run this one program.

34:51.440 --> 34:52.480
This is fine.

34:52.480 --> 34:53.840
There's a line in the chat room.

34:53.840 --> 34:58.000
Be right back, convincing my team to move our OpenShift clusters to Raspberry Pis.

34:58.000 --> 35:01.840
Yeah, I mean, you could swap them out easier, that's for sure.

35:01.840 --> 35:06.960
I'm not sure that you'd have as much downtime, but the power efficiency is also something

35:06.960 --> 35:10.240
else that we should go through and talk about, because when you're talking about doing that

35:10.240 --> 35:16.000
virtual machine and having the old school pizza boxes, you can get them cheap, but sitting

35:16.000 --> 35:21.600
there at 300 watts sucking out of the wall versus a Raspberry Pi is not sucking that

35:21.600 --> 35:24.320
much or even go into like an Intel NUC instead.

35:24.320 --> 35:26.400
But it can't do as much either, dude.

35:26.400 --> 35:27.360
I agree.

35:27.360 --> 35:32.400
There are very limited use cases for it, but those ones are legitimate.

35:32.400 --> 35:36.000
And I think I touched on this with Tim last time.

35:36.000 --> 35:42.000
The main reason for doing Kubernetes at home is not to do Kubernetes at home, it's to learn

35:42.000 --> 35:46.720
Kubernetes for somewhere else, because it's so complicated and coming back to your point

35:46.720 --> 35:52.640
about your wife approval factor of, oh, you just do this and then you tickle this particular

35:52.640 --> 35:55.200
thing in that under that armpit to make it work.

35:55.200 --> 35:59.360
You know, doing Kubernetes at home is complete overkill.

35:59.360 --> 36:04.800
Yeah, just spin up yourself a Podman and at that point, you're sitting so much better.

36:04.800 --> 36:07.760
Whether you're a Podman or Docker, it's easy enough just to install.

36:07.760 --> 36:11.920
If you've got a Linux box, install Cockpit and be done with it.

36:11.920 --> 36:13.920
Install Podman and you're done.

36:13.920 --> 36:15.760
I just run everything in Perl scripts.

36:15.760 --> 36:16.960
That's the way I go.

36:17.760 --> 36:19.040
Whatever floats your boat, man.

36:20.560 --> 36:21.360
That sounds about right.

36:22.080 --> 36:26.240
We have a storage leaderboard on our self-hosted.wiki website.

36:27.360 --> 36:31.760
How many raw terabytes do you have on your LAN?

36:31.760 --> 36:36.000
Live on my LAN, I've only got about 20 terabytes.

36:36.000 --> 36:41.120
Sitting in a case to be digitized, I've got over 96 total.

36:41.120 --> 36:44.560
I've not got the Synology's all set up to be able to bring in all the previous, because

36:44.560 --> 36:48.400
I've also got to bring things from the IDE drives and all those conversions, because

36:48.400 --> 36:52.800
all of the family pictures I'm responsible for, so I'm low on the chart.

36:52.800 --> 36:53.840
I'm only 20.

36:53.840 --> 36:54.880
What do you think, Chris?

36:54.880 --> 36:57.120
Do we do we give him 20 or do we give him the W?

36:57.120 --> 37:00.400
I mean, I feel like this sets a precedent, Alex.

37:00.400 --> 37:02.800
You said live on LAN, so it's only 20 terabytes.

37:02.800 --> 37:04.640
It's not the case.

37:05.360 --> 37:06.480
You did say live on LAN.

37:06.480 --> 37:08.480
You did say live on LAN, and I think we got to be careful.

37:08.480 --> 37:09.040
I did.

37:09.040 --> 37:09.520
I did.

37:09.520 --> 37:13.040
Yeah, that's not bad, right?

37:13.040 --> 37:14.160
I mean, it's not bad.

37:14.160 --> 37:14.720
It's not bad.

37:14.720 --> 37:15.520
It's not.

37:15.520 --> 37:16.880
It's manageable right now.

37:16.880 --> 37:21.760
It's not that I am out of space, because it's not like I'm so close to filling that

37:21.760 --> 37:23.680
up or anything, because I am.

37:23.680 --> 37:27.520
But that's what I've got live.

37:27.520 --> 37:28.720
What's the file system?

37:28.720 --> 37:33.440
I'm using the Synology file system, so where I can go through and plug in those other

37:33.440 --> 37:35.200
HotSwap larger drives.

37:35.200 --> 37:36.320
Is that ButterFS, I think?

37:36.320 --> 37:38.240
I think it actually is ButterFS under the hood.

37:38.240 --> 37:39.440
I might be wrong on that.

37:39.440 --> 37:43.440
I think there was talk about switching to ButterFS, but it's like SH something something.

37:43.440 --> 37:44.000
OK.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.320
Synology Hybrid RAID, I think is what they call it.

37:46.320 --> 37:48.480
Maybe I'm thinking of the Ready NAS, anyways.

37:48.480 --> 37:49.040
That could be.

37:49.040 --> 37:54.080
You know, I was surprised, Josh, you could have connected to this episode with the Raspberry

37:54.080 --> 37:55.440
Ninja project.

37:56.160 --> 38:02.480
This is a image created by the Video Ninja developer, which is the video chat app we

38:02.480 --> 38:08.240
use, and it essentially turns a Raspberry Pi into a dedicated remote camera that does

38:08.240 --> 38:09.600
an RTMP stream.

38:09.600 --> 38:11.120
And so you'd plug this thing in.

38:11.120 --> 38:16.960
It'll use GPU acceleration on the Raspberry Pi and then connect back and stream video

38:16.960 --> 38:18.160
just kind of out of the box.

38:18.160 --> 38:19.440
It looks really neat.

38:19.440 --> 38:24.560
I will have to definitely give that a try because between Sonobus, there are so many

38:24.560 --> 38:27.840
different things that you can literally slap on a Pi, especially when you're going through

38:27.840 --> 38:31.920
and you're starting to do interviews with people remotely, doing like an away kit that

38:31.920 --> 38:37.360
you can send them through the mail, like starting off with the inexpensive Razer microphones

38:37.360 --> 38:44.000
or you step up to the better microphones with like the Samsung 2QU and then you ship a Pi

38:44.000 --> 38:48.080
to them and then you've got a better audio quality in a Pi.

38:48.080 --> 38:49.200
You just plug it in.

38:49.200 --> 38:49.760
Absolutely.

38:49.760 --> 38:50.400
I'm down with it.

38:52.480 --> 38:55.040
Linode.com slash SSH.

38:55.040 --> 38:59.600
Go there to get $100 and 60 day credit on a new account and you go there to support

38:59.600 --> 39:00.400
the show.

39:00.400 --> 39:04.720
A simple, innovative, affordable and accessible Linux cloud solution.

39:05.280 --> 39:10.160
CY developers and Linux users, the DevOps pros of the world, all of you out there.

39:10.160 --> 39:13.520
Many of our listeners have chose to use Linode.

39:13.520 --> 39:15.200
You can get up and going in moments.

39:15.200 --> 39:20.080
I love the fact that they have a slick, clean, easy to use API.

39:20.080 --> 39:22.000
You can integrate with the command line tool.

39:22.000 --> 39:25.840
You can use like a Python library if you're living that Python lifestyle.

39:25.840 --> 39:30.560
And if you just want to use the Web interface, they have an easy, intuitive cloud manager.

39:30.560 --> 39:32.320
It's simple to get things going.

39:32.320 --> 39:36.240
If you've never set up a server before or if you've been deploying them for 15 years,

39:36.800 --> 39:38.400
it's going to be just fine.

39:38.400 --> 39:43.040
They have really powerful boxes with AMD epic processors, MVB PCIe storage.

39:43.040 --> 39:46.240
And of course, they have a bunch of really great back end services, too, like a powerful

39:46.240 --> 39:48.880
DNS manager, DDoS protection.

39:48.880 --> 39:51.680
They have Kubernetes support and Terraform support.

39:51.680 --> 39:54.640
And of course, they have S3 compatible object storage.

39:55.280 --> 39:57.680
And the benchmarks are out there.

39:57.680 --> 40:03.280
Linode performs better and faster than those hyperscalers that want to lock you in to their

40:03.280 --> 40:05.200
crazy esoteric platform.

40:05.200 --> 40:09.680
And Linode has free 100% human support.

40:09.680 --> 40:15.840
No handoffs, no tears, 24-7, 365 support you can actually talk to.

40:15.840 --> 40:19.520
And because they've been doing this for nearly 19 years, they know how to build it right

40:19.520 --> 40:26.160
with 11 data centers around the world and 99.99% uptime and over a million customers.

40:26.160 --> 40:28.400
And Linode is their own ISP.

40:28.400 --> 40:30.080
So they kind of get infrastructure, too.

40:30.960 --> 40:35.040
It could also be a great alternative to some of those hyperscalers.

40:35.040 --> 40:38.640
Maybe you need a little hybrid action in your cloud, want to diversify a bit.

40:38.640 --> 40:40.080
It's a great option, too.

40:40.080 --> 40:42.160
Build a portfolio or support your business.

40:42.800 --> 40:43.680
Linode can do it all.

40:43.680 --> 40:46.400
And you can support the show while trying it out and learning something.

40:46.400 --> 40:48.480
Just get started by going to linode.com.

40:50.080 --> 40:51.520
That's how you support the show.

40:51.520 --> 40:53.120
That's how you get the 100 bucks.

40:53.120 --> 40:54.080
Linode.com.

40:58.480 --> 41:02.080
Now, Tom H writes in with some Orange Pi feedback.

41:02.080 --> 41:05.680
I've been using a mixture of non-Raspberry Pi since around 2016.

41:05.680 --> 41:09.920
I started with an Orange Pi 1 and an Orange Pi PC.

41:09.920 --> 41:13.040
They were pretty much on par with Raspberry Pi 3B at the time.

41:13.040 --> 41:16.320
I think they're about 10 or 15 pounds each on eBay.

41:17.120 --> 41:22.800
Since I have moved on to other boards like the friendly arm stuff and the Pine 64 boards,

41:22.800 --> 41:27.680
the trouble I have with the orange and friendly arms are the images you're provided by them.

41:27.680 --> 41:31.280
They're often on an old kernel and often not updated.

41:31.280 --> 41:34.080
Some manufacturers do a much better job than others.

41:34.080 --> 41:36.560
Then I found Armbian.

41:36.560 --> 41:40.880
Armbian is an amazing project and the work they do to support a lot of these

41:40.880 --> 41:44.000
air quotes non-Raspberry Pi SBCs.

41:44.560 --> 41:48.720
I also found new boards on their downloads page that I never even knew existed.

41:48.720 --> 41:51.120
I highly, highly recommend Armbian.

41:51.120 --> 41:52.320
Thanks, Tom.

41:52.320 --> 41:55.600
Josh, I'm curious what OS you prefer on the Raspberry Pis.

41:55.600 --> 41:57.600
And if you have much experience with Armbian.

41:57.600 --> 42:01.360
I have not worked with Armbian, so I can't give a comparison there.

42:01.360 --> 42:05.840
I've run pretty much every OS under the sun in the last 10 years on any Raspberry Pi I

42:05.840 --> 42:07.040
can get a hold of.

42:07.040 --> 42:11.680
And again, back for the community's sake, it's going to be Raspbian or what used to

42:11.680 --> 42:14.000
be Raspbian now is Raspberry Pi OS.

42:14.000 --> 42:19.200
Pop OS is interesting on the Raspberry Pi, but by default, if you just want to be able

42:19.200 --> 42:24.080
to throw a Raspberry Pi at somebody and get them started, just go with the default.

42:25.120 --> 42:25.840
Like a brick.

42:25.840 --> 42:29.200
Not all of us have enough pies to throw around, Josh, but yeah, I get what you're saying.

42:29.200 --> 42:34.960
So to that point, I mean, I help run a hackerspace, so I'm trying to get people into technology.

42:34.960 --> 42:39.360
If they show interest, being able to feed that by throwing them a Raspberry Pi.

42:41.040 --> 42:45.680
I've also, although I think Raspbian or Raspberry Pi OS is a good idea for that kind of scenario,

42:45.680 --> 42:50.400
but I've also found that the Ubuntu team has put a lot of hard work into making Ubuntu

42:50.400 --> 42:52.240
LTS run really well on the Pi.

42:52.240 --> 42:57.520
Armbian, though, it's great for that outside the Raspberry Pi ecosystem, like Tom here

42:57.520 --> 43:01.360
writes, you know, the orange pie and some of those other boxes where it really feels

43:01.360 --> 43:05.920
like Armbian is trying to go above and beyond to include those devices in its support.

43:05.920 --> 43:11.840
So I think it's nice to get a pro Armbian user on the air because none of us are really one.

43:12.640 --> 43:14.240
How about we move to Mads here?

43:14.240 --> 43:18.000
Mads writes in about upgrading Home Assistant databases.

43:18.000 --> 43:18.640
Thanks for the show.

43:18.640 --> 43:19.600
Gives me a lot of ideas.

43:19.600 --> 43:22.640
I've been looking into Home Assistant for a while now and I want to get started.

43:22.640 --> 43:26.880
I've decided to go to the official Docker container for my setup and I'm running each

43:26.880 --> 43:30.560
add-on as a separate container like Frigate, ESPHome, Dashboard, etc.

43:31.200 --> 43:33.680
You guys seem to talk about a lot of things related to Home Assistant.

43:33.680 --> 43:38.640
So I was wondering, have you had any issues with just using the built-in SQLite database

43:39.200 --> 43:41.760
or have you already migrated to something like MariaDB?

43:42.320 --> 43:43.280
Thanks for the info.

43:43.280 --> 43:47.200
I'll be honest, Mads, it's not something I give a great deal of thought on a daily basis.

43:47.760 --> 43:53.440
I think, therefore, that means I must be using the SQLite database, just the default one.

43:53.440 --> 43:58.240
And occasionally, if things go a bit wonky, I'll just delete the database file.

43:58.240 --> 44:02.160
I don't really need to know what my front door was doing three years ago, whether it

44:02.160 --> 44:04.160
was open or shut for three seconds or not.

44:04.160 --> 44:09.760
I mean, there are some things I think it would be nice to do data samples on like temperature

44:09.760 --> 44:11.040
trends and stuff like that.

44:11.040 --> 44:16.640
A kind of nice once in a while to look back at, but they're really not that important

44:16.640 --> 44:17.120
for me.

44:17.120 --> 44:19.920
So my answer is I stick with the default.

44:19.920 --> 44:20.800
I think I have too.

44:20.800 --> 44:25.920
I think the only thing that would maybe make me change that is if we saw significant

44:25.920 --> 44:26.480
improvements.

44:26.480 --> 44:29.360
And we have seen some pretty good improvements in some of the more recent Home Assistant

44:29.360 --> 44:34.800
releases, but like something in the energy metrics area where I'd really want to keep

44:34.800 --> 44:39.520
that data for a while might kind of nudge me to improve the database because I really

44:39.520 --> 44:44.400
think it's going to be metrics that, you know, where you're going to feel the performance

44:44.400 --> 44:44.560
issue.

44:44.560 --> 44:46.560
And otherwise, I kind of agree, Alex.

44:46.560 --> 44:47.360
But here's the thing.

44:47.360 --> 44:52.640
You can still use SQL lite, but ship out everything into influx anyway.

44:52.640 --> 44:54.560
Yeah, true, true, true, right.

44:54.560 --> 44:59.040
That is a time series database which is designed for exactly that use case.

44:59.040 --> 44:59.600
Yeah.

44:59.600 --> 45:02.640
And I'm only three weeks into running mine, so I haven't had that experience yet.

45:02.640 --> 45:04.960
So I'm also just running the built in.

45:04.960 --> 45:07.120
Yeah, I mean, mine's a couple of years old.

45:07.120 --> 45:09.040
It's not it's not really a big issue.

45:09.040 --> 45:14.320
And the Home Assistant team in the last two releases has made significant improvements

45:14.320 --> 45:15.600
in the database performance.

45:15.600 --> 45:18.480
So I think it's getting even faster with SQL lite.

45:18.480 --> 45:22.560
Marcel boosted in seven days ago with 500 sets, wishing me to get better soon.

45:22.560 --> 45:23.280
Thank you, Marcel.

45:23.280 --> 45:26.800
It must have been the reason we all wished it to not not just Marcel.

45:26.800 --> 45:27.680
Oh, OK, all right.

45:27.680 --> 45:30.960
OK, what do you think this next one is?

45:30.960 --> 45:34.480
Fun Deck Kermit, Fun Deck Kermit.

45:34.480 --> 45:39.840
Yeah, I got it with Elite Boost 1337 with a tip of the week.

45:39.840 --> 45:45.840
The Authentech, which is Auth in T I K, makes single sign in accessible for the home user.

45:45.840 --> 45:50.160
You can use LDAP, OAuth 2, maybe even integrate with reverse proxy.

45:50.160 --> 45:52.240
I've been using it for eight months without any problems.

45:52.240 --> 45:53.440
Love the show.

45:53.440 --> 45:55.040
Greetings from Sylvania.

45:55.040 --> 45:58.720
So Authentic is something I've been wanting to look at for a very long time.

45:58.720 --> 46:05.200
I started using it's one of its other competitors, which it's not really authentication, but

46:05.200 --> 46:07.200
it's a it's a project called Orphalia.

46:07.200 --> 46:12.160
Essentially, this does like a transparent authentication proxy in front of applications.

46:12.720 --> 46:17.840
But I think where Authentic makes a lot more sense is for applications that have integration

46:17.840 --> 46:22.800
with LDAP and OAuth and that kind of thing, which unfortunately is not all of them.

46:22.800 --> 46:28.640
And I think that really is Authentic's biggest issue is you have to rely on the underlying

46:28.640 --> 46:35.200
application to support some kind of, for want of a better phrase, proper authentication

46:35.200 --> 46:37.840
mechanism in order to be able to use it with Authentic.

46:38.640 --> 46:43.680
So if you just got a simple HT access authentication, for example, then you're not going to see

46:43.680 --> 46:45.120
any benefit with Authentic.

46:45.120 --> 46:48.400
But there are other apps, you know, Git T is one of them.

46:48.400 --> 46:49.440
Next Cloud.

46:49.440 --> 46:54.400
There's a few that we run right in this community that will absolutely integrate very well with

46:54.400 --> 46:54.960
Authentic.

46:55.600 --> 46:58.720
So thanks for writing in Fundek Hermit.

46:58.720 --> 46:59.680
What a what a name.

47:00.480 --> 47:02.240
I need to give it a look.

47:02.240 --> 47:07.840
I wanted to ask Josh what he does for Authentication, given he's an elite hacker DEF CON man.

47:08.640 --> 47:09.440
Good question.

47:09.440 --> 47:11.840
Yeah, wiping formatting and reinstalling, man.

47:12.640 --> 47:18.400
So when it comes to trying to build that out, even for for home use versus for a hackerspace

47:18.400 --> 47:22.400
use versus for what we're going through and doing at DEF CON, I would say are three different

47:22.400 --> 47:23.440
situations there.

47:23.440 --> 47:26.480
I've run free IPA in the past and I've been pretty happy with that.

47:26.480 --> 47:29.040
And for our hackerspace, that's worked out pretty well.

47:29.040 --> 47:34.560
The issue is when it comes to getting other people to support it, it's been pretty straightforward

47:34.560 --> 47:38.800
when we were trying to do it from like my location here in the desert down to like somebody

47:38.800 --> 47:40.080
else in San Diego.

47:40.080 --> 47:44.480
It's been interesting to make sure that we have the mirroring on that working correctly.

47:44.480 --> 47:48.720
Otherwise, honestly, if you have a Synology, why aren't you just using the one that's built

47:48.720 --> 47:49.520
into that?

47:49.520 --> 47:53.920
And honestly, for my mom and dad's business, that's what we've just gone through and done

47:53.920 --> 47:55.120
there because it's built in.

47:55.120 --> 47:56.080
Make it easy.

47:56.080 --> 47:56.880
Make it easy.

47:56.880 --> 47:59.920
I think that is absolutely the right advice.

47:59.920 --> 48:04.800
So Kars Peelend writes in with 3690 sats.

48:04.800 --> 48:06.480
High signal, great show.

48:06.480 --> 48:07.280
Thanks.

48:07.280 --> 48:08.800
I think he liked last episode.

48:08.800 --> 48:12.800
High signal is like a good compliment in the in the Boostergram world.

48:12.800 --> 48:14.320
That's that's rare.

48:14.320 --> 48:15.120
Yeah.

48:15.120 --> 48:19.360
The Golden Drake and boosted in seven days ago with a row of ducks says it was a great

48:19.360 --> 48:20.880
show with Techno Tim.

48:20.880 --> 48:22.080
Yeah, absolutely was.

48:22.080 --> 48:25.200
I had a blast and I really hope we didn't bore you all too much talking.

48:25.200 --> 48:27.360
Nonstop about Kubernetes for an hour.

48:27.360 --> 48:28.880
But I had a great time.

48:28.880 --> 48:32.720
I found it educational and I don't really even have a use case for Kubernetes myself.

48:32.720 --> 48:37.120
But it's still something I like to keep a, you know, a kind of a at least not an ear

48:37.120 --> 48:41.040
on, but kind of a some at least an informed background on, I suppose.

48:41.040 --> 48:42.880
And the conversation was perfect for that.

48:42.880 --> 48:46.800
Now, Turquoise Fox writes in with a controversial.

48:46.800 --> 48:49.680
Is this controversial piece of feedback?

48:49.680 --> 48:54.000
I mean, I don't probably not in our audience because it's a little bit different.

48:54.000 --> 48:57.120
Probably not in our audience because there's probably others that feel this way.

48:57.120 --> 49:01.680
I would imagine this is an issue we've come up with before a turquoise technically boosted

49:01.680 --> 49:03.360
in twice for this one.

49:03.360 --> 49:07.280
So I combined them to six thousand two hundred sixty nine cents.

49:07.280 --> 49:08.880
But some discord hate here.

49:08.880 --> 49:09.880
Boo discord.

49:09.880 --> 49:10.880
Yay.

49:10.880 --> 49:11.880
Matrix.

49:11.880 --> 49:12.880
When will self-hosted be on Matrix?

49:12.880 --> 49:16.280
And we get this sometimes we know we've explained it before on the show.

49:16.280 --> 49:22.080
But sometimes there we try to walk this balance between the perfect being the enemy of the

49:22.080 --> 49:25.360
good enough and discord took off like a weed.

49:25.360 --> 49:29.560
There's a really great community over there and there's more good than there is negative

49:29.560 --> 49:30.560
as a result.

49:30.560 --> 49:36.160
And because really the network effect, it has been very beneficial to just have a strong

49:36.160 --> 49:38.160
discord presence for the show, too.

49:38.160 --> 49:39.560
It's helped the show a lot.

49:39.560 --> 49:41.100
Things like this London meetup, right?

49:41.100 --> 49:43.960
They are birthed in that discord.

49:43.960 --> 49:49.320
But there is two Matrix self-hosted rooms are not crazy busy, but they are available

49:49.320 --> 49:53.760
on the Jupiter Broadcasting Matrix for those of you because like Turquoise here doesn't

49:53.760 --> 49:58.440
basically doesn't want to put a phone number in or put information in the discord service.

49:58.440 --> 49:59.920
And there's going to be people out there that feel that way.

49:59.920 --> 50:01.440
I totally understand.

50:01.440 --> 50:06.620
So I've got an interesting take on this because if not this community, what community, right?

50:06.620 --> 50:08.980
Because this would be the one to be doing it.

50:08.980 --> 50:13.480
So with our hackerspace, with our folks that we work with at Defcon, it's like, hey, we

50:13.480 --> 50:15.640
want this to be more private, more secure.

50:15.640 --> 50:19.840
But the barrier to entry is so much higher, let alone just trying to get our own family

50:19.840 --> 50:21.360
members onto it.

50:21.360 --> 50:23.200
That's where it gets hard.

50:23.200 --> 50:28.040
And until we make it easier for folks to onboard with that, it's much like I think that there

50:28.040 --> 50:34.880
are better signal or messaging, secure messaging, like signal versus wire.

50:34.880 --> 50:38.100
But the problem is, what's your onboarding process?

50:38.100 --> 50:42.300
If it's not seamless, if it's not easy, you're not going to get as many people on.

50:42.300 --> 50:46.720
So depending on your paranoia, depending on you actually having to do threat modeling

50:46.720 --> 50:51.120
for yourself and your community, you're going to land in different areas.

50:51.120 --> 50:55.600
And I could see too, like if this was a podcast that was doing, you know, war crime journalism

50:55.600 --> 50:58.640
in Ukraine, maybe we wouldn't want to be on Discord, right?

50:58.640 --> 51:01.280
Maybe we'd want to be using really secure encrypted communications.

51:01.280 --> 51:05.320
But at the end of the day, this is a podcast and everything we produce is ultimately public

51:05.320 --> 51:06.320
too.

51:06.320 --> 51:11.280
We've almost got 5000 people in the Discord now, and I really don't think we would have

51:11.280 --> 51:14.960
so many people in a Matrix server.

51:14.960 --> 51:21.920
I may well be wrong, but my feeling is that the friction to joining a new Discord server

51:21.920 --> 51:26.240
for those that are already using Discord, which at this point is a lot of people that

51:26.240 --> 51:28.040
listen to this podcast, right?

51:28.040 --> 51:32.120
The cross section Venn diagram is quite large.

51:32.120 --> 51:37.200
The friction to joining yet another Discord server is quite low compared to signing up

51:37.200 --> 51:41.140
for Matrix and then having the right client and then waiting whilst Chris and Wes add

51:41.140 --> 51:47.800
more RAM to the box and, and, and, and, and, and so for me, I stand by what we said originally,

51:47.800 --> 51:54.900
that the mission of the chat server, in this case, it's a Discord server, is not necessarily

51:54.900 --> 52:01.040
to be the ultimate in self hosting dog food, for want of a better phrase.

52:01.040 --> 52:06.280
It's to further the mission by allowing people to collaborate and ask questions in a friction

52:06.280 --> 52:07.280
free way.

52:07.280 --> 52:11.560
Yeah, it's sort of like we stream on PeerTube now, but we're also streaming on YouTube and

52:11.560 --> 52:14.920
Twitch because we want to be where the audience is at.

52:14.920 --> 52:17.280
And just like with Matrix, we have a self hosted solution.

52:17.280 --> 52:18.960
That is something we self host.

52:18.960 --> 52:20.880
I'm long on Matrix, right?

52:20.880 --> 52:24.120
I feel like given another five years, it's just going to continue to grow.

52:24.120 --> 52:29.480
When we first launched our Matrix server, we had 200 users a year ago, you know, today

52:29.480 --> 52:35.680
we have like 2500 users and our largest room is like 1300 people, but it's not as big as

52:35.680 --> 52:39.360
the self hosted Discord because the Discord network effect is so much larger.

52:39.360 --> 52:42.560
But I am very happy with that kind of growth for a year.

52:42.560 --> 52:46.440
And I imagine if that continues, at some point, Matrix will be a real big part of what we

52:46.440 --> 52:47.440
do.

52:47.440 --> 52:51.640
And it is already for me, it's already the it's out of all of the different platforms

52:51.640 --> 52:56.000
that I'm available on, Matrix is the one that I hang out on the most.

52:56.000 --> 52:59.120
I do check those self hosted Matrix rooms from time to time, if you want to jump in

52:59.120 --> 53:00.480
there Turquoise.

53:00.480 --> 53:04.280
One day, one day, we'll make the switch just just not yet.

53:04.280 --> 53:10.560
And I think it's going to come soon because we had some Red Hatters jump from Red Hat

53:10.560 --> 53:17.360
over to the Element community and seen some interviews online from Eric the IT guy with

53:17.360 --> 53:20.000
what they're doing and how they're onboarding it easier.

53:20.000 --> 53:21.780
They're making those bridges happen.

53:21.780 --> 53:24.820
If you throw a couple bucks at them a month, it's making it a lot easier to me.

53:24.820 --> 53:28.800
It made me go and say, huh, it might be time to go relook at that now.

53:28.800 --> 53:29.960
That's true.

53:29.960 --> 53:33.880
Red Hat does is getting a bigger and bigger Matrix present to not just not just the team

53:33.880 --> 53:39.080
people over at the element stuff, but like Red Hat itself, I am in I'm in a couple of

53:39.080 --> 53:42.120
Red Hat rooms actually on Matrix.

53:42.120 --> 53:44.360
So I I may be in rooms that you guys are not in.

53:44.360 --> 53:45.360
How weird is that?

53:45.360 --> 53:49.680
I'm not surprised.

53:49.680 --> 53:53.960
We do have one last boost that came into the show from Seamoon or maybe Simon, perhaps

53:53.960 --> 53:54.960
one day ago.

53:54.960 --> 53:55.960
Five hundred stats.

53:55.960 --> 53:58.500
Hey, guys, I recently learned about the Fountain FM app.

53:58.500 --> 54:00.080
That's one of the new podcasting apps.

54:00.080 --> 54:01.080
So here are some stats from you.

54:01.080 --> 54:02.840
I got a question, though.

54:02.840 --> 54:03.840
And this is a good question.

54:03.840 --> 54:04.920
I thought a lot about this.

54:04.920 --> 54:09.720
He writes, when you got the Bitwarden one time authentication code token that you can

54:09.720 --> 54:13.320
put in when you're when you have the tokens of Bitwarden, he says, isn't that sort of

54:13.320 --> 54:19.320
against the idea of a two factor authentication to store that code right next to the password?

54:19.320 --> 54:20.440
Greetings from Germany.

54:20.440 --> 54:21.440
Keep up the great work.

54:21.440 --> 54:22.440
Simon.

54:22.440 --> 54:23.440
Why?

54:23.440 --> 54:24.440
Yes.

54:24.440 --> 54:25.440
Yes, it is.

54:25.440 --> 54:29.120
But I refer you to an argument I made with in the last episode with Tim.

54:29.120 --> 54:33.400
It's sometimes about just not being the tallest nail, right?

54:33.400 --> 54:38.880
If you have a two factor turned on on your Amazon account, anybody that's got your password,

54:38.880 --> 54:42.880
assuming it's not your Bitwarden password, of course, is going to look at that account

54:42.880 --> 54:46.040
and go, can't be bothered, move on to the next one that doesn't have it.

54:46.040 --> 54:47.040
And that's it.

54:47.040 --> 54:49.520
That really that's all two factors good for, in my opinion.

54:49.520 --> 54:54.180
And so for me, the convenience of having it in Bitwarden and be just a paste away as part

54:54.180 --> 54:59.840
of the keystrokes that I autofill with that risk profile for me is worth it.

54:59.840 --> 55:06.060
Now there are a couple of places that I remain phone two factor authentication, so GitHub

55:06.060 --> 55:07.060
is one of them.

55:07.060 --> 55:09.020
My next cloud is another one.

55:09.020 --> 55:14.860
There's a couple that I keep out of Bitwarden, Bitwarden itself being a great example.

55:14.860 --> 55:19.580
Most of the time I keep things in Bitwarden just because it's easier, which is not the

55:19.580 --> 55:21.420
best security answer.

55:21.420 --> 55:22.420
But that's the reality.

55:22.420 --> 55:23.600
I mean, I like your answer, though.

55:23.600 --> 55:24.600
I think it makes sense.

55:24.600 --> 55:26.120
What is the threat model exactly, though?

55:26.120 --> 55:28.440
I mean, it seems like it's a physical one, right?

55:28.440 --> 55:32.900
Isn't it mostly a physical threat model with that situation, which, you know, I think that's

55:32.900 --> 55:35.940
a real balancing act there that you got to decide what you're going to protect against.

55:35.940 --> 55:40.000
And if you're in a scenario where somebody could physically take advantage of that, they

55:40.000 --> 55:42.740
may also have access to your phone.

55:42.740 --> 55:43.740
Physical access, man.

55:43.740 --> 55:46.760
Once you have physical access and if your kid can then go through and buy stuff from

55:46.760 --> 55:51.700
Amazon or from whatever else, do you want that all in one device and one app?

55:51.700 --> 55:52.700
But I think that's true.

55:52.700 --> 55:56.860
I think Alex made a perfect point, though, that he did his risk model to figure out that's

55:56.860 --> 56:01.140
not his use case for other people in other situations that might not be.

56:01.140 --> 56:03.800
Wait till his daughter's older.

56:03.800 --> 56:09.020
But my Bitwarden authenticates with my face on my phone or my thumb on my MacBook.

56:09.020 --> 56:14.340
Like, unless she's chopping my thumb off when I'm sleeping, which I'd probably notice, she's

56:14.340 --> 56:18.540
not going to unlock my Bitwarden unless she literally knows the password, which one day

56:18.540 --> 56:20.420
she will, I'm sure.

56:20.420 --> 56:25.140
If you'd like to send a boost into the show, go get a new podcast app at newpodcastapps.com.

56:25.140 --> 56:28.380
Send your wallet up with a few sats, they're on sale, so it's a great time to boost the

56:28.380 --> 56:30.180
dip and send it in.

56:30.180 --> 56:34.060
What is Bitcoin with the price check today?

56:34.060 --> 56:39.820
Not that I'm looking, but $20,016.19, I don't know why you'd ask that.

56:39.820 --> 56:43.480
It's above 20, I suppose that's considered a W these days.

56:43.480 --> 56:47.300
Let's be honest, not for long, but don't get me into the doom and gloom of the economy

56:47.300 --> 56:49.340
that's coming.

56:49.340 --> 56:52.500
It's a great time to boost the show, I'll just put it that way.

56:52.500 --> 56:53.920
It's a long-term investment, right?

56:53.920 --> 56:54.920
Just hodl.

56:54.920 --> 56:58.020
Put your boosts to work by getting them cheap today.

56:58.020 --> 57:00.540
Hodl, hodl, hodl indeed.

57:00.540 --> 57:03.600
And also, just a major thank you to our members.

57:03.600 --> 57:07.540
Our site reliability engineers make the show possible, and as a thank you, we give you

57:07.540 --> 57:10.940
an ad-free feed of the show, so no ads.

57:10.940 --> 57:15.940
And we are working, still doing the plumbing on live versions, so we'll have a live feed

57:15.940 --> 57:16.940
as well.

57:16.940 --> 57:20.900
You'll have both options as a member, and I'm just kind of in the early stages with

57:20.900 --> 57:21.900
that.

57:21.900 --> 57:25.660
But if you are an RSS generator wizard, reach out.

57:25.660 --> 57:31.060
I could use your help on that at selfhosted.show slash SRE if you want to sign up.

57:31.060 --> 57:34.820
And then you can also support all the shows on the network, become a member for all the

57:34.820 --> 57:39.300
shows, get all the special features, all ad-free at Jupiter.party.

57:39.300 --> 57:44.380
And one of those nice features is a self-hosted bonus post-show, which will be coming up in

57:44.380 --> 57:45.380
just a little bit.

57:45.380 --> 57:48.380
You're going to talk about yet another golf I've purchased, I think.

57:48.380 --> 57:49.380
I can't wait.

57:49.380 --> 57:54.140
I've specifically made Alex wait to tell me, so that way I can hear about it in the post-show.

57:54.140 --> 57:57.580
I bought number seven.

57:57.580 --> 57:58.580
It's becoming a problem.

57:58.580 --> 58:01.860
We're going to be having an intervention.

58:01.860 --> 58:07.580
Now I really do want to see all of your smiling faces in London on August the 5th, meetup.com

58:07.580 --> 58:10.560
slash Jupiter broadcasting for all the details.

58:10.560 --> 58:14.620
And on the day itself, we'll probably be posting in there as well, if you're not quite sure

58:14.620 --> 58:17.660
exactly where to find us, keep an eye on that meetup page.

58:17.660 --> 58:19.980
That's where the source of truth is for that.

58:19.980 --> 58:23.080
To write into the show, it's self-hosted dot show slash contact.

58:23.080 --> 58:24.780
That's the place to go to get in touch with us.

58:24.780 --> 58:27.340
And you can find me on Twitter at ironic badger.

58:27.340 --> 58:28.380
How about you, Josh?

58:28.380 --> 58:31.280
So you can find me at JSKAR underscore Hawk.

58:31.280 --> 58:35.820
So that's J S K A R underscore H A W K.

58:35.820 --> 58:36.820
Thank you very much for joining us.

58:36.820 --> 58:37.820
It was a blast.

58:37.820 --> 58:38.820
Absolutely.

58:38.820 --> 58:39.820
My pleasure.

58:39.820 --> 58:40.820
Thanks for having me on, guys.

58:40.820 --> 58:41.820
It was a lot of fun.

58:41.820 --> 58:44.820
We'll put a link to your GitHub for all the projects for the Raspberry Pi, as well as

58:44.820 --> 58:46.220
your social in the show notes.

58:46.220 --> 58:49.700
You can find the podcast on Twitter at self-hosted show.

58:49.700 --> 58:51.240
I'm at Chris Ellis.

58:51.240 --> 58:54.300
And don't forget, we're doing the show live on Wednesdays now.

58:54.300 --> 58:57.820
Every other Wednesday, you can get your local time and date at Jupiter broadcasting dot

58:57.820 --> 58:59.180
com slash counter.

58:59.180 --> 59:04.560
And you can catch video replays of the show at Jupiter dot tube, as also you can catch

59:04.560 --> 59:05.700
the live stream there.

59:05.700 --> 59:08.100
It's just like one place to remember Jupiter dot tube.

59:08.100 --> 59:12.860
Whilst I'm in England, that might might go on hiatus for a week or two, but we'll see.

59:12.860 --> 59:13.860
We'll see.

59:13.860 --> 59:16.180
Yeah, there's always there's always trickiness when you're traveling.

59:16.180 --> 59:18.020
So we'll have to we'll have to be flexible.

59:18.020 --> 59:21.380
One of the places I'm staying, the primary Internet is Starlink.

59:21.380 --> 59:24.380
So who knows if it's cloudy?

59:24.380 --> 59:28.940
It depends on if there's any obstructions and if Dish turns on their 12 gigahertz interference

59:28.940 --> 59:29.940
stuff.

59:29.940 --> 59:30.940
Right.

59:30.940 --> 59:31.940
Right.

59:31.940 --> 59:32.940
So thanks for listening, everybody.

59:32.940 --> 59:47.820
You can find us at self hosted dot show slash 74.
