00:00.000 --> 00:02.580
Hello fellow self-hosters, Alex here.

00:02.580 --> 00:05.800
We've got a super exciting episode up our sleeves today.

00:05.800 --> 00:07.160
This is one I've been waiting to share with you

00:07.160 --> 00:08.720
for a little while.

00:08.720 --> 00:10.940
It's a prerecorded interview with Elan,

00:10.940 --> 00:14.120
the CTO and co-founder of Plex.

00:14.120 --> 00:15.880
Chris and I got the chance to talk with Elan

00:15.880 --> 00:20.240
during the JB Sprint in August from his Hawaii home base.

00:20.240 --> 00:22.180
We cover lots of ground in this interview with him

00:22.180 --> 00:25.040
on topics ranging from electric cars

00:25.040 --> 00:28.440
to the motivations behind starting Plex in the first place

00:28.440 --> 00:30.980
and where the project is heading in the future.

00:30.980 --> 00:32.800
Be sure to stick around though,

00:32.800 --> 00:34.320
as we have some exciting news

00:34.320 --> 00:36.200
about the ghost blogging platforms

00:36.200 --> 00:37.800
new release to share as well.

00:37.800 --> 00:41.120
So sit back, relax and enjoy our interview

00:41.120 --> 00:44.060
with Elan Finegold from Plex.

00:44.960 --> 00:48.560
You guys know this, Alex and I are both big Plex users

00:48.560 --> 00:51.440
and I challenged Alex before the show started

00:51.440 --> 00:56.260
to attempt an elevator pitch explanation of what Plex is.

00:56.260 --> 00:57.560
Okay, here we go.

00:57.560 --> 01:01.560
Plex organizes audio and visual media

01:01.560 --> 01:03.080
from your personal media libraries

01:03.080 --> 01:06.760
and allows you to stream it to any playback device.

01:06.760 --> 01:09.520
And for me, Plex has been a huge gateway drug.

01:09.520 --> 01:12.440
I had a Synology NAS back in the day

01:12.440 --> 01:15.640
and now I have a huge server in my basement

01:15.640 --> 01:18.840
with 100 plus terabytes that has 20 cores

01:18.840 --> 01:20.920
and hundreds of gigabytes of RAM.

01:20.920 --> 01:24.640
And I honestly owe an awful lot of that stuff to Plex.

01:25.560 --> 01:27.360
One of the other cool things that Plex does

01:27.360 --> 01:30.960
is that it does on the fly media transcoding.

01:30.960 --> 01:32.840
And why that's important

01:32.840 --> 01:36.720
is lots of different media devices support different codecs.

01:36.720 --> 01:38.520
You know, a web browser might not be able to support

01:38.520 --> 01:40.460
the same codecs as an iPhone, for example,

01:40.460 --> 01:42.720
or an Android TV box.

01:42.720 --> 01:45.880
And the single most magical feature of Plex

01:45.880 --> 01:47.900
is that if I press play on a device,

01:47.900 --> 01:50.240
there's no configuration required.

01:50.240 --> 01:53.080
It will just start playing my media as if by magic

01:53.080 --> 01:56.000
and transcode it from whatever source using FFmpeg

01:56.000 --> 01:58.080
to whatever target device.

01:58.080 --> 02:00.000
It just works and it's wonderful.

02:00.000 --> 02:00.840
That was pretty good.

02:00.840 --> 02:01.680
What'd you think, Elon?

02:01.680 --> 02:02.520
I'm impressed.

02:02.520 --> 02:06.320
Are you looking for a position as our PR spokesperson?

02:06.320 --> 02:07.160
I love your accent.

02:07.160 --> 02:08.320
I love the way you could describe that.

02:08.320 --> 02:09.160
It's brilliant.

02:09.160 --> 02:11.500
Well, I got out of a speeding ticket with this accent

02:11.500 --> 02:12.800
a couple of weeks ago, so.

02:12.800 --> 02:15.540
Now don't be sniping my co-host.

02:15.540 --> 02:17.200
I just got this thing off the ground.

02:17.200 --> 02:18.840
Damn it.

02:18.840 --> 02:20.920
Well, thank you for being here.

02:20.920 --> 02:22.160
We thought maybe we'd like to start

02:22.160 --> 02:23.400
with a few personal questions.

02:23.400 --> 02:26.480
Our crowd is a lot of a do-yourself hosted kind

02:26.480 --> 02:30.280
of group, and they love to know what people's setups are.

02:30.280 --> 02:32.680
And so we would like to ask, at what

02:32.680 --> 02:36.200
you consider to be home base, roughly how many computers

02:36.200 --> 02:37.840
would you say are in the home?

02:37.840 --> 02:39.680
Yeah, sure.

02:39.680 --> 02:42.640
I mean, I work personally off a Mac desktop.

02:42.640 --> 02:45.040
Right now it's a Mac Mini.

02:45.040 --> 02:46.920
I used to have the Trashcan Mac Pro,

02:46.920 --> 02:49.000
but that just got super long in the tooth,

02:49.000 --> 02:53.000
so I moved to one of the new Mac Minis.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.920
And then my wife and I both have MacBooks,

02:55.920 --> 02:57.640
because I really love the fact that they're

02:57.640 --> 03:00.280
super light and portable, and I don't do a lot of coding

03:00.280 --> 03:02.760
on that, mostly on the desktop with a bigger screen.

03:02.760 --> 03:06.600
And then as far as the media box,

03:06.600 --> 03:12.800
I have a 3U Norco box with a bunch of hard drives in it,

03:12.800 --> 03:16.940
probably around 100 terabytes.

03:16.940 --> 03:21.400
And that's running ZFS on top of Ubuntu,

03:21.400 --> 03:24.000
which is sort of what most of us at Kleks

03:24.000 --> 03:25.520
have gravitated towards.

03:25.520 --> 03:29.280
We really like ZFS, or ZFS, if you will,

03:29.280 --> 03:31.360
although there are several people that use UnRAID,

03:31.360 --> 03:34.520
but I tend to use that ZFS.

03:34.520 --> 03:39.600
And it was an older system, but I just upgraded recently.

03:39.600 --> 03:41.480
I guess Facebook and a bunch of other companies

03:41.480 --> 03:44.640
dumped a bunch of Xenons on them that they

03:44.640 --> 03:45.720
were using in data centers.

03:45.720 --> 03:52.200
So I picked up a couple of 8-core, 16-thread Xenons

03:52.200 --> 03:53.240
for like $100 each.

03:53.240 --> 03:57.960
So now it's got a total of 16 cores, 32 threads for $200,

03:57.960 --> 03:59.400
which is kind of unbeatable.

03:59.400 --> 04:00.000
Nice.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.520
No kidding.

04:01.520 --> 04:04.280
Now, I kind of got to know with all of that kind of storage

04:04.280 --> 04:08.520
and stuff, have you invested in a pretty fast local network?

04:08.520 --> 04:09.440
Well, yeah.

04:09.440 --> 04:13.960
When we got the place, we wired it for Cat 6.

04:13.960 --> 04:17.560
But sadly, there's Gigabit running

04:17.560 --> 04:19.160
to all the important places.

04:19.160 --> 04:21.600
And I experimented probably about a year ago

04:21.600 --> 04:25.120
with trying to go 10 gig just between the Mac Mini, which,

04:25.120 --> 04:28.200
as you know, it's ethernet ports for its 10 gig.

04:28.200 --> 04:30.800
And so I added one of these cheap $100 cards

04:30.800 --> 04:33.880
to the Linux system that also supported 10 gig.

04:33.880 --> 04:35.520
And it kind of worked for a few days.

04:35.520 --> 04:38.440
And I would transfer an MKB file back and forth and be like,

04:38.440 --> 04:40.200
oh my god, 300 megabytes per second.

04:40.200 --> 04:40.920
That's incredible.

04:40.920 --> 04:44.640
And it just stopped working on the Linux side after a while.

04:44.640 --> 04:46.640
And I would get like, wouldn't be able to connect.

04:46.640 --> 04:47.560
And I'd have to reboot.

04:47.560 --> 04:49.440
And I just was like, OK, fine.

04:49.440 --> 04:52.360
I'd prefer stable 1 gig over unstable 10 gig.

04:52.360 --> 04:53.320
Right, yeah.

04:53.320 --> 04:54.960
I mean, you must have been around

04:54.960 --> 04:57.960
in a time where even 1 gigabit would be just

04:57.960 --> 04:59.480
a remarkable transfer rate.

04:59.480 --> 05:00.480
Oh, yeah, incredible.

05:00.480 --> 05:02.720
I mean, the thing that actually blows my mind nowadays

05:02.720 --> 05:05.720
is that with a good Wi-Fi connection,

05:05.720 --> 05:08.600
you can get up there in at least the hundreds

05:08.600 --> 05:09.820
of megabits per second.

05:09.820 --> 05:11.240
That is kind of mind blowing.

05:11.240 --> 05:14.360
I don't think wired has actually really kept up

05:14.360 --> 05:17.160
with the accelerating speed of wireless.

05:17.160 --> 05:20.960
Thank goodness, because it probably makes Plex much more

05:20.960 --> 05:23.040
of a real option for people in homes

05:23.040 --> 05:25.720
that don't have physical wiring.

05:25.720 --> 05:26.240
It is true.

05:26.240 --> 05:29.240
I mean, honestly, I think a technology

05:29.240 --> 05:31.960
that people don't give enough credit to is Powerline,

05:31.960 --> 05:34.240
which is also something that's progressed super fast.

05:34.240 --> 05:36.440
I had a thing in my living room that I wanted

05:36.440 --> 05:39.400
to also speed up with wired.

05:39.400 --> 05:43.360
And I used Powerline, and I was able to get about a gigabit,

05:43.360 --> 05:47.560
I think, just over Powerline, which is, again, kind of crazy.

05:47.560 --> 05:48.720
That used to be super flaky.

05:48.720 --> 05:51.360
It used to 10 megabits, 5 megabits,

05:51.360 --> 05:54.400
but that's gotten really good, too.

05:54.400 --> 05:56.600
Speaking of power, I was doing a bit of research

05:56.600 --> 05:58.280
before the interview.

05:58.280 --> 05:59.960
How do you like your Tesla Model 3?

05:59.960 --> 06:01.160
That's so impressive.

06:01.160 --> 06:04.960
I'm like looking around for a spy cam now.

06:04.960 --> 06:07.480
There was some post on Medium that I found.

06:07.480 --> 06:09.320
Yeah, I love it.

06:09.320 --> 06:13.680
It's, to me, it's like the future of cars.

06:13.680 --> 06:17.760
And I know that's a term that is thrown around fairly lightly.

06:17.760 --> 06:20.920
But I guess the feeling I have with it,

06:20.920 --> 06:25.080
as it gets software updates and new features over the air,

06:25.080 --> 06:29.520
is I feel like I'm living through the revolution

06:29.520 --> 06:31.520
on the way to self-driving cars.

06:31.520 --> 06:35.280
And I'm not as bullish.

06:35.280 --> 06:39.160
The company is very bullish about full self-driving,

06:39.160 --> 06:40.920
end of the year, except for regulations.

06:40.920 --> 06:44.240
And historically, that's always been a lot harder.

06:44.240 --> 06:49.000
But it's incredibly cool to sort of live through, in theory,

06:49.000 --> 06:51.680
have the hardware and just need the software

06:51.680 --> 06:55.000
and see the software take incremental steps.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.920
Hey, all of a sudden, it recognizes stop signs.

06:56.920 --> 06:59.720
Hey, all of a sudden, it knows how to stop at a stop sign.

06:59.720 --> 07:03.800
As a nerd geek kind of a guy, that

07:03.800 --> 07:06.240
is an incredibly unique experience in a car.

07:06.240 --> 07:07.400
Usually, you get a car.

07:07.400 --> 07:09.640
Nothing gets updated ever.

07:09.640 --> 07:11.440
You sell it and get a new car.

07:11.440 --> 07:13.240
Maybe you get an upgrade.

07:13.240 --> 07:16.000
So it's really, it feels like a living piece of technology,

07:16.000 --> 07:17.280
essentially.

07:17.280 --> 07:19.480
Did you ever have an iPod back in the day?

07:19.480 --> 07:22.680
I remember that Apple had a similar kind of,

07:22.680 --> 07:24.800
we're used to devices that never see updates.

07:24.800 --> 07:26.560
We never get new features.

07:26.560 --> 07:29.720
And I remember having that same kind of journey of discovery

07:29.720 --> 07:31.800
with my first iPod.

07:31.800 --> 07:35.320
I unfortunately came to iPod late.

07:35.320 --> 07:37.960
Instead, I had one of those creative Zune players,

07:37.960 --> 07:39.960
which was just utter crap.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.120
Oh, yeah.

07:41.120 --> 07:43.400
No one had figured out back then that really all you

07:43.400 --> 07:45.240
needed to do was a simple hierarchy of artist, album,

07:45.240 --> 07:45.760
track.

07:45.760 --> 07:48.720
No one had figured that out until Apple came along

07:48.720 --> 07:50.680
with the iPod, and everyone was like, oh, yeah,

07:50.680 --> 07:51.640
artist, album, track.

07:51.640 --> 07:54.280
That makes total sense.

07:54.280 --> 07:57.520
But yeah, I know Apple's always been really good about updates.

07:57.520 --> 08:00.320
Talking of user interfaces and stuff,

08:00.320 --> 08:03.160
the iPod revolutionized things with a click wheel.

08:03.160 --> 08:04.960
I test drove a Model 3 a few weeks ago,

08:04.960 --> 08:06.760
which is why when I saw it, I brought it up,

08:06.760 --> 08:09.560
because I just wanted to get another person's input

08:09.560 --> 08:11.240
into why I should buy one.

08:11.240 --> 08:13.480
How are you finding the zero buttons thing?

08:13.480 --> 08:16.120
You should definitely buy one.

08:16.120 --> 08:19.520
So I counted, because before the Model 3, I had a leaf.

08:19.520 --> 08:20.880
So I've been electric for a while.

08:20.880 --> 08:23.480
I had two successive leaf leases,

08:23.480 --> 08:24.880
say that a few times fast.

08:24.880 --> 08:28.480
And I counted the number of buttons on my leaf,

08:28.480 --> 08:30.280
and it was something ridiculous.

08:30.280 --> 08:31.360
I'm not exaggerating here.

08:31.360 --> 08:34.040
I think it was something like 60 or 70 buttons

08:34.040 --> 08:37.360
in that front hemisphere compared to the Tesla, which

08:37.360 --> 08:39.760
was like 10 or something like that.

08:39.760 --> 08:44.040
But I have slightly mixed feelings.

08:44.040 --> 08:46.040
For the most part, it works amazingly well.

08:46.040 --> 08:49.120
And the control surfaces that they

08:49.120 --> 08:53.800
do have with the D-pad things on your thumbs

08:53.800 --> 08:57.880
work super well for various aspects.

08:57.880 --> 08:59.800
But there are a couple of things,

08:59.800 --> 09:01.960
like opening garage doors.

09:01.960 --> 09:06.880
And if you have to make adjustments to things,

09:06.880 --> 09:09.440
having to look at the screen and hit a tap target

09:09.440 --> 09:12.000
while you're driving at 50 or 60 miles an hour

09:12.000 --> 09:16.880
is unquestionably less safe than feeling

09:16.880 --> 09:19.600
for a mechanical switch or knowing where it is.

09:19.600 --> 09:22.960
So that's a bit.

09:22.960 --> 09:25.760
But that's essentially just an aspect of, again,

09:25.760 --> 09:27.880
the hardware is a little bit ahead of the software.

09:27.880 --> 09:29.680
Eventually, we probably won't need the wheel.

09:29.680 --> 09:31.560
And eventually, it'll be smart enough

09:31.560 --> 09:35.160
that I don't have to change the wiper speed.

09:35.160 --> 09:37.960
So the hope is that the software will eventually catch up

09:37.960 --> 09:39.840
and just make it less and less likely for you

09:39.840 --> 09:42.600
to have to touch anything.

09:42.600 --> 09:44.160
Yeah, if you're not the one driving,

09:44.160 --> 09:46.120
I guess it doesn't matter so much.

09:46.120 --> 09:47.720
So anyway, let's shift gears a little bit

09:47.720 --> 09:51.240
and get into some of the backstory behind Plex.

09:51.240 --> 09:53.760
It's been around a little while now.

09:53.760 --> 09:56.200
I forget what year it was founded.

09:56.200 --> 09:58.720
Technically, I think we're coming up on the exact 10 year

09:58.720 --> 10:01.040
anniversary of the incorporation.

10:01.040 --> 10:03.640
But we were around for a bit before that,

10:03.640 --> 10:05.400
before we were a real company.

10:05.400 --> 10:06.360
Congratulations.

10:06.360 --> 10:07.360
Yeah, thanks.

10:07.360 --> 10:08.120
Thanks so much.

10:08.120 --> 10:11.160
And I'm wondering, what motivated you to create Plex

10:11.160 --> 10:12.160
in the first place?

10:12.160 --> 10:15.680
I mean, essentially, the story is very simple.

10:15.680 --> 10:19.200
My wife left me alone near Christmas.

10:19.200 --> 10:20.480
I was bored.

10:20.480 --> 10:23.200
And I just wanted to play around with something.

10:23.200 --> 10:27.360
And I had never turned out well.

10:27.360 --> 10:31.360
I'd been running the Xbox Media Center on a hacked Xbox.

10:31.360 --> 10:34.240
And we were just at that cusp where you were starting

10:34.240 --> 10:39.040
to see 720p HD video appear.

10:39.040 --> 10:43.120
And the Xbox was clearly struggling at this.

10:43.120 --> 10:44.680
And the Mac Mini was out.

10:44.680 --> 10:47.720
And that just seemed like an incredibly great form factor

10:47.720 --> 10:53.360
for a tenth of the size of one of those giant Xbox things

10:53.360 --> 10:55.520
and super good horsepower.

10:55.520 --> 10:57.440
So it just seemed like an obvious target.

10:57.440 --> 11:00.400
And the XB1C team had already been working

11:00.400 --> 11:01.760
on porting it to Linux.

11:01.760 --> 11:04.800
And as you know, the underpinning Unix, same thing.

11:04.800 --> 11:06.680
I was like, eh, how hard could this possibly be?

11:06.680 --> 11:08.040
Let me give it a try.

11:08.040 --> 11:09.240
Famous last words.

11:09.240 --> 11:12.280
Yeah, it wasn't very easy.

11:12.280 --> 11:14.440
But that's how it all started, essentially.

11:14.440 --> 11:16.200
It was scratching an itch, which is probably

11:16.200 --> 11:18.000
how most projects start.

11:18.000 --> 11:18.720
Yeah.

11:18.720 --> 11:21.600
Now, I guess the 10 year mark is kind of a good opportunity

11:21.600 --> 11:22.960
to look back.

11:22.960 --> 11:25.560
If you had a time machine, would you go back and slip

11:25.560 --> 11:27.080
one bit of information to past self

11:27.080 --> 11:29.120
to do something differently?

11:29.120 --> 11:32.000
I mean, there's definitely things

11:32.000 --> 11:36.920
we've done along the road that I would have done differently.

11:36.920 --> 11:40.680
But I don't know if I can summarize it

11:40.680 --> 11:41.680
down to a single thing.

11:41.680 --> 11:45.000
Maybe like don't DDOS yourself as much.

11:45.000 --> 11:48.120
Do you mean your servers or yourself personally?

11:48.120 --> 11:51.760
Like our servers DDOSing our services.

11:51.760 --> 11:54.600
Because when you have millions of machines out there,

11:54.600 --> 11:56.760
and you're like, OK, let's flip on this new thing,

11:56.760 --> 11:59.840
and they all start using it, you can melt yourself down.

11:59.840 --> 12:04.480
But no, I think there's definitely lots of lessons

12:04.480 --> 12:06.360
learned along the way.

12:06.360 --> 12:09.960
And one thing that has always been super important to me,

12:09.960 --> 12:12.960
as well as I know my co-founder and a lot of the other people

12:12.960 --> 12:16.560
at Plex, is we really do try to stay

12:16.560 --> 12:17.960
in contact with the community.

12:17.960 --> 12:20.160
Like I've just been in the forums replying to posts.

12:20.160 --> 12:23.640
I love that contact with users.

12:23.640 --> 12:26.280
And I think that having that contact,

12:26.280 --> 12:29.680
keeping that surface area, the surface contact

12:29.680 --> 12:33.520
area between yourself and your user base

12:33.520 --> 12:34.720
helps you on the right track.

12:34.720 --> 12:36.480
They will tell you very vocally when

12:36.480 --> 12:37.800
you're doing something wrong.

12:37.800 --> 12:40.120
And again, you might not always agree,

12:40.120 --> 12:41.580
and you might agree to disagree, or you

12:41.580 --> 12:43.080
might take a slightly different turn,

12:43.080 --> 12:46.320
or it's a quote, what I think is actually not a Steve Jobs

12:46.320 --> 12:48.600
quote, like you might give your customers what they want,

12:48.600 --> 12:49.840
not what they ask for.

12:49.840 --> 12:53.720
But in general, I think you ignore your customers,

12:53.720 --> 12:57.240
and you lose that surface contact area

12:57.240 --> 12:59.120
with your customers at your own risk.

12:59.120 --> 13:01.880
That's, I think, one of the biggest lessons.

13:01.880 --> 13:04.680
It's a tight line, because there's also the enthusiast

13:04.680 --> 13:06.560
trap, where you get stuck always trying

13:06.560 --> 13:09.580
to serve your most vocal, most die-hard fans,

13:09.580 --> 13:12.120
and it's harder to appeal to a wider audience.

13:12.120 --> 13:14.120
That is entirely true.

13:14.120 --> 13:18.280
And I note that I've watched Plex over the years expand

13:18.280 --> 13:20.440
into new integrations with podcasts

13:20.440 --> 13:21.720
and other online services.

13:21.720 --> 13:25.620
Have you seen pushback from the original die-hard Plex

13:25.620 --> 13:28.120
community on those new services?

13:28.120 --> 13:29.240
How's that been?

13:29.240 --> 13:30.240
Absolutely.

13:30.240 --> 13:31.040
Yeah, absolutely.

13:31.040 --> 13:34.880
I mean, I think we used a joke, like if you'd

13:34.880 --> 13:37.120
release an iOS update, the Android people would get angry.

13:37.120 --> 13:38.720
If you'd release an Android update,

13:38.720 --> 13:40.000
the iOS people would get angry.

13:40.000 --> 13:43.240
So I think Plex, one of the metaphors

13:43.240 --> 13:44.840
that we use internally to describe it

13:44.840 --> 13:46.520
is it's essentially a fractal, right?

13:46.520 --> 13:50.320
You can zoom in and maybe you're interested in Plex for music,

13:50.320 --> 13:53.600
so you're very zoomed into that part of our platform.

13:53.600 --> 13:55.240
Maybe you use Plex for movies, and you're

13:55.240 --> 13:56.440
very zoomed into that.

13:56.440 --> 14:00.640
And in a sense, you're protective of the area

14:00.640 --> 14:04.040
that you are the most interested in, most vested in.

14:04.040 --> 14:07.220
And of course, that goes for what app you use,

14:07.220 --> 14:09.960
what streaming device you use or don't use.

14:09.960 --> 14:14.200
And I think there is also just a sense of cheese being moved.

14:14.200 --> 14:17.000
People are used to things a certain way.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.920
Our intent with podcasts, for example,

14:19.920 --> 14:22.280
was to give people the opportunity

14:22.280 --> 14:25.200
to consume this content alongside their other content

14:25.200 --> 14:27.880
and maybe even relate it in a way so that, hey,

14:27.880 --> 14:31.720
if you have Bob Dylan in your library

14:31.720 --> 14:35.040
and you have Plex everywhere, why shouldn't we say,

14:35.040 --> 14:37.600
hey, there's a really good podcast

14:37.600 --> 14:39.120
where they're interviewing Bob Dylan.

14:39.120 --> 14:41.880
So if you like Bob Dylan, you have Bob Dylan in your library,

14:41.880 --> 14:43.960
maybe you want to check out this podcast.

14:43.960 --> 14:46.000
And we thought that would be super cool,

14:46.000 --> 14:50.040
and people would like that sort of integration.

14:50.040 --> 14:54.240
We haven't gotten along to that specifically yet,

14:54.240 --> 14:56.280
but that's along the lines of where we're thinking.

14:56.280 --> 14:58.400
You can see it with title.

14:58.400 --> 15:00.240
There's been also pushback against title.

15:00.240 --> 15:01.280
Some people don't like it.

15:01.280 --> 15:04.280
But I think the people that have music libraries that

15:04.280 --> 15:07.600
want to expand their musical horizons, to me,

15:07.600 --> 15:11.600
and I count myself in that, to me,

15:11.600 --> 15:13.820
I think the title integration is awesome.

15:13.820 --> 15:18.400
I have purchased more new music in the last year

15:18.400 --> 15:20.920
than I have in the previous five years

15:20.920 --> 15:24.040
because it's such a cool way to discover new music.

15:24.040 --> 15:27.240
I mean, I know there's some detail here,

15:27.240 --> 15:29.840
but we show you new album releases from artists

15:29.840 --> 15:31.960
that are in your library.

15:31.960 --> 15:35.880
And we let you play radios where we introduce new stuff

15:35.880 --> 15:38.200
that you haven't heard from title.

15:38.200 --> 15:40.080
So there's all these kind of cool little integration

15:40.080 --> 15:40.640
features.

15:40.640 --> 15:43.100
So I think if you kind of zoom out and you're like,

15:43.100 --> 15:45.400
why flex during title, it might seem kind of weird.

15:45.400 --> 15:48.080
But if you are actually invested into the music ecosystem

15:48.080 --> 15:49.640
and you're a music lover, I think

15:49.640 --> 15:52.880
you'll find there's no other solution that

15:52.880 --> 15:55.160
melds the two so seamlessly.

15:55.160 --> 15:56.440
I like seeing it as a podcaster.

15:56.440 --> 15:58.160
I like seeing those podcasts in there.

15:58.160 --> 15:59.720
And I noticed recently that they seem

15:59.720 --> 16:02.660
to be matching more to what my movie library has.

16:02.660 --> 16:04.520
And I think that's a pretty clever strategy too.

16:04.520 --> 16:07.680
So I say, as a podcaster, keep it up.

16:07.680 --> 16:10.360
But it's a bit self-serving.

16:10.360 --> 16:12.040
Yeah, no, I mean, it's a big, it's

16:12.040 --> 16:14.720
a giant web of media, right?

16:14.720 --> 16:16.880
These things are very interrelated.

16:16.880 --> 16:18.480
There's podcasts that relate to movies.

16:18.480 --> 16:20.240
There's podcasts that relate to TV shows.

16:20.240 --> 16:22.760
There's all sorts of relationships

16:22.760 --> 16:24.480
between different types of media.

16:24.480 --> 16:27.200
And it's nice to have fresh content without me having

16:27.200 --> 16:29.760
to do the work sometimes.

16:29.760 --> 16:30.440
Exactly.

16:30.440 --> 16:33.400
And that's honestly, that's one of the other things

16:33.400 --> 16:36.840
that we like about it is the barrier to entry to flex

16:36.840 --> 16:39.960
historically has been, hey, go get a server.

16:39.960 --> 16:43.320
Hey, go rip a bunch of CDs or DVDs or whatever.

16:43.320 --> 16:44.120
That's hard, right?

16:44.120 --> 16:44.720
You need a computer.

16:44.720 --> 16:45.400
That's always on.

16:45.400 --> 16:47.120
It's clearly not for everyone.

16:47.120 --> 16:51.000
But with a podcast, you don't need a server.

16:51.000 --> 16:54.320
So that makes it, hopefully, lowers the barrier to entry.

16:54.320 --> 16:57.600
So that's also a good thing.

16:57.600 --> 17:02.120
So I wanted to take a minute to just walk back a little bit.

17:02.120 --> 17:07.600
The feedback from the users, I think sometimes the subreddit

17:07.600 --> 17:10.480
in particular can be a little bit toxic.

17:10.480 --> 17:12.840
I noticed one of your posts earlier had, yeah,

17:12.840 --> 17:15.880
I've turned off notifications for obvious reasons.

17:15.880 --> 17:18.480
I can only imagine how many times you get tagged a day.

17:18.480 --> 17:19.880
Just on Reddit.

17:19.880 --> 17:21.240
But there was one piece of feedback

17:21.240 --> 17:23.280
one of the users put, which I just

17:23.280 --> 17:26.800
wanted to get your response to really,

17:26.800 --> 17:29.280
which is most annoying to me is the fact

17:29.280 --> 17:34.640
that many bugs have gotten worse or have been unacknowledged.

17:34.640 --> 17:37.200
Yet Plex does nothing but introduce new features

17:37.200 --> 17:40.080
that I think the majority of users don't care about.

17:40.080 --> 17:43.120
I would rather no new features and a stable app instead

17:43.120 --> 17:47.360
of this feature waterfall.

17:47.360 --> 17:50.720
That seems pretty harsh to me, having been a diehard Plex user

17:50.720 --> 17:53.360
myself for at least, I don't know,

17:53.360 --> 17:55.960
must be five plus years at this point.

17:55.960 --> 17:57.640
I've seen a few bugs and a few issues.

17:57.640 --> 17:59.120
But honestly, I don't see anything

17:59.120 --> 18:01.120
that makes me feel as strongly as this guy does.

18:01.120 --> 18:05.080
I just wanted to get your take on that kind of we

18:05.080 --> 18:07.720
would rather a stable app than no new features.

18:07.720 --> 18:10.880
I mean, I think generally building products,

18:10.880 --> 18:12.560
building software specifically, there's

18:12.560 --> 18:15.040
always a trade off between new features and bugs.

18:15.040 --> 18:16.640
Software is never bug free.

18:16.640 --> 18:18.000
There's always going to be bugs.

18:18.000 --> 18:21.760
And marketing and there's always a push for new features.

18:21.760 --> 18:24.920
So there's always going to be a trade off there.

18:24.920 --> 18:28.840
But I think the trade off that we make,

18:28.840 --> 18:30.840
it's not like all of our engineers

18:30.840 --> 18:31.960
are working on new features.

18:31.960 --> 18:33.400
It's not like all of our engineers

18:33.400 --> 18:35.200
are working on fixing bugs.

18:35.200 --> 18:40.480
There's always a ratio of some doing new work,

18:40.480 --> 18:42.200
some doing bug work.

18:42.200 --> 18:50.400
So it's tricky because there are certainly

18:50.400 --> 18:53.360
bugs that have gone unaddressed for longer

18:53.360 --> 18:55.360
than I would personally like.

18:55.360 --> 18:59.200
There are definitely times when I wish

18:59.200 --> 19:02.320
we were faster at fixing bugs.

19:02.320 --> 19:04.920
But it's always the trade off.

19:04.920 --> 19:10.440
And we definitely do try to address bugs.

19:10.440 --> 19:14.240
I think one of the things that the user is referencing

19:14.240 --> 19:16.560
and one of the things I've seen mentioned elsewhere

19:16.560 --> 19:19.760
is they would love it if we at least acknowledged bugs.

19:19.760 --> 19:21.760
And that's something that, again, we've

19:21.760 --> 19:22.880
tried to be better at.

19:22.880 --> 19:24.400
We try to respond in the forums.

19:24.400 --> 19:27.400
I've encouraged our engineers to spend more time in there

19:27.400 --> 19:31.120
and our support staff to say, hey, we're working on this.

19:31.120 --> 19:32.240
Yep, known issue.

19:32.240 --> 19:33.760
Yep, we're working on it.

19:33.760 --> 19:36.200
But we're sort of outnumbered.

19:36.200 --> 19:40.480
And there is clearly times when we don't.

19:40.480 --> 19:42.920
We aren't able to acknowledge every single thing.

19:42.920 --> 19:46.120
And there's a lot of balls in the air.

19:46.120 --> 19:49.200
Well, as a user, I must say I've noticed over the last nine

19:49.200 --> 19:52.200
months or so that things have gotten significantly better

19:52.200 --> 19:54.840
on the messaging front.

19:54.840 --> 19:56.760
The stability of the apps appears

19:56.760 --> 19:58.160
to have improved quite a bit.

19:58.160 --> 20:00.240
And the only thing that I've noticed

20:00.240 --> 20:03.040
that's changed quite a lot has been the UI.

20:03.040 --> 20:04.840
There's been quite a few different revisions

20:04.840 --> 20:05.760
of the UI this year.

20:05.760 --> 20:08.240
And I wondered, given you just rolled out a new version

20:08.240 --> 20:10.680
a couple of weeks ago, is this the final revision

20:10.680 --> 20:12.680
we're going to see for a while?

20:12.680 --> 20:14.320
Yeah, I mean, that's a perfect example,

20:14.320 --> 20:18.720
I think, of the feedback loop and listening to users

20:18.720 --> 20:21.040
because we were heading down.

20:21.040 --> 20:23.400
I think time flies when you're having fun.

20:23.400 --> 20:27.480
But last year, we were heading a particular direction

20:27.480 --> 20:32.520
with the UI, and we got feedback on it.

20:32.520 --> 20:34.480
And it really kind of missed the mark

20:34.480 --> 20:36.400
for what we were intending.

20:36.400 --> 20:39.280
And so we went back to the drawing board.

20:39.280 --> 20:44.440
And that's when we came up with the Uno, the UI

20:44.440 --> 20:46.800
that we've termed called Uno.

20:46.800 --> 20:51.320
And the response to that has been overwhelmingly positive.

20:51.320 --> 20:53.720
And so what you've seen over the last few months

20:53.720 --> 20:59.160
is essentially just a coalescing of all of our interfaces

20:59.160 --> 21:01.200
to go in that direction because it seems to be one

21:01.200 --> 21:03.000
that our users like and appreciate

21:03.000 --> 21:05.320
the customizability of the home screen

21:05.320 --> 21:07.720
and all that kind of stuff.

21:07.720 --> 21:09.080
So essentially, what you're seeing

21:09.080 --> 21:10.760
is just us converging on this.

21:10.760 --> 21:14.520
We feel that this UI will last us for a while.

21:14.520 --> 21:15.840
It's fairly scalable.

21:15.840 --> 21:18.560
It works in multiple different scenarios,

21:18.560 --> 21:20.320
from all I want to see on my home screen

21:20.320 --> 21:23.600
is podcast and title to, hey, I have libraries

21:23.600 --> 21:26.160
from five different servers I want to have on my home screen

21:26.160 --> 21:28.120
and treat just as importantly.

21:28.120 --> 21:29.560
I think it's the best UI I've ever

21:29.560 --> 21:31.000
seen rolled out from the project.

21:31.000 --> 21:35.720
And I can only imagine the incredible constraints

21:35.720 --> 21:37.720
that there must be in designing for all

21:37.720 --> 21:40.320
of the different types of set-top TV appliance

21:40.320 --> 21:44.160
boxes from Apple TV down to the sticks of all different kinds

21:44.160 --> 21:46.080
and random Android devices.

21:46.080 --> 21:48.720
It must be a pretty large part of the business.

21:48.720 --> 21:50.000
Yeah, and definitely.

21:50.000 --> 21:55.400
I mean, as the tech guy, I really

21:55.400 --> 21:58.000
like it when we can reuse code as much as possible

21:58.000 --> 21:59.440
all over the place.

21:59.440 --> 22:00.640
But you're absolutely right.

22:00.640 --> 22:04.880
I mean, there's a wide variety of platforms that we hit.

22:04.880 --> 22:07.960
The Shield is a very powerful Android platform.

22:07.960 --> 22:10.120
There are way less powerful Android platforms.

22:10.120 --> 22:14.240
There's the smart TVs that have very,

22:14.240 --> 22:16.040
we call them potato devices sometimes,

22:16.040 --> 22:19.320
just because they're not super fast.

22:19.320 --> 22:21.000
That's pretty good.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
Do you mind if I borrow that?

22:23.000 --> 22:24.800
That's a good call.

22:24.800 --> 22:26.400
No, and in fact, just as I said it,

22:26.400 --> 22:27.800
I'm like, I wonder why potato?

22:27.800 --> 22:28.840
Spud gun?

22:28.840 --> 22:29.360
Potato?

22:29.360 --> 22:32.360
I guess potatoes are slow, but no vegetables move.

22:32.360 --> 22:34.520
So I don't know why we're singling out a potato.

22:34.520 --> 22:36.160
There's always that science experiment

22:36.160 --> 22:38.760
from elementary school where somebody powers

22:38.760 --> 22:42.160
something with a potato, so it's just enough power.

22:42.160 --> 22:42.720
Thank you.

22:42.720 --> 22:44.280
That makes perfect sense now.

22:44.280 --> 22:45.960
Yeah, that's MacGyver.

22:45.960 --> 22:47.040
Yeah, exactly.

22:47.040 --> 22:47.600
Yeah.

22:47.600 --> 22:49.880
Well, I mean, I can only imagine the constraints just

22:49.880 --> 22:53.080
in shipping that software to on time to end users.

22:53.080 --> 22:54.960
We're having to go through different vendors

22:54.960 --> 22:57.400
and different app stores, and all of that

22:57.400 --> 22:59.640
must be massively complex.

22:59.640 --> 23:00.440
Yeah.

23:00.440 --> 23:01.800
It's very hard.

23:01.800 --> 23:03.960
Yeah, I mean, there's definitely not

23:03.960 --> 23:05.360
an insignificant fraction of time

23:05.360 --> 23:09.600
spent on the packaging and different release formats

23:09.600 --> 23:12.000
and processes and all of that, for sure.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
I'm just still thinking about the 10-year mark.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.800
It's pretty significant to be joining us right around then.

23:16.800 --> 23:20.000
And I'd kind of like to know about some future plans.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.640
There must be some stuff in the pipeline near term,

23:22.640 --> 23:24.680
anything that you can share yet?

23:24.680 --> 23:27.320
One of the things that's near and dear to my own heart

23:27.320 --> 23:32.000
is the big upgrade of the music library.

23:32.000 --> 23:36.680
As you may be aware of, we've been moving metadata sources,

23:36.680 --> 23:40.640
and we've kind of revamped and upgraded the music

23:40.640 --> 23:43.480
system and a bunch of our associated systems

23:43.480 --> 23:45.960
in the cloud, and we think it's really awesome.

23:45.960 --> 23:48.680
So we continue to make huge advances

23:48.680 --> 23:55.280
in the personal media space for that media type,

23:55.280 --> 23:57.760
and we're also looking to do some other cool stuff

23:57.760 --> 23:59.160
with movies and TV shows that you're

23:59.160 --> 24:01.240
going to see here shortly.

24:01.240 --> 24:05.600
So I think there's kind of like the trinity of investments.

24:05.600 --> 24:11.880
We definitely are working on making the personal media

24:11.880 --> 24:15.120
features even more interesting.

24:15.120 --> 24:22.200
And we're continuing to look to make the player space for us.

24:22.200 --> 24:24.040
Like you kind of mentioned at the beginning,

24:24.040 --> 24:28.000
you said very nicely about how you can play anything anywhere,

24:28.000 --> 24:29.880
and that's kind of been our mantra for a while.

24:29.880 --> 24:32.040
But we've been investing kind of behind the scenes,

24:32.040 --> 24:33.620
and it might not be completely visible,

24:33.620 --> 24:36.000
but in the actual player stacks of our platform.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.840
So Android TV a couple of years ago

24:37.840 --> 24:40.080
got the Exo player-based thing, which

24:40.080 --> 24:42.720
is an FFmpeg-based player, and then on Apple TV and iOS,

24:42.720 --> 24:45.400
we got the MPV-based player, which, again,

24:45.400 --> 24:47.100
sounds like gobbledygook, which is probably

24:47.100 --> 24:48.360
why it's sort of hidden.

24:48.360 --> 24:49.320
But essentially, we've

24:49.320 --> 24:52.200
No, our audience understands, and boy, do we appreciate it.

24:52.200 --> 24:52.720
Yeah.

24:52.720 --> 24:53.080
Awesome.

24:53.080 --> 24:54.380
Well, I love your audience then.

24:54.380 --> 24:57.320
Yeah, so that's been a key for us,

24:57.320 --> 24:59.720
because we want the media to play well.

24:59.720 --> 25:01.960
We want the media to play fast.

25:01.960 --> 25:04.000
The more you can direct play, the more energy efficient

25:04.000 --> 25:06.560
it is, the faster you can seek, the faster

25:06.560 --> 25:08.320
playback time you have.

25:08.320 --> 25:10.260
So we've really been investing heavily

25:10.260 --> 25:14.280
in that core tech of player upgrades,

25:14.280 --> 25:16.640
and we take it very seriously.

25:16.640 --> 25:19.880
And so that's sort of another part,

25:19.880 --> 25:26.080
because our platform playback is an incredibly huge part.

25:26.080 --> 25:28.040
And then in the third part is kind

25:28.040 --> 25:31.620
of where you've seen us play with podcasts and title

25:31.620 --> 25:33.160
and stuff like that, which is we happen

25:33.160 --> 25:35.840
to think that it's really cool to have access

25:35.840 --> 25:39.080
to an even larger catalog of content, some of which

25:39.080 --> 25:41.680
might not come from your own computer.

25:41.680 --> 25:43.920
And we certainly don't want to force it on people.

25:43.920 --> 25:45.800
People can turn it off if they don't want it.

25:45.800 --> 25:50.840
But we think there's some really exciting opportunities

25:50.840 --> 25:54.480
for remixing your own content, augmenting,

25:54.480 --> 25:55.440
we call it internally.

25:55.440 --> 25:59.240
Augmentation is kind of what the term we use.

25:59.240 --> 26:01.560
And that's kind of what you're seeing with title.

26:01.560 --> 26:03.100
And I'll just give another example.

26:03.100 --> 26:08.200
If I go into Bob Dylan and I've got my title account set up,

26:08.200 --> 26:10.920
if I have missing albums, if I'm missing any albums by Bob

26:10.920 --> 26:13.480
Dylan, they'll show up right alongside the albums

26:13.480 --> 26:17.280
that I own, one click to play them.

26:17.280 --> 26:19.120
That's pretty cool.

26:19.120 --> 26:24.920
So that's some of the innovation space we're playing in.

26:24.920 --> 26:25.920
Yeah, that's really nice.

26:25.920 --> 26:29.440
And it augments cloud services like Spotify

26:29.440 --> 26:31.720
quite nicely to have something like that

26:31.720 --> 26:34.160
available in high quality and everything.

26:34.160 --> 26:37.560
I wanted to touch on the playback improvements

26:37.560 --> 26:38.920
that you talked about.

26:38.920 --> 26:42.240
This is a feature request from me, really.

26:42.240 --> 26:44.840
I have a server that has about 10 or 12 people that

26:44.840 --> 26:45.920
use it regularly.

26:45.920 --> 26:48.920
And one thing I've noticed, I have gigabit upload here.

26:48.920 --> 26:52.920
So I'm not constrained with my pipe going out.

26:52.920 --> 26:59.280
I would love to be able to set an on-the-fly transcoding

26:59.280 --> 27:02.240
preference, like prefer direct play over transcode

27:02.240 --> 27:04.840
or something like that instead of the current default.

27:04.840 --> 27:05.720
A server side?

27:05.720 --> 27:09.720
Yeah, server side, yeah, like push it out to the clients.

27:09.720 --> 27:13.000
I mean, I guess wouldn't that, I mean,

27:13.000 --> 27:18.040
that would assume that your clients have the downstream

27:18.040 --> 27:18.720
bandwidth, right?

27:18.720 --> 27:20.560
Like there might be, let's say if someone

27:20.560 --> 27:22.960
has a five megabit download, they're

27:22.960 --> 27:27.000
not going to be able to direct play a 20 megabit.

27:27.000 --> 27:28.000
That's true.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.960
I would prefer to be able to push a direct play.

27:30.960 --> 27:32.040
I take your point, though.

27:32.040 --> 27:36.240
I mean, you're trying to aim at the lowest common denominator,

27:36.240 --> 27:39.360
which is going to be probably the client's downlink

27:39.360 --> 27:41.800
bandwidth or my upload bandwidth, which

27:41.800 --> 27:43.520
I can control right now.

27:43.520 --> 27:45.920
Or heaven forbid, somebody on mobile.

27:45.920 --> 27:46.400
Yeah.

27:46.400 --> 27:48.780
Yeah, I was going to say, like if someone's on an iPhone,

27:48.780 --> 27:51.080
they probably don't have 20 megabits either.

27:51.080 --> 27:53.760
I mean, what you've touched on there is some of the complexity

27:53.760 --> 27:56.760
that we were trying to, or that we

27:56.760 --> 27:59.960
have been trying to address with the streaming brain

27:59.960 --> 28:04.280
project that we have, where the server is trying

28:04.280 --> 28:07.240
to be very cognizant of all of those facts.

28:07.240 --> 28:09.280
How much upload bandwidth do I have?

28:09.280 --> 28:11.720
What's the bandwidth of file?

28:11.720 --> 28:14.120
How loaded is the CPU right now?

28:14.120 --> 28:16.700
How much bandwidth is the client?

28:16.700 --> 28:18.500
How fast is the client able to transfer?

28:18.500 --> 28:20.880
And sort of magically making adjustments.

28:20.880 --> 28:26.920
So you'll see cases where if you have, let's say,

28:26.920 --> 28:30.040
20 megabit upstream, you'll start with a transcode,

28:30.040 --> 28:31.280
and you'll use up 15 megabits.

28:31.280 --> 28:34.080
And then when a new client comes on,

28:34.080 --> 28:36.160
literally they would only have five megabits left.

28:36.160 --> 28:38.960
But what we do is we downshift so they can share more evenly

28:38.960 --> 28:39.640
the bandwidth.

28:39.640 --> 28:42.360
So there is a lot of magic going on behind the scenes

28:42.360 --> 28:44.520
right now to try to make it automatic.

28:44.520 --> 28:48.800
But that magic is essentially in the transcode,

28:48.800 --> 28:51.800
because that's where you have the volume knob, essentially.

28:51.800 --> 28:54.400
Direct play, there's no real volume knob on that.

28:54.400 --> 28:58.320
I actually am very impressed by how intelligent

28:58.320 --> 28:59.320
the entire back end is.

28:59.320 --> 29:01.840
So this kind of collection of tools

29:01.840 --> 29:04.800
is called the streaming brain, did you say?

29:04.800 --> 29:07.240
Yeah, I'm not exactly sure why we decided to call it that.

29:07.240 --> 29:08.640
But that just was kind of what we ended up

29:08.640 --> 29:10.360
calling it internally, the streaming brain.

29:10.360 --> 29:15.080
And amusing side note, when we'd have meetings around it,

29:15.080 --> 29:18.480
there was one guy who, one of our project manager guys,

29:18.480 --> 29:19.920
who loved to use emoji.

29:19.920 --> 29:22.200
And he was trying to come up with emoji representation

29:22.200 --> 29:23.000
of streaming brain.

29:23.000 --> 29:26.480
And the best thing he could do is, while streaming,

29:26.480 --> 29:28.000
he used the shower emoji.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.240
And then brain, he used the robot.

29:30.240 --> 29:32.120
So it was like robot in a shower.

29:32.120 --> 29:33.960
And if you go to our online store,

29:33.960 --> 29:36.600
I think we actually sell a t-shirt that's

29:36.600 --> 29:38.720
a robot taking a shower.

29:38.720 --> 29:41.400
Yeah, it's like the robot from, oh,

29:41.400 --> 29:44.640
what was that old sci-fi movie with Hitchhiker's Guide?

29:44.640 --> 29:47.000
No, no, the one with Leslie Nielsen in it.

29:47.000 --> 29:48.240
Oh, it's a classic.

29:48.240 --> 29:50.520
I can't believe I'm blanking on it.

29:50.520 --> 29:54.520
It's in my Plex library, so I really should know.

29:54.520 --> 29:55.720
Forbidden planet.

29:55.720 --> 29:56.640
Yes.

29:56.640 --> 29:57.160
Yes.

29:57.160 --> 29:59.720
I'll put a link to the blog post that has a picture of it.

29:59.720 --> 30:00.480
It's so good.

30:00.480 --> 30:01.800
We'll have that in the show notes.

30:01.800 --> 30:03.640
Yeah, that's our illustrator, Craig.

30:03.640 --> 30:06.720
He is a brilliant, super talented guy.

30:06.720 --> 30:09.440
And you'll see a lot of his work on our t-shirts.

30:09.440 --> 30:10.480
That's awesome.

30:10.480 --> 30:14.800
We always joke about pivoting to clothing.

30:14.800 --> 30:17.280
You know, I'm saying, if it all looked like that,

30:17.280 --> 30:20.080
that actually would be probably a lucrative side business,

30:20.080 --> 30:21.640
a little Plex side hustle.

30:21.640 --> 30:23.120
Move over, threadless.

30:23.120 --> 30:23.620
Yeah.

30:23.620 --> 30:26.000
Yeah.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
I thoroughly enjoyed that, and I hope

30:28.000 --> 30:30.200
we get an opportunity to chat with him in the future

30:30.200 --> 30:31.800
and just sort of check in on things.

30:31.800 --> 30:34.880
But you did promise we'd talk about Ghost.

30:34.880 --> 30:38.360
Ghost is a blogging platform that has exploded

30:38.360 --> 30:40.240
over the last few years.

30:40.240 --> 30:45.160
Last week, 4,286 new sites were made with Ghost.

30:45.160 --> 30:46.400
And that's just last week.

30:46.400 --> 30:47.960
And they have a brand new release.

30:47.960 --> 30:50.280
I ain't afraid of no Ghost.

30:50.280 --> 30:52.840
I can't believe you.

30:52.840 --> 30:54.200
I suppose it had to be done.

30:54.200 --> 30:55.840
It's one week away from Halloween.

30:55.840 --> 30:57.560
You've got to embrace my new country.

30:57.560 --> 30:58.120
That's right.

30:58.120 --> 30:59.280
Good for you.

30:59.280 --> 31:00.240
Yeah, OK, fair enough.

31:00.240 --> 31:02.160
We are talking about Ghost near Halloween,

31:02.160 --> 31:03.880
and somebody had to put it in there.

31:03.880 --> 31:05.880
So you're a big fan, though.

31:05.880 --> 31:08.320
I have daydreamed about using Ghost,

31:08.320 --> 31:12.400
but never had enough reason to move off of WordPress,

31:12.400 --> 31:16.040
another favorite of the open source community.

31:16.040 --> 31:16.880
But you, you did.

31:16.880 --> 31:19.000
You just have no WordPress for me.

31:19.000 --> 31:21.720
Well, it was when Linux server was in the early days,

31:21.720 --> 31:23.880
and I was doing a lot of blogging over there.

31:23.880 --> 31:28.120
And it's just, I don't know, like, WordPress is fine,

31:28.120 --> 31:31.280
but I always felt like it was an extremely big, heavyweight

31:31.280 --> 31:34.840
application for what I wanted to achieve, which was just

31:34.840 --> 31:36.720
write some text with a couple of images

31:36.720 --> 31:39.480
and a couple of categories and tags and that kind of thing.

31:39.480 --> 31:40.960
I don't need any of the CMS.

31:40.960 --> 31:43.760
I don't need any of the e-commerce type stuff.

31:43.760 --> 31:46.240
And Ghost fitted that bill really, really well.

31:46.240 --> 31:50.280
It had a beautiful typography, because fonts do matter.

31:50.280 --> 31:54.480
And the writer's interface, as well, is super clean.

31:54.480 --> 31:56.920
So what do you consider notable about the new, what is it,

31:56.920 --> 31:58.880
3.0 release they just announced?

31:58.880 --> 31:59.920
There's a few things.

31:59.920 --> 32:05.240
So firstly is they are looking to give creators

32:05.240 --> 32:09.440
a way to receive money without relying

32:09.440 --> 32:12.720
on a third party middleman like Patreon or something like that.

32:12.720 --> 32:14.680
And what's particularly interesting about this

32:14.680 --> 32:16.600
is it doesn't require the Ghost company

32:16.600 --> 32:18.320
to remain in business either.

32:18.320 --> 32:21.040
So there is a direct way for readers of a blog

32:21.040 --> 32:25.440
to contribute to the writer of a blog, which is really nice.

32:25.440 --> 32:27.160
The payments all go through Stripe.

32:27.160 --> 32:29.040
So so long as Stripe stay in business,

32:29.040 --> 32:32.240
then this mechanism will continue to work just fine.

32:32.240 --> 32:34.040
There's another new feature in the release,

32:34.040 --> 32:36.800
which changes the way in which the sites are generated.

32:36.800 --> 32:40.000
And there's a lot more support now for static site generation

32:40.000 --> 32:43.880
frameworks for things like Gatsby, Next.js, et cetera,

32:43.880 --> 32:44.400
et cetera.

32:44.400 --> 32:48.200
There's dozens of dozens of changes there around that stuff.

32:48.200 --> 32:50.280
And if you want proof of the pudding,

32:50.280 --> 32:55.240
the entire ghost.org website is actually a Gatsby.js app

32:55.240 --> 32:57.240
hosted on top of Ghost.

32:57.240 --> 32:59.640
The other change that I'm super excited about

32:59.640 --> 33:02.800
is the way in which themes used to be developed.

33:02.800 --> 33:06.960
So before this release, you had to upload themes as a zip file,

33:06.960 --> 33:10.440
apply the change, and then pray that it worked.

33:10.440 --> 33:13.160
Well, now with a combination of the JAMstack work

33:13.160 --> 33:15.920
that they have, you can actually combine that with GitHub

33:15.920 --> 33:19.000
Actions and then sync custom ghost themes

33:19.000 --> 33:20.840
to your live production site with each commit

33:20.840 --> 33:21.840
you make to Git.

33:21.840 --> 33:23.880
All right, I might give that a go in the future.

33:23.880 --> 33:25.120
You've tempted me, Alex.

33:25.120 --> 33:27.840
And so if you do, it's really easy to get started

33:27.840 --> 33:29.320
with a Docker compose file.

33:29.320 --> 33:33.400
You can then couple that with an nginx image from the Linux

33:33.400 --> 33:39.760
server, guys, and have a let's encrypt TLS HTTPS encrypted

33:39.760 --> 33:41.440
website.

33:41.440 --> 33:44.200
We'll put a link to a sample Docker compose and nginx

33:44.200 --> 33:46.080
config file in the show notes for you.

33:46.080 --> 33:47.560
Ah, you're a gentleman.

33:47.560 --> 33:50.280
Well, just a quick project off-grid update for me.

33:50.280 --> 33:51.320
I've ordered my cameras.

33:51.320 --> 33:53.800
I'll reveal which cameras here in the near future.

33:53.800 --> 33:56.320
And I can tell you and I are going

33:56.320 --> 33:58.240
to need to have a storage chat soon.

33:58.240 --> 33:59.440
We got to talk some storage.

33:59.440 --> 34:01.320
I got to sort my storage out.

34:01.320 --> 34:04.800
That sends shivers down my spine, Christopher.

34:04.800 --> 34:07.640
I love talking about storage, Alex.

34:07.640 --> 34:10.700
Head over to selfhosted.show to send us your feedback,

34:10.700 --> 34:13.440
comments, any other stuff that you think we should

34:13.440 --> 34:14.960
know about in this space.

34:14.960 --> 34:16.880
How I could do storage for multiple Raspberry

34:16.880 --> 34:20.000
Pies in a tiny network with low power requirements.

34:20.000 --> 34:21.000
I'd love to know that.

34:21.000 --> 34:22.560
Selfhosted.show, close contact.

34:22.560 --> 34:25.320
I am at Chris LAS on the Twitter.

34:25.320 --> 34:26.760
He's at Ironic Badger.

34:26.760 --> 34:27.640
Thanks for listening.

34:27.640 --> 34:42.760
That was selfhosted.show slash four.
