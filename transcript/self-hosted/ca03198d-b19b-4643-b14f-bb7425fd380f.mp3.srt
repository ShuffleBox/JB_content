1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,240
Would I be a bad man if I ran Arch on the server?

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,560
You can't do that. Why not? You don't really do that, do you?

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,920
I might. No, I don't, but I've often considered it.

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,400
I stream a lot of important things from that server.

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,440
I have often considered it. No, I use Debian primarily.

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,960
However, lately I switched out to Ubuntu for the ZFS stuff.

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,360
And this was after coming to Linux Fest Northwest in April.

8
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,880
I listened to Jim and Alan Jude, who are very persuasive gentlemen.

9
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,040
They are. They really can convince you.

10
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:37,280
Yeah, and Ubuntu has ZFS baked into the user space tool.

11
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,520
All you need to install is a user space tool.

12
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,400
And in future releases, it sounds like it's getting even easier.

13
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,800
For me, though, you just can't beat the stability of a Debian or a CentOS

14
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,520
or something like that. Yes, on the server.

15
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,120
On the server. Yeah, I agree.

16
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,240
I think actually if I was going to pick one true OS to rule them all

17
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,120
for my personal servers, I would pick Debian.

18
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,600
Why? Because it is very much so out of many of the distros,

19
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,640
the most set it and forget it. Even more so, I think, than CentOS.

20
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:09,520
It's just my personal opinion, though. I don't actually run Debian.

21
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:15,360
I get a good sense of stability whenever I run apps update or apps upgrade in Debian.

22
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,040
There's maybe a dozen packages a week that change, if that.

23
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:23,680
Well, I kind of feel like this question is sort of irrelevant too, in a way,

24
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:29,600
because in the past, I would avoid using Debian because it was so slow moving

25
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,680
that the packages would be horribly out of date.

26
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,440
And so it was just not really a contender.

27
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,600
That kind of moved me up to Ubuntu and things like that.

28
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,600
But now I'm really, to be honest with you,

29
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,000
of the opinion that it just doesn't matter.

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,880
Whichever one you are comfortable managing.

31
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,000
And what matters more is how you deploy and run the applications

32
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,040
and how you secure them and how you manage all of that.

33
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,040
That's like what I think matters a lot more.

34
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,760
And then the OS is an implementation detail,

35
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,680
and it just needs to be one you're comfortable with.

36
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,120
Containers changed everything.

37
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:03,040
Yeah, basically. Or VMs too. But for me, it was containers, really.

38
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,120
Because VMs, you still had to answer that server question.

39
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,880
Because VMs, you still got to pick an OS.

40
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:12,160
Whereas a container, okay, the maintainer has picked a base image to base it off of.

41
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,400
It could be an image based on Debian or Arch or Fedora

42
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,880
or some other esoteric thing, Alpine or something.

43
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:24,480
But when you're able to separate the application runtime from the base OS,

44
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,760
you end up in a situation where, like you say, the base OS doesn't matter anymore.

45
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:34,480
The only time it matters is when you want to have things like extra file system support,

46
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,480
like Ubuntu's ZFS support.

47
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,320
And Debian is still a bit old and crusty.

48
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,280
And that's what makes it great, in a way.

49
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,520
Well, okay, just going to throw this out to play devil's advocate.

50
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,080
To play devil's advocate, just to have a rounder conversation.

51
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,160
What about Windows Server?

52
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,760
Well, what about it?

53
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:01,120
Well, you get disk management in the typical Windows disk management stuff.

54
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,600
You get some decent features with NTFS.

55
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,720
You get shadow copy volumes for your users data to be safe,

56
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,640
which is kind of a nice backup.

57
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,360
You've got plentiful application availability.

58
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,240
You've even got the capability of running containers.

59
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,760
And Hyper-V isn't that bad of a virtualizer if you want to run VMs.

60
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,440
Containers, in inverted commas.

61
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,320
They're still running a Linux kernel somewhere.

62
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,600
I know, but it works.

63
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,600
So, I mean, what if Windows is the OS you're the most comfortable with?

64
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,560
Because from where I've just positioned myself,

65
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,040
I've kind of backed myself into that corner.

66
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,200
Because if you're running the applications in a container,

67
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,880
it doesn't really matter at the host OS.

68
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,920
I was just that guy.

69
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,000
To a point, here's my counter to that.

70
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:46,560
Learning Linux is an incredible enabler from a career standpoint.

71
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,280
Mm-hmm.

72
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,160
You're investing in yourself by learning these things,

73
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,840
by learning about what SSH is,

74
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,720
by learning about port forwarding and opening things in your firewall.

75
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,680
You're doing stuff that is being done in the enterprise,

76
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,760
that is being done in business,

77
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,640
that you go to your next job interview and you can be like,

78
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,200
well, hey, I've done X, Y, and Z in my home lab.

79
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:07,700
Mm-hmm.

80
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,720
I run these services for my family.

81
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,320
I run an XCloud instance.

82
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,400
And then I had to set up a reverse proxy

83
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,920
that means I don't have to open loads and loads of ports.

84
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,160
I can just have a let's encrypt certificate

85
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,480
that does this stuff automatically.

86
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,040
And you can talk authoritatively in an interview on these topics.

87
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,360
And that, for me, is the answer.

88
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,960
Yeah, that was a big revelation I had not too long ago.

89
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:37,040
I was using enterprise grade production deployed tools

90
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,200
to run my home lab stuff.

91
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,320
And I just thought for a second,

92
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,720
it's been a long time since I've done that.

93
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,800
Yeah, that is very much what learning Linux felt like back in the day.

94
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,680
So that's a great point.

95
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,720
And I can't argue it because the skill set of the future,

96
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,760
I made this point on a Linux Unplugged recently,

97
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,600
is, quote unquote, the cloud.

98
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,200
When you look at open job searches right now,

99
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,160
there'll be a couple thousand for a traditional sys admin.

100
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,000
And then there'll be like 10,000 for a, quote unquote, cloud admin.

101
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,560
Cloud.

102
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,160
Yeah, well, the cloud's made of Linux.

103
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,760
Just someone else's computer, you know?

104
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,080
It is.

105
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,960
Well, it can be your own computer in the case of our preference.

106
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,240
This is something I wanted to ask you, what does self-hosted mean to you?

107
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,880
For me, it's having something on a box that I control.

108
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,280
I think that's kind of the root of it,

109
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:27,840
because I consider servers that I run on DigitalOcean to be my boxes.

110
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,080
Maybe that's not a safe illusion to be under,

111
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,680
because in theory, they could just go in there

112
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,600
and probably get access to that image.

113
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,600
They have root access to the box they're all running on.

114
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,920
So maybe I shouldn't feel that way.

115
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,360
But I do right now.

116
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,640
My current frame of thought is services I've implemented,

117
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:49,520
data I'm responsible for, and applications and security

118
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,200
that's totally under my control.

119
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:51,440
Yeah.

120
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,040
And there are a number of considerations you've got to make

121
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,000
when deciding where to self-host a particular service.

122
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,360
Do I host it in my garage or my basement or a closet?

123
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,920
Or do I need more uptime than I can guarantee with that

124
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:09,040
and put it on a droplet or an EC2 instance or something like that?

125
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,880
And then obviously, you've got cost considerations

126
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,720
when you come on to cloud hosting versus local hosting.

127
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,640
So local hosting, you're going to be spending a lot of money upfront,

128
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:22,240
probably at least $1,000 to build a system

129
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,520
with half a dozen disks and multiple terabytes.

130
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,960
Whereas the draw of something like a cloud service,

131
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,200
what do you call it, a VPS,

132
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:36,080
is that you can get started in, what, 35 seconds, 40 seconds?

133
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,560
And maybe an entry price of $5 a month?

134
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,120
Yeah.

135
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,880
Which is much easier to eat than $1,000 upfront.

136
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,000
And there's no power bill, there's no heat considerations.

137
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,960
Because I built a new server in September last year,

138
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,560
and I have some regrets, you know.

139
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,100
Really?

140
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,600
Mm-hmm.

141
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,280
I'd like to talk about that, because I went through a phase

142
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,840
where I went, I'm going to try to cloud all of the things,

143
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,560
on boxes I run, and have only dumb, small appliances in the house.

144
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,440
And now I'm swinging back to big rig, lots of disk,

145
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,560
draws a lot of power, but also provides a lot of benefits.

146
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,160
And I'm not having any regrets.

147
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,440
Well, okay, so let me be more specific.

148
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,800
I love having 100 terabytes on my LAN.

149
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,300
Right.

150
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,720
I love being able to...

151
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,400
Just think of the cost to do that in the cloud.

152
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,720
Well, but you wouldn't do that.

153
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,560
It just takes it out as an option, basically.

154
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,200
I wouldn't do that.

155
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,440
I mean, I needed somewhere to store my drone footage,

156
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,800
all of my photography stuff.

157
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,120
Mm-hmm, same.

158
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,360
And I'm sure you've got production requirements

159
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,720
for your storage as well.

160
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,760
But for me, looking at my power bill every month,

161
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:47,440
my server draws, it's a dual Xeon, E5-2690v2.

162
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,960
So they're pretty powerful CPUs.

163
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,080
They score like 15,000 on PassMark each.

164
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,560
So that is the minimum you want for a 4K Plex transcode.

165
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,600
And do you find that your CPUs stay fairly active,

166
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,280
like you are using that much horsepower?

167
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,680
Because sometimes people, you know, they overbuild,

168
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,800
which then gets you down to overpower.

169
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,120
And that's where I thought I could go all appliance space.

170
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,440
I could have just little small boxes of Raspberry Pi here

171
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,920
and Nvidia Shield there, and then have all of the horsepower

172
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,480
up in the cloud.

173
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,080
That was my dream.

174
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,120
I mean, it's tempting.

175
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:17,840
It was.

176
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,960
I'm looking at my server load here,

177
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,080
and it's currently sat at 11.

178
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:26,480
So, you know, 40 thread, 20 core boxes, CPUs.

179
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,440
So the work is kind of bursty when those CPUs are actually in use.

180
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,280
And otherwise, they're kind of sitting there idle.

181
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,440
Yeah, like when a Plex transcode comes in,

182
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,360
it'll burst the first 10 minutes,

183
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,920
and then it will just sort of blip, blip, blip

184
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,960
every few seconds, the next bit of transcoding.

185
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,920
Well, that's a tough call, though,

186
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,160
because you do want to overbuild at least a little.

187
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,240
So it lasts a while and has plenty of headroom.

188
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,600
Well, so here's what I found.

189
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,720
Like Plex has this wonderful offline sync feature

190
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,360
where I can effectively download and transcode media

191
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,400
from whatever format Plex sees it in to my iPad

192
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:02,320
or to my phone at 8 to 10x speed on these CPUs.

193
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,080
I used to have an Atom C2750,

194
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,200
one of these old ASRock boards, Atom 8 core things.

195
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,080
And that was wonderful.

196
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:15,360
It sipped power, had like a 30 watt kind of maximum power draw.

197
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,080
And that worked great when it was just me doing Plex.

198
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,200
But my new house, I have gigabit upload.

199
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,520
And so I was like, well, let's share the love a little bit.

200
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,760
Let's let, you know, you have access.

201
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,120
My parents, you know, in England,

202
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,480
and my uncle in Canada have access to this thing.

203
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,000
And you think, well, I want to be able to do at least,

204
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,160
let's say, 10 streams at once.

205
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,680
And then when you start looking at that,

206
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,280
there's a whole rabbit hole you could go down

207
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:42,240
of doing hardware transcoding with this new Nvidia stuff,

208
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,400
NVENC, which has come popularized

209
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,160
because of Twitch streaming and that kind of thing.

210
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,840
But does have some limitations.

211
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:51,760
Yes, Nvidia arbitrarily limit their GPU drivers

212
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,160
to two streams on consumer cards,

213
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,920
like a 1080Ti for crying out loud.

214
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,000
That's capable of doing 20 or 30 streams

215
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,360
and they limit it to two.

216
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,080
And really not all codecs and bit rates are supported.

217
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,920
So if you want something that's more flexible,

218
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,280
you still end up on CPU.

219
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,840
So you still need to account for that in your CPU build.

220
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:13,920
Yeah. And so going back a bit to my power bill,

221
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,240
I look at these dual Xeons and they idle at around,

222
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,200
I mean, there's 15 hard drives in this box as well.

223
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:21,920
Yeah.

224
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,720
But they idle, that box idles at around 300,

225
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,400
box idles at around 300 watts.

226
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,680
And now some rough maths that I use

227
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,960
to calculate what that costs me.

228
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,080
North Carolina, my power is about 11 cents per kilowatt hour

229
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:42,080
and you can approximate that to roughly $1 per watt per year.

230
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,120
So that server costs me approximately $300 a year to run.

231
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,600
Now, if I was to look at what I could get in Digital Ocean

232
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,240
or Amazon for that kind of money, wouldn't come close.

233
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,880
Yeah. Not in horsepower and not in storage.

234
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,040
And also bear in mind that you're getting the benefit

235
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,800
of raw metal performance,

236
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,680
not a virtual machine up on a shared system.

237
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,480
So I run Proxmox as my base OS,

238
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,240
which is based on top of Debian.

239
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,560
And then all of my application workloads

240
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,080
are within an Ubuntu VM,

241
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,720
which I use pass-through on to send

242
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,160
a couple of disk controllers through.

243
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,760
And that works great.

244
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,480
And I don't notice any performance penalty for real on that.

245
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,920
But I can't help escape this thing,

246
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,760
particularly with this new Ryzen launch.

247
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,000
I can't help escape the fact that I could build a system

248
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,840
with similar performance that only drew 100 watts from the wall.

249
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,960
And I've still got the new Ryzen 3 Zen 2 stuff.

250
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,440
I could have the same performance

251
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,600
for less than half the energy draw.

252
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,960
Yeah, but there's no way that math works out price-wise.

253
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,560
Since you've spent the money on the server,

254
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,720
it would take you so long to make that up.

255
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,120
Yeah, I mean, a Ryzen build is going to cost me at least,

256
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,960
what, $1,000, $1,500?

257
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,920
To be honest for you, it's probably closer to $2,000.

258
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,880
Come on, you know yourself.

259
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,760
Yeah, and you know, there's another thing

260
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,080
that this old enterprise gear has

261
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:05,520
that you can't necessarily get cheaply

262
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,600
on the AMD side right now, and that's IPMI.

263
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,400
So I could log into my PFSense box from here,

264
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,040
bring up the IPMI interface,

265
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,640
and remotely see what is being output through the VGA port.

266
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,280
I'm in Seattle, my server's in Raleigh, North Carolina,

267
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,840
and I can just bring up the display as if I was there.

268
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,800
KVM over IP, it's amazing.

269
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,400
That is, especially when you have family members

270
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,520
that are depending on it.

271
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,360
That is really nice to have that.

272
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,800
We use the word depending in inverted commas as well, I think.

273
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,120
The whole thing is a big math equation to me.

274
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,600
I look at what I expect this box to do,

275
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,920
how core to my, how, quote unquote, dependent am I on this?

276
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,480
How core to my daily use of my network is it?

277
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,960
I.e., is it doing DNS?

278
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,400
Is it doing DHCP?

279
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,680
Is it doing Samba or NFS, some kind of storage?

280
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,640
So then how performant does that need to be,

281
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,480
and how dependable does it need to be?

282
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,560
And then from that, I try to derive

283
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,120
how reliable I need the server hardware to be.

284
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,200
And then the only other kind of two factors

285
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,360
I have to figure there is how much CPU and disk,

286
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,160
because often the other things will drive the RAM requirements.

287
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:17,280
And I often end up on a mix of x86 Xeon hardware

288
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,880
with 64 gigs of RAM was kind of like my standard build right now,

289
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,320
and then a ton of disk.

290
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,360
And it is the same thing.

291
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,480
It's drawing around.

292
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,600
I don't think it's drawing that much.

293
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,440
I don't have as many disks as you do, but it does.

294
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,480
It does have a big cost.

295
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,920
I look at it as a business expense

296
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:36,160
since it is also file services for our team and whatnot.

297
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,760
But it was a hard calculation to make

298
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:43,360
because I did really like when I could go in lower power

299
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,440
because I often went that also meant less noise,

300
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,920
less heat, less costs, less complexity.

301
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,560
So I do kind of want to encourage like when possible,

302
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,440
don't overbuild if possible.

303
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,840
I've kind of gotten away with that so far in the RV.

304
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,880
I don't have any hard work equipment

305
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,200
that requires a fan or anything like that running in the RV.

306
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,840
It's all appliance space so far, but I can feel it slipping.

307
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,800
It's slipping.

308
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,880
You're not tempted to put a Pi in the RV then?

309
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,520
Oh, I got like an idea for like three different ones right now.

310
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,600
The Raspberry Pi fits in a weird place in all of this

311
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,520
because it's perfect to run small stuff

312
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,040
that doesn't have much IO.

313
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,640
But the minute you want to attach

314
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,600
more than one SATA type disk to it,

315
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,240
you have to have lots of USB converters.

316
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,480
And maybe with the four, we should do some testing maybe

317
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,160
because they've separated out the ethernet bus

318
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,600
from the USB bus finally.

319
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:33,920
Yep.

320
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,760
The early benchmarking I've done shows

321
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,040
it really makes a big difference.

322
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:37,520
I'm sure.

323
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,960
So I think the four is the first Raspberry Pi

324
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,920
that's truly ready to be a home server.

325
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,120
And I think so regardless of what hardware you pick

326
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,480
and regardless of what OS,

327
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,080
even though I think we both kind of recommend

328
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,600
if you're starting out, people try out Debian

329
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,840
or Ubuntu therefore.

330
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,800
Well, there are others.

331
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,040
Yep.

332
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,720
CentOS would be another good choice, I think.

333
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,280
Well, we haven't mentioned FreeNAS or Unraid yet.

334
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,440
Oh, I feel like we could have a whole conversation

335
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,240
on those suckers.

336
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:02,720
Right?

337
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,120
Yeah.

338
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,720
I mean, if you're just starting out,

339
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,840
Unraid I would say is possibly the easiest thing around.

340
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,480
Yeah.

341
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,280
Is that good though?

342
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,800
It's a proprietary piece of software

343
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,240
which you have to pay a license for.

344
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,880
So it's not completely free and open source

345
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,200
like our Debian recommendation would be.

346
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,800
And that's something that I struggle with quite often

347
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,240
when speaking to people in Discord or on Reddit

348
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,520
is trying to gauge you as a person.

349
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,960
What are you trying to get out of this purchase

350
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,920
or this build?

351
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,320
Are you trying to learn skills

352
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,600
that will make you more marketable for a job

353
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,200
or are you just trying to solve a problem

354
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,600
which is how do I stream media around my house?

355
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,600
You could also be somebody who just likes to know

356
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,040
how the things work

357
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,040
and so you want to build it yourself, put it together.

358
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,800
You want to know all the parts of the recipe.

359
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,880
You know, what is the right box for you?

360
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,080
Is it a Synology maybe?

361
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:59,360
Is learning Linux the right thing for you to do whatsoever?

362
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,160
There are so many options in this space.

363
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,360
It can be bewildering.

364
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,800
Bewildering as a new guy.

365
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,280
It's like we need some sort of show

366
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,000
that has time to discuss and explore

367
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,160
all these different options and help sort all of this out.

368
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:12,960
Something to help you.

369
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,560
Is that what this is?

370
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,120
Yeah, maybe.

371
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,960
Maybe something to help you navigate those complexities.

372
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,680
What a great idea.

373
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,400
I think my other checklist

374
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,840
if you're considering self-hosting

375
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,280
is you need to be willing to take on

376
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,600
some personal responsibility for security.

377
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,320
Absolutely.

378
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,600
You know, be willing to use SSH key authentication

379
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,520
whenever possible, don't use passwords

380
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,040
for any kind of login.

381
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,320
Be willing to explore isolating applications and services

382
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,520
either through VMs, through containers,

383
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,960
whatever works for you.

384
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,520
Also, where possible, restrict your file systems to read only.

385
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:48,880
There's no read.

386
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,240
If you don't need to have write access

387
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,720
or if you can easily enable write access to make a change,

388
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,880
consider that and also stay tuned for future discussions

389
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,320
on setting up reverse proxies

390
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,000
because that's going to be a key part of this too.

391
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
You got to be willing to deep dive a little bit

392
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,280
into reverse proxy.

393
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,280
And if you're willing to do those kinds of

394
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,480
self-responsibility items that aren't related to the CPU

395
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,720
or the hardware or the operating system,

396
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,360
if you're willing to do those things in addition,

397
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,600
I think you're probably a good candidate to self-host.

398
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,800
But the other thing is, right,

399
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,520
if you were to just buy an off-the-shelf Synology

400
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,880
or a QNAP or any of the other kind of NAS in a box

401
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,920
like Drobo maybe,

402
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,280
you're still going to have to figure a lot of this stuff out.

403
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,240
The minute you, for me, what woke my mind up to all this

404
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,560
was five or six years ago, I bought a Drobo,

405
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,000
returned it because it was expensive.

406
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,080
I've owned a couple of them.

407
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,200
And then I bought a Synology.

408
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,840
And then I sort of thought to myself,

409
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,400
well, I've got this thing sat there with blinky lights

410
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,800
that's on, what else can I do with it?

411
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:52,080
And that single thought sparked my entire journey rabbit hole

412
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,320
into, I guess, being sat here with you right now.

413
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,560
Now, was that before you worked for Red Hat or was that?

414
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,000
Oh, a long time, yeah.

415
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
This was, I was still working at the Apple Store.

416
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,640
Oh, okay.

417
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,520
I was a genius on the genius bar at the Apple Store.

418
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,880
You have that moment, you say to yourself,

419
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,000
I want to solve this problem.

420
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,200
What would it take?

421
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,160
For me, it was a 1.5 terabyte Seagate hard drive,

422
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,640
which are notorious now.

423
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,680
They have a reputation.

424
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,640
I woke up one morning, I powered my computer off this.

425
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,600
I was still running Windows.

426
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,040
I'm sorry to say.

427
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,080
No, that's it.

428
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:22,960
Windows happens, man.

429
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,880
We're okay with that.

430
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,920
I was still running Windows.

431
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:30,320
I had a bunch of movies and TV shows on this 1.5 terabyte hard drive,

432
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,080
which I'd ripped from DVDs I had.

433
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:32,640
Oh, yeah.

434
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,480
Oh, that's a labor of love.

435
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:34,720
Yeah.

436
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,400
And they were all beautifully categorized.

437
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:36,720
Of course.

438
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,440
And cataloged.

439
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,160
You had a nice naming scheme for each file and everything.

440
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,680
And I woke up one morning, pushed the power button on my desktop.

441
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:43,920
Sure.

442
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,000
And that drive didn't show up.

443
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,960
And I'm like, what the F?

444
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,800
Where has this gone?

445
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,760
It was fine last night.

446
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,320
Double click on all my computer, no D drive.

447
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,840
And then you go in disk management, nothing.

448
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,600
And you go into the BIOS, nothing.

449
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,480
And when it doesn't show up in the BIOS, you're like, oh, crap.

450
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:05,760
So I had a USB external hard drive, 3.5 hard drive.

451
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,400
You can close your kind of thing to hook up.

452
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,200
It was like a hot swap.

453
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,600
I had one of those toasters.

454
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,640
It's like a USB toaster.

455
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,960
You put this full size drive in there.

456
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,160
I love those things.

457
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:16,400
Yeah.

458
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,840
So they fulfill a use case that I wish I had.

459
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,160
Right.

460
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,120
I just don't have it.

461
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:21,680
Never used.

462
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,200
I bought one at home.

463
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,320
And I bought one here at the studio.

464
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,080
And I thought, I'll synchronize my data that way.

465
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,320
I use it all the time, but nothing.

466
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:35,120
So this 1.5 terabyte Seagate drive just had a hugely horrific failure rate.

467
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:40,880
We're talking double digit percentages where the spindle one morning just decided

468
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,920
I'm not going to unlock.

469
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:46,560
Back when IBM made this, I had a series of, we call them death stars.

470
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,520
Same thing happened to me.

471
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,920
In an array, like several of them started popping.

472
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,560
That name has stuck with the desk star forever.

473
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,760
So I had a similar thing afflict me one time.

474
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,640
And then you start thinking, well, what if that had been the other drive

475
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,080
that had all my photos on it?

476
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:00,880
Yeah.

477
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,840
And then you think, well, OK, I need some redundancy here.

478
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:08,480
Because one, the phrase in the backup industry is once is nonce.

479
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:09,760
Right.

480
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,040
One is none, actually.

481
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,360
One copy is not a backup.

482
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,320
One is none.

483
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,000
Two is something.

484
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:16,960
And then three is-

485
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,840
A proper backup.

486
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,880
Yeah, that's what you want.

487
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:25,280
So nowadays I have, for all of my photos, for example, I have a full copy in Google

488
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,960
of everything, like Google Drive.

489
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:33,040
I have a few drives at my dad's house, which I send everything remotely to him,

490
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:37,040
encrypted using duplicati across the internet to his house.

491
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:37,680
How does that work?

492
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,960
It has this wonderful way of doing like snapshots.

493
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,200
So it does incremental backups.

494
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,720
It's a bit like ZFS send, I believe.

495
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:51,040
It only sends what's changed, but it works at the file level instead of ZFS's

496
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,960
block level stuff.

497
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,920
So in some ways it's better.

498
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,720
In some ways it's worse.

499
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,480
And do you go to the trouble of encrypting the data that you send up to Google Drive?

500
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,000
Google, yes.

501
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,400
Yeah.

502
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,280
My dad's no.

503
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:01,760
Yeah, right.

504
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,640
Sure, sure.

505
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:07,120
Because in the event of a failure where I need to get that data, the risk of having

506
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,960
to remember an encryption password on my dad's house might be the one thing that

507
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,840
costs me that data.

508
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,480
And it feels like if it's going to be safe somewhere, it's probably your dad's house.

509
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,960
Does the encryption you use to go to Google Drive, does it support incremental file changes

510
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,720
or is it whole files every time?

511
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,400
I think it must be whole files every time.

512
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,080
Yeah, that's something I think we could explore in the future too is how to leverage the cloud

513
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,920
for your self-hosted solution that is still secure for backups.

514
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,400
Yeah.

515
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,000
Private, I think that'd be a big thing.

516
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,720
There's a whole rabbit hole we could go into on just backups alone.

517
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,760
Oh man, totally.

518
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,920
We could have a total full conversation.

519
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,880
I'd love suggestions too.

520
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,120
We have a new Twitter account at self-hosted show, which you can tweet at Alex and I will

521
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,480
both be monitoring that.

522
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,880
And if you have something you want to get in the show, that's probably the best way

523
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:53,360
or hit us on Twitter or in the Telegram for Jupiter broadcasting, hashtag ask SSH.

524
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,400
What does the S stand for?

525
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,120
The extra S.

526
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,400
The super self-hosted show.

527
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,920
I think we should make the audience guess.

528
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:01,920
Oh, they should give us suggestions by doing hashtag ask because we just wanted to use

529
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,400
SSH.

530
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,800
And the winner will get a t-shirt with ask SSH on it.

531
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,600
Oh, great.

532
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,100
Yeah.

533
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:07,780
Sure.

534
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,200
Let's just do that.

535
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,040
And then if you have something longer form that you want to get over to us, you can

536
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:16,080
go over to us, self-hosted.show slash contact.

537
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:20,640
Self-hosted.show is going to be the landing page for this whole show.

538
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:26,240
Anything like links or contact pages or our RSS feeds, subscribe links, all of that is

539
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,160
at self-hosted.show.

540
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:32,560
So we're going to be focusing mostly on service stuff, like you've just heard.

541
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,600
Chris and I, we're building out infrastructure.

542
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,560
We're infrastructure guys.

543
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:39,280
Yeah, like right now I'm working on like a whole security camera system that's going

544
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,080
to be tied into this.

545
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:40,800
Right, yes.

546
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,600
Got to talk about that soon.

547
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,400
I can't wait to hear about that.

548
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,720
I really like it so far.

549
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,360
But we also have another show on the network called Choose Linux.

550
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:47,840
Yep.

551
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,520
Which complements this one really well.

552
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,560
Yeah, on the desktop side.

553
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:50,800
Yes.

554
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,520
And they're trying out desktop applications and distributions.

555
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,600
It's a great introduction to that.

556
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:00,160
It's just a fun journey of discovering new things in open source and Linux.

557
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:04,000
Just like we'll be doing on the server side, they do it on the desktop side.

558
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,680
So it's sort of a companion show in a way.

559
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,280
I like how that's worked out.

560
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,360
It's almost like we planned it that way.

561
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,960
Almost?

562
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,240
Hey, before we run, I've been watching something this week I want to tell you about.

563
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,600
I think you might really like this channel.

564
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,240
OK.

565
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:21,200
I came across it when I was doing research on security cameras.

566
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,840
And have you heard of the EufyCam E's?

567
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,720
No, I have not.

568
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,200
They're like a competitor to the Arlo camera system.

569
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,200
And Eufy is a division of Anchor, the people that make all of the.

570
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,640
My robot is by Eufy.

571
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,040
Yeah.

572
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:39,280
And so they've made some really nice cameras that are battery, wireless, the local recording,

573
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,480
which is encrypted and you still get remote access to it.

574
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,960
And the channel is just great where I watched the review.

575
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,640
It's undecided with Matt Farrell.

576
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,520
And he has just a great clean take on this stuff.

577
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,800
Nice level headed.

578
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,600
It's a good YouTube channel.

579
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,760
So I just I subscribed and I became a patron today.

580
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,120
I really I was that impressed.

581
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,320
Look at those production values.

582
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,440
This guy has good lighting.

583
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,160
That's what I'm talking about.

584
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:01,680
You can tell just in the first thumbnail how good a video is going to be.

585
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,440
And he's really he's well spoken.

586
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,320
He posts the script up on his website.

587
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,080
He does a really good evaluation.

588
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,600
And I just want.

589
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,840
So he's put these cameras into a Synology box, has he?

590
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,080
I think it's one of the many systems he has.

591
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,800
Yeah, that's great.

592
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,240
Check it out.

593
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,280
Undecided with Matt Farrell.

594
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:38,800
We'll have a link in the show notes at self hosted dot show slash one.
