00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,660
Coming up on today's show we cover our favorite last-pass alternative

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:10,760
We talk about why more boxes might be better than one and we confess our undying love for arch

3
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:40,600
I'm Alex and I'm Chris and this is self-hosted 39

4
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:47,980
I too I too Alex have been worshipping at the altar of arch recently after experimenting with various different distributions

5
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:54,400
I like that I can set up a minimal system and I actually have been enjoying using arch as my base

6
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,320
Application server. I don't run apps directly on arch but in containers or VMs

7
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,000
I find it to be a fantastic platform been doing it for a while now

8
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,560
This comes hot off the heels of this week's Linux unplugged where I think it's fair to say you got in your soapbox

9
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,600
And preach the arch gospel. Oh, I don't know

10
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:17,840
I think what I what I got in my soapbox about was it's become kind of a joke or a meme

11
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,800
Oh arch users people are just trying to flex and talk about how elite they are

12
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,040
When the reality is that's not it at all

13
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:31,360
I simply just want something that makes it really quick to get software deployed or up or running and maybe have the most minimal Linux

14
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:36,880
Installed before I run an application and I find it great for that without sort of all of the upfront work

15
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:42,420
That's something like gen 2 or Linux from scratch takes a broke broke broke. I run arch by the way

16
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:49,640
Yeah, well, that's kind of how it started and then it became you kind of grew from there, didn't it? It did

17
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:54,040
Yeah, I definitely feel the shame like when you say to people I run arch

18
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:58,520
It's not because you want to flex or at least I don't want to flex it

19
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:05,400
It's because I I love it so gosh-darn much and I think other people would too if they just gave it a chance and well

20
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,960
Why is that? I think we should talk about maybe just really briefly why it is

21
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:15,040
You love it so much because it's not it's not the forums, right? It's not the arch. It's not the arch user base necessarily

22
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,560
It's the practicality of it, right? It is I am

23
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,780
One command away from pretty much any piece of software that I want

24
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,960
yay, dash s

25
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:30,280
Everything literally is you know, the AUR is is arch is secret source

26
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:36,320
Think of anything think of a custom kernel, you know, the FIO stuff is is pretty complex to get into

27
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:43,000
There is a custom kernel already compiled or there's a package build to compile a custom kernel already there for you ready to go

28
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:50,720
You want some esoteric piece of software that on Ubuntu would be a PPA or on Fedora would be a copper repo

29
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:56,400
I don't have to worry about any of that. It's just yay, dash s install and and off you go and

30
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,720
Besides that, you know as a new user when I was getting into Linux in

31
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,520
2013-14 sort of time period the arch documentation

32
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:09,560
It's just the best around and it's crowdsourced

33
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,600
It's not always completely accurate and always completely totally up-to-date, but it's good enough

34
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:22,320
That even an idiot like me can pick it up and get going when I knew basically nothing and at that point

35
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:27,960
That was when I should just transition to system D. So I kind of credit arch and system D

36
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:33,320
And docker as being the three kind of pillars of what got me into Linux and being able to get me over that initial

37
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:39,800
New user not knowing what I'm doing hump those three things together for me would just

38
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:47,080
Game-changing there really is a Linux for every type. Obviously, there's benefits to running something like Debian or

39
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:51,720
CentOS or Ubuntu LTS on a server that make just a ton of sense for most people

40
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:57,320
I'm the type of user. I don't mind logging in at least once a week doing a package update and

41
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:02,880
Seeing what needs to be installed. I I don't always have time for that

42
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,080
I don't I don't always get to do it weekly

43
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:09,160
But I generally am able to do it at least once a month if not twice a month and that

44
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:14,200
Seems to be all it's taken for me to keep these systems up and running and the benefit that I get from

45
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:22,280
A self-hosting standpoint is my operating system is continuously updated. I don't I don't have this event that comes up every few years

46
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:27,080
Where I kind of brace myself and do this massive upgrade

47
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:34,280
I instead I take my medicine kind of on a weekly basis and it kind of stretches out the changes so that they're just more

48
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,000
Minor, they're more frequent, but they're more minor

49
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,680
I I prefer that and then when you add something like Alex is saying the AUR

50
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:48,760
with the package management system I can get something up and running in moments on arch that would take

51
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:55,160
A bit of fiddling around maybe adding a package repository following a guide to add the keys and all that kind of stuff

52
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:01,960
To a machine and then I have the joy of watching that repo go by every time I do an apt update or a dnf

53
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:08,280
Update and not a huge fan of that system. It works and for some people it's not a huge fan of that system

54
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,960
It works and for some people it works really well for me

55
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:17,960
I just like to have it all integrated with a single package manager single set of updates that I do and it's always

56
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,000
Guaranteed to be at least close to guaranteed it

57
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,560
I should say the latest version when I install something

58
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:27,320
So I know the security stuff's taken care of the feature stuff that I've been reading about online

59
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:32,680
I know it's already landed and then anything that's more complex than a basic system level tool

60
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:38,600
I'm already loading in a container anyways, and those are often based on alpine or ubuntu, etc

61
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,760
And it kind of doesn't really matter what the host os is running as long as it's secure and up to date

62
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,160
I kind of view arch a little bit like

63
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:52,760
Stock android, you know like on a pixel phone or well not oneplus anymore, but definitely on the pixel phones like

64
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:59,480
It has no opinion. There's no opinionation really in how it does stuff. It just gives you stuff and lets you figure it out by yourself

65
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:03,400
And for that reason it makes a really great minimum viable server

66
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,600
It also makes a really great workstation

67
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:13,800
It could make a great cloud box because you can only install very very minimal numbers of packages. So from a security perspective

68
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,360
There's a smaller attack surface

69
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:21,080
The downside is that the industry and I use air quotes around industry

70
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:27,320
In the cloud at least does seem to be settling on ubuntu like if you look at market share and stuff like that

71
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,320
so you are kind of

72
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:33,000
trailblazing your own path by going with arch but

73
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:38,680
I would argue that what distro you run doesn't really matter that much anymore

74
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:42,760
I mean, I I do feel pretty strongly that you know, all my systems will just run arch

75
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,520
You know if it's a laptop or a desktop or whatever, but if it's a server

76
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,080
I'll probably put ubuntu on it

77
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,800
even though everything we've just said because

78
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,400
It has canonical behind it doing a bunch of testing

79
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,880
Especially when it comes to zfs and the licensing there. That's a tricky one even on arch

80
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:06,040
Just a bunch of stuff bunch of testing and things like that mean that I don't run arch absolutely everywhere

81
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:12,040
Just most places. I have found that for the cloud i'm sticking with ubuntu lts for the most part

82
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:18,440
I find that works really well and for my raspberry pies that are at the rv on an lte connection

83
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:23,320
I'm also running ubuntu lts there in part because they've done a really good job

84
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,480
with their pi support, but also

85
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:33,000
Less updates is a feature when you're on cellular. Yeah, and i'm already updating my laptop enough as it is

86
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,160
So there's those those elements of it

87
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,800
But when I have an opportunity to run local physical hardware like I do here at the studio, it's all arch

88
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:47,000
It works fantastic. I do have one arch box up in the cloud that is like an example of arch in the cloud gone wrong

89
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,320
Where the vendor tried to pin to a third party

90
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,680
Vendor tried to pin to a certain version of the kernel

91
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,680
And of course that just doesn't work very well with arch

92
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,880
So I think it is a little trickier in the cloud and it's not a hundred percent solution

93
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:05,000
and what I was just advocating now, I guess here and in that episode of linux unplugged is

94
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,000
let's

95
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,080
Not mock people for their choice of distribution

96
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:14,440
There's functionality behind everything and like perfectly good reasons to run susa as well

97
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,080
My buddy on coder radio mike

98
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:22,360
That's what he prefers to run. He likes susa in the enterprise. He runs pop os on his desktop and susa

99
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,920
In the rack and that works really well for him

100
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:29,080
It's not it's not like we're trying to create a this distribution is better debate

101
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:36,040
what we're trying to say is let's include everybody in the conversation and not mock people for their choice of distribution and

102
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:41,880
As a couple of counter narrative guys, I guess we happen to find arch actually works pretty well if you're willing to maintain it

103
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:49,080
Linode.com slash ssh go there to get a 100 60-day credit towards a new account. Yeah

104
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:55,480
$100 in credit to play with and of course your support in the show by going to linode.com slash ssh

105
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:02,520
That's where we set up all of our infrastructure for jb 3.0 if we're playing around for something like ssh like segment work or something

106
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,800
Yeah, we do that up on linode and speaking of arch

107
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:10,520
One of the great things about linode is they let you pick just about any distribution you want they have arch

108
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,240
They got I mean they got everything alpine debian

109
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,240
sent off susa

110
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:21,000
Ubuntu's of course, I mean they got like everything up there even some fedora for you crazy kids out there

111
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,760
You can run it up on linode. They've been in this game since 2003

112
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:31,080
They've learned what works and they've learned what doesn't work and they were doing that years before everybody else

113
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:38,200
and they've really managed to modernize it with a beautiful cloud dashboard that makes it approachable to somebody who's brand new to servers or

114
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:42,360
Or maybe you're like a longtime pro. You're gonna love the way this dashboard works

115
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:46,600
Of course, they have native ssd storage 40 gigabit connections coming into the machines

116
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:52,440
It's all super fast and because they've been around since 2003. They've got some great locations

117
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,640
Like think about that, right?

118
00:09:53,640 --> 00:10:01,000
They can leverage their experience their relationships in a way that nobody else can because they've been in cloud computing before it was cloud computing

119
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:04,920
11 data centers around the world. We got an email into the show from james

120
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:09,960
He said I wanted to set up an smtp relay at my previous

121
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,680
vps provider but

122
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,400
Because they were kind of you know

123
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,560
Trying to be competitive in the market

124
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,540
They they ended up with not the best ip reputation

125
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:27,420
And they ended up getting blocked by microsoft. And so then he spun up another box on their system and that also got blocked by microsoft

126
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:32,760
He's like I couldn't even find them on any public blacklist yet microsoft just started

127
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:39,100
Blacklisting all of these ips. So I decided I'd go over to linode and try a try a linode over there and support the show

128
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,100
So he goes to linode.com

129
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:44,220
Ssh he spins up a system on linode and he discovers. Oh

130
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:49,260
Linode has a policy where they block all smtp related ports by default

131
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:52,060
Oh, well, I guess i'll email support and see what they say

132
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:59,020
So he sends off a quick email to support he gets a prompt response later and they open up the ports and everything is working

133
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:02,940
Perfectly he goes then a few days later

134
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:07,420
I finally got a response from my original provider with some canned email that didn't help it at all

135
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,340
I reply to that. I got another canned email response and that was it

136
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:16,060
I just gave up and i'm moving everything over to linode. They're genuinely just great

137
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,740
And i've gotten so many notes into the show that talk about linode support

138
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:23,180
It's not an aspect. I touch on a lot, but it really matters once you get up and running

139
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:27,280
Especially if you've got some important infrastructure on there, so go check them out linode.com

140
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,280
slash ssh

141
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:38,480
Now I know you covered some stuff about last pass in linux unplugged this seems this is like linux unplugged plus this episode, isn't it?

142
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:44,160
But uh last pass have been doing some shenanigans with their free tiers and stuff

143
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,720
I think we've all been expecting this for quite a long time

144
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,360
since uh, they were acquired

145
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,840
now they are limiting

146
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,440
the

147
00:11:53,440 --> 00:12:01,360
access to unlimited devices of one type so to clarify what that means is you can access last pass free

148
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:09,200
On an unlimited number of computers or an unlimited number of mobile devices, but not both on their free tier

149
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:14,960
I say enough. I say that stinks and we have a recommendation for you. I agree

150
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,600
I mean the price right now is kind of reasonable. It's like what four bucks a year or something

151
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,000
It's not outrageous

152
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
for a year, I mean

153
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
But it stinks the way it's going about

154
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,200
And I agree it it's time to look at an alternative and this is the self-hosted podcast

155
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,360
And I think both of us landed on bitwarden pretty quickly

156
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:41,040
I have some trepidation here though. Hold on a minute. I think last pass is 27 a year

157
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,560
It's two dollars up two dollars 25 a month billed annually

158
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:48,080
Oh, you're kidding me. Yeah, huh? Oh geez, okay

159
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:53,440
Uh-huh. Yeah, you're right. So that's that's not nearly the deal. I thought it was that's a bad deal

160
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,440
Especially when bitwarden is only ten dollars a year. That's if you buy an annual plan

161
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:07,920
But if you don't even want to do that, you can self-host the bitwarden server, which is just so cool

162
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:15,920
Yeah, I really love seeing this and I know it's a little complicated. I think it requires sequel among other things

163
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:22,160
So the community has come up with an alternative. Yeah, there's a a project called bitwarden rs, which is written in rust

164
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,800
Where's where's when you need him?

165
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,840
and this is a a

166
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:34,960
A bit warden server that can run in a container that will essentially perform the same role as the ten dollar a year

167
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:42,240
Hosted service the difference being is you own all the data. It remains on your servers or your vps or whatever

168
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:47,360
So there's a couple of ways you could go about doing this the first and most obvious way is to spin up a linode

169
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,760
Or something like that and throw a bit warden on there

170
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:56,000
And just call it good and because it's your password manager. I would probably caution against

171
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,600
Running this on a shared cloud vps, you know, if you if you're hosting a ton of websites

172
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,280
And it's a very public, you know vps

173
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,240
I probably wouldn't put your password manager on that same system. I would put it on a separate system

174
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:15,600
Just so you're reducing the blast radius of any bots or anything doing something crazy with the web servers

175
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,400
The other thing you can do is run it on your lan and I think the

176
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,000
running it on a separate system becomes less important when it's on your

177
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:28,720
Network and the idea of of running it on your lan, of course

178
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,840
Is that your data never leaves your house, right and and that will hopefully

179
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:39,680
Reduce the risk even further now the downside of running it on your lan

180
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:45,280
Now the downside of running your own password manager backend is you've got to configure secure access to it

181
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,680
So that could be using wire guard

182
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,600
Or some other kind of authentication through ssh or something like that

183
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:56,740
But ultimately you're going to want to be really careful and really sure you know what you're doing from a security perspective

184
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:00,800
Before you start going and storing all your passwords on a public system

185
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:06,080
That's where you could make the argument that it could just be worth paying for their hosted service

186
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:13,120
And this is where i'm currently experiencing my trepidation. I I 100 know I could self-host it

187
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,480
Uh, and the nice thing about this rust version of their server is

188
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,320
Really minimal resources so you could really run it on anything

189
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:24,240
So I could run it on my raspberry pi or I could run it easily here on the server at the studio

190
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:31,200
But I i'm not sure I want to you know, there's something about the the master password vault

191
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,680
It's such a sacred responsibility

192
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,120
that

193
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:42,560
I almost trust an organization like bit warden to be more focused on securing that platform than I am not that I

194
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,440
I really have no concerns about our security really

195
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,560
But there's something that still gives me pause

196
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:53,600
They got one job to do right and i've actually paid bit warden the ten dollars a year for

197
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,640
Two or three maybe four years at this point. I've been very very happy. It just does the job

198
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:04,480
I never have to think about it. All the auto fill stuff on android and ios just works fantastically. Well

199
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,200
You know ten dollars is that kind of?

200
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,040
Screw it amount of money when it's spread over an entire year, you know

201
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,040
It's less than a dollar a month and yeah

202
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:18,320
To just not have to worry about it and to just not have to think about it for what 80 90 cents a month

203
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,000
That's worth it for me. It reminds me of why I kind of like

204
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,560
Like supporting nebuchadnezzar and how supporting nebuchadnezzar goes into home assistant development makes home assistant better

205
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:35,680
By subscribing to bit warden you're helping them come up with sustainable business model that encourages them to make the password manager better

206
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,840
And keep their service secure

207
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:44,400
So it incentivizes the right things and on top of that. It means I don't have to host it myself. I haven't actually made my decision

208
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,560
Because I I have kept a lot of business stuff in last pass for a while. I know I like bit warden

209
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,560
So i've always thought that's what I would jump to

210
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:58,000
And so I went over to their to their subscription pricing page and they also offer team plans

211
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,700
For as little as like three dollars per user and that's still pretty reasonable

212
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:06,880
So I think that might be the direction I end up going i'm going to research more about how they host it first

213
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:12,800
Because I know a big use case for me a really big use case for me is mobile access

214
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,880
It's such a crap shoot with me. I don't just connect from one machine

215
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:23,600
I could it's just ridiculous, especially when you bring in like traveling or setting up family member systems or and hosts

216
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,840
yeah, it's just it's it's ridiculous so I

217
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:31,760
I kind of like the idea of something where i'm not handing out wire guard connections to 15 different people

218
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,240
So that way they can access the central password database

219
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,080
And don't forget as well

220
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:41,520
Generally the time when you need bit warden the most is when your device is completely brand new or empty

221
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:48,160
Right, and so you've always got that awkward first 10 minutes where you're getting, you know, your two-factor auth set up again

222
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,480
And your bit warden whatever set up again

223
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,360
And once you've got those two things you're good to go generally

224
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,400
But yeah, I can see you don't want to be handing that out to randos

225
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,720
If you do want to self-host it though alex like somebody in our audience who may have a different use case

226
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:06,560
It's easier than ever now because the bit warden rust server has a docker image fully up to date

227
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:11,520
Um as of like 19 hours ago as we record this it's like uh, the old proverb

228
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,720
If if something isn't dockerized at this point, does it even exist?

229
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:19,760
Now another nice thing that I do with bit warden is I actually share passwords with my wife

230
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:24,240
She has a bit warden. I don't think she pays the premium. I think she just has the basic free account

231
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,640
But we created an organization and when you create a particular login

232
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:32,980
You can assign that login to an organization and share it with that organization

233
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:38,100
So certain passwords for us like amazon ebay, you know stuff that you want to share

234
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:43,860
It goes into that shared, uh area if you like that shared organization and we've both got access to it

235
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:47,060
I find that really useful. There's of course other solutions out there

236
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:50,340
Another beloved one in the audience is key pass and key pass x and

237
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,980
There's several solutions to this

238
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:58,580
But bit warden is the one we both landed on I think in part because of the ui the browser integration

239
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:04,580
The ability to self-host and the quality of the mobile apps all kind of come together to make it our favorite choice

240
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,540
So whilst we're sort of kind of on the topic of security

241
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:12,740
Why don't we discuss the plex hoopla that's been going on as well about this?

242
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:17,140
Botnet thing that's been amplifying stuff across the internet

243
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:22,180
Distincts because you know, you you got a plex server going you've opened it up to the internet

244
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:25,300
So that way you can share it some scanner finds your server

245
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:32,260
Indexes it and then some botnet author figures out a way to take advantage of a vulnerability and plex to amplify

246
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,420
by a factor of five

247
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:39,940
Their ddos traffic they kind of corral all of these different plex installs together

248
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:46,580
To kind of do this amplified attack against a single source and just happened the last week as we're recording this

249
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:51,380
Net scout said that there was a ddos for hire service that recently turned

250
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:55,000
Misconfigured plex media servers into amplifying attack servers

251
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:02,920
Yeah, not only does it suck up all of your bandwidth and attack somebody but it also runs your server like crazy

252
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,040
It's just it's bad. Yeah, what really kind of

253
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:12,600
I don't want to use the word scared me, but I suppose so, you know gave me cause for a concern at least was

254
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,080
just opening

255
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,280
port 3 to 400 that 32 400

256
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:23,960
On tcp just opening that port alone is enough to be vulnerable because it's such a common port

257
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:28,440
People will scan it and find it and then be like, oh this guy's running plex. Yeah

258
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:33,480
so what i've done since this vulnerability to kind of remove myself from the

259
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:40,280
The risk factor is i've closed that port in my firewall and I have started to define a custom

260
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,920
server url in my plex server settings

261
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,920
And I set a dns entry in cloudflare

262
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,040
That then points to my wan ip

263
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:54,520
From there that then points to a traffic instance that's running on the same server as plex

264
00:20:55,400 --> 00:21:03,400
And from there it does a standard reverse proxy thing and just does the remote access as if I was going through port 3 to 400

265
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,040
Like I was last month

266
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:12,680
Very easy fix and I highly recommend you take a look into that. That's a great idea because netscout said that after a scan

267
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:17,640
They conducted they found about 27 000 servers on the internet that can be abused this way

268
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:21,720
So if it doesn't mean you have to shut off remote plex, but it it does

269
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:26,680
It does mean you should probably take some steps to protect yourself. Yeah, just put it behind a reverse proxy

270
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:30,120
I mean doesn't have to be traffic. It could be nginx could be whatever but uh,

271
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:37,640
Just don't open any ports in your firewall. You absolutely don't need to which actually brings me very nicely onto a very very

272
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:41,960
Quick bit of follow-up about the wire guard rant. I had last week on uh open sense

273
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:49,800
Uh turns out like an idiot. I uh, I set a slash 16 subnet in my dhcp server

274
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:55,640
Now for those that don't know what that means is every address from 192.168.0

275
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:59,480
All the way up to 192.168.255

276
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:05,880
Was within my dhcp range. So I had 65 000 or whatever dhcp address is available

277
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:12,700
Uh, the the upshot of that was when I was trying to route through wire guard. I was doing a 192.168.13

278
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,400
subnet and so

279
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:20,840
The remote servers were hearing that were receiving the commands from my laptop or my phone or whatever

280
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:26,600
But they didn't know how to route back to the client device because so far as they were concerned the slash 16

281
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,320
Overrode everything and it just thought everything was on the land. So

282
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:35,960
What I did was I changed the subnet of the wire guard vpn to a 10 dot something

283
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:42,040
So it was a completely different subnet and I reduced my slash 16 down to a more manageable slash 20

284
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:47,080
So i've only got a few thousand like four thousand addresses now instead of having to go through the subnet

285
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:51,880
So i've only got a few thousand like four thousand addresses now instead of 65 000

286
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:57,080
I think that should tie me over for a bit. Right nicely done. I definitely always suggest if people can

287
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:02,520
Different subnets for the different vpn and points makes it so much simpler

288
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,600
uh, you know and i've tried i've tried to do that myself so many times because it can solve you just a few

289
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:15,240
Simple problems and keeps it a little clearer in your head. Like I know that the studio is dot

290
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:22,360
4 and home is dot 7 and the wire guard network is actually a dot 10 network. It's all separated out

291
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:28,360
Yeah, so I just wanted to be absolutely clear that the problem was the user not open sense or wire guard

292
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,280
It was totally my fault

293
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:34,920
And uh, I I owe a huge debt of gratitude to one of our listeners who reached out to me on discord

294
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,320
and uh

295
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:40,760
Did a screen share with me and walked me through it for half an hour because he works in uh,

296
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,900
security down in charlotte in north carolina

297
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:49,420
And he sort of taught me some new stuff about you know networking and triage and that kind of stuff. So that was pretty cool

298
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:55,100
So huge. Thank you to to that listener sounds like somebody we should uh buy a beer for when uh,

299
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,820
community events happen again one day

300
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:00,780
Yeah

301

Spring into cloud 21, you know, the cloud is growing. There's lots of new services and systems more every day

304
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:23,420
It seems and that also means the demand for skilled cloud professionals is growing, too

305
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:28,860
82 of hiring managers say a cloud certification makes a candidate more attractive

306

Ryan writes in with an igpu question. Hey there friends. I'm a big fan of the show

312
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:05,200
I currently i'm in the process of building an off-grid house in new zealand. Oh, oh, that's the dream. No

313
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Right amazing. Can we come visit?

314
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,960
self-hosted on tour

315
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:17,280
Power power consumption is key. So I want a small box to run basically everything I need which thankfully isn't going to be that much

316
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:24,160
My question is is it possible to run a linux server and pass through an igpu to a windows vm for blue iris

317
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,640
While still using the igpu for containerized applications like plex

318
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:35,600
I can't seem to see any problem with this in theory, but wonder if you have any ideas. Love your work ryan

319
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:41,440
What do you think about this one? I have also contemplated. Is there a way I can have my cake and eat it too

320
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:46,560
When it comes to an igpu and a low power system, I thought i'd solve this problem

321
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:53,280
I thought I had the answer and it was a technology called gvt dash g which is a virtual

322
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,080
graphics card kind of slicing

323
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,360
Thing that basically lets you take a an intel

324
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:06,400
Gpu built into your cpu and slice it up into two slices and give one to one vm and one to another so

325
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:12,000
The obvious use case for that is to give one slice to a windows vm for blue iris

326
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:18,080
And then give the other slice to a another linux vm for plex and then keep the host as clean as possible

327
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,240
Yeah, however, and i've written a blog post about this this week

328
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:26,400
unfortunately, the performance of gvtg is

329
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,400
is horrible

330
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:33,060
I found it to be anywhere from 58 to 82

331
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:39,860
Slower than quicksync being run natively on the bare metal host. Holy smokes. I did not expect that at all

332
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:42,660
Yeah, so my test that I did was it was pretty unscientific

333
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:46,340
Um, but it was a very real world use case for me. So I used the

334
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:54,500
Plex sync for offline playback feature and I chose a high bit rate. So about a 38 megabyte

335
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,500
A second. Um

336
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,740
Was it megabit? I always get confused

337
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:01,800
video file encoded with mpeg4 and h264

338
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:05,140
um with a dts

339
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:07,220
master audio soundtrack

340
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:13,940
And I used the four megabytes a second 720p sync for offline playback option within plex

341
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:19,700
And I did that on an ipad, you know, that was the client. I don't think that it really mattered too much

342
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:24,100
But I did a few different tests. So I did a software render. So this is using the

343
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:27,460
intel i5 8500 cpu

344
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:32,980
I picked that up for about a hundred dollars used on ebay. So it's a pretty good value four gigahertz

345
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:36,100
I think 4.1 gigahertz six core cpu

346
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:41,860
With cpu rendering only I saw a 1.1 times speed

347
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:47,540
The best I saw running it natively in quicksync on the host was 10.2

348
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:53,140
And then on a sliding scale between those two numbers of one times and 10 times

349
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:56,020
with the gvtg stuff

350
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,500
Set into two slice mode

351
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:04,580
I saw only about a 1.8 1.9 times. So it was faster than cpu

352
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:08,020
software encoding, you know twice as fast actually

353
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:10,180
but it was

354
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:12,180
80 what something

355
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:16,180
82 slower than running it on the bare metal host. So

356
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:22,580
The other problem that I ran into besides, you know, leaving 80 plus percent performance on the table

357
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,540
With stability, unfortunately

358
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:31,860
That wasn't a great story either the problems I ran into were so I was running proxmox as the base os

359
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,020
because the

360
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:38,180
Proxmox wiki actually has a really great entry about enabling gvtg and

361
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:42,580
Quicksync and pass-through and all that kind of stuff and it was really painless to get going

362
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:46,580
It only took me an hour or so to figure it all out and get it get it going

363
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:51,860
But the stability was just not there. My evidence is only anecdotal though

364
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:56,100
Because of the instability I couldn't really get the log files that I needed

365
00:28:56,580 --> 00:29:03,380
Because the system either had to be hard reset or it was just hanging and processes were just hanging or I was getting kernel panics

366
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:06,180
it was just a mess and

367
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:11,700
You know at the end of the day just not not something you could just let run and and just not have to think about

368
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:17,940
It no, unfortunately, it wasn't and you know things worked fine until I powered on the windows vm

369
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:20,660
that was running blue iris and

370
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:25,300
That system has six 4k cameras going into it. So it's got a decent amount of load

371
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:32,180
Now I know for a fact that the i5 cpu can handle that load because it's been running in my hp290 slim

372
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:36,600
For six months just fine handling everything perfectly

373
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:40,660
But for some reason when it's in the the gvtg mode

374
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:44,580
it just I guess because it's the performance is so poor with the

375
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:50,420
Emulation whatever they're doing to slice the gpu up. However, they're doing it in the intel drivers

376
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:54,420
It just meant that as soon as I powered up blue iris

377
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:57,620
within 30 minutes the whole proxmox system was just

378
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:04,500
Unhappy, you know like the web ui wouldn't load sometimes or you actually go and reboot the system and you'll see

379
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:10,180
System d printing out waiting on kimu guest to shut down for like 30 minutes and

380
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:15,060
So it wasn't just guest stability issues, but the entire host. Uh-huh

381
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:18,580
Oh, yeah, that's that's well, that's just a deal breaker

382
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:26,580
Oh man, alex at the end of the day you want it to be on and functional and yes, this is a hobby and I do enjoy

383
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:31,220
Messing about with servers, but there comes a point. It's not a full-time job

384
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:36,660
No, exactly. There comes a point where you're like this s just needs to work now

385
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:38,980
Yeah, and it just didn't unfortunately

386
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:43,380
I think you cross the threshold of devoting more time to this than most folks quite a while ago

387
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:49,540
I mean even taking a pass at the different encoding options. That's good insight and it really shows you that you're

388
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:53,460
I mean, yeah, it's almost twice as fast if you use gvt

389
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:56,580
When you consider the stability issues

390
00:30:56,580 --> 00:31:04,420
stability issues I would rather just use cpu encoding cpu encoding with quicksync because that's only pulling down about

391
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:09,380
10 watts when it's doing a full 1080p stream and it's running at 10x real time

392
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:14,660
So actually, you know in terms of performance per watt is the best thing out there

393
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:19,220
I actually also just for giggles use my 1080 ti to run one of these trans codes

394
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:24,980
So quicksync is running at 10x a 1080 ti which is pulling down 18 times

395
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:30,420
The amount of power is running at 17 times. So 10x versus 17x. Wow

396
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:35,000
It's a good way to see the performance discrepancy between intel's gpu

397
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,380
And the nvidia gpu right there, isn't it?

398
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:41,380
You can really and then of course cpu with its measly 1.1x. Yeah

399
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:47,220
Performance per watt of the nvidia card was just hilariously bad. Well, sure sure

400
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:53,540
So what i've ended up doing actually and this is to go back to ryan's question now is i've ended up splitting things back out into

401
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:59,940
Physical boxes the blue iris box is uh an hp290 slim. I already had

402
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:05,380
I've put the i5 back into there and I bought another i5 to put into my server. So I have two now

403
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:07,860
Which is a shame but hey ho

404
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:14,020
Um, I was doing some testing on the hp290 for average power usage when I say idle

405
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:18,340
What I mean by that is blue iris is running with its normal sort of load. So

406
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:25,220
At average sort of use power usage I see on that box is anywhere from sort of 10 to 25 watts depending on what it's doing

407
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:30,580
Which for the performance i'm getting, you know, that kind of power usage is is fantastic really

408
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:36,340
And then my main server is pulling it anywhere with you know, it's got I think 12 hard drives in it anywhere from

409
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:39,060
40 to 80 watts

410
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:45,060
Uh at idle so, you know, it's all pretty good pretty low, you know to have all that performance for under 100 watts at idle is

411
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:50,020
I'm pretty happy with that. Yeah. Thanks for sharing the details with us. You mentioned the blog in there. Well

412
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,180
Sam actually writes in with our next question

413
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:56,660
He's a new listener and he says i'd love to hear more about what alex uses for building his blog

414
00:32:56,740 --> 00:33:01,220
And if you've experimented with any other options and what you thought thanks for the great show

415
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:04,040
Well several years ago when I was launching linuxserver.io

416
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:09,140
I actually had a personal blog blog. Katie said dot me that got turned into

417
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:14,740
Linux server's blog and eventually the linux server website and that kind of took over and became its own thing

418
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:20,340
So we used to use wordpress and then we moved to ghost and linux server and this would be

419
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:23,540
I dread to think how long ago like five years ago

420
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:27,220
Um, we moved to ghost and it's been so solid

421
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:32,660
I then ended up spinning up ghost for my own personal blog to do like travel writing and all that kind of stuff as well

422
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:35,860
So I use ghost almost exclusively for blogging

423
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:40,600
Um, and then the perfect media server website is written in mkdocs

424
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:46,420
I live vicariously through you on ghost. That was the route I thought I might go if I were going to set up a blog again

425
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:50,660
And uh, i'm going to put a link to that in the show notes because I think that's worth checking out

426
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:54,180
Although they've changed their model a lot since I first originally found them now

427
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:59,860
They seem like they're really focused on them hosting the blog, but you can still post self-host and all that

428
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:03,140
Self-host out of a container. Yep, and i've actually got a custom theme

429
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:06,580
So I spent quite a bit of time before the perfect media server

430
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:12,740
2020 edition came out making sure that my blog had search and a few other different, you know

431
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:16,740
Like fav icons and and social media icons all that kind of crap. So

432
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:23,540
You can customize the theme relatively easily and all of that stuff is open sourcing github. So

433
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:29,220
You know, I have no complaints about ghost at all. It just does exactly what I need. It looks pretty good and

434
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:33,220
You see it all over the place on the internet really. So I think that's kind of uh,

435
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:39,380
You know proof is in the pudding. How how how many blogs do you see that are in in ghost quite a few?

436
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:41,380
So yeah, it must be okay

437
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:46,100
All right, so I think our final question for today tarmo writes in about user account management

438
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:51,780
Hi guys, i'm a new listener and this show is perfect for me. I started at episode one. Well, thank you

439
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:57,300
I was wondering if you have done a podcast about how you manage different servers and user accounts

440
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:00,420
Do you have ldap or some kind of centralized authentication?

441
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:07,940
I'm finding creating unique user accounts for every server and saving their credentials every time to be a bit of a pain in the bum

442
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,980
I was wondering if you have any thoughts

443
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:14,340
Looking through the episode descriptions. I didn't find anything about this. Thanks

444
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:18,340
Tamo good question because it's been on my mind a lot

445
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:20,180
recently

446
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:27,300
linux distributions like fedora and ubuntu added checkbox active directory support to their installers and

447
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:29,860
That got me thinking

448
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:38,580
Yeah, almost almost wouldn't mind having like an active directory set up here on the land either either actual active directory or some samba

449
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,280
frankenstein version of it, but

450
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,720
truthfully

451
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:46,020
I what I have landed on is standardized accounts

452
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:50,420
So we have a standardized studio account and I have an account on all the systems

453
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:57,620
And the people who work here at the studio, we know those logins and then for our server logins. We use ssh keys

454
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:04,980
But I do long term have my eye on systemd homed as a potential way

455
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:08,100
To solve this at least here on the land at the studio

456
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:11,140
uh, and i'll have a link to that in the show notes, but essentially it

457
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:16,500
It takes your home directory and all of your user information and puts it into json

458
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:22,820
And then you can drop this home directory bundle into a systemd homed enabled system

459
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:29,140
And not only does your home directory show up there, but you also then become a user on the system

460
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:36,260
That's obviously me giving you the short version, but it has some potential so you could see here in the studio where

461
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:42,740
Perhaps we'd keep our master homed directories on the server and then rsync them down to the studio machines in my workstation

462
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:47,380
I don't know every hour every 24 hours. I don't know. I haven't really looked into it yet

463
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:50,660
But if we did that, it would also sync down our user credentials

464
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:58,260
Early days just something that's on my horizon kind of keeping on my radar as a possibility because I don't need something too advanced

465
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:03,060
I've managed large ldap single sign-on installations in the past as part of my job and

466
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:07,140
It worked surprisingly well for a long time, but I just don't really have an interest in doing that anymore

467
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:10,660
I mean you could spin up ldap. You could do free ipa

468
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:14,900
You could do a lot of things, but could do active directory kind of sounds kind of fun. I don't know

469
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:20,900
Yeah, but I don't know about you, but i've got to the point over the last decade where i'm managing so many different

470
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:26,180
Systems some of them are in different houses or different cloud providers or stuff like that that

471
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:28,580
Having them sync back to a central

472
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:36,260
Authentication would just be so complicated. I've kind of got I feel like half decent at context switching

473
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:40,760
Between the different servers and knowing. Oh, right. I don't have that particular

474
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:45,060
Set up on this one and any files. I do need to sync between various things

475
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:47,700
I have my nas and I just mount that via samba

476
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:54,100
And I I don't really worry too much about the home directory anything that's in there as in my opinion at least is

477
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:58,820
Ephemeral it goes in git or it goes in samba or it gets lost. That's kind of how I treat it

478
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:02,900
Yeah, I I think in part it's because I have

479
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:04,980
in full disclosure

480
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:07,940
I've accepted a security practice on the land of the studio that

481
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:12,180
Probably you shouldn't do and that is we don't rotate passwords very often

482
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:16,820
Maybe once every couple of years, but then again, it's convenient. I'll give you that

483
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:20,340
Yeah, and as far as physical access goes it's a lot easier to do that

484
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:25,780
It's not like a organization with an office of 20 here. And then for this for the servers

485
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:28,340
uh, it's it's pretty much all down to

486
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,980
ssh keys and

487
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:35,300
All remote login is usually done with that any access to the lan is done with wire guard

488
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:37,860
And that has its own set of keys

489
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:43,380
So there's some layers there every now and then I still think it's a fair question. I still think to myself

490
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:46,100
I could do this on my own

491
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:51,140
I still think it's a fair question. I still think to myself I could do this a little better

492
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:55,060
And I I do fantasize about a future where I deploy everything

493
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,980
Pragmatically and then everything has central sign on and central storage

494
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:02,980
But I think i'd have to i'd have to like clone myself to get there

495
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:05,860
But this goes back to the point at the beginning, right?

496
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:11,700
You use arch because you just want to get stuff done and I think we don't use a central authentication system

497
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:16,980
Because we don't we just want to get stuff done. Like we don't want to spend the week or two figuring it out and

498
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:20,580
Setting it up and then every time we reinstall a box

499
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:26,500
Attaching it to a domain controller or whatever it is, right? I think it's just pragmatism, isn't it?

500
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,500
That means we're lazy and don't do it

501
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:33,780
Maybe that's a bit of it. We've gotten old what we need is a young ssh

502
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:41,380
Ssh intern to come into the studio and whip us together and get a single sign on going. Yeah, maybe maybe

503
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:44,180
