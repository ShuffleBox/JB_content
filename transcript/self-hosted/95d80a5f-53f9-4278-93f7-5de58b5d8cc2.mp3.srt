00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,540
Joining us on the show today from serverbuilds.net is JDM.

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,220
He's my go-to hardware guru.

3
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:08,900
We also cover the new Raspberry Pi release

4
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:12,360
and I stage an intervention for Chris's Raspberry Pi habit.

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,260
I'm Alex.

6
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:16,020
I'm Chris, and this is Self Hosted 21.

7
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:19,800
Alex, have you ever had the perfect system

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,140
end up being the machine you built yourself?

9
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,980
There's no such thing as the perfect system, is there?

10
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:25,420
It's just between upgrades.

11
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:26,580
I don't know.

12
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:30,320
I kind of think the workstation I have upstairs

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,240
is one of those kind of perfect builds

14
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:36,680
where I had kind of the confluence of the core series

15
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,680
of CPUs were in a good maturity.

16
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,980
Six cores was a good bang for the buck.

17
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,280
It was a good price to get 32 gigs of RAM.

18
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,360
Fast storage was cheap enough

19
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,000
that I can have multiple disks.

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,640
I just love this box I built.

21
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,240
I feel that way about this one I'm talking to you via.

22
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:56,240
It's an i7-8700K with a couple of NVME storage

23
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,640
storage drives and all my actual storage is in the basement.

24
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,760
But I've got an SSD for Windows and an SSD for Linux

25
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,520
for pass-through and stuff like that.

26
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,360
It does everything I could ever dream of.

27
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,440
It's just a champ.

28
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,260
What's yours?

29
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,480
Mine's my Linux box upstairs that I run Manjaro on

30
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,840
with my three 27-inch screens.

31
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,440
It's got an AMD 580 graphics card in it,

32
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:21,760
Intel six core CPU, 64 gigs of RAM in this thing

33
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,280
because I like to run lots of VMs.

34
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,360
And I have multiple disks.

35
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,220
I have a dedicated disk for my home.

36
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:29,640
A dedicated disk for my root and a dedicated disk

37
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,320
for my VMs and a dedicated disk for my steam games

38
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,960
and also my sync folders.

39
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,080
That's the way to go, man.

40
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,240
It's pretty great.

41
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,160
Now it's fun when you're building a desktop

42
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:43,200
but it like really matters when you're building a server.

43
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,420
And that's why it's really great that we are joined

44
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,580
by a very special guest today who helps the community

45
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:53,000
figure these things out with his website, serverbuilds.net.

46
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,760
JDM, welcome to the show.

47
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,880
Hey guys, thanks for having me.

48
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,840
Man, thanks for being here.

49
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,060
And for those that are not familiar with serverbuilds.net,

50
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,520
can you give them like the elevator pitch

51
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,520
on what the website is?

52
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,800
Well, our website's a little stale at the moment

53
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,600
but the forums are really where it's happening.

54
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,600
That's where the action is.

55
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,760
Yeah, the forums and the Discord.

56
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,640
So we got almost, probably what I would say 10K users

57
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,200
like including Reddit, Discord,

58
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,140
but it's a very community focused,

59
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,200
well, for lack of a better word, community.

60
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,360
So I try to engage as much as possible

61
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,560
but anyone can write a guide and post it on the forum.

62
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,600
And then if it's good enough, like we'll help you edit it

63
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,520
and it can become featured.

64
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,640
But mostly I write guides on hardware getting used

65
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:43,060
or enterprise off-lease hardware.

66
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,160
Sometimes it's not even used, sometimes it's brand new.

67
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,840
It's just old stock, but it's all very affordable.

68
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,920
And I basically just try to make it easy

69
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,200
if you're like used to building gaming PCs and whatnot

70
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,020
and you wanna build a server, it's just as easy as that.

71
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:00,920
Yeah, but you do help kind of give people an area

72
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,040
to focus in and some of these guides are pretty useful

73
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,400
because I think Alex, you've used one of them in the past

74
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,460
to build your setup.

75
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,400
I certainly have.

76
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,560
So yes, hi JDM, welcome to the show.

77
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,400
Thanks.

78
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,720
I built when I immigrated a brand new server

79
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,120
and I built your anniversary,

80
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,400
I think it was 1.0 build at that point,

81
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,400
which has a pair of dual LGA 2011 Xeons,

82
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,680
128 gigabytes of RAM, 100 plus terabytes

83
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,680
in the Rosewill LSV4500, I think case.

84
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:36,520
And that was all about a couple of thousand dollars.

85
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,880
So, I mean, the bang for buck that you and your site

86
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,960
enabled me to get was just astonishing really.

87
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:46,280
That power, you know, five years ago would have cost

88
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:50,520
three, four, five times what it cost me a year ago.

89
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,400
The CPUs that you have,

90
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,800
if you look at the retail price of them,

91
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,280
they could be in the 2000 to $3,000 each

92
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,320
back when they were brand new,

93
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:03,160
but now you can get them on eBay for maybe a couple

94
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,880
of hundred bucks, $150.

95
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,800
I think the magic sauce really that you have,

96
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,080
there's a few tools that you kind of share with the community.

97
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,000
There's an absolutely awesome spreadsheet,

98
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,360
the CPU Compendium spreadsheet that you have,

99
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:21,200
which lists every single Xeon in that era

100
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,680
and compares the price to performance, to TDP,

101
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,480
to, you know, everything that you're trying to think about

102
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,840
when you're building one of these servers.

103
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:33,280
So stuff like idle power draw is obviously quite important

104
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,800
for a 24 seven home based box, but then, you know,

105
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,880
Plex transcoding performance might be important

106
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,100
for some people, or, you know,

107
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,920
there's just a whole bunch of stuff that's in there

108
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,840
that's just really great.

109
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,280
And one of the things you actually helped me with,

110
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,400
I don't know if you remember this,

111
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,280
about six to eight months ago,

112
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,160
was I was having some temperature issues in my build

113
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,700
and I was posting on the forums,

114
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,440
or I think it was Discord actually,

115
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,200
with, you know, all the pictures and things like that.

116
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,120
And it turned out that the fan configuration I had in my box,

117
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,960
I just didn't even look, I just bought Noctua's

118
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,120
just because that's what I've always done.

119
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,960
And then you told me, no, Alex,

120
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:14,800
you need high static pressure fans because of XYZ.

121
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,000
I was already to buy a new case at this point, you know?

122
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,180
And I changed the fan configuration based on your advice

123
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:22,680
and you saved me probably another few hundred dollars.

124
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,480
So thanks for that.

125
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,320
Oh, absolutely.

126
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:29,800
And we try to do a full service recommendation

127
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,720
where if you're in that situation and you're like,

128
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,280
okay, I've got the hardware,

129
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:37,580
but I don't have these little tiny details fleshed out,

130
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,720
I try to do my best to pay attention to that.

131
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,080
And say like, okay, well, if you're in a server chassis

132
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,840
and you do need those high static pressure fans,

133
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,000
here's not only the ones you should buy,

134
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
but here's those fans compared to what else is on the market

135
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,480
and here's why they're a better value.

136
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,360
You can get like, you know, for the ones that you got,

137
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,640
they were, I don't know, five pack for 28 bucks

138
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,640
or something like that.

139
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,520
Yeah, they weren't really even very expensive, so.

140
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,360
Right, and sometimes it's just about

141
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,320
buying the correct hardware

142
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,920
and it doesn't always have to be the most expensive.

143
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,880
And especially for servers, I mean,

144
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,760
why did you go that route?

145
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,240
Like, I know you came across it and all that,

146
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,760
but what was so attractive to you about that

147
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,280
versus going for something more modern?

148
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,480
I like the idea I had dual 10 gig on board

149
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:27,760
as well as IPMI and dual Xeon is obviously quite attractive

150
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,320
from a Plex transcoding perspective.

151
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,240
My use case was that I wanted to be able to run

152
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,080
a couple of Kubernetes clusters at once

153
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,200
in addition to my normal server workloads, that is.

154
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,880
I needed to be able to have at least 96 gigs of RAM,

155
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,600
but I went for 128 in the end

156
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,560
because I'm a baller and why not?

157
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:48,360
That board actually tops out at like 512 or 768.

158
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,560
Yeah, it's kind of insane what you can get

159
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,880
and it just blew my mind.

160
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,720
I mean, I kind of, because I was emigrating,

161
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,840
I didn't really have a lot of time to, you know,

162
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:00,640
dig into the minutia like you and your team obviously do.

163
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,560
And it was just really helpful to have all that information

164
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,160
in one place and be able to say, right,

165
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,240
if I buy this board, I'm gonna expect roughly

166
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,760
this performance, it's gonna all work together.

167
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,840
And you were actually lining up vendors as well.

168
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,800
So I bought from, I think the IT Mart at that point.

169
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,520
We've been trying our best to work with a lot

170
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,880
of these vendors that do either off lease servers

171
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:25,400
or they're like resellers or refurbishers

172
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:29,520
and there's a ton on eBay, but they're all very professional

173
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,800
in the business of reselling server hardware.

174
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,000
And you can get some really interesting stuff

175
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,800
that the public just doesn't even know about.

176
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,680
For example, like you said, there's a vendor

177
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,360
that we do group buys with,

178
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,360
and he had a few 6.4 terabyte NVME drives.

179
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,760
They went for, I think, $600 a piece on group buy.

180
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,360
And if you think about that for a second,

181
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,240
consumer NVME drives, your two terabyte brand news,

182
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,720
maybe 270 bucks.

183
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,640
So if you're getting 6.4 terabytes for 600

184
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,360
and then the best part is that it has

185
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,480
a 60 petabyte write endurance.

186
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,360
So that drives never gonna die.

187
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,480
Oh, could you ping me next time that comes up?

188
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,800
Right?

189
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,640
Absolutely.

190
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,920
I mean, that's the kind of thing that you would see

191
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,760
in the discord.

192
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,520
And I mean, maybe that was a little bit of a rare deal,

193
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,480
but stuff like that does come up.

194
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,120
We try to establish that relationship

195
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,840
because these vendors, they don't know

196
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,560
that there's communities out there for that.

197
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,320
They're just selling to businesses and things like that

198
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,920
where if I can establish the link between the vendors

199
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,760
and this large community that's still growing,

200
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,480
I mean, it's growing at a fantastic rate

201
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,640
that helps everyone.

202
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,400
I think what you do so nicely is you bridge the gap

203
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,520
between Googling, I want to build my own server

204
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,880
and actually having a functional list of parts

205
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,440
that all work together, which is just really nice

206
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,760
at different price points as well

207
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,960
and different performance points.

208
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,760
So we've talked about the anniversary build.

209
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,680
That's kind of like the no compromises build almost.

210
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,040
There's another one that you guys do called the NAS killer.

211
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,200
Tell us about that one.

212
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,120
The home NAS is something that's becoming very,

213
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:08,960
very popular.

214
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,560
You can run a bunch of applications on it.

215
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,080
You throw a bunch of hard drives in

216
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,280
and you've got local storage that you can serve

217
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:17,360
to your network and it's nice to have

218
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,280
because you don't have to rely on the cloud.

219
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,480
You can have it local, it's fast

220
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,960
and overall it's a great idea.

221
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:27,960
However, companies like Synology or QNAP or WD,

222
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,560
they have their own little NAS devices,

223
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,840
but really they end up being very expensive

224
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,280
for the hardware you get.

225
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,840
And so the NAS killer was my vision

226
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:43,480
of how you can build a NAS for the same price or cheaper

227
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,520
and have the hardware be much more powerful.

228
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:50,600
So I found some early E3 Xeons

229
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:55,280
and the pass mark was like 7,000 compared to,

230
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,560
even the high end Synology is only like 1900 pass mark.

231
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,480
So you're getting four times the performance.

232
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,160
You can build it yourself and then you have anywhere

233
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,600
from eight to 15 to 30 drive bays,

234
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,400
just depending on what your setup's like,

235
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,640
but really the NAS killer series has evolved

236
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,480
and currently we're on NAS killer four,

237
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,840
NAS killer five is in the works.

238
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,640
The hardware is getting newer and newer as time passes

239
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,520
and stuff starts to go again, like off lease.

240
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,560
So you start to see the hardware,

241
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,360
even though it's a little bit older,

242
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,920
starts to come through and prices start to drop

243
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,320
a little bit more.

244
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,120
But yeah, the NAS killer is our most popular guide

245
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,800
and I think there's like 30,000 views or something

246
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,000
is just on the forum post alone.

247
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,520
But yeah, it's just designed to be the all in one home NAS.

248
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,360
You can run any software you want,

249
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,120
but it's designed to give you that starting point.

250
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,440
Now you're gonna make me wanna build one of those,

251
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,600
but I can't figure out how to fit it in the RV.

252
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,320
I could make that work for sure.

253
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,240
Do you have any advice for anyone who's looking to build

254
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:01,680
a low power box that's gonna be on 24 seven?

255
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,040
So I mean, something that could form the basis

256
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,600
of a self hosted router, for example,

257
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,200
running open sense or PF sense, something like that.

258
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,800
What's really interesting about computer hardware,

259
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,560
especially I would say within the past five to seven years,

260
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,760
performance hasn't increased a whole lot.

261
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,960
So like IPC instructions per clock, yes, it's improving,

262
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:28,320
but really where the improvements have come about

263
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,760
is through power usage.

264
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:34,800
If you look at the modern 1151 socket from Intel,

265
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,760
for example, Intel's eighth and ninth gen CPUs,

266
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,200
they're extremely power efficient.

267
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,360
For example, the HP 290,

268
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,760
it's a little like all in one consumer grade device,

269
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,360
but it idles at like seven Watts

270
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:52,680
and there's a 54 watt TDP seller on it.

271
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,320
And that's the TDP, not the power usage.

272
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,920
But at idle, it's only about seven Watts.

273
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,840
I use one for my PF sense.

274
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,160
And I think that box was only a hundred dollars

275
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,660
on eBay shipped.

276
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,000
But we just look for like little deals like that.

277
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,360
And it really just depends on what your needs are.

278
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,840
But like you said, for PF sense,

279
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,880
it's not gonna be super high.

280
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,840
PF sense or for home assistant or something like that,

281
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,480
that's just gonna be always on.

282
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,720
You know, if you don't wanna build a huge box like I did

283
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,520
and run them all as VMs with pass through

284
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,000
and stuff like that,

285
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,120
it's a really good idea to consider

286
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:32,680
one of these smaller lower power x86 based systems

287
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,920
because, you know, legacy software is gonna support it.

288
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,400
And one of the issues with using the Raspberry Pi

289
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,180
for all of this type of stuff

290
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:44,200
is that you have to hang everything off the USB bus,

291
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,280
number one.

292
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:49,420
And then number two, every ARM CPU is different.

293
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,320
So there's no guarantee that

294
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,400
just because a vendor says they support ARM

295
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,920
through, you know, a Docker container

296
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,120
or something like that,

297
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,680
there's no guarantee it's actually gonna run

298
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,600
on your setup.

299
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,920
So, I mean, that could be proved by

300
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:03,440
the recent Raspberry Pi 4.

301
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,280
And if you look at the software support for that

302
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,040
compared to the three and any model below,

303
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,160
it's totally different.

304
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:12,600
The Pi 4 went through some more significant changes

305
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,800
with the video that are for the better

306
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,660
and a couple of other areas with the bootloader,

307
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,220
which has caused that lag.

308
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,920
But the two to three series,

309
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,080
and there was lots of iterations in between there,

310
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,120
was pretty successful.

311
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,360
I look at it like this, Alex,

312
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,760
it's early days still with the platform

313
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,640
and like any early adoption,

314
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:35,640
there's a series of trade-offs, but also benefits.

315
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,020
Like for example, the USB bus,

316
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:41,700
it is a limitation of the Raspberry Pi platform,

317
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,400
but there are several small board computer platforms

318
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:49,120
that now either have eMMC in addition to PCI

319
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,760
or SATA even.

320
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,360
And then of course with the Raspberry Pi 4,

321
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,800
a guy like yourself,

322
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,500
you really could do all of the storage

323
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,560
over the gigabit ethernet,

324
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,120
which is now on its own dedicated connection.

325
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,280
You know, you could iSCSI everything really.

326
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,440
I might have bought a Raspberry Pi this week.

327
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,020
I think you should try using the network

328
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,480
as your primary storage location.

329
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,140
I think that'd be an interesting experiment.

330
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,480
It's in England.

331
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,740
So I bought one of those brand new eight gigabyte

332
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:17,740
Raspberry Pi 4s to use as a remote ZFS storage endpoint.

333
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:20,020
I was gonna ask if you got the eight gig one.

334
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:20,860
Yeah, I did.

335
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,020
I mean, I really don't need eight gigs on a Pi,

336
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,420
but why not?

337
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,900
Why not have the headroom for future tasks?

338
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,740
Because that means in the future,

339
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:31,580
you could also throw something on there like sync thing.

340
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,460
You have plenty of overhead

341
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,620
for all kinds of additional applications

342
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:36,940
that are just a container away.

343
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:38,860
I mean, it's not necessarily a bad idea.

344
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:42,180
And I would also just say in my hands-on experience

345
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:46,660
with say the Pine 64, Rock Pro 64 and the Pi 4,

346
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:51,220
I could run everything in every container on either.

347
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,700
I didn't run any particular compatibilities.

348
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,900
The OS kind of abstracts that aspect.

349
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:58,460
Once you have the core OS,

350
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,540
as long as it's a mainstream Linux,

351
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:04,420
like Archbase or Debian base, you're pretty much good.

352
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:07,100
Yeah, cause you were talking about Raspberry Pi OS

353
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:10,820
for a little bit on LUP 357 and how they've,

354
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:14,500
I mean, they've just renamed Raspberry into Raspberry Pi OS.

355
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:18,260
And talk a little bit about why you don't really rate it

356
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:19,740
versus say an Ubuntu.

357
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,780
Well, that's a good question because I think the,

358
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:24,020
for me and it's something maybe I haven't made

359
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:27,020
implicitly clear on this show is the transition

360
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:29,340
for treating the Raspberry Pi a little more seriously

361
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:32,460
came when Canonical announced that they were going to make it

362
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:34,820
a first-class Linux platform for them.

363
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:38,180
Like it's actually got staff that are working

364
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,580
to support future Raspberry Pis.

365
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:43,260
And that resonated with me pretty strongly

366
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:45,700
because the Raspberry Pi models tend to stick around

367
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:46,980
for at least five years.

368
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,700
You know, you can still buy older Pis.

369
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:53,260
And Ubuntu LTS is a professional grade operating system.

370
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:55,540
It might not be everyone's favorite,

371
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,620
but it's a professional operating system

372
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:01,340
that is designed to run in production environments.

373
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:04,340
Raspbian to me, or I'm sorry, Raspberry Pi OS,

374
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,940
there are just formerly known as Raspbian.

375
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:07,780
I think it's great.

376
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:08,980
And I think it's really well suited

377
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,820
for new users of the platform.

378
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,260
And I think it's really well suited

379
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,940
for people who want a lightweight desktop

380
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,380
with a web browser.

381
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:18,580
But for those of us that want to use it as a home server

382
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:21,420
or like a backup server, even like in your case, Alex,

383
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,100
which is a great use case,

384
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,740
I think you need something on there

385
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:27,020
that is a little more production grade.

386
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:30,260
And just to the point of low power consumption,

387
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:33,140
just keep in mind that with low power consumption

388
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:36,780
generally comes low performance as well.

389
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,620
And it may be relatively higher performance

390
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,580
compared to another model.

391
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,780
But if you compare it to, for example,

392
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:44,980
a low power consumption Xeon

393
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:47,500
that has eight cores, 16 threads,

394
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,220
Raspberry Pi is never gonna touch it.

395
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:52,260
Even though maybe the power consumption's,

396
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:56,620
let's say 50 watts at idle on the Xeon,

397
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,660
yes, it's more power for sure,

398
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:01,900
but how much more compute horsepower do you have?

399
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:04,580
Here's a really interesting consideration though.

400
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:07,620
So my sister is not a techie.

401
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:10,500
In fact, she works in pharmaceuticals.

402
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:14,900
And when the Pi for eight gig came out this weekend,

403
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,780
I ordered one and sent it to her.

404
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:19,460
She put it together,

405
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:22,060
plugged in the USB hard drive in half an hour

406
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,780
over a Skype call.

407
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,420
I can't imagine asking her

408
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,660
to put together a remote Xeon system for me.

409
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:34,020
I know that building computers is just like adult Lego,

410
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,700
but I've been doing it since I was 13.

411
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,660
She's never even so much as, I mean,

412
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:39,500
when her Mac breaks,

413
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,900
she goes to the Apple store and takes it there.

414
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,660
It's someone else's problem.

415
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:46,100
So the Pi, for me at least,

416
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,820
fulfills a really great need of being like a computer

417
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:53,260
in a box that I can still mostly own every piece of,

418
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,900
like I can choose the case,

419
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,900
I can choose the bootloader and that kind of thing

420
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:01,220
without having to install a CPU or a power supply

421
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,260
or something like that.

422
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,100
I totally agree.

423
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:07,060
And I think that it absolutely has a purpose

424
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:10,460
and I'm not against a Pi or anything like that,

425
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:13,620
but you do have to consider that it's still not x86.

426
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:16,660
So if there's applications that you wanna run there,

427
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,460
you do run into that hard limitation.

428
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,460
I think that's very fair.

429
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:21,660
You have to go into it with the acknowledgement

430
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:24,500
that there's just not the level of software compatibility

431
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,020
to both the point you guys have both made

432
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,300
and I have to agree with.

433
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:30,020
And you are probably not gonna get

434
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:31,700
quite the right bang for your buck.

435
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,180
I wonder though,

436
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:36,220
because I run three right now is what I have remaining,

437
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,700
Raspberry Pis that are currently running

438
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:43,700
and even with the overhead of being inverted from DC power,

439
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:48,100
I think all three of them are maybe drawing 30 Watts.

440
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,500
I'm not sure cause it's mixed in with my router,

441
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,900
my switch and a wifi access point in there,

442
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:56,060
but the draw is so substantially low

443
00:18:56,060 --> 00:19:00,140
that I can run them for days off the battery power.

444
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:00,980
That's pretty great.

445
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:03,900
Yeah, so Chris, your server seat,

446
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,300
I think that's what we're gonna dub it now.

447
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,500
JDM had potentially some ideas

448
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,980
for what we could do to maybe replace,

449
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,460
I don't know if we can replace the Pi,

450
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:15,540
obviously you love yours,

451
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:18,220
but yeah, maybe we could do something a bit different.

452
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,820
I'm open to the idea, I gotta be honest.

453
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,660
I think the Raspberry Pi would be a good

454
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,540
like one year experiment right now,

455
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:27,860
but I really wish at the end of the day,

456
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:31,900
all of this was virtualized, that everything was in a VM.

457
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,540
So I'm trying to stage a Pi intervention here, JDM,

458
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,380
help me out.

459
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:40,380
So what has built in KVM, a battery backup

460
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:44,580
and is X86 and low power?

461
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:45,420
Do you know?

462
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:46,900
A ghost.

463
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:49,100
I was gonna say, it sounds like a SuperNUC.

464
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,140
It's a laptop.

465
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,380
Oh, very fair.

466
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:53,900
Yeah, okay, all right.

467
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:57,500
So I have actually found great success

468
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:02,500
using even low end consumer refurbished laptops

469
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,420
for situations like yours,

470
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:08,020
because a lot of times they have NVME slots.

471
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:09,980
So you can have one or two NVME slots,

472
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:12,660
even on like, let's say a $300 laptop.

473
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:15,460
And maybe it has like an Intel Pentium Gold,

474
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:21,500
I believe the model is like the G5405 or something like that.

475
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:24,260
It's a two core, four thread, it's got Intel quick sync.

476
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,820
So if you wanna do Plex transcoding,

477
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:28,820
you can do 15 trans codes easily.

478
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:32,700
It's got an X86 CPU, so you can run Linux,

479
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,540
you can run Windows,

480
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:35,580
you can run basically anything you want.

481
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:39,180
You can do 16, 32 gig of RAM,

482
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:42,220
and it's got ethernet wifi,

483
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:44,020
again, built in battery backup.

484
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,380
You can leave the lid closed,

485
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:47,780
tuck it away somewhere on a shelf.

486
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,660
That screams to me, laptop.

487
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:53,060
You know, I didn't expect this line.

488
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,460
I gotta say, that's pretty interesting.

489
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,500
Did you have a specific laptop in mind?

490
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:00,180
The ones that come on eBay that I've been eyeing

491
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,340
and I've used personally,

492
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:03,980
like right now at my home,

493
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:06,860
I have an LTE network that's completely separate.

494
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:09,900
It's a, I kind of jokingly call it a PLAN.

495
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,780
It's a physical LAN, it's not a VLAN,

496
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,620
it's totally separate.

497
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:17,940
But right now I'm running that off of a router OS

498
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:21,020
on a Lenovo,

499
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,700
I have to look at the exact model number.

500
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:23,940
Maybe you can put it in the show notes,

501
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,500
but it's just a Lenovo.

502
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,300
Like I said, it's got the Pentium Gold,

503
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:31,220
and then it runs a USB LTE connection,

504
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:33,900
and that is just for my smart home devices,

505
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:37,500
so it's totally separate from my regular LAN.

506
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,460
But you could do something similar

507
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:41,380
where if you wanna run Docker

508
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:44,300
and containerize everything on the laptop,

509
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,140
you could do that.

510
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,940
Yeah, I was thinking the ThinkPad.

511
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:49,060
Yeah, and the other advantage

512
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:51,180
is if I have to go into crash cart mode,

513
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,780
it has a built-in screen and keyboard.

514
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:53,780
Absolutely.

515
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:58,260
And that has saved my butt quite a few times,

516
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,740
and especially in your situation,

517
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:02,540
leave the lid closed, leave it plugged in,

518
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:05,340
and then you can actually run it off of a UPS

519
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:07,220
or whatever battery you have,

520
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:09,460
and then you also have the laptop's internal battery.

521
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:11,980
So the possibilities are endless,

522
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,820
and you obviously don't have to go that route.

523
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:15,340
You could go for a NUC.

524
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,820
Those are a little bit more expensive

525
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:19,300
for the performance you get, actually.

526
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,140
But again, you don't have the screen

527
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,980
and KVM and all that.

528
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:23,820
Right?

529
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,260
I mean, it's hard to argue with a used ThinkPad

530
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,740
because honestly, it's still gonna be more powerful

531
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:28,580
than the Raspberry Pi.

532
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,900
And what I'm using these Pis for

533
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,860
is gonna work great on a laptop

534
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:35,980
if it's just a headless Linux with KVM.

535
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:39,820
Home Assistant, of course, Plex, obviously.

536
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:41,700
SyncThing's a big deal for me.

537
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,980
I have a very simple Markdown viewer application

538
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,420
that I like to use.

539
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,820
Those things will be no problem.

540
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:48,860
The one that's tricky,

541
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:51,300
and I don't know exactly what to do with, is Shinobi,

542
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,380
because that's a lot of disk I.O.,

543
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,900
and it's a lot of network I.O.,

544
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,680
and Shinobi's one of those applications

545
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:59,300
that just wants to have the entire OS,

546
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,800
which either means I gotta virtualize it,

547
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,820
or I gotta put it on dedicated hardware.

548
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:05,180
Could you give me a quick rundown of Shinobi and what the...

549
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:09,820
Yeah, it's basically just a closed-circuit,

550
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:13,220
self-hosted capture system for RTSP camera feed.

551
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:15,680
So I have a bunch of Wwise cameras

552
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,020
that have a firmware on them

553
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,820
that just lets me capture the video off them

554
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:19,940
directly over the network.

555
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:23,140
And this thing provides recording of those videos

556
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,940
and playback and viewing,

557
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,540
kind of like a DVR system,

558
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,860
and you can pull up all the feeds

559
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:29,340
and look at them in a dashboard

560
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,020
and cut out clips and segments.

561
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:32,380
And it's great,

562
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:34,700
because sometimes I take my RV in wild places

563
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,660
and I wanna have surveillance when I'm not there,

564
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,100
or like right now it's in a shop

565
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:41,240
and I wanna check in on what's going on every now and then.

566
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:44,100
I found that it basically keeps the box

567
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,940
totally busy the entire time.

568
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:47,820
I don't wanna run two laptops.

569
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:50,560
Well, okay, that's fair.

570
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,580
Are you aware of what QuickSync is?

571
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:54,220
Yeah, like Intel's built-in,

572
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:57,780
improved H.264 encoding accelerator.

573
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:02,620
Correct, and it's seen huge generational improvements.

574
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:05,020
So this is something that's been very popular

575
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,100
on serverbuilds.net.

576
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,980
We've been recommending QuickSync

577
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:10,300
transcoding boxes for Plex.

578
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:15,140
A seventh-gen Celeron two-core can do 20 transcodes

579
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:19,060
from 1080p to 1080p or 720p.

580
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:19,900
Without us, what?

581
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,580
Did you just say 20?

582
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:22,880
20.

583
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,300
Wow. Wow.

584
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:28,160
Okay, so that's a scale I just did not appreciate.

585
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,520
That's including laptop CPUs.

586
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,700
The biggest performance increase

587
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,020
that we've seen with QuickSync

588
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:37,300
and through my testing has been generational.

589
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:40,900
So you go from seventh-gen to eighth-gen to ninth-gen Intel,

590
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,980
and currently we're on 10th-gen.

591
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:45,420
You can get a 10th-gen Intel QuickSync laptop

592
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:48,100
for about 300 bucks off of eBay,

593
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:51,100
but it really doesn't really matter what the processor is.

594
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:54,880
It's more about, again, the generation.

595
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,780
There's some indication that faster processors are faster

596
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:00,180
and do support more transcodes,

597
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:05,000
but even the very baseline models support a ton.

598
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,380
And you were talking about Shinobi.

599
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,860
I'm not sure if that can leverage QuickSync.

600
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:10,740
It might be able to,

601
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:13,060
but I know that its competitor Blue Iris,

602
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:15,020
which is a Windows-based application,

603
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:16,660
can absolutely leverage QuickSync.

604
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:18,900
And they just had a recent update

605
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:23,900
where it almost completely removes the CPU usage entirely.

606
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:28,620
I actually use QuickSync for Twitch streaming and recording.

607
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:33,020
So I have an i9-9900K in my desktop,

608
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,260
but if I were to use NVENC,

609
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:36,900
which is NVIDIA's encoding on the GPU,

610
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,700
I would lose a little bit of performance,

611
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:41,380
and there is some indication that it does mess

612
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:43,040
with your frame times a little bit.

613
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,940
Whereas if I use the iGPU,

614
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:48,820
which you do have to enable manually in your BIOS,

615
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:52,440
but that iGPU is not doing anything.

616
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,860
There's no monitors plugged into it or anything.

617
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:55,100
It's just sitting there idle.

618
00:25:55,100 --> 00:26:00,100
So using it to encode a Twitch stream, for example,

619
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:03,060
or a YouTube video, it works fantastically.

620
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:06,060
The quality's amazing.

621
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:09,900
It sees about 0.6% CPU usage while it's doing it.

622
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:10,820
Wow.

623
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:12,100
That's pretty great.

624
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,780
Hardware circuitry, huh?

625
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,100
Yeah, that is really great.

626
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,740
And the other thing that's tricky for me

627
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:19,600
along with this is heat, because it is in this seat.

628
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:22,980
It's tricky to keep my ambient temperature

629
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:25,540
below 80 degrees Fahrenheit.

630
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:28,400
I wouldn't worry about it too much with the laptop.

631
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,240
They can handle it.

632
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:32,620
And like I said, QuickSync is very power efficient.

633
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:35,860
It doesn't really require too much of a CPU resource.

634
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:39,500
So for example, if you were to run that original setup

635
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,320
like we were talking about,

636
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:45,620
you could run Docker on Linux on the laptop.

637
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:47,660
And then if you were to run Plex on it and you say,

638
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:50,760
okay, we'll want Plex to leverage that CPU transcoding,

639
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:55,760
you can actually pass just the iGPU through to Plex,

640
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:59,940
through the Plex container and leverage it that way.

641
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:03,180
But if you were to do a separate NVR build,

642
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,220
like you said with Shinobi,

643
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:06,720
or I would prefer Blueiris

644
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,260
because I know it can leverage QuickSync very well.

645
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:11,220
I would recommend a separate box.

646
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,780
And maybe I just keep a Pi doing that

647
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:13,740
and then move everything else.

648
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,180
The laptop idea is a good one.

649
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:17,740
I'm trying to ride the Raspberry Pis out for a year

650
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:20,180
just as like a self-education program.

651
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,060
And I know that a lot of people out there in the community

652
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:22,900
are trying to use Pi.

653
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:25,860
So I just, I wanna be well versed in them.

654
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,620
And I definitely am now.

655
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:29,500
I'm definitely deep.

656
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:32,720
I'm like tribbles with the Raspberry Pis

657
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,060
in the RV these days.

658
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:36,660
But I could see this probably,

659
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:37,820
I don't know, I'd have to go look back

660
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:40,660
when we started this, see where my year mark is.

661
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:41,980
I could see switching to this.

662
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:44,020
This is how it goes with JDM, Chris.

663
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:46,980
He has these little nuggets of ideas

664
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:48,340
that kind of sprinkle into your brain.

665
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:50,440
You go away for a couple of weeks and you're like,

666
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,780
damn it, that's what I need to do.

667
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,220
I need to buy an old ThinkPad now.

668
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:57,300
Well, you know what's funny is for like a hot half a second,

669
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:00,980
I think I glanced at an old laptop in the studio

670
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,060
and I looked at that and I went,

671
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:04,500
huh, I wonder if that'd work as a server.

672
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,580
And then I thought, nah, not a laptop.

673
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:09,300
Especially if you could power it directly off DC

674
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,660
if you got the voltage right.

675
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:13,660
Absolutely you can, they're mostly 19 volt DC.

676
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,180
Yeah, I bet I could make it work.

677
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:18,540
The other thing that I want you to think about,

678
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:21,260
and I don't know, this is for me personally,

679
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,780
this is the way I work.

680
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:25,300
But you said that you're using Pis

681
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,760
because you like to play and you like to learn

682
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,260
and that's something you're trying to learn.

683
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:32,620
For me, I don't like to play with things

684
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,260
that I just want to play and work.

685
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,820
Yeah, there is that, yeah.

686
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:38,220
So if you can get your baseline set up

687
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,340
where you've got your router virtualized

688
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:44,220
and all of your services that you need to work work

689
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,660
on like, let's say the laptop setup we're talking about

690
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:49,700
or something else, then you would actually have

691
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,740
more freedom to play with the Pis

692
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:56,220
where you don't necessarily have that back of your head

693
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:59,520
saying, oh, well, if I mess this up,

694
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,620
then I need to redo everything.

695
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:04,740
Yeah, there's advantages to,

696
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,660
like I don't want to be too critical of the Pis

697
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:09,480
because I'm impressed that the advantage to me

698
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,660
diving into this and really using them

699
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,940
is I truly am learning what they're capable of and not.

700
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:18,320
And I have to say, they really have run pretty solidly.

701
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,980
The biggest mistake I made early on was I used Raspbian

702
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,880
and I had to rebuild a couple of things.

703
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,580
But now I'm quite happy.

704
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:28,380
In fact, having my storage on the USB bus

705
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:29,920
hasn't really been an issue because I'm getting

706
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,740
these Samsung T5 disks.

707
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:34,380
They transfer it like 280 megabytes a second,

708
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:36,240
which is as good as my wifi is gonna do

709
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,940
for the Plex playback.

710
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:40,700
So even the disk IO, I've been fairly happy with.

711
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,780
And then I'm gonna also add in there because of the cost,

712
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:45,620
what I'm doing now on this trip I'm taking

713
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:50,100
is I've brought a cold Pi ready to go in a case all set up

714
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:53,060
and I have them installed in Velcro

715
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,500
to the inner walls of the seat.

716
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,420
So if one of these Pis dies,

717
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:59,420
I just grab the cold standby, literally just pull

718
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:01,540
the one Velcroed in, pop the new one in,

719
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:04,900
it has Velcro on it already, put all the same connections in

720
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,740
and power it up, it's good to go.

721
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:08,980
Oh, but cold Pi is not as tasty.

722
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:10,060
It's true.

723
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:14,300
But I do feel like I am constantly walking on eggshells.

724
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:16,380
I will acknowledge that aspect of it.

725
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:18,900
But that could also just be because it's such a new platform

726
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:19,740
to me.

727
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:22,220
Right, but I think that you would gain

728
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:26,380
a lot more experience where you can sort of

729
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:29,860
piecemeal implement things that you're testing with the Pi

730
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:31,420
if you have a good backbone.

731
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:34,260
Yeah, I could be riskier if it wasn't my production device.

732
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:36,060
And that's the same reason I ended up splitting out

733
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:36,900
my PFSense.

734
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,780
I mean, I used to run it on top of Proxmox

735
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:43,220
with a quad Intel gigabit NIC card in the main hypervisor

736
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,980
in that anniversary build.

737
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:48,580
I ended up building a separate PFSense box.

738
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,740
I've since switched it to OpenSense,

739
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:52,860
but I ended up building a separate box

740
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:55,500
because I didn't want my internet to go down

741
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:58,540
every time I rebooted my server, right?

742
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:02,180
The uptime now is 115 days or something.

743
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:05,540
But when it happens, or what was happening with me

744
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:09,620
with Proxmox was I was getting hard lockups,

745
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,500
kernel panics, basically.

746
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,700
And so every time that happened,

747
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:15,140
I had to walk down to the basement and push the button

748
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:17,460
because IPMI wasn't working or something.

749
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,100
It was completely weird.

750
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:21,740
And I just ended up thinking, right,

751
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:24,500
my internet needs to be separate from my server.

752
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,500
That's just something that needs to happen.

753
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,820
Part of building a home lab is identifying

754
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:32,860
those key points of this needs to not fail.

755
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:36,140
What do I need to do to make it perfectly reliable?

756
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:37,860
And then on the other hand,

757
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:40,140
what kind of hardware do I want to play with

758
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:43,300
where I have that freedom and the flexibility?

759
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:46,580
Yeah, a home lab, and this is a bugbear of Morgan, actually.

760
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:48,620
He was on the show a couple of episodes ago.

761
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:49,900
He and I were talking the other day,

762
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:52,700
and he was like, a home lab is not just someone's server.

763
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:56,700
A home lab is an actual thing with multiple switches

764
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:57,940
and multiple servers and whatever.

765
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:01,500
So the purists out there will be probably cringing

766
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:04,340
a little bit at my definition of a home lab as one box,

767
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:05,180
but-

768
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:06,700
Hey, home labs can be virtual too.

769
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,420
They don't have to be just physical.

770
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:10,140
It's true. That is true.

771
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:13,060
So I have a question for you, JDM, about your setup

772
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:15,260
and how many terabytes you have

773
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:17,740
and what does your home lab look like?

774
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:22,100
Being a hardware guy, I'm expecting some good stuff here.

775
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:25,100
Yeah, it's been an interesting process

776
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,820
because we just recently moved to Denver

777
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:30,860
and that was a cross country move for us.

778
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:33,260
But as some of you may know,

779
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:35,020
I do stream occasionally on Twitch.

780
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:37,300
And in the past couple of streams,

781
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:40,060
I've been implementing a storeinator.

782
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:45,060
So that was kindly given to us by a fellow

783
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:48,500
server builds member who works at Backblaze.

784
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:51,340
And I spent a little bit of time implementing that

785
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:56,060
and I've got 30 drives of mixed eight and 10 terabytes

786
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:57,940
running Unraid on that box.

787
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:59,340
I have to wipe the pool of drool

788
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,780
from underneath my chin right now.

789
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:04,420
A storeinator, oh, that's the stuff of dreams.

790
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:06,300
I just recently posted about it on Twitter

791
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:08,900
and it was nice to have Unraid retweet me,

792
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:13,900
but it's been an interesting challenge to get that to work.

793
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:18,380
In the past, I've run pretty much all super microservers,

794
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:22,100
a couple of 3Us, 16 bays, and then a 45 bay DAS,

795
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,300
which is a direct attached storage.

796
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:29,060
It's just basically a JBOD, just a bunch of disks

797
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:31,860
and that connects to the main server.

798
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:35,140
So in the past, I've run that and I've condensed down

799
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:36,620
a little bit into the storeinator

800
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:40,260
where I can have 45 bays in for you.

801
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:41,900
So are you running Unraid on that?

802
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:45,780
Yes, I run Unraid mostly and shout out to you guys

803
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:47,540
for having the best Docker containers.

804
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:51,700
I run exclusively LSIO when possible.

805
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,020
Oh, we'll have to change that

806
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:54,860
because I'm not part of them anymore.

807
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:57,540
Are you officially not part of them?

808
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:58,860
I'm officially not, no.

809
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:00,820
Oh, okay, well.

810
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:02,700
I use them too and I still think they're great.

811
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,740
Thanks for any work that you did do on them

812
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:07,380
because they've been pretty great.

813
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:10,780
But aside from that, yeah, I do run Unraid

814
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:13,380
and of course, Plex and all that.

815
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:16,260
That's kind of where I got started was the Plex subreddit

816
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:17,900
and I was a mod there and helped out

817
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,420
the team there for a while.

818
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:21,540
I started doing a couple of hardware builds

819
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:23,620
and split off into serverbuilds.net

820
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:26,780
because we just really took over the Plex subreddit

821
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:30,260
and I didn't really want to continue to do that.

822
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:33,100
Right, it's fascinating because it's a theory.

823
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:35,300
I think we probably said on the show a couple of times

824
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:38,140
but Alex and I talk about it off air all the time

825
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:42,980
that a lot of this journey starts at Plex

826
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:45,500
and sometimes our audience kind of hates to hear that

827
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:48,820
because we got a pretty hardcore open source aficionados

828
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:51,980
out there and they prefer we talk about other things

829
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:54,860
but I think you really gotta give Plex credit.

830
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,700
It draws a lot of people into this space

831
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:59,980
and it's kind of like the toe in the water

832
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:01,940
that leads to bigger and bigger things.

833
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:03,900
So JDM, I'm curious, now that you've kind of got

834
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:08,400
a fairly sophisticated setup, what do you find to be

835
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,180
the most frustrating or troubling aspect of the setup?

836
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:13,980
Like what's the thing that you have to constantly deal with

837
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,460
or manually fix?

838
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:20,460
Luckily, not much because I choose my hardware

839
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:24,220
in a way that I don't need to do anything with it

840
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:27,540
once it's implemented and now I'm more geared

841
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,500
at helping other people find hardware

842
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,660
or I can start playing around with software

843
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:35,100
because everyone has their specialties.

844
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:38,020
I love hardware, I love working with hardware

845
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:40,260
but software is definitely one of my weaker points

846
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:42,260
so if I can start to gain experience with that

847
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:44,980
because I have that solid hardware base

848
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:48,740
where I have the freedom to do whatever I want basically.

849
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:51,180
That is my goal really is just to start moving

850
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:54,580
into more software, developing my own experience with that

851
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:57,860
and relaying those experiences to other people

852
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:00,820
because everyone has their own way of doing things

853
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:04,260
and not to say my way is any better than anyone else's

854
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:08,940
but we both, you guys and server builds,

855
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:10,660
we have our own communities

856
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:12,880
and I'm sure that there's a crossover there

857
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,260
but we do have our own ways of doing things

858
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:17,860
and if there's more information out there

859
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:20,940
on how to do something or if there's a gap in knowledge,

860
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:23,520
I'd like to try to fill that.

861
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,260
But as far as challenges go,

862
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:27,600
I don't really have a whole lot.

863
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:31,000
Right now it's kind of getting everything

864
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:36,000
to where it is what I would say like peak efficiency

865
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:40,540
so I'm trying to cut down power usage where I can

866
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:43,020
if it's downgrading a processor or moving

867
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:44,180
to a different system.

868
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:46,040
Dialing it in in a sense.

869
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,980
That's great, that's a great, I love that phase.

870
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:50,820
And unfortunately, I kind of live by the motto.

871
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:53,360
It's like, oh, I have a spare part.

872
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,380
It's not really a spare part.

873
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:56,060
It's an unfinished build now

874
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:57,440
so now I have to do something with it.

875
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,500
That could get expensive real fast.

876
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,380
Oh, absolutely.

877
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,180
So back when we had Wendell on the show,

878
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,940
I asked him how many terabytes he had

879
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:09,140
and I had this vision of like a top gear style leaderboard

880
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:11,780
for guests as to how many terabytes they have.

881
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:12,780
Oh, sweet, yeah.

882
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:14,620
I don't know if I've asked every guest

883
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:17,460
but I'm gonna ask you, how many terabytes do you have?

884
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:19,420
Raw or formatted?

885
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:22,740
Oh, I don't think we've ever clarified.

886
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:27,740
I guess, I mean, I think we should consider raw potential

887
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:30,660
versus available.

888
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:32,820
Yes, because Wendell just dropped the petabyte bomb

889
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:35,260
so I mean, I don't think we're gonna compete with that

890
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:36,580
but maybe.

891
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:38,260
I'm not quite there.

892
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,940
I do have multiple unrated setups

893
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:41,780
so I do have the one in the store inator.

894
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:43,260
I have one that's in a 15 bay

895
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:46,460
and I have another one that I'm prepping for another 15 bay

896
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:49,100
but I'm nearing half a petabyte.

897
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,460
Wow, okay, that's pretty cool.

898
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:52,580
Where do you buy your drives from

899
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:54,100
and what sort of things do you look for

900
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,540
when you're buying hard drives?

901
00:37:55,540 --> 00:38:00,380
I exclusively buy WD Shuckables and.

902
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,220
Me too.

903
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:02,420
Exclusively.

904
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:03,460
They're fantastic

905
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:06,260
because they're really just HDST Helium drives

906
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:11,020
to the most part with a little bit of firmware trickery

907
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:13,540
but there's really not a whole lot to consider.

908
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:16,220
Buy eight terabyte WDs or higher,

909
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:20,780
so eights, tens, 12s, 14s, soon to be coming out 16s

910
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:22,900
and they're the best value for the money

911
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:25,220
and nothing can touch them right now.

912
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,820
That's a great tip.

913
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:30,580
Alex is a Shucking fan and it's his favorite thing

914
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:32,540
so I don't think you could have had a more perfect answer

915
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:33,580
for this show.

916
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:35,660
Yep, yep, yep, yep, I love it.

917
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:36,980
There's a couple different models.

918
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:40,700
There's the Elements, there's the Easy Stores

919
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:43,300
which are a Best Buy exclusive but it doesn't matter.

920
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:45,460
They're all the same drives inside.

921
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:46,900
The only thing that you have to consider

922
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,580
just like SAS hard drives,

923
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:50,620
if anyone's familiar with SAS hard drives,

924
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:53,540
they have a 3.3 volt standby.

925
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:56,780
There's a guide on our forum on how to surpass this issue.

926
00:38:56,780 --> 00:39:00,540
A lot of people use Kapton tape to just tape off the pins

927
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:03,340
but you can just simply remove the correct SATA wire

928
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:04,540
and it'll function.

929
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:07,780
Just cut the wire, yeah, cut the green one.

930
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:08,620
I don't know if it's green.

931
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:10,220
Please don't cut the green wire.

932
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:12,220
Check which one you're cutting.

933
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:13,580
If you're using like a server backplane,

934
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:14,420
like a Super Micro,

935
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:17,620
they already have the 3.3 volt standby taken care of

936
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:19,780
so you don't even need to worry about it.

937
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:21,580
But yeah, they're extremely versatile.

938
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:24,740
They're even great in their own USB 3.0 enclosure

939
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:27,500
for those Raspberry Pi guys that we won't talk about.

940
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:32,380
All right, well JDM, thank you very much for joining us.

941
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:34,300
It's been a real pleasure to talk to you.

942
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:36,500
Is there any way you'd like to send folks?

943
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,980
Yeah, you can check out serverbuilds.net.

944
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:40,220
Like I said in the intro,

945
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:42,420
the website's a little stale right now.

946
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:44,860
Really everything's happening on the forums,

947
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:47,180
which is forums.serverbuilds.net.

948
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:48,460
And you're on Twitter, aren't you?

949
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:49,300
I'm on Twitter.

950
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:51,380
I don't really do a whole lot on there.

951
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:53,980
Apart from give me grief about my TV stand.

952
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:54,820
That's true.

953
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:59,460
At JDM underscore what with three A's.

954
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:01,060
You can also just hit me on Discord.

955
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:03,020
Everyone bothers me on Discord.

956
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:05,260
I think we've got about 8,000 members in our server.

957
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:07,620
So it's growing and it's pretty large.

958
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:08,780
We'll put a link to the Discord

959
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:10,620
and the forums in the show notes.

960
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:13,620
And I think it's a great companion Discord to our own.

961
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:16,500
Those are two Discords in a pod.

962
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,180
Is that a thing?

963
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:19,200
Can we make that a thing?

964
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,040
Oh, absolutely.

965
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:23,640
I think we should do like a partnered Discord something

966
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:26,060
and maybe just cross link or something like that.

967
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:26,900
I love it.

968
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:28,780
And you've given me a lot to think about.

969
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:30,940
I think the laptop is a serious route

970
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:33,420
that I'm gonna consider when the Pi experiment ends.

971
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:35,220
And now it's just a matter of how soon

972
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:36,580
does the grand experiment end

973
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:39,900
and can I find the right ThinkPad on eBay?

974
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:42,820
I'm kind of hoping I can stretch it out long enough

975
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:44,600
to get a great deal on a 10th gen

976
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,460
to really take advantage of QuickSync.

977
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:48,020
Think about it this way.

978
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:49,140
You don't need a ThinkPad

979
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:52,580
because that is their sort of mid to upper tier laptop.

980
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:54,420
You just need the hardware.

981
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:55,700
The screen doesn't matter.

982
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:56,540
Keyboard doesn't matter.

983
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:57,740
Mouse doesn't matter.

984
00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:00,100
It's really just what CPU does it have?

985
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:02,620
Does it have the NVMe slots that I need

986
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:04,580
or hard drive slots?

987
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:05,600
How much RAM can it support?

988
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,440
And that's about it.

989
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,980
It makes a good point, Chris.

990
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:08,940
Wise words, JDM.

991
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:11,980
Maybe we'll have you back when I do make the switch.

992
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:12,800
Oh, awesome.

993
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,640
I would look forward to it.

994
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,540
And just one other thing.

995
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:19,100
There is one guide that I do want you to check out, Chris.

996
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:21,260
I wrote it about a year ago.

997
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:23,780
It's called how to create a mobile media server

998
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:26,780
with Plex's new app for Windows.

999
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:30,580
So right now it's a Windows thing only,

1000
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:35,300
but it would be somewhat interesting to you particularly

1001
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:39,300
because what you can do is, just to give a TLDR,

1002
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:40,780
you can use Plex's new app,

1003
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:45,780
download media from any shared server onto the app,

1004
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:47,880
like you're syncing it locally,

1005
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:51,140
and then also run Plex Media Server on that computer

1006
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:52,820
and then share that media out.

1007
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:53,980
Oh, sure, sure.

1008
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:57,220
It's really easy and it's got a nice UI.

1009
00:41:57,220 --> 00:42:00,020
It's not an intended use for the app, but it does work.

1010
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:01,400
So check that one out.

1011
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,240
I just found it.

1012
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,080
I will.

1013
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,500
Thanks very much, JDM, for joining us.

1014
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:05,540
Thanks, guys, for having me.

1015
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:07,060
I hope I could, I mean,

1016
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:08,740
I know we talked about a lot of different things,

1017
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:10,700
but the rabbit hole goes way deeper.

1018
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:11,660
We'll have to chat more.

1019
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:13,100
Well, I look forward to chatting on Discord,

1020
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:14,980
but I look forward to having you back on the show too.

1021
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:15,820
Of course.

1022
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:16,640
Thanks for having me, guys.

1023
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,480
Appreciate it.

1024
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:22,480
I'll see you guys next time.
