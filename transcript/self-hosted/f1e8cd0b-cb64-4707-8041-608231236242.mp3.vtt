00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
You're now listening to Chris and the Badger, a presentation of the self-hosted podcast

00:08.000 --> 00:09.000
with Chris.

00:09.000 --> 00:11.600
A lot of options out there, but you can use this stack.

00:11.600 --> 00:12.600
I've tested this.

00:12.600 --> 00:13.760
I've refined it over the years.

00:13.760 --> 00:14.760
And Alex.

00:14.760 --> 00:17.840
I don't think there's a better solution really if you're willing to put the effort in.

00:17.840 --> 00:26.440
And featuring special guests, Morgan the Doorbell Guy, Wes Payne, an RV, JDM, what?

00:26.440 --> 00:32.280
Jonathan, hang on a sec, this goes on for a while.

00:32.280 --> 00:40.440
Geerling and your hosts who are celebrating episode, oh, come on, alright.

00:40.440 --> 00:41.440
And Jeff Geerling.

00:41.440 --> 00:42.440
Okay.

00:42.440 --> 00:43.440
Now your host.

00:43.440 --> 00:46.760
Snap Raid and Merger FS and I endorse this media server build here.

00:46.760 --> 00:50.640
Celebrating episode number 50, a long-term relationship with something.

00:50.640 --> 00:52.000
What else could I do with it?

00:52.000 --> 00:56.200
And that single spark is a huge rabbit hole.

00:56.200 --> 00:59.440
Chris and Alex.

00:59.440 --> 01:01.160
Well welcome to episode 50 everybody.

01:01.160 --> 01:05.640
I hope you liked our special intro to celebrate the 50th episode.

01:05.640 --> 01:06.720
Yeah, that's great.

01:06.720 --> 01:12.160
Congratulations Alex to episode 50 and thank you to, oh yeah, in our Discord for making

01:12.160 --> 01:13.680
that awesome intro.

01:13.680 --> 01:17.820
Now he's got to make a special edition show themes all the time.

01:17.820 --> 01:19.640
That was amazing.

01:19.640 --> 01:23.880
And it's here Alex, 50 episodes and it takes a while when you're doing them only twice

01:23.880 --> 01:24.880
a month.

01:24.880 --> 01:26.360
It's been a long haul.

01:26.360 --> 01:27.360
Yeah, 50, huh?

01:27.360 --> 01:33.040
It means, what, nearly two years of doing this with you and to celebrate we've actually

01:33.040 --> 01:38.380
got some merch available for the first time.

01:38.380 --> 01:41.080
This really was all really driven by Alex.

01:41.080 --> 01:42.360
He wanted to see this done.

01:42.360 --> 01:46.520
Of course I wanted to see it too, but Alex really took the lead and made sure we got

01:46.520 --> 01:49.340
something special for you guys for episode 50.

01:49.340 --> 01:52.080
We have it up at JupiterGarage.com.

01:52.080 --> 01:57.380
We've got a couple of special shirts, a Chris and the Badger shirt and a self-hosted logo

01:57.380 --> 01:58.520
shirt if you'd like that.

01:58.520 --> 02:03.720
And we also have a couple of exclusive stickers, a self-hosted square sticker and of course

02:03.720 --> 02:07.680
a Chris and the Badger sticker, which would look great on your machine, I got to say.

02:07.680 --> 02:08.840
Yeah, I think it would too.

02:08.840 --> 02:15.160
I mean, I think it was when Drew, who's our editor sent me a little electronics project

02:15.160 --> 02:19.580
full of parts and it said to the Badger on the corner, I was like, ah, we need to lean

02:19.580 --> 02:20.840
into this a bit more, don't we?

02:20.840 --> 02:22.240
Yeah, we are leaning into it.

02:22.240 --> 02:25.600
I think with episode 50, we're just like, we're doing it.

02:25.600 --> 02:26.600
We're doing it.

02:26.600 --> 02:29.740
And it's because, you know, people kind of came together and helped us make it special.

02:29.740 --> 02:31.960
So that's up there right now.

02:31.960 --> 02:37.720
And if you are a self-hosted SRE, one of our members, then check out the post show and

02:37.720 --> 02:38.800
check out your member feed.

02:38.800 --> 02:44.280
We will have a special promo code for you to take a little bit off the gear, but it's

02:44.280 --> 02:46.040
all actually at a really great price right now.

02:46.040 --> 02:49.360
We're basically running it pretty close to cost as it is because we just wanted to have

02:49.360 --> 02:51.520
something special out there for episode 50.

02:51.520 --> 02:54.960
So all of it is up at JupiterGarage.com.

02:54.960 --> 02:59.640
If I could just take a moment to interject and just say a huge thank you personally to

02:59.640 --> 03:01.760
all of you for listening to all these episodes.

03:01.760 --> 03:07.040
It's a real privilege to do this show with you, Chris, but also be able to present to

03:07.040 --> 03:11.960
the audience that we have who engage on Discord so well and on Twitter and all that kind of

03:11.960 --> 03:12.960
stuff as well.

03:12.960 --> 03:16.000
So it's been a huge privilege for me and a big, big thank you.

03:16.000 --> 03:19.880
And we want to say thank you to A Cloud Guru, the leader in learning for the cloud, Linux

03:19.880 --> 03:21.320
and other modern tech skills.

03:21.320 --> 03:23.920
They have hundreds of courses and thousands of hands-on labs.

03:23.920 --> 03:29.360
So go get certified, get hired and get learning at ACloudGuru.com.

03:29.360 --> 03:33.720
I'd imagine that you're still rebuilding from the great flood of a few weeks ago.

03:33.720 --> 03:34.820
How's that going?

03:34.820 --> 03:37.320
It is indeed an ongoing process, Alex.

03:37.320 --> 03:39.520
We'll just say that, I guess.

03:39.520 --> 03:44.120
I actually did pick up a couple of quick tips that I'll share in a bit in the show from

03:44.120 --> 03:45.120
this entire experience.

03:45.120 --> 03:50.480
So I guess there's a bit of a silver lining there to it, but I haven't replaced everything.

03:50.480 --> 03:53.680
I have successfully saved a couple of items.

03:53.680 --> 03:55.380
So that's awesome.

03:55.380 --> 03:59.680
But for the most part, I'd say like 90% of everything was a loss.

03:59.680 --> 04:00.680
Damn.

04:00.680 --> 04:02.400
I mean, I hope you had insurance.

04:02.400 --> 04:06.040
Well some of it's just old gear, you know, some of it's just old stuff like chargers

04:06.040 --> 04:07.040
and whatnot.

04:07.040 --> 04:09.760
I suppose I could probably try to do the insurance thing.

04:09.760 --> 04:14.620
I have a box in the attic full of old English for some reason.

04:14.620 --> 04:18.120
They made it across the channel, ocean.

04:18.120 --> 04:20.320
I have a box full of English power adapters.

04:20.320 --> 04:22.840
And so they're the sort of things that just hang around forever.

04:22.840 --> 04:27.420
So maybe it's a good thing that you doused them all with, you know, 17 gallons worth

04:27.420 --> 04:28.420
of water.

04:28.420 --> 04:31.520
And I do need to kind of like change up my charging situation because see what I got

04:31.520 --> 04:37.980
going in this area is a charging station, you could say, for all of the kids iPads and

04:37.980 --> 04:40.320
switches and controllers.

04:40.320 --> 04:47.880
And so this whole situation's actually inspired the wife and I to cap the water pipes at that

04:47.880 --> 04:51.120
area, remove the faucet completely.

04:51.120 --> 04:55.260
And then after we get back on the impending Denver road trip, we're going to build a shelving

04:55.260 --> 04:58.620
system in there where the kids can slide their devices in the shelves and they'll have power

04:58.620 --> 04:59.620
cords pre-run.

04:59.620 --> 05:03.020
So the whole, the whole incident's actually inspired us to really kind of up our game

05:03.020 --> 05:07.820
instead of just having like this loose area where we stash stuff near a sink.

05:07.820 --> 05:10.240
But it just took the disaster to kick our butts into gear, I guess.

05:10.240 --> 05:14.780
You know, one of these days I might convince you to get a 3D printer and custom print the

05:14.780 --> 05:18.540
right size inserts for the devices.

05:18.540 --> 05:22.100
There's been a couple of fixes and a couple of projects for this road trip a couple of

05:22.100 --> 05:26.400
times now because this is one of the bigger trips because we're going to be on the road

05:26.400 --> 05:28.820
for probably about 40 days straight.

05:28.820 --> 05:33.740
If you think about that in terms of just wear and tear on a vehicle and the house box that

05:33.740 --> 05:35.800
is running on top of that vehicle, that's a lot.

05:35.800 --> 05:38.380
And so there's been a lot of things we're doing to prepare for it.

05:38.380 --> 05:41.580
And I've thought a couple of times, a few things I'm replacing, like trying to get a

05:41.580 --> 05:45.620
magnet on my door so that lines up with the sensor and trying to just position that magnet

05:45.620 --> 05:46.620
just right.

05:46.620 --> 05:50.420
If I could have built a little 3D housing for that, to just position it where I needed

05:50.420 --> 05:51.940
it, it would have been job done.

05:51.940 --> 05:53.740
It's on my mind.

05:53.740 --> 05:54.740
It may happen.

05:54.740 --> 05:56.580
You have a few options of cheap 3D printers.

05:56.580 --> 06:01.860
I mean, there's a Prusa one that's the Prusa mini, it's about 400 bucks delivered.

06:01.860 --> 06:08.020
I could make some, Creality makes some as well, but I had bad experiences with the Chineseium

06:08.020 --> 06:09.020
printers.

06:09.020 --> 06:13.300
And personally, I'm a huge fan boy of Prusa because they open source everything and nine

06:13.300 --> 06:18.140
times out of 10, the print just works, which is what I'm in 3D printing for.

06:18.140 --> 06:22.420
I'm not really in it to tinker and 3D print new parts for my printer.

06:22.420 --> 06:24.820
I want to print cool stuff.

06:24.820 --> 06:27.940
I just figured I'd wait for you to upgrade your current rig and then I'd buy this one

06:27.940 --> 06:28.940
off you used.

06:28.940 --> 06:32.100
That does tend to happen.

06:32.100 --> 06:33.100
Yeah.

06:33.100 --> 06:34.100
We'll see.

06:34.100 --> 06:35.100
We'll see.

06:35.100 --> 06:36.100
But we will be in Denver soon.

06:36.100 --> 06:37.100
We're going to have a meetup.

06:37.100 --> 06:39.260
Alex is going to be there running trivia night.

06:39.260 --> 06:41.540
So go to meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting.

06:41.540 --> 06:46.100
I think it's August 20th, a Friday that we're going to be in Denver doing the meetup.

06:46.100 --> 06:48.060
There's also a meetup coming up in Salt Lake City.

06:48.060 --> 06:49.060
Just only I will be there.

06:49.060 --> 06:53.180
Alex won't be making it to that one, but details for that are at meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting.

06:53.180 --> 06:56.340
It's going to be weird getting on a plane, I'll tell you that.

06:56.340 --> 06:58.500
How long of a flight is it to Denver for you guys?

06:58.500 --> 07:00.820
About three or four hours, I think.

07:00.820 --> 07:05.060
It really is just the perfect midpoint between you and me, isn't it?

07:05.060 --> 07:06.740
It's like right there smack dab in the middle.

07:06.740 --> 07:07.740
Yeah.

07:07.740 --> 07:10.880
It's either that or the middle of Arkansas.

07:10.880 --> 07:17.780
Most of the crew is flying out with the exception of myself, of course my wife and Brent.

07:17.780 --> 07:23.060
Brent, you know, from Brunch with Brent is flying into Seattle and then he is going to

07:23.060 --> 07:26.820
caravan out with the family and I in Lady Jubes.

07:26.820 --> 07:29.140
Oh, I'm so jealous.

07:29.140 --> 07:32.100
Brent is a precious resource that we have to share out carefully.

07:32.100 --> 07:33.100
We do.

07:33.100 --> 07:34.100
Yeah.

07:34.100 --> 07:35.100
Yeah.

07:35.100 --> 07:37.380
Well, he'll have his fill of us, I think, by the time we're in.

07:37.380 --> 07:39.740
I mean, you know, it's actually going to be pretty great.

07:39.740 --> 07:41.740
The kids are excited.

07:41.740 --> 07:45.660
This is going to totally, this is going to enshrine him as Uncle Brent at the end of

07:45.660 --> 07:49.740
this road trip, you know, so that'll be pretty great and I'm really looking forward to it.

07:49.740 --> 07:54.260
Well, I'm extremely jealous of that and I hope you have a great time on the road.

07:54.260 --> 07:56.180
I've always wanted to do Salt Lake City.

07:56.180 --> 07:58.620
I never quite made it that far north in Utah.

07:58.620 --> 08:04.180
We did Arches and Dead Horse State Park and that kind of stuff near Moab a couple of years

08:04.180 --> 08:05.180
ago.

08:05.180 --> 08:06.180
That was amazing.

08:06.180 --> 08:09.260
If you're ever in that area, amazing, amazing stuff.

08:09.260 --> 08:10.260
Absolutely love it.

08:10.260 --> 08:11.260
Totally.

08:11.260 --> 08:12.260
You're absolutely right.

08:12.260 --> 08:13.260
It's like another world.

08:13.260 --> 08:14.460
It feels like you're on a set of Star Trek when you're in Moab.

08:14.460 --> 08:15.460
Mars.

08:15.460 --> 08:18.460
You know, Salt Lake City was a promise I made to the audience because it's not like exactly

08:18.460 --> 08:22.900
on our way to Denver, but I made a promise to the audience that when we could, we'd return

08:22.900 --> 08:24.720
to Salt Lake City because we had to skip it.

08:24.720 --> 08:26.300
We had a whole thing planned and we had to skip it.

08:26.300 --> 08:30.420
So this is making good on a promise to the audience in Salt Lake City.

08:30.420 --> 08:36.140
Perhaps this is an entirely gross misrepresentation of Salt Lake City, but it's kind of colored

08:36.140 --> 08:42.260
to me by the Book of Mormon, if you've seen that.

08:42.260 --> 08:46.780
I mean, you know, it actually just sort of tangentially related to that.

08:46.780 --> 08:50.260
When we were trying to book a venue, we had to listen to a whole bunch of rules about

08:50.260 --> 08:55.340
alcohol that we have never had to sit through from any other state.

08:55.340 --> 08:56.340
It's a thing.

08:56.340 --> 08:57.340
It's a thing.

08:57.340 --> 09:00.180
Well, when you've had one too many beers after a meetup, the last thing you want is to be

09:00.180 --> 09:04.380
fumbling around for a phone in your pocket or trying to remember what voice command you

09:04.380 --> 09:07.180
programmed into the lady cylinder this week.

09:07.180 --> 09:09.500
Have you got a solution to that?

09:09.500 --> 09:13.200
I had a fire tablet that worked pretty well before it got water destroyed because it fell

09:13.200 --> 09:14.200
out.

09:14.200 --> 09:15.200
It was off the wall.

09:15.200 --> 09:16.200
It fell into the water bath.

09:16.200 --> 09:20.380
But also, you know, Brent's going to be on board and he doesn't know all those special

09:20.380 --> 09:22.860
commands, and he's going to want to control things.

09:22.860 --> 09:28.300
So I wanted to get that tablet on the wall replaced, which runs my home assistant dashboard

09:28.300 --> 09:33.660
24-7 because it makes it easier for the family and it makes it easier for guests.

09:33.660 --> 09:36.820
And yeah, it makes it easier when you just can't remember what, you know, what did I

09:36.820 --> 09:38.140
call that group of lights again?

09:38.140 --> 09:40.100
I can't remember.

09:40.100 --> 09:46.260
So out of a bit of, I'd say maybe laziness, and out of a bit of budget concerns, I've

09:46.260 --> 09:49.380
been picking up the Amazon Fire tablets.

09:49.380 --> 09:54.580
And I don't really want to invest in a system where I need to reflash these things.

09:54.580 --> 09:55.780
It's not that I'm against it.

09:55.780 --> 09:57.660
I used to love doing that.

09:57.660 --> 10:01.740
It's just kind of, it crosses an effort line for me that I'm willing to put into this kind

10:01.740 --> 10:02.740
of device.

10:02.740 --> 10:05.100
Beyond that, I'd rather just get like a used iPad.

10:05.100 --> 10:09.580
Well, we talked a little bit about flashing lineage on to my old Kindle Fire a little

10:09.580 --> 10:10.580
while ago.

10:10.580 --> 10:11.580
Right.

10:11.580 --> 10:14.500
And for me, it's just not quite worth the effort.

10:14.500 --> 10:16.700
The tablets kind of suck already.

10:16.700 --> 10:21.540
And so if I have to do all this extra work, it kind of like loses the value for me a little

10:21.540 --> 10:22.540
bit.

10:22.540 --> 10:25.900
I wanted to see if I could find a nice sweet spot where I could still pick up a Fire tablet

10:25.900 --> 10:31.620
for a great price off of Amazon and then just easily and quickly modify it for my needs,

10:31.620 --> 10:36.060
which is mount it to a wall and run home assistant dashboard all day.

10:36.060 --> 10:39.860
And so a couple of projects that I found made it exactly what I was shooting for that kind

10:39.860 --> 10:42.140
of like that sweet spot in the middle.

10:42.140 --> 10:44.220
And I picked up a 10 inch Amazon Fire tablet.

10:44.220 --> 10:48.580
I opted to go for the ad free one because again, I'm not going to reflash this thing.

10:48.580 --> 10:52.160
But if you were going to reflash the thing, you could, you could save a few bucks and

10:52.160 --> 10:57.580
you could get the version that comes with ads on the lock screen, which is so obnoxious.

10:57.580 --> 11:02.320
In fact, I've bought the no ads version in the past and still received the version that

11:02.320 --> 11:06.220
comes with the ad so I could totally understand if you wanted to reflash it.

11:06.220 --> 11:08.300
But I that wasn't what I wanted to do.

11:08.300 --> 11:11.180
I wanted to use this app that I found called wall panel.

11:11.180 --> 11:15.220
It's an Android application for web based dashboards, like home assistant, like that's

11:15.220 --> 11:17.280
what's in a lot of their screenshots.

11:17.280 --> 11:19.320
And you could sideload it if you want.

11:19.320 --> 11:24.060
But they've also submitted wall panel to the Google Play Store and to the Amazon App Store,

11:24.060 --> 11:28.180
which means it makes it stupid easy to get it up and going on a Fire tablet.

11:28.180 --> 11:34.660
It has really great fast camera motion detection to so now what I can do is sleep my screen.

11:34.660 --> 11:38.860
And then when the front facing camera detects motion, it wakes the screen up.

11:38.860 --> 11:41.660
And that's actually surprisingly handy.

11:41.660 --> 11:45.320
You approach the tablet and as you're approaching it, the screen just becomes available.

11:45.320 --> 11:47.900
And then I have it set to like a three minute sleep window.

11:47.900 --> 11:50.960
You can have a pin code option in there to kind of lock the screen out if you don't want

11:50.960 --> 11:54.300
to just give anyone access to your dashboard.

11:54.300 --> 11:59.000
And with the ease of access and installing this thing and the power options for keeping

11:59.000 --> 12:06.280
the screen awake and all that kind of stuff, it gets me 90% of the way there with a stock

12:06.280 --> 12:07.860
Amazon Fire tablet.

12:07.860 --> 12:08.860
So it's wall panel.

12:08.860 --> 12:10.800
I'll have a link in the show notes for that.

12:10.800 --> 12:13.560
So what if I did want to reflash it or tinker with it?

12:13.560 --> 12:14.720
What can I do there?

12:14.720 --> 12:16.580
There are a couple of options there.

12:16.580 --> 12:20.740
The one that I think I'd recommend like the next step up from wall panel.

12:20.740 --> 12:24.900
You may have seen this over at the XDA forums, it's called the Amazon Fire Toolbox.

12:24.900 --> 12:31.160
And this uses the Android debug bridge to apply tweaks to the Fire tablet from completely

12:31.160 --> 12:36.860
reflashing them to just doing things like maybe installing Google Play, or removing

12:36.860 --> 12:41.420
some of Amazon's annoying software that's on there to just completely replacing the

12:41.420 --> 12:43.020
version of Android if you like.

12:43.020 --> 12:49.080
The downside is you got to use Windows and I just don't really have access to a Windows

12:49.080 --> 12:50.080
machine.

12:50.080 --> 12:51.400
It's a basic app.

12:51.400 --> 12:56.840
They say they're going to work on Linux support, but Datastream33 who kind of hangs out over

12:56.840 --> 12:59.700
the XDA forums, he's a senior member over there.

12:59.700 --> 13:03.300
It's his project or their project and they're a Windows user right now.

13:03.300 --> 13:05.580
So they're making it for Windows.

13:05.580 --> 13:08.200
So it's not really something that I have quick access to.

13:08.200 --> 13:13.460
But the idea is you plug your Fire tablet into your Windows box, you load this toolbox

13:13.460 --> 13:18.760
up and then it gives you a GUI with a bunch of options in there that just kind of can

13:18.760 --> 13:23.700
go in there and lobotomize the Amazon stuff out of the tablet if you want and give it

13:23.700 --> 13:26.180
actual genuine Google Play Store APIs.

13:26.180 --> 13:29.380
Who doesn't want to lobotomize a tablet, huh?

13:29.380 --> 13:33.340
Well, I mean, have you seen the neg where they put on these things?

13:33.340 --> 13:37.280
They want you to buy everything that Amazon makes and they want to turn it into an Alexa

13:37.280 --> 13:42.820
and they also want you to turn it into an Audible station and they also want you to

13:42.820 --> 13:46.720
turn it into a Prime streaming machine and they put all this stuff all over it.

13:46.720 --> 13:48.860
And I just want it to run one single app.

13:48.860 --> 13:53.660
You know, I was worried about this kind of thing because in days past you had to root

13:53.660 --> 13:57.300
things and reflash bootloaders and that kind of stuff.

13:57.300 --> 14:03.740
And I read a long time ago that warranty claims were refused if people had done modifications

14:03.740 --> 14:05.740
like this to these ad supported devices.

14:05.740 --> 14:08.080
Is that still the case now?

14:08.080 --> 14:13.620
So the nice thing about the toolbox that we were just talking about from XDA, that's not

14:13.620 --> 14:17.580
messing with like the system restore partition on your fire tablet.

14:17.580 --> 14:22.080
So you could go in there and like lobotomize the Amazon stuff out of the image.

14:22.080 --> 14:25.860
And then if you needed to reset it to factory defaults and it just restores it to a stock

14:25.860 --> 14:26.860
fire tablet.

14:26.860 --> 14:29.620
So your warranty is good if you just did that before you sent it in.

14:29.620 --> 14:30.620
Yeah, that makes sense.

14:30.620 --> 14:31.980
I mean, it's just software, isn't it?

14:31.980 --> 14:38.180
I mean, unless there's like an intrusion detection in the firmware, I don't see how they'd ever

14:38.180 --> 14:39.180
know.

14:39.180 --> 14:41.620
Well, yeah, they could do that, I suppose, but thankfully they're not.

14:41.620 --> 14:45.860
But that's where wall panel is kind of this nice starting point.

14:45.860 --> 14:49.400
And you could just start with that for these on wall dashboard.

14:49.400 --> 14:53.180
This is, I think, such a great way to make home automation more accessible to your family

14:53.180 --> 14:55.740
is a visual way for them to control things.

14:55.740 --> 14:59.540
And with the home assistant dashboard setup, you could make something really appealing

14:59.540 --> 15:03.300
to people and it renders really great on a 10 inch tablet.

15:03.300 --> 15:07.840
And wall panel has an option to turn on by default when the tablet boots.

15:07.840 --> 15:14.060
So it kind of just launches immediately and kind of papers over all that Amazon stuff.

15:14.060 --> 15:17.660
And it really gets you like 90 percent of the way there.

15:17.660 --> 15:18.660
Super quick.

15:18.660 --> 15:19.660
What's the last 10 percent?

15:19.660 --> 15:23.300
I think the last 10 percent would be replacing the OS, you know, because then you could put

15:23.300 --> 15:29.900
something a little more modern on there because Amazon's fire Android OS space is often behind

15:29.900 --> 15:30.900
mainline Android.

15:30.900 --> 15:34.820
Well, yeah, I mean, I saw today just in the J.B. Telegram chat that people were talking

15:34.820 --> 15:40.220
about the I think it's like a 12 year old Kindle is getting Internet access revoked

15:40.220 --> 15:44.420
or something by Amazon, turning it into a waste essentially.

15:44.420 --> 15:45.680
You know, that's a tricky one.

15:45.680 --> 15:47.500
The cellular networks eventually get shut down.

15:47.500 --> 15:51.700
I think things like on the 3G network or something, right, because it's it's pretty old.

15:51.700 --> 15:54.180
I mean, yeah, eventually they got to shut down the network.

15:54.180 --> 15:58.660
But that's it really kind of does make you think like if you want something to last a

15:58.660 --> 16:04.540
really, really long time, you've got to look at ways of self-hosting it.

16:04.540 --> 16:09.260
And maybe some some devices just aren't aren't the right fit, although you could argue 12

16:09.260 --> 16:12.900
years is a pretty good value proposition when you consider new Kindles are like 100 bucks.

16:12.900 --> 16:16.380
Like back then, those Kindles were not that cheap, but new Kindles are a lot cheaper.

16:16.380 --> 16:17.780
Well, very good.

16:17.780 --> 16:22.980
I think next time there's a Black Friday sale or some kind of Amazon invented Prime Day

16:22.980 --> 16:27.180
thing, I might pick up a Fire tablet and just give that a go.

16:27.180 --> 16:31.940
The one that I flash with Lineage a little while ago has been doing perfect duty, actually,

16:31.940 --> 16:38.500
because we've been using one of the Wyze Cam V3s with that Lineage OS 7 inch Fire tablet

16:38.500 --> 16:44.220
from half a decade plus ago as our baby monitor, and it's been working brilliantly well.

16:44.220 --> 16:50.180
So you can breathe new life into old dogs with this stuff.

16:50.180 --> 16:54.660
As part of the episode 50 festivities, I wanted to complete a project that I've been kind

16:54.660 --> 17:00.620
of working on in the evenings off and on over the last six months or so, which was a searchable

17:00.620 --> 17:03.380
archive of our show notes.

17:03.380 --> 17:09.780
And a huge thanks goes out to the orange one from Discord who rewrote, I think, something

17:09.780 --> 17:17.780
like all but three lines of my code to scrape the Flyerside website and ingest the HTML

17:17.780 --> 17:25.100
and the XML feeds and spit out what eventually turns out to be an MKDocs based searchable

17:25.100 --> 17:29.260
archive of the entire Jupiter broadcasting suite of shows.

17:29.260 --> 17:30.260
That's so great.

17:30.260 --> 17:33.980
I feel like he kept those three lines of code in there just to be nice to you.

17:33.980 --> 17:38.740
But it's so quick and snappy, and it makes it really quick to find stuff that eventually

17:38.740 --> 17:41.780
this is going to get integrated into the site itself.

17:41.780 --> 17:45.620
But for right now, it's just a great way to like, I know we talked about something.

17:45.620 --> 17:46.980
When did we talk about it?

17:46.980 --> 17:48.180
Like it's good for that kind of stuff.

17:48.180 --> 17:52.580
I can't tell you how many times a week I get pinged with, when did you talk about X or

17:52.580 --> 17:53.580
when did you?

17:53.580 --> 17:54.580
Yeah.

17:54.580 --> 17:59.700
You know, great example is the Lineage flashing of the 7 inch Fire tablet.

17:59.700 --> 18:04.980
As we were talking just then, I just typed into the search bar LineageOS and boom, up

18:04.980 --> 18:07.940
came episode 44 of Self-Hosted.

18:07.940 --> 18:08.940
There we go.

18:08.940 --> 18:09.940
Job done.

18:09.940 --> 18:10.940
So it's already working for me.

18:10.940 --> 18:15.180
Now you can find this thing at notes.jupitabroadcasting.com.

18:15.180 --> 18:21.740
We've got Coder Radio, Jupiter Extras, Linux Action News, Linux Unplugged, and of course

18:21.740 --> 18:23.780
this here Self-Hosted podcast.

18:23.780 --> 18:24.780
All right.

18:24.780 --> 18:25.940
Well, this is the Self-Hosted show.

18:25.940 --> 18:28.900
So you got to tell us a little bit about how you set it up and what's running.

18:28.900 --> 18:33.300
Well, one of the coolest things that Orange managed to do was dynamic theming between

18:33.300 --> 18:34.300
the different shows.

18:34.300 --> 18:37.780
So I don't know if you're on the site right now, but if you click between the different

18:37.780 --> 18:40.140
shows, you'll notice the top header changes.

18:40.140 --> 18:43.020
So Self-Hosted is orange, Coder Radio.

18:43.020 --> 18:44.020
I do like that.

18:44.020 --> 18:45.020
Yeah.

18:45.020 --> 18:46.020
That's so cool.

18:46.020 --> 18:48.900
Linux Action News is red.

18:48.900 --> 18:53.140
It's all backed by MKDocs and he's done a bit of dynamic CSS switching between the different

18:53.140 --> 18:55.080
tabs, which is pretty cool.

18:55.080 --> 19:00.520
But what we're doing is we scrape all of the show information that's on Fireside and we

19:00.520 --> 19:06.620
use Fireside as our podcasting publishing platform and we use that as a source of truth.

19:06.620 --> 19:13.460
And this Python script then takes that scraped data, uses what's called a Ginger 2 template

19:13.460 --> 19:19.580
to substitute things like the tags in there, the hosts, any of the links that we put in

19:19.580 --> 19:24.580
the episodes, that kind of thing, and it spits out a plain markdown file.

19:24.580 --> 19:31.060
MKDocs then ingests that plain markdown file and bada bing, bada boom, we have an MKDocs

19:31.060 --> 19:32.060
site.

19:32.060 --> 19:33.060
Very nice.

19:33.060 --> 19:37.700
But we are relying on a small element of non-self-hosted software.

19:37.700 --> 19:41.860
We're using GitHub Actions and we're running it through a con job.

19:41.860 --> 19:45.720
So at five or six a.m. every day, it just goes and scrapes the JB site.

19:45.720 --> 19:49.620
So you'll see that these show notes are getting automatically updated.

19:49.620 --> 19:53.220
This website gets automatically updated every day.

19:53.220 --> 19:56.380
So it's never out of date.

19:56.380 --> 19:58.280
Linode.com slash SSH.

19:58.280 --> 20:02.100
Go there to get $100 in 60-day credit towards a new account and you go there to support

20:02.100 --> 20:03.100
the show.

20:03.100 --> 20:05.920
So it's Linode.com slash SSH.

20:05.920 --> 20:10.380
And yeah, of course, notes.jupiterbroadcasting.com is running on Linode.

20:10.380 --> 20:14.300
Everything we build that we want the audience to be able to use, we host that on Linode

20:14.300 --> 20:17.080
because their infrastructure is killer.

20:17.080 --> 20:18.820
And the price is great, too.

20:18.820 --> 20:23.560
In fact, Linode is 30 to 50 percent less than the other big hyperscalers out there.

20:23.560 --> 20:27.540
And they've been around since 2003 doing this.

20:27.540 --> 20:34.220
So for 18 years, they have remained focused on building out the greatest cloud that you

20:34.220 --> 20:36.380
could possibly ever want as a Linux geek.

20:36.380 --> 20:38.380
I mean, it's like a playground.

20:38.380 --> 20:41.820
I go up there and sometimes when I just want to try out a couple of different projects

20:41.820 --> 20:46.620
for talking about on the show, like, how do you know if something is worth proceeding

20:46.620 --> 20:47.620
with?

20:47.620 --> 20:48.860
How do you know if it's going to work for you when you're building out something like

20:48.860 --> 20:49.860
you have a project?

20:49.860 --> 20:52.260
Like, how do you know if this is the stack you want to use?

20:52.260 --> 20:56.660
Well, I deploy it on Linode often with some of their one-click deployments.

20:56.660 --> 21:00.940
And I'll test it out and I'll run it for a couple of days and see how it works.

21:00.940 --> 21:06.420
And often, I keep one out of two or three things and that eventually turns into a show.

21:06.420 --> 21:09.340
And then we create a project around it and we end up putting it in production.

21:09.340 --> 21:12.540
And the entire time from beginning to end, we're doing it all with Linode because they

21:12.540 --> 21:17.640
just make it simple, it's affordable, and it's easy to work with the team too.

21:17.640 --> 21:22.460
And then on top of that, they have a really handy API that you can either use directly

21:22.460 --> 21:27.220
yourself dramatically or do like I do and just kind of take the lazy route and use their

21:27.220 --> 21:29.100
command line client.

21:29.100 --> 21:33.940
So I'll do this to like pop a file up on their S3 compatible object storage and I can market

21:33.940 --> 21:37.580
public and generate the URL in like three or four seconds.

21:37.580 --> 21:40.580
And this is awesome when we're trying to get clips ready for a show or something like that

21:40.580 --> 21:45.940
or we're collaborating on a project or recently, I sent a big batch of files to somebody and

21:45.940 --> 21:48.940
we were going back and forth like, how are we going to even share this file?

21:48.940 --> 21:52.180
I'm like, hold on a second here, I'll get you a little zip file with the URL.

21:52.180 --> 21:56.380
I did that with a video of my daughter the other day that was like 170 meg to a parent

21:56.380 --> 21:58.660
and Telegram was like, nope.

21:58.660 --> 22:01.180
So I just used the object storage and it worked great.

22:01.180 --> 22:02.180
Yeah.

22:02.180 --> 22:05.980
And the command line client is like the pro way to get things up there because what I

22:05.980 --> 22:11.620
do cause I'm such a nerd is I have a awake dropdown terminal where it's always like in

22:11.620 --> 22:12.620
one of the tabs.

22:12.620 --> 22:15.880
So it's like up, up, change a couple of things, hit enter.

22:15.880 --> 22:17.040
It's great.

22:17.040 --> 22:21.140
But on top of that, they've got cloud firewalls, they've got VLAN support, they have a really

22:21.140 --> 22:22.980
powerful DNS manager.

22:22.980 --> 22:27.700
They're beginning to roll out bare metal servers and they also work with infrastructure management.

22:27.700 --> 22:30.700
So if you want to plug in with Kubernetes and Terraform, maybe you want to even just

22:30.700 --> 22:34.060
use Linode as part of a multi-cloud strategy.

22:34.060 --> 22:35.060
They're great for that too.

22:35.060 --> 22:40.740
But 66% of companies will save money working with a mix of alternative cloud providers instead

22:40.740 --> 22:42.900
of just relying on like one big hyperscaler.

22:42.900 --> 22:45.220
So it's worth just looking into that.

22:45.220 --> 22:47.020
Linode could be part of your multi-cloud strategy.

22:47.020 --> 22:51.440
And if you ever run into any trouble, you ever need any help, they've got the best customer

22:51.440 --> 22:53.340
service in the business.

22:53.340 --> 22:57.580
And when your business is running on Linode, it's nice to know that's available.

22:57.580 --> 22:59.300
And their support for the community runs deep.

22:59.300 --> 23:03.040
They're making it possible for our team to get together in Denver.

23:03.040 --> 23:05.440
They're making the whole road trip possible.

23:05.440 --> 23:06.440
That's pretty awesome.

23:06.440 --> 23:09.260
And not only that, but they're going to be bringing swag and giveaways like raspberry

23:09.260 --> 23:13.980
pies and all kinds of awesome shirts they've made just for the trip.

23:13.980 --> 23:16.340
It's just going to be a whole party made possible by Linode.

23:16.340 --> 23:20.460
And they're doing that just to have a chance to connect because like us, they miss seeing

23:20.460 --> 23:21.460
people.

23:21.460 --> 23:22.460
It's been a while.

23:22.460 --> 23:26.140
And Linode has been so enthusiastic about supporting our reunion.

23:26.140 --> 23:29.500
But there's so many things I could go on about, you just got to go check it out for yourself.

23:29.500 --> 23:31.320
You got to get your hands on it and see it.

23:31.320 --> 23:42.260
So go use that $100, maybe learn something and support the show, linode.com slash SSH.

23:42.260 --> 23:49.220
Now I came across a thread on Reddit a couple of weeks ago that Sure, who's an ISP in Canada,

23:49.220 --> 23:54.620
was blocking Plex because it thought it was suspicious, which tingled my spidey sense

23:54.620 --> 23:56.060
a little bit.

23:56.060 --> 24:00.280
Because I often tell people that I share my Plex server with that the ISPs don't care.

24:00.280 --> 24:02.240
It's all just encrypted traffic.

24:02.240 --> 24:05.340
They have no idea what is going on, right?

24:05.340 --> 24:08.980
And so I dug into it a little bit and one of the comments has some really interesting

24:08.980 --> 24:13.120
information about how the Plex web app works, which I thought might be interesting to share

24:13.120 --> 24:14.640
with you all.

24:14.640 --> 24:22.140
Now Sure Protected Browsing uses a service called Zvelo, which happens to flag app.plex.tv.

24:22.140 --> 24:27.640
And the way that the Plex app works in your web browser is it downloads the code to the

24:27.640 --> 24:29.460
browser and then runs it locally.

24:29.460 --> 24:36.740
So if you can't access or the web URL is blocked by an ad blocker or some kind of safe browsing

24:36.740 --> 24:42.140
plugin, it just can't download the code and you can't run it.

24:42.140 --> 24:48.860
And because of this, it could affect things running a web app on a TV, for example, might

24:48.860 --> 24:49.860
suffer the same fate.

24:49.860 --> 24:55.860
And I just thought it was really interesting that these apps aren't local, they're not

24:55.860 --> 25:01.880
locally rendered, which is why when Plex update their UI, you don't have to download anything.

25:01.880 --> 25:05.260
It just automatically happens.

25:05.260 --> 25:11.200
Plex clients for Android, Android TV, iOS, TVOS, et cetera, aren't affected because they

25:11.200 --> 25:13.520
are full versions of the app.

25:13.520 --> 25:20.760
So if you have a smart TV or hosted Plex web app.plex.tv, you're probably going to want

25:20.760 --> 25:27.020
to find a way to route it around something like Zvelo, which is what Shure uses to avoid

25:27.020 --> 25:28.280
this issue.

25:28.280 --> 25:33.140
It's hard to not be skeptical, safe browsing, that just sounds like they're trying to reduce

25:33.140 --> 25:35.100
load on their network, doesn't it?

25:35.100 --> 25:38.740
Or perhaps encourage people to sign up for streaming packages.

25:38.740 --> 25:47.380
I absolutely find it abhorrent that Verizon or AT&T, they all do it here, have different

25:47.380 --> 25:53.540
quality profiles of Netflix videos or YouTube videos and they lock you into certain quality

25:53.540 --> 25:58.020
profiles unless you pay them more money.

25:58.020 --> 26:03.660
This is one of the reasons I decided to set up my PEP Wave with their Fusion Hub VPN solution

26:03.660 --> 26:08.580
because it routes my traffic through a VPN and they can't tell what it is and so they

26:08.580 --> 26:14.900
don't re-encode the video for me or actually what AT&T does, each provider does a little

26:14.900 --> 26:15.900
bit differently.

26:15.900 --> 26:20.420
And AT&T is particularly frustrating because they just sort of brute force it so that way

26:20.420 --> 26:25.820
the YouTube client and the Netflix client, they just sit there and bang their head against

26:25.820 --> 26:29.660
the video streaming service asking for the best quality and it keeps failing and failing

26:29.660 --> 26:30.920
and failing.

26:30.920 --> 26:35.700
And then when the client finally to say, okay, fine, I'll go down to the next lower quality,

26:35.700 --> 26:36.700
it tries that, that fails.

26:36.700 --> 26:39.940
And then when it finally goes down to 480p, then it plays.

26:39.940 --> 26:45.340
So you just sit there waiting while your carrier is blocking these connections.

26:45.340 --> 26:48.400
You wait with your little spinner on the screen.

26:48.400 --> 26:49.400
It's so frustrating.

26:49.400 --> 26:54.540
And to see Shaw do this for Plex, it really, it stinks.

26:54.540 --> 26:59.100
It stinks because the reality is they know what's going on over that Plex port.

26:59.100 --> 27:02.940
They know it's not some sort of attack or some sort of weird malware.

27:02.940 --> 27:05.180
They know it's video streaming.

27:05.180 --> 27:09.400
And my reading of the law is the copyright violation really happens when you download

27:09.400 --> 27:10.780
the file.

27:10.780 --> 27:14.700
I think, I don't know, I could be wrong if anybody wants to let me know in a clear, explain

27:14.700 --> 27:19.380
it to me like I'm a five-year-old way, cellphones.show.com, but my understanding is you're not actually

27:19.380 --> 27:20.460
violating copyright.

27:20.460 --> 27:23.560
If you stream it, that can't be right.

27:23.560 --> 27:29.500
But either way, I don't know how Plex scoots around that particular issue, but regardless,

27:29.500 --> 27:32.700
it's not Shaw's place to enforce copyright law.

27:32.700 --> 27:34.540
It's just not, or, or IP law.

27:34.540 --> 27:36.900
It's just, they should just be passing the bits.

27:36.900 --> 27:37.900
Yeah.

27:37.900 --> 27:42.180
I don't expect my water company to choose which bits of water I get.

27:42.180 --> 27:43.180
Yeah.

27:43.180 --> 27:45.740
Although you do want them to keep the bad stuff out of the water.

27:45.740 --> 27:48.900
So that might be a bad analogy.

27:48.900 --> 27:53.660
I know Alex, you are, you are very organized compared to me in your Plex collection.

27:53.660 --> 27:56.300
Like you have collections for everything.

27:56.300 --> 27:58.500
You've got nice consistent album art.

27:58.500 --> 28:02.220
Like at some point in time, you must've just sat back, had a drink and spent like hours

28:02.220 --> 28:04.500
organizing all of your metadata.

28:04.500 --> 28:05.860
Well, I am now.

28:05.860 --> 28:12.360
This week I've found possibly my new favorite Plex pick of the year, Plex Metamanager.

28:12.360 --> 28:16.000
This is a Python script and it is awesome.

28:16.000 --> 28:20.940
So this thing will go through using the Plex API of your local Plex server.

28:20.940 --> 28:26.260
It uses the token that you can generate by going to view XML and get the little token

28:26.260 --> 28:28.260
from up the address bar.

28:28.260 --> 28:37.620
And what it will do is it will basically match the TMDB ID of the movie against a list of

28:37.620 --> 28:38.700
different collections.

28:38.700 --> 28:44.620
So it's built me in my Plex library, for example, a bunch of different collections based on

28:44.620 --> 28:45.620
genres.

28:45.620 --> 28:46.620
Okay.

28:46.620 --> 28:50.620
Yes, I already had genre filtering, but this is using Plex's smart search.

28:50.620 --> 28:51.620
It's just really cool.

28:51.620 --> 28:52.820
You've got to go check it out.

28:52.820 --> 28:59.260
I've got now a nineties, a noughties, a tensies, a twenties collection in my Plex library as

28:59.260 --> 29:00.640
well.

29:00.640 --> 29:03.460
It's just really, really cool.

29:03.460 --> 29:06.980
But what got me looking at this in the first place was my wife and I were browsing through,

29:06.980 --> 29:09.500
I've got about a thousand movies or so on my server.

29:09.500 --> 29:12.220
And we were just browsing through the other night saying, what should we watch?

29:12.220 --> 29:18.420
And neither of us could come to any kind of agreement about what we should watch.

29:18.420 --> 29:19.860
I know it's so true.

29:19.860 --> 29:25.820
Well, first of all, why don't I have a bunch of collections of stuff that's recently added

29:25.820 --> 29:32.140
is one thing that Plex does out of the box, but there's no real kind of trending kind

29:32.140 --> 29:37.420
of collection like there is through the Plex meta manager, like a Netflix or Amazon prime

29:37.420 --> 29:38.420
would give me.

29:38.420 --> 29:43.260
And with this, I'm able to sort of say, Oh, Hey, yeah, that, that new Wonder Woman movie.

29:43.260 --> 29:44.260
Okay, cool.

29:44.260 --> 29:46.220
I could go and watch that tonight.

29:46.220 --> 29:47.940
So that was really the motivation behind it.

29:47.940 --> 29:51.220
But this, this script takes a little bit of elbow grease to get set up.

29:51.220 --> 29:55.140
The documentation is very good, but it's also very verbose.

29:55.140 --> 29:58.860
So it almost put me off, but I'm very glad it didn't.

29:58.860 --> 30:03.740
You need to configure a couple of YAML files and then they actually provide a Docker contain

30:03.740 --> 30:08.500
that you can run the Python script out of, which just floats my boat.

30:08.500 --> 30:12.460
I have it set to run every day through a system D timer.

30:12.460 --> 30:17.620
And the main reason that actually we wanted to go into refreshing all the metadata every

30:17.620 --> 30:20.900
day was because of the critic ratings that Plex has.

30:20.900 --> 30:27.200
I noticed that several of the movies that I had, the critics rating and the rotten tomatoes

30:27.200 --> 30:33.340
rating didn't really seem to line up with what I thought the movie was, like not even

30:33.340 --> 30:34.340
a little bit.

30:34.340 --> 30:39.180
And it turns out that it was just a few thousand votes on those really early scores.

30:39.180 --> 30:43.020
And so the Plex meta manager goes through every day and refreshes things like critic

30:43.020 --> 30:44.020
ratings.

30:44.020 --> 30:47.900
It has a cache, which you can configure, and I think I've got mindset to 30 days.

30:47.900 --> 30:53.660
So it's not going to go and scrape every movie every day, but you know, once a month, I think

30:53.660 --> 30:56.380
updating my critic ratings is probably worthwhile.

30:56.380 --> 31:01.660
So this Python script, you set it up to run through system D every night, and then it

31:01.660 --> 31:05.820
goes out and gets all the updated information, and then it writes it to the Plex database

31:05.820 --> 31:06.820
directly?

31:06.820 --> 31:07.820
Yeah.

31:07.820 --> 31:10.940
So if you're running Plex in a container, are you running this script in that container?

31:10.940 --> 31:12.380
How's that working?

31:12.380 --> 31:14.260
You supply the Plex server URL.

31:14.260 --> 31:19.660
So in my case, it was just 192.168.port.32.400.

31:19.660 --> 31:20.660
So it's talking Plex.

31:20.660 --> 31:22.460
It's not like crawling the file system.

31:22.460 --> 31:23.460
No.

31:23.460 --> 31:24.460
Gotcha.

31:24.460 --> 31:25.860
And then how does it get access to the database though?

31:25.860 --> 31:26.860
Through a token.

31:26.860 --> 31:30.820
So when you go into your media library, there is a Plex token that you can get.

31:30.820 --> 31:35.180
You can click on, I think it's get info and then view raw XML.

31:35.180 --> 31:40.860
And as part of that XML payload up in the address bar, there is a, it's like a 20 character

31:40.860 --> 31:42.260
long token.

31:42.260 --> 31:47.300
You give this script that token and then it authenticates against the Plex API and off

31:47.300 --> 31:48.380
it goes.

31:48.380 --> 31:51.460
That is so cool, Alex, man.

31:51.460 --> 31:54.780
I love the idea of going out and getting the updated ratings because I have observed that

31:54.780 --> 31:59.820
same exact thing and I'm really glad you dug into it because I had wondered how exactly

31:59.820 --> 32:01.480
does that work?

32:01.480 --> 32:04.740
That is so cool that it goes out there and gets the trending stuff too.

32:04.740 --> 32:08.700
I noticed too that you came across Movie Match, which is what I actually thought was going

32:08.700 --> 32:09.700
to do some of this.

32:09.700 --> 32:12.220
Yeah, it's like Tinder, this thing.

32:12.220 --> 32:15.020
Not that I've ever used Tinder because I've been married for 10 years, but.

32:15.020 --> 32:17.220
Now you're more of a Grindr guy.

32:17.220 --> 32:19.500
Oh man.

32:19.500 --> 32:22.940
No, I'm not.

32:22.940 --> 32:30.900
I'm not, but it is like, it's actually more of like, uh, it's more of matching tastes

32:30.900 --> 32:32.260
up with a group, right?

32:32.260 --> 32:35.620
It's more about like, Hey, what do we all want to watch together?

32:35.620 --> 32:39.260
And when again, going back to that problem, when you've got like a thousand movies in

32:39.260 --> 32:41.520
your library, it's harder.

32:41.520 --> 32:45.820
If a group of us were here in the studio legitimately, if we were all just hanging out, you, me and

32:45.820 --> 32:50.220
everybody were hanging out on the couch and we were just flipping through live TV and

32:50.220 --> 32:54.220
like Star Wars was like on one of the cable channels, we would just watch it.

32:54.220 --> 32:55.900
There wouldn't even really be a debate.

32:55.900 --> 32:57.420
That's what we would put on.

32:57.420 --> 33:03.100
But when you actually have to choose and you want a group of people to decide, it's a real

33:03.100 --> 33:04.380
first world problem.

33:04.380 --> 33:07.060
Me so like Star Wars.

33:07.060 --> 33:08.060
Those ones even.

33:08.060 --> 33:09.060
Yeah.

33:09.060 --> 33:10.500
I was a kid when that came out.

33:10.500 --> 33:15.820
Episode one, I was, uh, I was like nine or 10 when that came out.

33:15.820 --> 33:19.340
And I remember we were on, this is one for the British audience.

33:19.340 --> 33:23.220
We were on a Norfolk Broads holiday and we were in lowest off that night and we all,

33:23.220 --> 33:28.300
I remember walking down the road with my dad to go to the cinema from the boat to go and

33:28.300 --> 33:29.300
watch episode one.

33:29.300 --> 33:31.420
And it's just one of those things that stuck in my memory.

33:31.420 --> 33:32.420
Ah, that's great.

33:32.420 --> 33:33.780
How can you not love pod racing?

33:33.780 --> 33:35.140
It's just the coolest thing ever.

33:35.140 --> 33:36.140
Yeah, that's true.

33:36.140 --> 33:37.660
The pod racing was super awesome.

33:37.660 --> 33:38.660
Yeah.

33:38.660 --> 33:42.020
I mean, I enjoy the Star Wars movies, the prequels, not as much.

33:42.020 --> 33:45.100
I think the writing's horrible, but I'm more of a Star Trek guy.

33:45.100 --> 33:48.900
I've kind of lost track of what's going on these days.

33:48.900 --> 33:52.980
So speaking of this movie match thing, uh, essentially what you do is you and your partner

33:52.980 --> 33:58.920
or your group of friends set up, uh, this app to talk to your Plex library and it presents

33:58.920 --> 34:02.940
you with a random bunch of movies that you swipe right, swipe left if you like it or

34:02.940 --> 34:04.300
don't like it.

34:04.300 --> 34:09.260
And if you and your group end up with a common set of movies, it will show you at the bottom.

34:09.260 --> 34:13.340
Here are the three movies that you all thought were worth watching.

34:13.340 --> 34:15.940
So you just narrow things down for you.

34:15.940 --> 34:20.580
You could set up like a group chat, like movie night group chat, and you drop that link in

34:20.580 --> 34:26.180
there a couple of nights before and have everybody go through and swipe right and left.

34:26.180 --> 34:30.020
And then when it comes time, use the new Plex watch feature and just watch it all together.

34:30.020 --> 34:31.500
Socially distanced movie night.

34:31.500 --> 34:33.260
Hey, it could be a thing again.

34:33.260 --> 34:36.180
And now we, now we have the tools we need.

34:36.180 --> 34:37.180
This is really cool.

34:37.180 --> 34:40.580
So we'll have a link in the show notes or you could just Google search for movie match.

34:40.580 --> 34:44.680
It's just one word, but links will be at selfhosted.show slash 50.

34:44.680 --> 34:49.080
Now my final Plex pick for this week is a no spoilers script.

34:49.080 --> 34:54.100
Have you ever been watching a TV show and seen an episode, three or four episodes ahead

34:54.100 --> 35:02.180
in Plex and you see a character whose current storyline doesn't fit with that thumbnail?

35:02.180 --> 35:03.180
Yes.

35:03.180 --> 35:07.180
Well, this script will blur out the future episodes you haven't yet watched.

35:07.180 --> 35:08.180
That's great.

35:08.180 --> 35:11.740
So is it, it must be going through finding that JPEG and actually like applying a blur

35:11.740 --> 35:12.740
to it.

35:12.740 --> 35:13.740
That's funny.

35:13.740 --> 35:15.700
That's really funny.

35:15.700 --> 35:18.940
It will blur out the episodes based on the user who sets it up.

35:18.940 --> 35:24.720
So for example, my server, let's say Catherine had her own account, my wife, all the episodes

35:24.720 --> 35:27.860
I hadn't watched would be blurred even if she'd watched them.

35:27.860 --> 35:30.700
So it's not perfect, but it's better than nothing.

35:30.700 --> 35:31.700
Mark my words.

35:31.700 --> 35:35.400
Plex will introduce this feature to the Plex client.

35:35.400 --> 35:40.180
My prediction right here on self hosted 50 because in fuse the, that what I've been raving

35:40.180 --> 35:43.700
about recently, which is also a Plex compatible client does this.

35:43.700 --> 35:46.580
It's an option in the settings and it's a game changer.

35:46.580 --> 35:49.860
It's what actually switched us over using infuse and now I've just stuck for all of

35:49.860 --> 35:54.820
the other reasons, but it, it pre blurs the image and the description.

35:54.820 --> 35:59.700
Once you've watched it, it unblurs all that stuff and it's just goes based on the watch

35:59.700 --> 36:02.540
status and there's just one user within fuse.

36:02.540 --> 36:07.800
But if you are on an Apple TV platform and you want to use infuse to watch Plex and would

36:07.800 --> 36:11.360
like to do that, it's just in the settings and we love this feature.

36:11.360 --> 36:14.980
So I got to imagine this is something Plex is going to implement too, just because it's

36:14.980 --> 36:15.980
so fricking handy.

36:15.980 --> 36:16.980
Yeah.

36:16.980 --> 36:19.740
I'm still butthurt about this Nvidia shield update.

36:19.740 --> 36:24.220
I thought I'd get used to it and I thought I wouldn't care too much, but I tell you what

36:24.220 --> 36:28.420
my shield downstairs doesn't have the update, but the one upstairs does.

36:28.420 --> 36:30.900
And the one upstairs is really beginning to grate on me.

36:30.900 --> 36:35.740
So I might have to get an Apple TV soon.

36:35.740 --> 36:39.060
I want to take a moment and thank our friends over to cloud guru for their support.

36:39.060 --> 36:42.180
And I want to mention to you, they have a Linux file sharing course.

36:42.180 --> 36:44.900
It's a deep dive on Linux file sharing.

36:44.900 --> 36:48.600
It's a standalone course, but it's also part of a learning path intended to prepare you

36:48.600 --> 36:52.700
for the LPIC2 Engineer 202 and 450 exam.

36:52.700 --> 36:56.080
In this course, they're going to cover the basics and advanced configurations for Samba

36:56.080 --> 37:01.500
and NFS, including configuring file servers, exporting file shares, user authentication,

37:01.500 --> 37:03.900
client configuration, and mount options.

37:03.900 --> 37:08.080
We'll have a link for that in the show notes, or you can go to cloudguru.com.

37:08.080 --> 37:11.700
And also we have cloudfree.shop sponsoring this week's episode.

37:11.700 --> 37:16.460
You can go to cloudfree.shop to get a pre-flashed TAS motor smart plug, use the coupon code

37:16.460 --> 37:19.420
self-hosted to get a dollar off per smart plug.

37:19.420 --> 37:22.900
And of note, the new version two smart plug has been released recently.

37:22.900 --> 37:26.060
And this one's really cool because it features energy monitoring.

37:26.060 --> 37:30.980
So not only do you have a free and open source firmware on this thing from the factory, but

37:30.980 --> 37:36.720
I can now also monitor how much power my server is using without needing to tie up my kilowatt,

37:36.720 --> 37:37.720
for example.

37:37.720 --> 37:38.720
It's super cool.

37:38.720 --> 37:43.860
So go to cloudfree.shop and use the coupon code self-hosted.

37:43.860 --> 37:46.720
Greg writes into the show, Chris and the Badger, I love the show.

37:46.720 --> 37:50.900
It inspired me to learn Docker this past April and convert all of my self-hosted services

37:50.900 --> 37:51.900
to Docker.

37:51.900 --> 37:57.540
I built one big Docker compose that provides the MariaDB for various components, plus the

37:57.540 --> 38:01.220
swag and SSL for all my external services.

38:01.220 --> 38:06.380
And I've moved over to Airsonic Advanced and Booksonic and Ghost as well.

38:06.380 --> 38:10.180
All tips from the show, but here's my question.

38:10.180 --> 38:13.820
How do I manage updates for the various service images?

38:13.820 --> 38:17.180
Most of the compose entries are built with the latest tag.

38:17.180 --> 38:23.540
Should I move to a specific version and definition and then rebuild it on a regular basis?

38:23.540 --> 38:28.020
And for in-container security updates, how often should I repull the images to keep them

38:28.020 --> 38:29.420
up to date?

38:29.420 --> 38:32.700
Perhaps there is a guide or a white paper on different approaches.

38:32.700 --> 38:35.420
I think Greg just needs some help, Alex.

38:35.420 --> 38:42.020
Well, my advice would be straight off the bat, don't run latest because it's just a

38:42.020 --> 38:43.860
disaster waiting to happen.

38:43.860 --> 38:47.900
As I found out with my next cloud this week, which broke again.

38:47.900 --> 38:49.560
No, no, no way.

38:49.560 --> 38:53.940
Even though I talk about it in the last episode and I've pinned it to a specific version,

38:53.940 --> 38:55.380
you know, a major version.

38:55.380 --> 38:59.100
So 19, 20, 21, something like that.

38:59.100 --> 39:04.180
But within those certain tags, sometimes you've got to watch the developers as well even because

39:04.180 --> 39:08.700
they will just released all the security patches and all the updates for the entire life cycle

39:08.700 --> 39:11.140
of that major version.

39:11.140 --> 39:14.960
So you will get a lot of updates even sometimes when you pin specific versions.

39:14.960 --> 39:20.660
So the only way to be sure is to go to the Docker hub page for a specific image and look

39:20.660 --> 39:23.180
at the list of tags that are available.

39:23.180 --> 39:29.540
And some providers, some developers offer specific tags to the exact specific version,

39:29.540 --> 39:31.980
which ties to a specific commit.

39:31.980 --> 39:37.540
Others like next cloud offer a stable version of a major version, lots of different ways

39:37.540 --> 39:39.740
to do this particular thing.

39:39.740 --> 39:44.740
But for apps that don't matter, maybe you'll get away with latest.

39:44.740 --> 39:48.980
You know, things like traffic, for example, is probably a good idea to run that on latest

39:48.980 --> 39:51.200
because that's public facing.

39:51.200 --> 39:55.660
So you want the latest, you know, CVEs and things patched in that one.

39:55.660 --> 39:59.980
But for the rest of them, I would probably steer away from latest just because at some

39:59.980 --> 40:02.540
point or other, it will bite you.

40:02.540 --> 40:07.780
Bevan writes in and he is looking for a security camera system for a vacation house.

40:07.780 --> 40:11.140
So I think one that he probably isn't attending to be at very often.

40:11.140 --> 40:16.860
He writes, most of the options seem to need a cloud component in order to operate, which

40:16.860 --> 40:20.540
is a bit concerning since the systems are not cheap to install.

40:20.540 --> 40:24.940
I'd be interested to know what you guys use and maybe what other listeners might have

40:24.940 --> 40:25.940
installed.

40:25.940 --> 40:26.940
Cheers.

40:26.940 --> 40:27.940
Love the show.

40:27.940 --> 40:33.820
You can go up notes.jupitabroadcasting.com and type in Blue Iris because that's going

40:33.820 --> 40:34.820
to be my recommendation.

40:34.820 --> 40:38.420
We've got a couple of episodes where we've talked about it in the past.

40:38.420 --> 40:44.780
Episode 43, episode 28, 36, and we've talked about it quite a few times.

40:44.780 --> 40:49.960
The too long didn't listen, though, is Blue Iris is a Windows app.

40:49.960 --> 40:54.100
So you're going to want to have some kind of a system that has a quick sync enabled

40:54.100 --> 40:55.280
CPU.

40:55.280 --> 41:02.100
So something like the HP290 slim box, which you can pick up off eBay for about $130 at

41:02.100 --> 41:03.620
the time of recording.

41:03.620 --> 41:07.860
That has an eighth gen Intel CPU in it, which has quick sync.

41:07.860 --> 41:09.260
You install Windows on there.

41:09.260 --> 41:10.260
Yes, I know.

41:10.260 --> 41:11.480
Sorry, Windows.

41:11.480 --> 41:13.880
And then Blue Iris on top of that.

41:13.880 --> 41:20.820
And then what you will need to power the hardware is a POE switch connected to POE cameras.

41:20.820 --> 41:27.180
And you can usually get those for anywhere from $10 or $20 from Alibaba, all the way

41:27.180 --> 41:31.980
up to $300, $400 each if you want to buy UniFi gear.

41:31.980 --> 41:36.260
What I tend to stick with is the price point of around $50 a camera, unless I absolutely

41:36.260 --> 41:38.080
need 4K.

41:38.080 --> 41:40.340
And then it's about $100 a camera.

41:40.340 --> 41:42.180
But it's not terribly expensive.

41:42.180 --> 41:44.740
The cameras are the cheap part, essentially.

41:44.740 --> 41:48.940
Running Ethernet is going to be something of a consideration because that's how the

41:48.940 --> 41:50.900
cameras get their power.

41:50.900 --> 41:55.980
And then also, you might want to upgrade a couple of things in the HP box are recommended.

41:55.980 --> 42:00.060
It comes, I think, the one on eBay with a 500 gig spinning drive, for example.

42:00.060 --> 42:03.140
So you might want an SSD for that as well.

42:03.140 --> 42:04.780
But that's a pretty solid setup.

42:04.780 --> 42:08.340
And there are lots of guides on YouTube on how to set up Blue Iris.

42:08.340 --> 42:12.860
And recently, they've got some really cool features in there with DeepStack to do object

42:12.860 --> 42:14.480
detection and that kind of stuff.

42:14.480 --> 42:16.580
So Blue Iris gets my vote.

42:16.580 --> 42:17.580
Right.

42:17.580 --> 42:21.380
The cameras going over Ethernet are going to be a rock solid setup.

42:21.380 --> 42:28.300
And I think that's really key is a lot of the cloud solutions are all Wi-Fi cameras.

42:28.300 --> 42:31.900
And Wi-Fi cameras are going to work 90% of the time.

42:31.900 --> 42:35.420
But wired cameras are going to work 100% until there's like a hardware failure.

42:35.420 --> 42:39.660
Now with Blue Iris, Alex, because I'm unfamiliar with it, is there a remote viewing component

42:39.660 --> 42:41.860
so we could pull it up on a mobile device?

42:41.860 --> 42:42.860
It's so cool.

42:42.860 --> 42:50.260
There's an app for all the major mobile platforms, as well as a web browser, like a web interface.

42:50.260 --> 42:57.340
So I can just type the URL of my server, which happens to go through my traffic reverse proxy.

42:57.340 --> 43:00.700
And straight away, I'm thrown into a web interface that is HTML5.

43:00.700 --> 43:04.400
And I can see all six of my cameras, boom, right there.

43:04.400 --> 43:12.420
So if I hear a noise, or the doorbell goes, or something like that, I just type in bi.mydomain.com

43:12.420 --> 43:15.140
and boom, straight in the browser, I'm good to go.

43:15.140 --> 43:18.780
And that's another thing about the local wired systems is those camera feeds are going to

43:18.780 --> 43:19.900
come up a lot quicker.

43:19.900 --> 43:23.060
The cloud-based systems are going to have to connect to the service first.

43:23.060 --> 43:27.060
There's usually somewhere, like on a good day, a three-second delay.

43:27.060 --> 43:28.980
Sometimes it can be a 30-second delay.

43:28.980 --> 43:29.980
I don't like it.

43:29.980 --> 43:33.900
Now I normally would sit here and I'd tell you about my Wwise system.

43:33.900 --> 43:38.980
I have the WYZE cams that are going into a Shinobi box.

43:38.980 --> 43:43.500
But I don't love this solution because the cameras are not super reliable.

43:43.500 --> 43:47.940
And so I would not recommend them for a security system like what you have here.

43:47.940 --> 43:53.060
I have it for, we're off-grid somewhere and we come back and somebody's broken into our

43:53.060 --> 43:54.060
rig.

43:54.060 --> 43:55.860
I want to have a good shot that I've caught something on camera.

43:55.860 --> 43:57.980
That's really what I have my system for.

43:57.980 --> 44:02.620
But I don't know if I would trust it to run 24-7 because they're Wi-Fi cameras.

44:02.620 --> 44:05.300
They're doing it over RTMP or RTSP.

44:05.300 --> 44:07.820
It's just not super reliable.

44:07.820 --> 44:12.660
Now I've never used the next system I'm about to talk about so I would not normally recommend

44:12.660 --> 44:13.660
it.

44:13.660 --> 44:18.220
However, I have gotten a couple of emails and people have said that if you want a system

44:18.220 --> 44:23.700
that's kind of like a midway system, I've heard that the Arlo camera system is good

44:23.700 --> 44:24.780
for that kind of thing.

44:24.780 --> 44:28.780
You can get it like on Amazon in like a three to six camera kit.

44:28.780 --> 44:32.220
And what's kind of different about this is it has a base station unit that the cameras

44:32.220 --> 44:36.920
connect back to locally on your LAN and that's where the video is stored.

44:36.920 --> 44:42.740
And so that does seem compelling to me and I guess it has a pretty flexible setup system

44:42.740 --> 44:49.380
and you can get a three camera kit for 385 bucks off of Amazon when it's not on sale.

44:49.380 --> 44:53.340
And I don't know how great it is but the people who've written into the show seem to really

44:53.340 --> 44:54.340
like it.

44:54.340 --> 44:56.000
The cameras seem to work indoors and outdoors.

44:56.000 --> 45:01.780
Never tested it myself but if I had 385 bucks to burn, I may give this a go one day because

45:01.780 --> 45:05.620
I do like the idea of making this as much of an appliance as I can and I am not really

45:05.620 --> 45:09.180
in a situation to run Ethernet and do POE.

45:09.180 --> 45:13.580
Now I do have a couple of those Wyze cameras plugged into Blue Iris as well.

45:13.580 --> 45:19.540
One thing of note though is that the new V3 cameras don't support the RTSP firmware yet.

45:19.540 --> 45:27.960
So if you're thinking about getting those cheap $20, $25 Wyze Cam V2 cameras, just be

45:27.960 --> 45:29.940
aware you'll need to put a custom firmware on there.

45:29.940 --> 45:32.180
Yeah, my advice would be don't do Wyze right now.

45:32.180 --> 45:39.060
The Wyze 2 is just not fast enough to do the feed reliably and the V3, while it has a faster

45:39.060 --> 45:43.760
processor and better optics, doesn't have the firmware yet like you were saying.

45:43.760 --> 45:47.760
And I would hold off on purchasing a Wyze camera system until then because what I like

45:47.760 --> 45:51.540
to do is bring all those feeds back into Shinobi running on my Raspberry Pi.

45:51.540 --> 45:56.160
But with the V2 Wyzes, they drop off several times an hour right now.

45:56.160 --> 45:57.160
It's no good.

45:57.160 --> 45:58.160
There's gaps.

45:58.160 --> 46:01.820
And I think the V3s would be a lot better but you have to wait.

46:01.820 --> 46:05.060
So I'd say hold up when we come back on the show and say we've tested it, go for it.

46:05.060 --> 46:08.140
But in the meantime, if you can, wired is the way to go.

46:08.140 --> 46:12.500
And don't forget, as we talked about at the top of the show, we have a big Jupiter Broadcasting

46:12.500 --> 46:17.220
Meetup coming up very, very soon, both Salt Lake City and Denver.

46:17.220 --> 46:22.220
And don't forget to go to JupiterGarage.com and grab some self-hosted 50 merch.

46:22.220 --> 46:27.700
For the next couple of weeks, we're running member pricing on the store to celebrate Episode

46:27.700 --> 46:28.700
50.

46:28.700 --> 46:31.980
So you got a limited amount of time to get over to JupiterGarage.com and pick yourself

46:31.980 --> 46:34.740
up some stickers or shirts or I don't know.

46:34.740 --> 46:35.800
There's all kinds of stuff over there.

46:35.800 --> 46:36.800
I'm not you.

46:36.800 --> 46:37.800
I don't know what you do.

46:37.800 --> 46:42.060
And if you want to support the show, you can get a self-hosted dot show slash SRE.

46:42.060 --> 46:46.380
I got a memo the other day that we might be doing a special discount for all original

46:46.380 --> 46:47.380
merch.

46:47.380 --> 46:48.380
That's right.
