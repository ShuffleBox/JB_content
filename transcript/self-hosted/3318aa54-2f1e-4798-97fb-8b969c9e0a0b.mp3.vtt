WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.680
Well given that we only record every two weeks, it's not often that I get the chance to say

00:05.680 --> 00:15.520
BREAKING NEWS. I have some exciting news about the Prusa XL, a 3D printer that is enormous.

00:16.320 --> 00:20.800
Okay. Wait, when you say enormous, like how enormous are we talking about?

00:21.520 --> 00:28.320
So the standard size for a 3D printer has kind of been dictated by the Prusa Mark III now for

00:28.320 --> 00:35.360
several years. Similar size to like the Ender 3 and the Creality CR-10. All these guys,

00:35.360 --> 00:40.960
they've had a build volume that's been in the region of 10 inches by 8 by 8, something like

00:40.960 --> 00:49.360
that, which is 25 by 21 by 21 centimeters. This new one from Prusa, 14 inches square.

00:49.360 --> 00:50.400
Ah, okay.

00:51.040 --> 00:52.000
So it's a big boy.

00:53.040 --> 00:54.960
It's adequate, at least.

00:54.960 --> 01:02.240
Yeah. Now what's really interesting is the Prusa Mark III has a bed that moves back and forwards

01:02.240 --> 01:06.160
and the extruder moves left and right and that kind of stuff. So there's a lot of moving parts.

01:07.040 --> 01:12.560
The Prusa XL is so big that they couldn't really figure out a way to make the bed move properly

01:12.560 --> 01:18.800
and smoothly. So they're doing what's called a Core X Y 3D printer for this. So essentially

01:18.800 --> 01:23.440
what that means is the extruder does all the movement and the bed moves up and down.

01:23.440 --> 01:25.360
Uh-huh.

01:25.360 --> 01:26.240
Which is pretty cool.

01:26.240 --> 01:27.440
It sounds like my place.

01:27.440 --> 01:33.360
Now this thing has five interchangeable or up to five interchangeable tool heads.

01:34.400 --> 01:37.360
That's great. So you put your order in, I assume.

01:37.360 --> 01:43.760
Oh, no, no, no. Because this thing, wait for it, starts at $2,000.

01:44.880 --> 01:47.520
Oh. And that's before you've tricked it out.

01:47.520 --> 01:53.120
That's, yeah. I mean, that's beyond even Alex Impulse purchased territory at two grand. You

01:53.120 --> 01:53.840
know what I mean?

01:53.840 --> 01:58.560
Here's what we do is we launch a merch store that's filled with stuff that we've 3D printed.

01:58.560 --> 02:00.000
It pays for itself.

02:00.640 --> 02:05.520
Yeah. Yeah. So it's not that easy. You know, I've had a few things up on Etsy that I've

02:05.520 --> 02:10.080
been 3D printing for a while, like workshop accessories, that kind of thing. And I've sold

02:10.080 --> 02:14.880
a few, but I mean, I've come nowhere close to even paying for a couple of spools of filament,

02:14.880 --> 02:15.280
you know?

02:15.280 --> 02:22.400
So, yeah, there is that. I guess you got to deduct the cost of the machine, the materials,

02:22.400 --> 02:23.840
and God forbid your time.

02:23.840 --> 02:25.600
And the electricity. Don't forget that.

02:26.240 --> 02:30.880
Right. All that's valuable. So that's why you should probably go learn at acloudguru.com,

02:42.800 --> 02:45.840
I've been thinking about talking a bit more about 3D printing on the show. If you're

02:45.840 --> 02:52.720
interested in a segment on 3D printing, let me know, selfhosted.show/.contact. Now, something

02:52.720 --> 02:56.320
else I found on the internet this week, well, I guess it was a couple of weeks ago now,

02:56.320 --> 02:56.800
was-

02:56.800 --> 02:58.640
It was like just after the last episode.

02:58.640 --> 03:02.400
Yeah, literally a day or two after the last episode. It was a new toy for you, Chris,

03:02.400 --> 03:05.280
a Raspberry Pi compute module powered router.

03:06.160 --> 03:08.240
Ah, you're spending my money again, Alex.

03:08.240 --> 03:10.320
Yeah. It's easier when it's someone else's.

03:10.320 --> 03:15.280
Yeah. Well, this is perfect timing because we have a project to replace the router here

03:15.280 --> 03:19.520
at the studio and we want something that does WireGuard. I've decided, after the last road

03:19.520 --> 03:27.120
trip, that I wanted to divorce my VPN and server because guess what? My server was down

03:27.120 --> 03:31.040
and I couldn't VPN into troubleshoot. I want to put it on the router. I've wanted it that

03:31.040 --> 03:34.320
way for a long time, but I got a confession.

03:34.320 --> 03:37.600
Dear listener, Alex is nodding very, very strongly right now.

03:37.600 --> 03:46.320
I've been using the Comcast router that came with my Comcast business internet since they

03:46.320 --> 03:48.240
gave it to me. It worked.

03:48.240 --> 03:50.800
Can we have a sad tuba sound effect, please, editor?

03:54.080 --> 03:58.880
I know. The only excuse really is truly just I didn't feel like Googling. That's barely

03:58.880 --> 04:04.240
an excuse. So this is obviously something that needs to be fixed. And you found this

04:04.240 --> 04:11.920
fantastic dual gigabit Ethernet carrier board for the Raspberry Pi 4 compute module. It's

04:11.920 --> 04:16.960
a pretty small board, smaller than the original size of the Raspberry Pi, not quite, but around

04:16.960 --> 04:24.080
that size that you snap the compute module onto and you get USB ports, you get Ethernet,

04:24.080 --> 04:30.480
you get HDMI. And I should make it clear, you get two Ethernet, which wouldn't that

04:30.480 --> 04:34.160
be great? You can have one interface connected to your LAN, you have one interface

04:34.160 --> 04:38.240
connected to your network, to your ISP or whatever it might be. And, you know, you can

04:39.120 --> 04:40.560
build yourself a firewall.

04:40.560 --> 04:47.200
Are they both on the PCI bus? Because only one of them is like on the Raspberry Pi 4

04:47.200 --> 04:48.480
at least is PCI, right?

04:49.920 --> 04:54.240
Sadly, I would say you have cut right to what the core issue is.

04:56.160 --> 05:01.520
Interface zero is on the PCI bus, so like that would be a great LAN interface, right?

05:01.520 --> 05:07.680
But interface one connects via USB, which is then connected to the PCI bus. And

05:09.440 --> 05:16.800
this is also a challenge because stock OpenWRT does not have a driver for that. So you if

05:16.800 --> 05:21.200
you install just regular old Linux or Raspberry Pi OS, you're good to go. I mean, it's like

05:21.200 --> 05:28.240
there's been a driver since like kernel four. But OpenWRT has decided not to ship that and

05:28.240 --> 05:32.800
a friend of the show, Jeff Gerling, you know, he posted a poll request saying, hey, how

05:32.800 --> 05:36.400
about adding this support for this? And it doesn't seem like it's going anywhere. Yeah.

05:38.400 --> 05:42.800
It was actually funny. Speaking of Jeff, I was doing some research on this very thing

05:42.800 --> 05:46.720
and I came across this this whole GitHub thread that he had created on this very issue. And

05:46.720 --> 05:51.760
it was actually really useful to know don't go with stock OpenWRT with this router board

05:51.760 --> 05:56.720
because of this issue. And if you look at the documentation from the folks over it,

05:56.720 --> 06:02.560
what is it, Seed Studios? Is that what it is? Yeah. Link in the show notes. Yeah. On

06:02.560 --> 06:10.480
their Wiki, they link to their own build of OpenWRT, which has the driver. So if you get

06:10.480 --> 06:16.080
the image from them, you're pretty much good to go. But I'd like to back up and talk about

06:16.080 --> 06:21.520
why I wanted this because the compute module has interested me for a while, because I think

06:21.520 --> 06:28.160
that the critical flaw in the Raspberry Pi four as a server for me was the SD card just

06:28.160 --> 06:34.000
sucks. It's fine for booting the random OS here and there. But you know, I want to run

06:34.000 --> 06:42.480
your server on that. And you can get the compute module with a built in eMMC up to 32 gigs

06:42.480 --> 06:48.560
of eMMC. And that's pretty appealing. So I thought that would be the way to go. Or, you

06:48.560 --> 06:53.120
know, maybe an external USB drive. But I really wanted to try the eMMC and see how that works.

06:53.840 --> 06:58.080
And I got this device pretty quickly. I was I was shocked because I've tried to get the

06:58.080 --> 07:01.440
compute module on its own in some cases. And I've seen prices as high as one hundred and

07:01.440 --> 07:06.720
thirty dollars right now. And I think this whole thing all in was like 80 bucks. Then

07:06.720 --> 07:10.960
depending on the price of the computer module goes up from there. So you get it and it's

07:10.960 --> 07:15.520
really small. One thing I didn't like about it is they put the SD card on the bottom of

07:15.520 --> 07:20.000
the board and it's right under the HDMI port. So when you're plugging in the HDMI port,

07:20.000 --> 07:25.440
your thumb in the SD card, which is a trigger to eject. It's really frustrating. And then

07:25.440 --> 07:30.560
the USB-C ports also in the same area. And so when you're like kind of using your thumb

07:30.560 --> 07:34.400
to brace on the board so you can pull the power out. Well, guess what you're doing?

07:34.400 --> 07:40.160
You're ejecting the SD card. It's kind of annoying. So if you can avoid it, just don't

07:40.160 --> 07:45.280
use the SD card. I don't like the way they've designed that at all. But the trick is to

07:45.280 --> 07:52.080
the tricky thing is flashing eMMC. I didn't really appreciate this. But if you want to

07:52.080 --> 07:58.640
flash the eMMC with an image, a pre-built image directly, you got to move some jumpers

07:58.640 --> 08:03.600
on this little board to put it in a specific kind of boot mode. So it shows up as an external

08:03.600 --> 08:07.680
storage on your OS. Then you got to install a driver and you got to actually flash it

08:07.680 --> 08:14.640
that way. Well, I wasn't down for that. I said, no, thank you. Thanks anyways. And I

08:14.640 --> 08:18.800
went and got myself OpenSUSE at Tumbleweed because I've been I've been diving deep into

08:18.800 --> 08:24.880
Tumbleweed recently. Downloaded their Arch 64 image, just their generic ISO, not a Raspberry

08:24.880 --> 08:31.120
Pi image, not an image file, but an ISO, which is also an image file. Downloaded that to

08:31.120 --> 08:40.080
my machine and I flashed it to a Samsung SSD, a USB-C SSD. The ISO image. Plugged it into

08:40.080 --> 08:47.360
the USB port on this little board, booted it up like a regular old PC. It booted off

08:47.360 --> 08:52.640
the SSD because there's no OS on the thing. I booted up the SUSE installer, which was

08:52.640 --> 08:57.680
crazy slow, like ridiculously stupid slow. They're taking every opportunity to check

08:57.680 --> 09:02.080
your packages, scan your hardware, double check this. I mean, I'm not exaggerating

09:02.080 --> 09:06.400
when I say maybe it was nearly a 30 minute boot process just to get to just to get to

09:06.400 --> 09:11.440
the install. Oh, my God. Yeah. But then you get a full graphical yas installer and all

09:11.440 --> 09:16.880
that kind of stuff, which is, you know, that's nice. That's nice to see. 30 minutes. Mm hmm.

09:16.880 --> 09:23.040
Yeah. And it took quite a while to install it, too. I noticed on the console that it

09:23.040 --> 09:28.080
was like checking repositories and every single thing it was checking was 404ing on

09:28.080 --> 09:34.640
the console. But I could ping, right? Like I had no problem getting out and routing to

09:34.640 --> 09:37.760
the Internet. So I don't know what exactly was going on there, but it seemed to just

09:37.760 --> 09:45.920
really slow stuff down. But goodness, if my name isn't Chris, I tell you what.

09:47.040 --> 09:53.680
The SUSE installer just saw the EMMC like it was a hard drive. No big deal at all.

09:53.680 --> 09:58.640
It just auto the whole auto partition auto install the bootloader. It all worked. It just

09:58.640 --> 10:03.760
it installed to the EMMC on this Raspberry Pi compute module as if it was an x86 PC.

10:03.760 --> 10:08.880
I just booted off a thumb drive and was installing to the internal disk. It felt like a real

10:08.880 --> 10:13.440
computer and then it rebooted. And sure enough, I'm in open SUSE tumbleweed and it's good to

10:13.440 --> 10:18.640
go. And it worked great. I did do a little bit of benchmarking on the old EMMC because

10:18.640 --> 10:27.920
I was curious. And, you know, I saw anywhere between 80 to 200 megabytes a second. I don't

10:27.920 --> 10:31.440
really I don't really think it's very I don't think it's very good performance in terms

10:31.440 --> 10:35.120
of like overall, like if you want this thing to be faster, it's not going to be that. But

10:35.120 --> 10:39.920
it's way better than the SD. That's the same kind of level of performance as a spinning

10:39.920 --> 10:45.200
hard drive. Yeah. Yeah. It kind of performs like a yeah. Yeah. That's a good way to think

10:45.200 --> 10:49.440
of it. Alex is it kind of performs like a spinning hard drive. Yes, that's a that's

10:49.440 --> 10:57.600
a no for me, Doug. Yeah. Well, you know, some of these compute module boards have MVME slots

10:57.600 --> 11:05.200
and stuff. Our PCI Express slots. It's still an order of magnitude better than the SD card.

11:05.760 --> 11:09.840
Yeah. Oh, for sure. Yeah, for sure. At what point do we sit back and think we're flogging

11:09.840 --> 11:14.720
a dead horse here? You know, everything you've just told me, there wasn't a single thing

11:14.720 --> 11:19.680
that made me think, oh, I need this now. Like when I first saw the link, I was like, huh?

11:20.320 --> 11:23.760
OK, now I'm going to take this seriously. But hearing what you've just said, I'm like,

11:23.760 --> 11:33.760
oh, yeah, reality doesn't match. I mean, you could use like I do on my Pi four servers in the RV.

11:33.760 --> 11:39.680
You could use an external USB three SSD, which I never I never would have done until I was in

11:39.680 --> 11:44.480
this situation. And I can't believe how well it's worked. It's it's embarrassing. Like,

11:44.480 --> 11:48.880
what am I, two years now into using these things with SSDs that are over USB? It's stupid. It

11:48.880 --> 11:54.160
shouldn't be working, but it is. So you could go that route or, you know, I'm I'm going to get the

11:54.160 --> 12:00.080
IO board that I think has a PCI one X Express slot on it. And I want to get an MV. I already have an

12:00.080 --> 12:07.600
MV adapter for that that I'm going to try that. The other area that's a bit of a limit in terms

12:07.600 --> 12:15.200
of performance is thermals. So this thing runs hot. I think there's not a lot of room between

12:15.200 --> 12:23.120
the router board and the compute module. So it runs warm. And I was throwing different jobs at

12:23.120 --> 12:26.720
it. Like, I thought, let's this is a great opportunity to try out jellyfin again. It's

12:26.720 --> 12:31.760
been a couple of years. And so I tossed jellyfin on there and had it scan my library. And the CPU

12:31.760 --> 12:36.960
got up to like 181 degrees Fahrenheit, which is pretty hot. Then I started a build of net data

12:36.960 --> 12:43.600
while the library scan was going on. And I got up to 186 degrees. Sorry. And then in real numbers,

12:43.600 --> 12:48.800
that's 82 Celsius, right? I ain't dealing in your freedom units, dude. I know I live here,

12:48.800 --> 12:53.920
but still, I think I saw it got up to 85 Celsius is the highest I saw somewhere out there. I mean,

12:53.920 --> 12:59.200
that's warm. It's I mean, you know, Intel starts to thermal throttle, though, you know, real CPUs,

12:59.200 --> 13:05.680
air quotes, real CPUs get up to 100 and then they start throttling. So 85 is OK. It's warm.

13:06.240 --> 13:11.840
Yeah, no, it's fine. And it'll handle it all. It's literally been going now for

13:11.840 --> 13:17.040
more than 24 hours. And it's it's I'm still getting like 1.5 gigahertz out of the most of

13:17.040 --> 13:24.320
the cores most of the time. It's going as we as we record right now. If you put a heat sink or

13:24.320 --> 13:28.960
put it in a case with a fan, I think you'd get a little bit less thermal throttling out of this

13:28.960 --> 13:33.600
thing is kind of what my takeaway was, because this is just naked. You know, it's just absolutely

13:33.600 --> 13:38.880
naked. I saw decent performance on the network transfer. I will have a better take at how it

13:38.880 --> 13:43.120
works as a router after I've, you know, gone through all of the paces there. But

13:44.640 --> 13:52.080
I don't have a super fast connection to deal with. So I was getting around 600 megabits out of the

13:52.800 --> 13:59.680
interface that's connected to USB, which is the ETH one. 600 megabits is doable for me. I have a

13:59.680 --> 14:06.960
300 megabit Comcast connection, right? I have a gigabit LAN so that the LAN interface that's on

14:06.960 --> 14:11.520
the PCI bus, that'll be full. That's like you get nearly 900 megabits a second out of that thing.

14:12.560 --> 14:19.600
And because the interface connected to USB is still twice as fast as my Internet connection,

14:19.600 --> 14:24.800
I don't really think it's going to be a problem. The only other downside I could foresee is that

14:25.520 --> 14:31.360
stuff on the USB bus also takes more CPU. So I could see it putting more load on the box. So I

14:31.360 --> 14:36.320
won't know until I put this thing into production in that regard. But as far as like this kind of

14:36.320 --> 14:44.000
like this, could this work as I can no longer wait for the Home Assistant Amber to arrive because of

14:44.000 --> 14:48.240
part delays or something. So I'm going to deploy this. Could it work as that? Yes. I think this

14:48.240 --> 14:55.120
would be a pretty good upgrade from my current Pi setup as servers. I think this compute module

14:55.120 --> 15:00.960
on a board, especially maybe the IO board, which is arriving tonight after we record,

15:00.960 --> 15:04.160
funny enough. If it just would have showed up a little earlier, I could have told you. But

15:04.160 --> 15:08.160
I bought it like two days later. And so it's of course, it's showing up a little late. But that

15:08.160 --> 15:12.640
has I think that has real potential for me to build a server platform around. And when you say

15:12.640 --> 15:18.080
what when I look at this and what do I get out of it, what I get out of it is two to three watts of

15:18.080 --> 15:24.640
power draw, even when it's being slammed. That's massive for me. And to get dual network ports and

15:24.640 --> 15:29.760
to have additional IO, depending on which board you put the compute module into while having access

15:29.760 --> 15:35.040
to the Raspberry Pi ecosystem of support. And at this point, you can pull down Arch Fedora,

15:36.240 --> 15:44.800
Alma Linux and of course, CentOS and and Rel and Ubuntu that all just work out of the box using

15:44.800 --> 15:51.520
the generic arm 64 ISO image now. And they work with this stuff. And so we've gotten past the

15:51.520 --> 15:57.120
point where you got to go find this very specific image to get it all to work. And that opens the

15:57.120 --> 16:02.240
door up to a lot more people, in my opinion, and a lot more standard server type operating systems

16:02.240 --> 16:09.360
just in time for the Raspberry Pi five to come in and require a whole new bunch of esoteric builds.

16:09.360 --> 16:16.000
I wonder. Yeah, you're probably right. We'll see. I also after I was reading through the thread that

16:16.000 --> 16:21.520
Jeff had started, I found another board that he's talked about before in the past that has both NICs

16:21.520 --> 16:27.760
on the PCI bus. Yeah, so I ordered that one. No, of course you did. Of course, it's like it was like

16:27.760 --> 16:32.720
30 bucks. So like, why not? Right. Once you've got a compute module, this is where this is actually

16:32.720 --> 16:37.200
quite a powerful little thing. Right. For those that aren't familiar, the compute module slightly

16:37.200 --> 16:43.760
smaller than the Pi four itself. And it just sort of pops into a daughter board, if you like. And

16:43.760 --> 16:49.120
then lots of different people make different breakout boards, I suppose that expose different

16:49.120 --> 16:53.440
interfaces for the Pi and stuff like that. So the one that Chris has been talking about, obviously,

16:53.440 --> 17:00.320
is focused at being a router. But this I.O. board, for example, exposes like it's got an NVME slot

17:00.320 --> 17:07.280
on it and all sorts of other stuff. Yeah. And a battery for the real time clock, which is something

17:07.280 --> 17:11.920
that the Pi has traditionally been missing. You know, the nice little. Yeah. Nice thing for a

17:11.920 --> 17:17.200
server. Yeah, very cool. Well, I put a link in the show notes to that Seed Studio website.

17:17.200 --> 17:21.840
It's a little bit funny, so you will need to go and look it up, how it's spelt. And they do still

17:21.840 --> 17:28.320
have, if you can believe it, the compute module fours in stock shipping today. So take it for

17:28.320 --> 17:31.600
what it's worth. Chris bought one, it showed up. So hopefully that's the same for you. We're not

17:31.600 --> 17:34.480
affiliated in any way. I wish you luck.

17:36.000 --> 17:41.600
lino.com slash SSH. Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account and you go there to

17:41.600 --> 17:45.520
support the show. It's like the next best thing to being jacked into the business.

17:45.520 --> 17:49.760
Next best thing to being jacked into the matrix and having information downloaded to your brain.

17:50.720 --> 17:57.200
I mean it because you can go on there and you can just learn and play and investigate and test.

17:57.760 --> 18:02.560
I mean, that's a huge part of what I use Linode for when I think about how it's changed my game

18:02.560 --> 18:06.560
over the years, doing just a little bit of research here and there, trying something out

18:06.560 --> 18:11.760
every now and then. And when you add it all up, man, that's been like one of the keys to like

18:11.760 --> 18:16.080
getting things done on time for these shows and being able to get things figured out.

18:16.080 --> 18:20.400
But you know, Linode really is just super fast too. And I think that's a big part of why I've

18:20.400 --> 18:25.520
stuck with it. They just rolled out new MVME disks. They've got 40 gigabit connections coming

18:25.520 --> 18:30.960
to the hypervisors. They are their own ISP. That's the level of control they have over their

18:30.960 --> 18:36.880
connectivity. They've got 11 data centers to choose from. And I feel like it is a bit of a

18:36.880 --> 18:42.400
superpower because it's how we've hosted everything for the last couple of years. And you know,

18:42.400 --> 18:47.040
frankly, our audience would tell us if something wasn't up to snuff. There's a higher expectation

18:47.040 --> 18:51.840
with Jupiter Broadcasting that our technology stack is going to respect your privacy, that's

18:51.840 --> 18:56.160
going to perform well, that it's going to be up when you want to download a show right before you

18:56.160 --> 19:04.080
hit the road or something like that. And you know, you're all kind of picky as I am. And if things

19:04.080 --> 19:09.920
didn't work right, if the infrastructure wasn't up to snuff, you'd tell us. And we literally get

19:09.920 --> 19:15.920
zero complaints because Linode is just screaming fast. And it's 30 to 50% cheaper than the major

19:15.920 --> 19:19.280
hyperscalers out there that just want to lock you into their platforms anyways.

19:20.000 --> 19:26.800
And that's one of the nice things about Linode. I strike that balance with Linode where I feel like

19:26.800 --> 19:32.160
I'm in control. I have the power in this relationship. And I think that's also really

19:32.160 --> 19:36.640
important for just the type of business person that I am. But like I said earlier, there's so

19:36.640 --> 19:40.560
much you could learn and try with Linode too. And that's where that $100 is really special.

19:40.560 --> 19:45.760
That is actually a unique opportunity. Because with $100, you can really try out the platform,

19:46.640 --> 19:51.920
see what you can do with it. And then if you ever have any problems, they've got the best customer

19:51.920 --> 19:56.960
support in the business by phone or ticket or even on social. If you're a customer, they're

19:56.960 --> 20:02.000
going to help you out. And I think they're going to impress you. They also have just

20:02.000 --> 20:07.200
a bunch of great tutorials and how-to guides. They have S3 compatible object storage that

20:07.200 --> 20:12.480
I use just the crap out of. So from the best customer support, super fast rigs,

20:12.480 --> 20:18.080
super fast networking, and a Linux culture that runs deep, there's just like a lot of

20:18.080 --> 20:24.000
these types of reasons to choose Linode, but you'll find your own. So go try it out. Linode.com.

20:27.520 --> 20:31.760
Right. So we're not really going to be talking about self-hosting for the next few minutes.

20:31.760 --> 20:38.800
I want to have a bit of a rambling gripe grudge airing fest about Android 12 and everything that

20:38.800 --> 20:43.680
I think is wrong with the state of the mobile ecosystem these days. I'm actually up for it

20:43.680 --> 20:47.520
because how do you access all these things you're hosting? A lot of times it's through

20:47.520 --> 20:51.760
a mobile device or a tablet on the wall or something like that. You know, it was interesting

20:51.760 --> 20:56.560
as well as I posted a tweet last night or the night before about saying, you know, Pixel 6

20:56.560 --> 21:02.800
isn't for me. I can't stand Android 12's UI, which I'll come on to shortly, and the fingerprint

21:02.800 --> 21:07.920
reader sucks and the phone is too slippery and, you know, all these different reasons.

21:08.480 --> 21:13.040
And then a couple of people reminded me why I was excited about buying it in the first place.

21:13.040 --> 21:18.400
There's stuff that the Pixel does that is genuinely pretty cool. So they've got this

21:19.120 --> 21:25.040
call screening thing built in for scammers, which if you don't live in the US, like in the UK,

21:25.040 --> 21:30.240
that you can just register with some telephone preference service. But in the US, there's no

21:30.240 --> 21:35.840
such thing. And I get, you know, it's a brand new phone number to me that I've obviously only ever

21:35.840 --> 21:42.160
given out to a few people. And I get four or five spam calls a day that just love to call me and

21:42.160 --> 21:49.520
just say nothing. Does that happen to you? Oh, well, it did for a long time. Yeah. Yeah, I've

21:49.520 --> 21:53.520
got I've got a couple of apps that screen calls on the iPhone because they did open up an API for

21:53.520 --> 21:58.480
that. But it's not built into the OS like it is with Google Assistant. My mom got a call recently

21:58.480 --> 22:05.920
saying that she owed AT&T $1,200 for an iPhone, but the whole call was a scam. But she was very

22:05.920 --> 22:11.760
convinced. So she calls me up. She's like, I owe somebody money. Like, what's going on? Mom, it's

22:11.760 --> 22:16.000
a scam. Yeah, it's absolutely a scam. Yeah. And that kind of stuff is really nice just to when

22:16.000 --> 22:20.000
you're at when you're at work and your phone, you know, maybe you're in a meeting, it's nice to have

22:20.000 --> 22:25.360
something catch that kind of thing. So it doesn't interrupt your day. Yeah, not only do they have

22:25.360 --> 22:31.680
cool screening, so that's inbound, they've also added with the Pixel six, a new outbound kind of

22:31.680 --> 22:39.440
on hold Google Assistant will be on hold for you type mode, which is legitimately very, very cool.

22:39.440 --> 22:44.160
It uses all of the text to speech stuff to listen to what the phone is saying the person on the

22:44.160 --> 22:50.160
phone is saying. And it will print out in text for you on the screen. So you know, press one to

22:50.160 --> 22:54.560
talk to sales, press two to talk to and by the time you got to option seven, you're like, what was

22:54.560 --> 22:59.280
option one again? It's on the screen in front of you. So I found that quite helpful a couple of

22:59.280 --> 23:08.960
times. But yeah, in general, I just couldn't deal with with Android 12. You know, it's just they I

23:08.960 --> 23:15.440
think they've ruined it. There's also in the background, like the slow and continued effort

23:15.440 --> 23:20.800
to de Google different services over different, you know, like different chunks, like, I still

23:20.800 --> 23:25.840
haven't gone back to Google Maps. Like that was that was a successful de Google vacation. It was

23:25.840 --> 23:31.600
rough because I did it on the road trip. But I think because I did it on the road trip, I had to

23:31.600 --> 23:39.520
do it like in anger under pressure and it's stuck. Great. So I wonder too, like, does this play into

23:39.520 --> 23:46.000
that at all for you? A little bit? Yeah. I mean, when when I saw the news this week that Apple have

23:47.200 --> 23:53.280
somehow made a U turn on right to repair and made some parts available, what previously only

23:53.280 --> 23:58.880
available to authorized service centers and stuff like that, I think to myself, okay, that's another

23:58.880 --> 24:04.720
pin down on the Apple domino board of stuff that I care about. So, you know, right to repair,

24:04.720 --> 24:09.920
I can get parts for my phone and my laptop shortly. Okay, right now it's only a very small

24:09.920 --> 24:14.480
program. But I'm excited for what that means over the next five, 10 years of how they're going to

24:14.480 --> 24:19.760
expand that program and hopefully start designing the devices with a bit more modularity in mind so

24:19.760 --> 24:24.640
that people can just pop out the logic board and pop out a battery and that kind of basic stuff

24:24.640 --> 24:29.840
that after two or three years, the phone still functions fine. You think, I wish I could just

24:29.840 --> 24:35.760
have a new battery. I don't want to buy a whole new phone. Well, that's hopefully going to be

24:35.760 --> 24:41.360
the reality moving forward. The other thing that Apple are doing pretty well, and I was really

24:41.360 --> 24:48.240
suspicious of this at first, but I think their privacy stance is actually really solid. You know,

24:48.240 --> 24:53.680
a lot of the stuff they're doing with the ask to track stuff in iOS, you know, particularly I've

24:53.680 --> 25:00.080
seen articles talking about how much that's hurt Facebook and specifically their targeted advertising.

25:00.880 --> 25:05.200
Okay, you've got me. I am really impressed by that. Google could never do that.

25:06.400 --> 25:11.440
Right. Well, that's true. Yeah. You know, it's funny. It is good to see them make these right

25:11.440 --> 25:18.240
to repair moves. And I do like to see them make anti-track moves on the platform, even if they're

25:18.240 --> 25:23.520
in some cases just asking apps not to do it. But then I see them doing like the library scanning

25:23.520 --> 25:27.280
stuff. And I'm like, boy, you got it with Apple. There's a lot of good with the bad you have to

25:27.280 --> 25:33.120
take. And that's the thing that I've been struggling with. So for me, I have to ask myself how important

25:33.120 --> 25:38.480
is customizing my device, like changing out the launcher, maybe even just putting an entirely

25:38.480 --> 25:43.360
different OS on there or different image. And for different devices, I have different answers

25:43.360 --> 25:49.200
to that question. If you were to ask me about the fire tablets that I have littered throughout my

25:49.200 --> 25:55.280
homes now, the studio or at least the studio in the RV, I would say extremely. I want to always

25:55.280 --> 26:00.400
be able to reflash that. I always want to be able to replace the launcher. That is probably the

26:01.120 --> 26:07.200
two top features of those devices for me, right? Mostly because the fire launchers are just garbage

26:07.200 --> 26:13.280
and so unstable, very slow and unstable. Yeah. Yeah. What are you? And it's like, okay,

26:13.280 --> 26:18.480
maybe maybe a decade ago. But what are we doing today? What's going on here? It's just it's

26:18.480 --> 26:25.280
unacceptable. So and you know, but I've never I've never wanted that from my phone. And I think maybe

26:25.280 --> 26:33.280
I'm just an old enough guy where I've never totally wanted that. I wanted that early on

26:33.280 --> 26:38.640
in the early days of Android when there was like things I was getting from it, maybe improved

26:38.640 --> 26:42.720
battery life, improved performance, getting the OS on a device that didn't get that OS because

26:42.720 --> 26:47.120
the vendors bailed so quickly or maybe the camera app was better. The same reason that you're into

26:47.120 --> 26:54.960
Linux. Yeah. You like to tinker under the hood. I mean, right. That's just you. Yeah. And I want

26:54.960 --> 27:02.560
my phone to always take a picture and I want it to always make a call. So I didn't really have that

27:02.560 --> 27:06.960
same requirement for that device. And I think those things shift for us to over time. You may

27:06.960 --> 27:10.640
really, for example, like the launchers may be replacing the launchers with something you did

27:10.640 --> 27:15.680
all the time. And then the vendor started to get it right after a while. So the need to replace it

27:15.680 --> 27:19.280
stopped becoming as necessary. It's funny you should say that because I've been running a

27:19.280 --> 27:26.160
OnePlus 7T for the last two years. I think that's actually the last good device that OnePlus made,

27:26.160 --> 27:31.680
but I still replaced the launcher. So it's running Android 10. It did run Android 11,

27:31.680 --> 27:36.400
but I wiped and downgraded it because the update that OnePlus shipped for Android 11 was,

27:37.600 --> 27:42.000
it was just so buggy. Like it just kept dropping the frame rate because a 90 Hertz

27:42.000 --> 27:47.840
display and it kept dropping the frame rate to like 20 or 30 frames a second. And I noticed

27:47.840 --> 27:52.080
that kind of thing. So I had to go into the settings and toggle it to 60 Hertz and then

27:52.080 --> 27:59.200
back to 90 and it was fine again. I also have the Google work profile installed on my phone.

27:59.200 --> 28:03.440
So it has like, I love the way Android does this, by the way, it has like two separate

28:03.440 --> 28:09.440
profiles, like modes on the phone. Yeah, that's nice. All my work apps are completely separate

28:09.440 --> 28:14.480
from my personal apps. So like I've got two Gmail apps installed on my phone. So it's very obvious

28:14.480 --> 28:20.640
for me when I'm context switching to calendar apps, you know, you could achieve that in iOS

28:20.640 --> 28:27.120
as far as customizing alerts and, and icons. Like you could have a focus mode that is work.

28:27.120 --> 28:32.320
And so you'd have work launchers and you'd have work alerts, but you would not be able to have

28:32.320 --> 28:36.560
two versions of Gmail. You'd have to have essentially two mail apps. One's a personal mail

28:36.560 --> 28:40.720
app and one's your work mail app. I'll tell you what's also awesome is there's an app I've got

28:40.720 --> 28:46.880
called quiet for Gmail and I have it set on a timer and it turns my email on and off at 8am.

28:46.880 --> 28:51.920
It turns it on at 6pm, it turns it off. And then for the rest of the time, I can just go into the

28:51.920 --> 28:57.280
app and swipe to refresh and it will, you know, load my emails if I really want to at, you know,

28:57.280 --> 29:02.160
midnight check, you know, a Sunday night before work or whatever. But, you know, on the whole,

29:02.160 --> 29:08.640
it's a very easy way to separate concerns between the two contexts of my life.

29:08.640 --> 29:15.680
And, uh, there was some really awful bugs in the way the under screen fingerprint reader on the,

29:15.680 --> 29:24.880
uh, 70 and Android 11 just kept not working very well. And you know, I use it dozens of times a

29:24.880 --> 29:29.840
day and it was very frustrating. So I've gone back to Android 10 on the 70 and forever there,

29:29.840 --> 29:35.520
it shall stay until I find a replacement, you know, that'll be fine. But that brings me back

29:35.520 --> 29:44.720
to the pixel six, I think, and, uh, the in-screen fingerprint reader. Oh God, is it bad. It's really

29:44.720 --> 29:49.600
bad. You know, I've had one for two years in my OnePlus device and sure. You know, when, when I'm,

29:49.600 --> 29:54.640
you know, baking bread or doing something and my hands are a little bit greasy or sweaty or whatever,

29:54.640 --> 29:59.920
it doesn't work all the time, but I have the pattern to unlock and on OnePlus devices, I have

29:59.920 --> 30:04.960
face unlock as well. Don't have face unlock on a pixel. It seems like something they would have

30:04.960 --> 30:10.080
ripped off by now. Yeah. Well, I mean, all the OnePlus are doing is using the selfie camera.

30:10.080 --> 30:15.600
It's not like a face ID system like Apple with a fancy 3d dot matrix scanners. It's just,

30:16.320 --> 30:23.360
does that look vaguely like Alex? Yeah, that'll do. Is that a picture? Who cares? Right. Exactly.

30:23.360 --> 30:27.840
And, uh, for the most part, I mean, if you physically got my phone, I'm probably going to

30:27.840 --> 30:32.880
notice, you know, unless you're my kid and then maybe, but she's not quite old enough for that

30:32.880 --> 30:38.000
yet. She'll be coming for it soon. Yeah. Yeah. She started crawling this week. So that's, that's been

30:38.000 --> 30:43.120
fun. I remember early on when I was in a grocery store when, and I figured out, wait a minute,

30:43.680 --> 30:48.800
are there rattle apps? There was a rattle apps. Perfect here. Hold this. And this is like,

30:48.800 --> 30:53.600
I'm going to let you hold this, you little monster while I pay for these groceries, this thousand

30:53.600 --> 31:01.680
dollar baby rattle. Yeah. Really kind of ridiculous actually. So fingerprint readers aside, because,

31:01.680 --> 31:07.520
you know, you can kind of just about learn to deal with that. We've got to talk about Android 12 and

31:07.520 --> 31:13.280
this material you interface redesign. Have you seen much in the way of screenshots? Have you got

31:13.280 --> 31:19.200
a pixel three, right? Yeah, I do. I do. Um, it's up to date as far as the pixel three will go. So

31:19.200 --> 31:25.520
I don't know, but I have not immersed myself in it. I have heard a lot of different takes on it,

31:25.520 --> 31:29.040
though. So I'm curious to know what you think. Cause I've actually heard people that like it

31:29.040 --> 31:34.480
and it doesn't sound like you do well, they're wrong. I tell you, do you like padding?

31:35.680 --> 31:40.800
I mean, not really. I generally find it to be kind of gross. Cause if you like lots of wasted

31:40.800 --> 31:46.320
white space on a beautiful big display, then Android 12 is for you. But it makes it feel like

31:46.320 --> 31:51.520
it's the, like the whole UI just isn't designed for your screen size. No, you know, so there's a

31:51.520 --> 31:56.960
couple of things and they almost all to do with how the notification center toggle swipe down thing

31:57.600 --> 32:05.120
operates. So on my one plus device, which is running, I can say Android 10, I have 12 toggles

32:05.120 --> 32:10.640
that I can customize to be practically anything on my phone that are just a tap. You know, I want to

32:10.640 --> 32:15.280
turn wifi off swipe tap. That's it. It's all in one place. It's all at the top of the screen.

32:15.280 --> 32:20.240
It doesn't move around. It's just in one place. And there are 12 different things and I can long

32:20.240 --> 32:26.560
press to get to the settings of wifi or Bluetooth or whatever it is. Right. It's a really elegant

32:26.560 --> 32:37.040
system. Android 12, there are four. That's just crazy. Not only that, one of those options now is

32:37.040 --> 32:45.040
a new internet toggle. So rather than it being a simple single tap to turn off wifi, I have to

32:45.040 --> 32:51.600
swipe tap and then do this hand kind of gymnastic gesture all the way down to the bottom of the

32:51.600 --> 33:01.520
screen, then toggle off wifi. You know, that's so funny because it seems like even iOS, right? It's

33:01.520 --> 33:04.800
going in the direction of like control center where there's just way more things you can do

33:05.600 --> 33:09.280
just by sliding down the screen. Like even Apple is out of a whole bunch of buttons there.

33:10.000 --> 33:15.120
Why, why go back? Why, why reduce functionality? Why make you take more taps? Yeah, that kind of

33:15.120 --> 33:20.400
stuff. I don't know. It was too complicated. Alex. The problem was it was too complicated of a UI

33:20.400 --> 33:25.120
and it was intimidating to new users. I need to make it simpler. You're sounding like the

33:25.120 --> 33:31.760
comment section on one of Linus tech tips, Linux challenge videos. At this point, we hear this all

33:31.760 --> 33:39.040
the time. Who are these mythical new users? Who are they? I don't know because it's funny because

33:39.040 --> 33:46.240
Google changes it all the time with every single release. And so it causes users, these new users

33:46.240 --> 33:51.760
to actually lose their footing. It's the geeks who can adapt and people criticize the iOS launcher

33:51.760 --> 33:56.240
for being very slow to change and the notifications, which got a huge change in the last OS.

33:56.240 --> 34:03.120
You still saw them there. Yeah. But at the same time, the reality is, is all of my family members

34:03.120 --> 34:09.920
that got an iPhone or an iPad a decade ago are, are more competent today. Like they know how to

34:09.920 --> 34:14.080
get to settings. They know how to change stuff. They know how to launch apps. They have evolved

34:14.080 --> 34:19.840
their skill set. And my family members that have Android devices are still lost as hell. Every time

34:19.840 --> 34:24.640
they get an Android device, the buttons are all in a different place. Setting screen is reorganized,

34:25.200 --> 34:31.040
renamed, and they start at zero every single time. And every time Google reorganizes these

34:31.040 --> 34:35.040
dropdown screens, they're making it harder for these very new users that they're trying to

34:35.040 --> 34:39.840
design this stuff for. You know what it feels like? And I think it was Tyler on Twitter that

34:39.840 --> 34:46.080
said it most succinctly to me. It feels like someone has slapped a cheap skin on top of my

34:46.080 --> 34:52.880
stock Android. And it just, it doesn't, it doesn't work. It doesn't fit for me. And, you know, they

34:52.880 --> 34:58.880
tout all these features. Like it picks up colors from your wallpaper and changes the theme throughout

34:58.880 --> 35:04.480
the app. I don't want that. I want to set it and forget it. It is a production device that should

35:04.480 --> 35:13.200
just always be exactly as I left it. That's it. That's its job. It's funny. That has been a trend

35:13.200 --> 35:17.520
recently of like, well, we will automatically detect a primary color in your website or in

35:17.520 --> 35:23.120
your background and we'll completely recolor the UI. So that way it matches and user's response is

35:23.120 --> 35:29.840
always, no, don't, don't really want that. I think Big Sur might've started this trend, actually,

35:29.840 --> 35:35.440
you know, Apple, maybe even going back to, was it iOS seven when they introduced like the new

35:35.440 --> 35:42.240
Crayola style, you know, cartoonish kind of vibe to it. It was a big redesign. It was a while ago

35:42.240 --> 35:47.120
now. Yeah. Well, wasn't there just a big upset about Safari, like getting changing colors and

35:47.120 --> 35:51.600
stuff, new tab design or something like that and taking colors from websites and people hate it.

35:51.600 --> 35:57.680
People don't like change. Why change it? It's not broken radical change for just change sake. I

35:57.680 --> 36:03.040
think is what people don't like. I mean, I'm the type of guy that installs bartender on my Mac

36:03.040 --> 36:09.040
so that I can condense the icons in Big Sur back together again. You know, I don't need things

36:09.040 --> 36:16.160
spacing out more. I have a very fine cursor on a laptop or, you know, a computer. I don't need

36:16.160 --> 36:23.760
finger sized buttons. Yeah. I'm on a phone. I tell you, you know, you give me a six and a half inch

36:23.760 --> 36:29.360
display or whatever, and you take, you reduce my options by an order of magnitude. I just,

36:30.160 --> 36:35.120
can I tell you what my lesson is from this is that if you're building an app or you're hosting

36:35.120 --> 36:43.120
something or whatever it is, web apps are still the best way to go because all of these OS platforms

36:43.120 --> 36:47.360
disappoint in some other way. And like you can be an Android fan for a while and then you get

36:47.360 --> 36:50.480
burned out. You can be an iOS fan for a while. You get burned out and it's not like you can go out

36:50.480 --> 36:56.400
and buy some other phone at any scale, any practicality right now. But as long as it's a web

36:56.400 --> 37:01.120
app, well, you can get to it from your, any phone OS, you can get it from any desktop OS.

37:01.680 --> 37:10.400
Ultimately it is the neutralizer, which brings me to my final nail in the coffin for iOS for now.

37:10.400 --> 37:17.200
And I do hope the courts kind of change how this is going to go. I was listening to Craig Federighi

37:17.200 --> 37:23.200
passionately defend against sideloading. And I could not believe some of the trash.

37:23.200 --> 37:27.200
That's so embarrassing to listen to him. Cringy.

37:27.200 --> 37:32.000
And for me on, on Android, you know, I discovered sponsor block this week for YouTube.

37:32.000 --> 37:37.280
By the way, if you've not come across this thing, it will cut out the intros of YouTube

37:37.280 --> 37:42.400
videos. And this video is brought to you, but like all that stuff is just gone. You know,

37:42.400 --> 37:47.600
like, and subscribe is gone, just gone. It's amazing. And I wanted to sideload this on my

37:47.600 --> 37:53.040
Android TV device and I can do that. If I wanted to do this on an Apple TV, I mean,

37:53.040 --> 37:57.040
I don't have one, but I assume it would be more difficult because why would Apple approve

37:57.040 --> 38:02.960
something like that through the app store, you know? Yeah. Um, so for now at least,

38:02.960 --> 38:08.960
I think I will stick with my 7T until something better comes along. Although,

38:08.960 --> 38:16.480
the grass over on the iOS side is looking ever more slightly verdant and greener.

38:16.480 --> 38:20.880
I'll probably buy one at some point and then regret it and return it like I always do.

38:20.880 --> 38:24.320
Well, since we'll probably never have this chat again on the show where we will have

38:24.320 --> 38:29.520
it very infrequently, I just want to add, because I don't get an opportunity to do this

38:29.520 --> 38:35.200
very often and it holds true now about two years in, I think something we do not give

38:35.200 --> 38:39.920
iOS enough credit for on this show in particular, is that if you are a Home Assistant user,

38:40.880 --> 38:49.600
you can use HomeKit to integrate with the iOS HomeKit system. And every device you have in Home

38:49.600 --> 38:57.200
Assistant, every light, every fan, every thermostat, shows up as a HomeKit device to your iPhone,

38:57.760 --> 39:02.720
which means it shows up as a device to Siri. It shows up as a device to your iPhone.

39:02.720 --> 39:08.000
As a device to Siri, it shows up as a device to your watch. It shows up when I pull down

39:08.000 --> 39:12.400
the control panel and it changes location too, by the way. So when I'm at the studio,

39:13.040 --> 39:18.000
it updates to devices that are here. And when I go home, it updates to devices and chips.

39:18.000 --> 39:19.040
And as I'm here right now...

39:19.040 --> 39:22.640
Is that what you've been telling me about this HomeKit bridge for ages?

39:22.640 --> 39:26.560
No, HomeKit bridge is a little different. That's a little different. That HomeKit

39:26.560 --> 39:30.720
bridge allows you to talk to devices that don't natively speak HomeKit. It'll talk

39:30.720 --> 39:39.120
whatever they speak and bridge it to HomeKit. But this, you connect the HomeKit on the iOS

39:39.680 --> 39:45.360
to Home Assistant and Home Assistant actually speaks native HomeKit now. And it means every

39:45.360 --> 39:50.640
device is in here and I can use voice prompts on HomePods, on the phone, but also in Control

39:50.640 --> 39:58.160
Center in the Home app. And it also means if you have a family iOS setup, so like my wife and kids

39:58.160 --> 40:02.960
were all family in iOS, they also get access to devices through the Home app. I don't even

40:02.960 --> 40:06.880
have to give them the Home Assistant app. And it works remotely because we have a HomePod.

40:08.080 --> 40:12.960
And it's very special and there's nothing quite close to that integration on Android without

40:12.960 --> 40:19.840
going all in on Google Assistant. And additionally, what I love about it is the Home Assistant app

40:19.840 --> 40:26.800
for iOS is a particularly great piece of software. And the developer who makes the iOS Home Assistant

40:26.800 --> 40:33.440
app deserves a few beers, just for me personally, because it is such a great app. And they've

40:33.440 --> 40:39.680
recently added focus mode support as a sensor to Home Assistant. So I want you to think about what

40:39.680 --> 40:45.840
that means for a second. I have an NFC tag on my mixer. I sit down, I set my phone on this tag,

40:45.840 --> 40:51.680
it goes into recording focus mode. Now Home Assistant knows I'm in recording mode. So lights

40:51.680 --> 40:57.440
change. I can do all kinds of automations based around that. And it all happens without me having

40:57.440 --> 41:03.520
to do hardly anything. And last part, and then I'm totally done, because all of the devices show up

41:03.520 --> 41:11.520
in HomeKit, I can actually just use the built-in shortcut app on iOS. So if I never wanted to write

41:11.520 --> 41:15.440
a Home Assistant automation because I felt it was too complicated or whatever, I could do all

41:15.440 --> 41:20.560
my automations with shortcuts on iOS and on the Mac, and just have it talk to the devices like

41:20.560 --> 41:25.600
HomeKit devices. And you could just do that. And it's fantastic. And it's something that I think

41:25.600 --> 41:30.320
is five notches above anything you can do on Android with Home Assistant. And I think it's

41:30.320 --> 41:34.560
fantastic. But other than that, I agree there's nice things about both platforms. But I just think

41:34.560 --> 41:39.440
that's an area where iOS perhaps has a leg up for us Home Assistant users.

41:40.240 --> 41:45.280
Yeah, and this rant, it wasn't too much of a rant, I don't think. But this segment for me

41:45.280 --> 41:51.520
isn't necessarily a, I think iOS stinks and Android is better. I just think in general,

41:51.520 --> 41:58.800
they've both got significant issues that I don't know what the next few years holds in the mobile

41:58.800 --> 42:05.920
OS space. There's room for a third player, honestly, to come along and disrupt, I think.

42:07.440 --> 42:13.520
But I'm tempted by an iPhone, I must admit. Those cameras in particular, the camera on the

42:13.520 --> 42:19.440
Pixel 6 is good. But it's not earth shatteringly good. Everybody else has caught up to what Google

42:19.440 --> 42:26.720
are doing. Their de-blurring of face feature is just marketing. Their erase thing that they love

42:26.720 --> 42:32.240
to tout on the adverts is just that, it's just marketing as well. So I mean, it's a perfectly

42:32.240 --> 42:40.560
fine device, but it's $700. And my 7T is just about as good, to be honest. So I think I'm

42:40.560 --> 42:47.840
going to stick with that. Backblaze.com slash SSH. Get peace of mind knowing your files are backed

on your PC backed up to the cloud and restored anywhere you want. I mean, you could just directly

43:12.560 --> 43:17.680
download them back to your machine or restore them via the app. Or if it's a lot of data,

43:18.320 --> 43:23.520
heaven forbid, you need to restore like a lot of data. Backblaze will work with you to restore by

43:23.520 --> 43:30.480
mail as well. It's a neat system. And you know, the nice thing about the mobile apps is that even

43:30.480 --> 43:34.400
when you're out on the go, if you really need to get something, you don't have to expose your

43:34.400 --> 43:39.520
network to remote access or something like that. You can log into that Backblaze app and grab the

43:39.520 --> 43:46.240

idea to create a business that was fair and good for its customers, its partners, its employees,

44:17.840 --> 44:22.880
and of course your data, and now the greater community. And I love how they've contributed

44:22.880 --> 44:27.600
over the years with not only their Drive reports, which we've cited on the air lots of times,

44:27.600 --> 44:35.360
they've got their storage pods, over 500,000 customers in 175 countries. It's Backblaze.

44:35.920 --> 44:40.400

for unlimited backup for your Mac and your PC. Backblaze.com slash SSH.

44:47.840 --> 44:52.800
Now if you have any thoughts on whether Chris and I should talk a little bit more about the world of

44:52.800 --> 44:57.600
technology and the art of smart... No, wait, that's the wrong show. We should talk about this stuff a

44:57.600 --> 45:02.320
bit more. Do let us know at self-hosted.show slash contacts. And we'd love to hear from you.

45:02.960 --> 45:07.360
Speaking of which we have a bit of feedback about Home Assistant.

45:08.080 --> 45:12.720
Yeah. Listener Chris writes and he says, hello, Chris and the Badger. Home Assistant hit a

45:12.720 --> 45:19.360
milestone recently with 100,000 users participating in their analytics. This is a great way for users

45:19.360 --> 45:24.080
to contribute to the project and help shape the development. And the best part is it's an

45:24.080 --> 45:29.920
opt-in implementation. The downside to an opt-in is that it can get overlooked by some users who

45:29.920 --> 45:35.120
maybe wouldn't mind contributing. So I thought maybe a shout out to this feature and its location

45:35.120 --> 45:39.360
in the UI would be an excellent way for the self-hosted community to give back to an incredible

45:39.360 --> 45:45.120
project. Thanks for all you do and happy hosting. If you go into Home Assistant, and this can just

45:45.120 --> 45:49.840
be Home Assistant Core, and you go into configuration, and then in the configuration

45:49.840 --> 45:55.360
screen you go to general, and then in general at the bottom of that there's an analytics section.

45:56.160 --> 46:03.360
And I have opted on my systems to check all those boxes and hit save. I trust the Nebuchadnezzar

46:03.360 --> 46:07.680
guys. I also pay for the service and I want them to know that I'm running this thing on a Pi and

46:07.680 --> 46:12.560
I'm running on an x86 box and I'm not always using their OS. I actually want it to represent

46:12.560 --> 46:18.000
my usage and I feel like that's the best way for me to do it. Brandon writes in with some feedback

46:18.000 --> 46:23.360
about Frigate from a couple of episodes ago. Hey guys, I just listened to episode 56. I really

46:23.360 --> 46:28.000
enjoyed the show. I've been using Frigate for a while now and I think it's pretty great. I have

46:28.000 --> 46:36.400
not upgraded to 0.9 yet. I'm still on the version of 0.8. I'm contacting you guys because one thing

46:36.400 --> 46:41.520
Frigate is very good for is improving a camera system that you might already have. As Chris

46:41.520 --> 46:48.640
mentioned, Frigate just needs an RTSP feed and I had a Lorex Dahua, I hope I said that right,

46:48.640 --> 46:54.400
camera system set up on my network with a standalone NVR. Frigate's integration with

46:54.400 --> 46:58.560
Home Assistant is pretty great. I've got a Wyze camera in the basement which detects if the kids

46:58.560 --> 47:04.320
are playing down there. If they leave and don't turn the lights off, brackets, they never do,

47:04.320 --> 47:08.240
then it will turn the lights off after 10 minutes of not recognizing any people.

47:08.240 --> 47:11.840
That's nice. When an object is detected,

47:11.840 --> 47:17.440
I get a snapshot and a notification through Home Assistant. One thing I'm curious about is updating

47:17.440 --> 47:22.160
the models in Frigate though. I'd love to have a custom model that could detect our two vehicles

47:22.160 --> 47:30.080
versus say a DoorDash delivery vehicle or a UPS truck. Wow, that's a great idea. Have you seen

47:30.080 --> 47:36.000
anything about that? I wonder if that's possible right now. Well, we might have something in this

47:36.000 --> 47:42.560
space. We're planning fairly soon a site reliability engineers only live stream with

47:42.560 --> 47:47.440
Chris and I to hang out with the supporters and patrons of the show. I've been doing some

47:48.640 --> 47:53.280
background sleuthing with the author of an app called Double Take. Essentially what this does

47:53.280 --> 47:59.920
is it's facial recognition for Home Assistant. It'll plug into DeepStack and Frigate and

47:59.920 --> 48:07.840
Double Take. It's all this kind of machine object detection learning type melange of stuff that all

48:07.840 --> 48:13.120
sort of kind of works together. I could see adding a vehicle detection model in one of these programs

48:13.120 --> 48:17.600
being quite viable and perhaps we'll pick the Double Take author's brain on that on that live

48:17.600 --> 48:22.720
stream. Interesting. I look forward to that. I could see like the next thing I might want

48:22.720 --> 48:30.960
is detecting Levi versus any other animal. Don't worry about Levi, but dog, not hot dog, right?

48:30.960 --> 48:37.520
Right. All right. This is probably our last one today. IA writes in with some network jargon

48:37.520 --> 48:43.600
questions. He says, I recently graduated and discovered this podcast a few days ago. So since

48:43.600 --> 48:48.880
I've been listening, I've heard the term doubly natted and the term punching a hole through a

48:48.880 --> 48:53.680
firewall on the podcast at least a couple of times. I think TeamViewer was cited as an example.

48:53.680 --> 48:58.880
I'm wondering if you could explain what this is in a bit of detail. I'd like to know about ways to

48:58.880 --> 49:04.000
overcome double net and the pros and cons of that. You mentioned wire guards and VPNs. Maybe they

49:04.000 --> 49:09.600
fit into this picture. Thanks. Well, Mr. Carrier Grade. Nat, why don't you stop by explaining that

49:09.600 --> 49:17.280
one? I thought you were giving me a hard time. Right. So what has just unfortunately become way

49:17.280 --> 49:23.120
more common than we'd like is a situation where you have somebody that runs a private network.

49:23.120 --> 49:28.320
So this is a private network is generally a way of saying a network that doesn't route outside

49:28.320 --> 49:33.040
itself. So if you're on that network, you're not, you're not routing, you're not publicly

49:33.040 --> 49:37.600
available. People can't find you on the internet. You're a private network. The most typical example

49:37.600 --> 49:43.040
of that would be say like an intranet at a school or even just your LAN at home. Right. Those are

49:43.040 --> 49:50.800
all private networks. Now imagine that private network set up a network for another set of

49:50.800 --> 49:57.360
machines and it was essentially networkception and it was also a private network. So you have

49:57.360 --> 50:01.200
a private network that is connected to a private network that is then connected to the public

50:01.200 --> 50:08.480
internet. And that in a really loose way is what double netted is, is you are behind two network

50:08.480 --> 50:13.280
address translated networks. You can actually set this up for yourself if you're curious to kind of

50:13.280 --> 50:20.320
play around with it, spin up open sense or PF sense in a VM behind your existing router. And that

50:20.320 --> 50:24.800
would create a network within a network, which is essentially what Chris is talking about here. So

50:24.800 --> 50:31.520
he has a wireless ISP that's got a mast up on a hill somewhere and that thing has a router behind

50:31.520 --> 50:38.320
it. So that router has a public facing IP address. Now, you know that there are only a certain number

50:38.320 --> 50:44.320
of IPv4 addresses available. They're expensive as a consequence, relatively speaking. And so what a

50:44.320 --> 50:51.760
lot of these wireless ISP guys do is to save a bit of money. They will just give you a private IP

50:51.760 --> 50:58.560
and essentially translate your local devices on your local network in Chris's RV, for example.

50:58.560 --> 51:02.560
They won't know, you know, everything he's got behind their little router that they've given him,

51:03.440 --> 51:08.320
but his router will have an IP address on their network, not the public internet.

51:08.320 --> 51:17.120
And because of this, software like VPNs or other types of software that want to, quote unquote,

51:17.120 --> 51:22.000
punch a hole through a firewall, they can't just open up a port on the firewall through something

51:22.000 --> 51:26.320
like universal plug and play and start receiving connections. Because even if they open up a

51:26.320 --> 51:31.280
port on that firewall, there's just a private network on the other side of that that can't

51:31.280 --> 51:37.680
talk to the internet. And so when you're double netted, you need something that is sort of like

51:37.680 --> 51:43.200
a proxy between whatever is on the private network and whatever is on the public network.

51:43.200 --> 51:47.440
And that's usually what you hear us talking about ways around double netting or something like that.

51:47.440 --> 51:52.960
And really what it just means is that if you want to host something on a double netted network,

51:52.960 --> 51:56.560
you're going to have to work to make it happen. And it's not going to be the most efficient way

51:56.560 --> 52:01.760
to do it. And they probably don't want you doing it because another place you'll often see this

52:01.760 --> 52:08.880
is on cell networks and mobile networks and some satellite internet. And so they probably don't

52:08.880 --> 52:12.480
want you hosting anything either. That's very common. And that's that's where something like

52:12.480 --> 52:17.360
our sponsor Linode could be useful. Yeah. And this is one of the reasons why I found

52:17.360 --> 52:25.280
tailscales so useful is they host a lighthouse, a third party kind of witness node somewhere that

52:25.280 --> 52:30.560
does all that nat traversal stuff for you. So then you end up with a peer to peer connection

52:30.560 --> 52:35.120
to the remote host. And I'm very pleased to say that I've been using tailscale now for what,

52:35.120 --> 52:41.360
a couple of months and doing all my backups to England on my Synology box over tailscale. And

52:41.360 --> 52:44.880
it's just working. I mean, I really like it too. Yeah.

52:44.880 --> 52:50.080
I think you cannot find it just works, you know, it is so simple to get up and get going

52:50.080 --> 52:56.080
and have a mesh network. The only thing about tailscale that I'm not a huge fan of is you are

52:56.080 --> 53:01.040
placing a lot of trust in them because they are doing the key exchange and managing all of that

53:01.040 --> 53:06.960
stuff for you. And if you want something like tailscale, but you want full control and you want

53:06.960 --> 53:11.600
to be completely, you know, a trustworthy setup. I still think Nebula is better in that regard.

53:11.600 --> 53:16.720
Like, especially in a server to server to server scenario, I might be more comfortable with Nebula,

53:16.720 --> 53:22.480
but if it's like phone workstation server, that might be where our or or workstation workstation

53:22.480 --> 53:26.640
workstation among friends. I'd probably go tailscale, but when it's server server server,

53:26.640 --> 53:30.240
I might be more inclined to go Nebula just because you have complete control.

53:30.240 --> 53:36.800
It is also exceedingly good at punching through double nat and you have complete control over

53:36.800 --> 53:42.640
the keys in that scenario. You know what? I'd equate that to tailscale is a bit like plex.

53:42.640 --> 53:48.080
Like, I'm not totally 100% on board with what they're doing, but it's very slick.

53:48.800 --> 53:55.360
And Nebula is kind of like Cody. No, jelly. You know what? I didn't say it during during the

53:56.160 --> 54:03.760
compute module review, or at least first look. But jellyfin in a way is be is a lot more appealing

54:03.760 --> 54:08.640
now because, you know, plex is added a lot of stuff and jellyfin remains kind of lean and mean.

54:08.640 --> 54:14.480
And it it has a pretty good metadata manager and it will write the information to the folders

54:14.480 --> 54:19.920
and NFO files and it'll go through and scan for chapter images. You can get chapters for all your

54:19.920 --> 54:25.840
all your stuff. That's fine. That's fine. How are the clients? Yeah, you're right. That's that's

54:25.840 --> 54:30.080
the problem. You see what I mean? Like tailscale has that figured out. They have all the clients

54:30.080 --> 54:36.080
for iOS, for Android, for everything. Whereas Nebula, you're on your own. That's kind of what

54:36.080 --> 54:41.360
I mean. Yeah, it is. It is a similar, I think. And I think there is a place for both of them.

54:41.360 --> 54:46.320
But when you want simplicity and ease of use, tailscale wins. You're right. It is that. Yeah,

54:46.320 --> 54:50.720
they should. They should totally sponsor. If anybody at tailscale is listening, hook us up

54:50.720 --> 54:54.720
with like a deal and we'll start getting people signed up. Well, we're all pretty happy users.

54:54.720 --> 55:02.000
You know, we like some of them. We started asking them to sponsor us. And by that point, we've

55:02.000 --> 55:09.120
already given away the milk. We'd love to hear your feedback, your ideas, your projects you're

55:09.120 --> 55:13.760
working on, things you're using a compute module for. Let me know. Let us all know.

55:13.760 --> 55:20.000
Self host dot show slash contact. And also find our sponsor, a cloud guru on social media.

55:20.000 --> 55:24.800
They're just slash a cloud guru at anything that's like a social media platform, you know,

55:24.800 --> 55:28.960
like the YouTube, the Facebook, the Twitter slash a cloud guru. Now you heard me mention

55:28.960 --> 55:33.440
it a little bit earlier in the show, but for our site reliability engineers at self hosted dot show

55:33.440 --> 55:40.240
slash SRE, we're going to be doing a secret super special live stream over the next few weeks for

55:40.240 --> 55:44.640
Chris and I. We're going to hang out with you guys and we'll just have like a video call where we

55:44.640 --> 55:49.760
can all talk. But we have a few special guests on the on the show as well at that point. It'd be

55:49.760 --> 55:55.200
basically like a pseudo episode, I guess, except you're part of it, like a hypervised episode.

55:55.200 --> 55:59.680
It's not like it's not or a pair of virtualized episode. That's what it is. I just wanted to say

55:59.680 --> 56:04.400
to I also I bought a new microphone for it. I'm going to do it up for my office, I think. And so

56:04.400 --> 56:09.280
I needed a microphone in my office. I'll be trying out a brand new microphone for these for this for

56:09.280 --> 56:15.120
this for this whole live stream stuff. Self host dot show slash SRE. And don't forget, you also get

56:15.120 --> 56:20.560
the post show every episode. So, you know, by now, so posted dot show slash contact is the place to

56:20.560 --> 56:25.440
go to get in touch with us. You can find me on Twitter at ironic badger. I'm over there at Chris

56:25.440 --> 56:30.720
Elias and the show is at self hosted show. Don't forget the network at Jupiter signal. And thanks

56:30.720 --> 57:00.720
for listening, everyone. That was self hosted dot show slash 58.
