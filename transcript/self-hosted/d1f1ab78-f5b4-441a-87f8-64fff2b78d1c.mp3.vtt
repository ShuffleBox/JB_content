00:00.000 --> 00:01.000
Hello.

00:01.000 --> 00:02.000
Hello.

00:02.000 --> 00:03.000
Is this thing on?

00:03.000 --> 00:04.000
Hey, Alex.

00:04.000 --> 00:05.000
What's going on?

00:05.000 --> 00:06.000
Hey.

00:06.000 --> 00:07.000
Good to hear from you, Chris.

00:07.000 --> 00:08.000
Hey, Alex.

00:08.000 --> 00:09.000
Hi.

00:09.000 --> 00:10.000
Hi.

00:10.000 --> 00:11.000
Good to hear from you.

00:11.000 --> 00:12.000
Right.

00:12.000 --> 00:15.000
So I've been meaning to bother you about this for a while.

00:15.000 --> 00:16.000
Uh-oh.

00:16.000 --> 00:17.000
I have an idea.

00:17.000 --> 00:18.000
Okay.

00:18.000 --> 00:19.000
Do you want to hear it?

00:19.000 --> 00:20.000
Of course.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.000
Well, you do podcasts.

00:21.000 --> 00:23.520
Yeah, that's what I've been told.

00:23.520 --> 00:27.040
That's allegedly what happens.

00:27.040 --> 00:30.120
We've both been doing a lot of self-hosting lately.

00:30.120 --> 00:31.120
I love it.

00:31.120 --> 00:32.120
I'm all about it these days.

00:32.120 --> 00:33.120
Self-host all the things.

00:33.120 --> 00:34.120
Mm-hmm.

00:34.120 --> 00:35.120
Yeah?

00:35.120 --> 00:36.120
Well, that's the show.

00:36.120 --> 00:37.120
Right there.

00:37.120 --> 00:38.120
That's the idea.

00:38.120 --> 00:39.120
What do you think?

00:39.120 --> 00:40.120
Well, I'm not anti-cloud.

00:40.120 --> 00:41.120
That's my only problem.

00:41.120 --> 00:42.120
I'm not like an anti-cloud guy.

00:42.120 --> 00:43.120
Well, nor am I.

00:43.120 --> 00:44.120
Oh.

00:44.120 --> 00:45.120
Okay.

00:45.120 --> 00:50.840
So I don't want to buy a piece of hardware, a thermostat maybe, a security camera, smart

00:50.840 --> 00:55.840
plug in my case, that two, three years later, maybe even six months, the manufacturer goes,

00:55.840 --> 00:57.400
that's not the business model here.

00:57.400 --> 00:58.400
Right.

00:58.400 --> 00:59.400
And then it's just a shiny paperweight.

00:59.400 --> 01:00.400
No.

01:00.400 --> 01:03.320
I mean, that's literally just happened to me.

01:03.320 --> 01:04.320
Yes.

01:04.320 --> 01:05.320
There's no...

01:05.320 --> 01:06.680
Never again, I say, Alex.

01:06.680 --> 01:07.680
Never again.

01:07.680 --> 01:12.560
And I want to give people a way to find out how to do a lot of this stuff, like a discovery

01:12.560 --> 01:14.080
portal, if you like.

01:14.080 --> 01:18.400
You know, say, I want to build a home server.

01:18.400 --> 01:19.400
Where do you start?

01:19.400 --> 01:20.400
There is so much information.

01:20.400 --> 01:23.400
It's a lot to consider.

01:23.400 --> 01:27.240
Google is overrun with keywords and SEO optimizations.

01:27.240 --> 01:28.240
No kidding.

01:28.240 --> 01:29.240
No kidding.

01:29.240 --> 01:32.480
And so you and I, between us, I think can cut through a lot of the chaff and...

01:32.480 --> 01:35.160
A few hard learned lessons over the years.

01:35.160 --> 01:36.160
A few.

01:36.160 --> 01:37.160
Yes.

01:37.160 --> 01:38.160
Yes.

01:38.160 --> 01:39.160
Yeah.

01:39.160 --> 01:40.160
Yeah, we could definitely cut.

01:40.160 --> 01:41.160
I like this idea.

01:41.160 --> 01:42.160
I like it a lot.

01:42.160 --> 01:44.440
In fact, it's an area that I also want to kind of continue to push and explore myself.

01:44.440 --> 01:48.120
So I could use a little help, a little guidance.

01:48.120 --> 01:51.680
And what about if we included some guests along the way?

01:51.680 --> 01:52.680
Maybe people who...

01:52.680 --> 01:53.680
Working on stuff?

01:53.680 --> 01:54.680
Yeah.

01:54.680 --> 01:55.680
All right.

01:55.680 --> 01:56.680
Now you're getting me excited.

01:56.680 --> 01:57.680
On the crew.

01:57.680 --> 01:58.680
Crew too?

01:58.680 --> 01:59.680
Yeah.

01:59.680 --> 02:00.680
JB crew, listeners.

02:00.680 --> 02:01.680
That's true.

02:01.680 --> 02:02.680
They're always building stuff.

02:02.680 --> 02:03.680
Get viewer audience questions.

02:03.680 --> 02:05.040
I think we should get a few developers on the horn to talk to them about what they're

02:05.040 --> 02:06.040
doing.

02:06.040 --> 02:07.040
Yeah.

02:07.040 --> 02:08.040
That's a good idea.

02:08.040 --> 02:09.040
All right.

02:09.040 --> 02:10.040
I'm all in on this idea now.

02:10.040 --> 02:11.040
Okay.

02:11.040 --> 02:23.160
Thank you guys so much for watching, and I'll see you guys next time.

02:23.160 --> 02:24.160
Bye.

02:24.160 --> 02:25.160
Bye.
