00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
Hello fellow self-hosters, Alex here.

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,800
We've got a super exciting episode up our sleeves today.

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,160
This is one I've been waiting to share with you

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:08,720
for a little while.

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,940
It's a prerecorded interview with Elan,

6
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:14,120
the CTO and co-founder of Plex.

7
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,880
Chris and I got the chance to talk with Elan

8
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:20,240
during the JB Sprint in August from his Hawaii home base.

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,180
We cover lots of ground in this interview with him

10
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:25,040
on topics ranging from electric cars

11
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,440
to the motivations behind starting Plex in the first place

12
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,980
and where the project is heading in the future.

13
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:32,800
Be sure to stick around though,

14
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,320
as we have some exciting news

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,200
about the ghost blogging platforms

16
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,800
new release to share as well.

17
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,120
So sit back, relax and enjoy our interview

18
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,060
with Elan Finegold from Plex.

19
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,560
You guys know this, Alex and I are both big Plex users

20
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,440
and I challenged Alex before the show started

21
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,260
to attempt an elevator pitch explanation of what Plex is.

22
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:57,560
Okay, here we go.

23
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:01,560
Plex organizes audio and visual media

24
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,080
from your personal media libraries

25
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:06,760
and allows you to stream it to any playback device.

26
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,520
And for me, Plex has been a huge gateway drug.

27
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,440
I had a Synology NAS back in the day

28
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,640
and now I have a huge server in my basement

29
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,840
with 100 plus terabytes that has 20 cores

30
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,920
and hundreds of gigabytes of RAM.

31
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:24,640
And I honestly owe an awful lot of that stuff to Plex.

32
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,360
One of the other cool things that Plex does

33
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,960
is that it does on the fly media transcoding.

34
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,840
And why that's important

35
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:36,720
is lots of different media devices support different codecs.

36
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,520
You know, a web browser might not be able to support

37
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,460
the same codecs as an iPhone, for example,

38
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,720
or an Android TV box.

39
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,880
And the single most magical feature of Plex

40
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,900
is that if I press play on a device,

41
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,240
there's no configuration required.

42
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,080
It will just start playing my media as if by magic

43
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,000
and transcode it from whatever source using FFmpeg

44
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,080
to whatever target device.

45
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,000
It just works and it's wonderful.

46
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,840
That was pretty good.

47
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,680
What'd you think, Elon?

48
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,520
I'm impressed.

49
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,320
Are you looking for a position as our PR spokesperson?

50
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,160
I love your accent.

51
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,320
I love the way you could describe that.

52
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,160
It's brilliant.

53
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,500
Well, I got out of a speeding ticket with this accent

54
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,800
a couple of weeks ago, so.

55
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,540
Now don't be sniping my co-host.

56
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,200
I just got this thing off the ground.

57
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,840
Damn it.

58
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,920
Well, thank you for being here.

59
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,160
We thought maybe we'd like to start

60
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,400
with a few personal questions.

61
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,480
Our crowd is a lot of a do-yourself hosted kind

62
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,280
of group, and they love to know what people's setups are.

63
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,680
And so we would like to ask, at what

64
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,200
you consider to be home base, roughly how many computers

65
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,840
would you say are in the home?

66
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,680
Yeah, sure.

67
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,640
I mean, I work personally off a Mac desktop.

68
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,040
Right now it's a Mac Mini.

69
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,920
I used to have the Trashcan Mac Pro,

70
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,000
but that just got super long in the tooth,

71
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
so I moved to one of the new Mac Minis.

72
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,920
And then my wife and I both have MacBooks,

73
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,640
because I really love the fact that they're

74
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,280
super light and portable, and I don't do a lot of coding

75
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,760
on that, mostly on the desktop with a bigger screen.

76
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,600
And then as far as the media box,

77
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:12,800
I have a 3U Norco box with a bunch of hard drives in it,

78
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,940
probably around 100 terabytes.

79
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:21,400
And that's running ZFS on top of Ubuntu,

80
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,000
which is sort of what most of us at Kleks

81
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,520
have gravitated towards.

82
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:29,280
We really like ZFS, or ZFS, if you will,

83
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,360
although there are several people that use UnRAID,

84
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,520
but I tend to use that ZFS.

85
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:39,600
And it was an older system, but I just upgraded recently.

86
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,480
I guess Facebook and a bunch of other companies

87
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,640
dumped a bunch of Xenons on them that they

88
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,720
were using in data centers.

89
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:52,200
So I picked up a couple of 8-core, 16-thread Xenons

90
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,240
for like $100 each.

91
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:57,960
So now it's got a total of 16 cores, 32 threads for $200,

92
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,400
which is kind of unbeatable.

93
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,000
Nice.

94
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,520
No kidding.

95
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,280
Now, I kind of got to know with all of that kind of storage

96
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,520
and stuff, have you invested in a pretty fast local network?

97
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,440
Well, yeah.

98
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:13,960
When we got the place, we wired it for Cat 6.

99
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:17,560
But sadly, there's Gigabit running

100
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,160
to all the important places.

101
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,600
And I experimented probably about a year ago

102
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,120
with trying to go 10 gig just between the Mac Mini, which,

103
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,200
as you know, it's ethernet ports for its 10 gig.

104
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,800
And so I added one of these cheap $100 cards

105
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,880
to the Linux system that also supported 10 gig.

106
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,520
And it kind of worked for a few days.

107
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,440
And I would transfer an MKB file back and forth and be like,

108
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,200
oh my god, 300 megabytes per second.

109
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:40,920
That's incredible.

110
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:44,640
And it just stopped working on the Linux side after a while.

111
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,640
And I would get like, wouldn't be able to connect.

112
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,560
And I'd have to reboot.

113
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,440
And I just was like, OK, fine.

114
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,360
I'd prefer stable 1 gig over unstable 10 gig.

115
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,320
Right, yeah.

116
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,960
I mean, you must have been around

117
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,960
in a time where even 1 gigabit would be just

118
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,480
a remarkable transfer rate.

119
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,480
Oh, yeah, incredible.

120
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,720
I mean, the thing that actually blows my mind nowadays

121
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,720
is that with a good Wi-Fi connection,

122
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,600
you can get up there in at least the hundreds

123
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,820
of megabits per second.

124
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,240
That is kind of mind blowing.

125
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,360
I don't think wired has actually really kept up

126
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,160
with the accelerating speed of wireless.

127
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,960
Thank goodness, because it probably makes Plex much more

128
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,040
of a real option for people in homes

129
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,720
that don't have physical wiring.

130
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,240
It is true.

131
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,240
I mean, honestly, I think a technology

132
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,960
that people don't give enough credit to is Powerline,

133
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,240
which is also something that's progressed super fast.

134
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,440
I had a thing in my living room that I wanted

135
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,400
to also speed up with wired.

136
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,360
And I used Powerline, and I was able to get about a gigabit,

137
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,560
I think, just over Powerline, which is, again, kind of crazy.

138
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,720
That used to be super flaky.

139
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,360
It used to 10 megabits, 5 megabits,

140
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,400
but that's gotten really good, too.

141
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,600
Speaking of power, I was doing a bit of research

142
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,280
before the interview.

143
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,960
How do you like your Tesla Model 3?

144
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,160
That's so impressive.

145
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,960
I'm like looking around for a spy cam now.

146
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,480
There was some post on Medium that I found.

147
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,320
Yeah, I love it.

148
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:13,680
It's, to me, it's like the future of cars.

149
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,760
And I know that's a term that is thrown around fairly lightly.

150
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,920
But I guess the feeling I have with it,

151
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:25,080
as it gets software updates and new features over the air,

152
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:29,520
is I feel like I'm living through the revolution

153
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,520
on the way to self-driving cars.

154
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,280
And I'm not as bullish.

155
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,160
The company is very bullish about full self-driving,

156
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,920
end of the year, except for regulations.

157
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:44,240
And historically, that's always been a lot harder.

158
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,000
But it's incredibly cool to sort of live through, in theory,

159
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,680
have the hardware and just need the software

160
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,000
and see the software take incremental steps.

161
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,920
Hey, all of a sudden, it recognizes stop signs.

162
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,720
Hey, all of a sudden, it knows how to stop at a stop sign.

163
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,800
As a nerd geek kind of a guy, that

164
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,240
is an incredibly unique experience in a car.

165
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,400
Usually, you get a car.

166
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,640
Nothing gets updated ever.

167
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,440
You sell it and get a new car.

168
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,240
Maybe you get an upgrade.

169
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,000
So it's really, it feels like a living piece of technology,

170
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,280
essentially.

171
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,480
Did you ever have an iPod back in the day?

172
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,680
I remember that Apple had a similar kind of,

173
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,800
we're used to devices that never see updates.

174
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,560
We never get new features.

175
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,720
And I remember having that same kind of journey of discovery

176
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,800
with my first iPod.

177
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,320
I unfortunately came to iPod late.

178
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,960
Instead, I had one of those creative Zune players,

179
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,960
which was just utter crap.

180
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,120
Oh, yeah.

181
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,400
No one had figured out back then that really all you

182
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,240
needed to do was a simple hierarchy of artist, album,

183
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:45,760
track.

184
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,720
No one had figured that out until Apple came along

185
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,680
with the iPod, and everyone was like, oh, yeah,

186
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,640
artist, album, track.

187
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:54,280
That makes total sense.

188
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,520
But yeah, I know Apple's always been really good about updates.

189
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,320
Talking of user interfaces and stuff,

190
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:03,160
the iPod revolutionized things with a click wheel.

191
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,960
I test drove a Model 3 a few weeks ago,

192
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,760
which is why when I saw it, I brought it up,

193
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,560
because I just wanted to get another person's input

194
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,240
into why I should buy one.

195
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,480
How are you finding the zero buttons thing?

196
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,120
You should definitely buy one.

197
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,520
So I counted, because before the Model 3, I had a leaf.

198
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,880
So I've been electric for a while.

199
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,480
I had two successive leaf leases,

200
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,880
say that a few times fast.

201
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:28,480
And I counted the number of buttons on my leaf,

202
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,280
and it was something ridiculous.

203
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,360
I'm not exaggerating here.

204
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,040
I think it was something like 60 or 70 buttons

205
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:37,360
in that front hemisphere compared to the Tesla, which

206
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,760
was like 10 or something like that.

207
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,040
But I have slightly mixed feelings.

208
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,040
For the most part, it works amazingly well.

209
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,120
And the control surfaces that they

210
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,800
do have with the D-pad things on your thumbs

211
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,880
work super well for various aspects.

212
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,800
But there are a couple of things,

213
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,960
like opening garage doors.

214
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:06,880
And if you have to make adjustments to things,

215
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,440
having to look at the screen and hit a tap target

216
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,000
while you're driving at 50 or 60 miles an hour

217
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,880
is unquestionably less safe than feeling

218
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,600
for a mechanical switch or knowing where it is.

219
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,960
So that's a bit.

220
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,760
But that's essentially just an aspect of, again,

221
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,880
the hardware is a little bit ahead of the software.

222
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,680
Eventually, we probably won't need the wheel.

223
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,560
And eventually, it'll be smart enough

224
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:35,160
that I don't have to change the wiper speed.

225
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,960
So the hope is that the software will eventually catch up

226
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,840
and just make it less and less likely for you

227
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,600
to have to touch anything.

228
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,160
Yeah, if you're not the one driving,

229
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,120
I guess it doesn't matter so much.

230
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,720
So anyway, let's shift gears a little bit

231
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,240
and get into some of the backstory behind Plex.

232
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,760
It's been around a little while now.

233
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,200
I forget what year it was founded.

234
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,720
Technically, I think we're coming up on the exact 10 year

235
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,040
anniversary of the incorporation.

236
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,640
But we were around for a bit before that,

237
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,400
before we were a real company.

238
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,360
Congratulations.

239
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,360
Yeah, thanks.

240
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,120
Thanks so much.

241
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,160
And I'm wondering, what motivated you to create Plex

242
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,160
in the first place?

243
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,680
I mean, essentially, the story is very simple.

244
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,200
My wife left me alone near Christmas.

245
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,480
I was bored.

246
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,200
And I just wanted to play around with something.

247
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,360
And I had never turned out well.

248
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,360
I'd been running the Xbox Media Center on a hacked Xbox.

249
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,240
And we were just at that cusp where you were starting

250
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:39,040
to see 720p HD video appear.

251
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,120
And the Xbox was clearly struggling at this.

252
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,680
And the Mac Mini was out.

253
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,720
And that just seemed like an incredibly great form factor

254
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:53,360
for a tenth of the size of one of those giant Xbox things

255
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,520
and super good horsepower.

256
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,440
So it just seemed like an obvious target.

257
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,400
And the XB1C team had already been working

258
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,760
on porting it to Linux.

259
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,800
And as you know, the underpinning Unix, same thing.

260
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,680
I was like, eh, how hard could this possibly be?

261
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,040
Let me give it a try.

262
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,240
Famous last words.

263
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,280
Yeah, it wasn't very easy.

264
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,440
But that's how it all started, essentially.

265
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,200
It was scratching an itch, which is probably

266
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,000
how most projects start.

267
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,720
Yeah.

268
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,600
Now, I guess the 10 year mark is kind of a good opportunity

269
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,960
to look back.

270
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,560
If you had a time machine, would you go back and slip

271
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,080
one bit of information to past self

272
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,120
to do something differently?

273
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,000
I mean, there's definitely things

274
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,920
we've done along the road that I would have done differently.

275
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:40,680
But I don't know if I can summarize it

276
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,680
down to a single thing.

277
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,000
Maybe like don't DDOS yourself as much.

278
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,120
Do you mean your servers or yourself personally?

279
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,760
Like our servers DDOSing our services.

280
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,600
Because when you have millions of machines out there,

281
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,760
and you're like, OK, let's flip on this new thing,

282
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,840
and they all start using it, you can melt yourself down.

283
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:04,480
But no, I think there's definitely lots of lessons

284
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,360
learned along the way.

285
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,960
And one thing that has always been super important to me,

286
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,960
as well as I know my co-founder and a lot of the other people

287
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:16,560
at Plex, is we really do try to stay

288
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,960
in contact with the community.

289
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,160
Like I've just been in the forums replying to posts.

290
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,640
I love that contact with users.

291
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,280
And I think that having that contact,

292
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,680
keeping that surface area, the surface contact

293
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,520
area between yourself and your user base

294
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,720
helps you on the right track.

295
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,480
They will tell you very vocally when

296
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,800
you're doing something wrong.

297
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,120
And again, you might not always agree,

298
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,580
and you might agree to disagree, or you

299
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,080
might take a slightly different turn,

300
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:46,320
or it's a quote, what I think is actually not a Steve Jobs

301
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,600
quote, like you might give your customers what they want,

302
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,840
not what they ask for.

303
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:53,720
But in general, I think you ignore your customers,

304
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:57,240
and you lose that surface contact area

305
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,120
with your customers at your own risk.

306
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,880
That's, I think, one of the biggest lessons.

307
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,680
It's a tight line, because there's also the enthusiast

308
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,560
trap, where you get stuck always trying

309
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,580
to serve your most vocal, most die-hard fans,

310
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,120
and it's harder to appeal to a wider audience.

311
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,120
That is entirely true.

312
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:18,280
And I note that I've watched Plex over the years expand

313
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,440
into new integrations with podcasts

314
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,720
and other online services.

315
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:25,620
Have you seen pushback from the original die-hard Plex

316
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:28,120
community on those new services?

317
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,240
How's that been?

318
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,240
Absolutely.

319
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,040
Yeah, absolutely.

320
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,880
I mean, I think we used a joke, like if you'd

321
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,120
release an iOS update, the Android people would get angry.

322
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,720
If you'd release an Android update,

323
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,000
the iOS people would get angry.

324
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,240
So I think Plex, one of the metaphors

325
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,840
that we use internally to describe it

326
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,520
is it's essentially a fractal, right?

327
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:50,320
You can zoom in and maybe you're interested in Plex for music,

328
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,600
so you're very zoomed into that part of our platform.

329
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,240
Maybe you use Plex for movies, and you're

330
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,440
very zoomed into that.

331
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:00,640
And in a sense, you're protective of the area

332
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:04,040
that you are the most interested in, most vested in.

333
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:07,220
And of course, that goes for what app you use,

334
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,960
what streaming device you use or don't use.

335
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:14,200
And I think there is also just a sense of cheese being moved.

336
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,000
People are used to things a certain way.

337
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,920
Our intent with podcasts, for example,

338
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,280
was to give people the opportunity

339
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:25,200
to consume this content alongside their other content

340
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,880
and maybe even relate it in a way so that, hey,

341
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:31,720
if you have Bob Dylan in your library

342
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:35,040
and you have Plex everywhere, why shouldn't we say,

343
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,600
hey, there's a really good podcast

344
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,120
where they're interviewing Bob Dylan.

345
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,880
So if you like Bob Dylan, you have Bob Dylan in your library,

346
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,960
maybe you want to check out this podcast.

347
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,000
And we thought that would be super cool,

348
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,040
and people would like that sort of integration.

349
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:54,240
We haven't gotten along to that specifically yet,

350
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,280
but that's along the lines of where we're thinking.

351
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,400
You can see it with title.

352
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,240
There's been also pushback against title.

353
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,280
Some people don't like it.

354
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:04,280
But I think the people that have music libraries that

355
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:07,600
want to expand their musical horizons, to me,

356
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,600
and I count myself in that, to me,

357
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,820
I think the title integration is awesome.

358
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:18,400
I have purchased more new music in the last year

359
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,920
than I have in the previous five years

360
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,040
because it's such a cool way to discover new music.

361
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:27,240
I mean, I know there's some detail here,

362
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,840
but we show you new album releases from artists

363
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,960
that are in your library.

364
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:35,880
And we let you play radios where we introduce new stuff

365
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,200
that you haven't heard from title.

366
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,080
So there's all these kind of cool little integration

367
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:40,640
features.

368
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,100
So I think if you kind of zoom out and you're like,

369
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,400
why flex during title, it might seem kind of weird.

370
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,080
But if you are actually invested into the music ecosystem

371
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,640
and you're a music lover, I think

372
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,880
you'll find there's no other solution that

373
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,160
melds the two so seamlessly.

374
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,440
I like seeing it as a podcaster.

375
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,160
I like seeing those podcasts in there.

376
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,720
And I noticed recently that they seem

377
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,660
to be matching more to what my movie library has.

378
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,520
And I think that's a pretty clever strategy too.

379
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:07,680
So I say, as a podcaster, keep it up.

380
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,360
But it's a bit self-serving.

381
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,040
Yeah, no, I mean, it's a big, it's

382
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,720
a giant web of media, right?

383
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,880
These things are very interrelated.

384
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,480
There's podcasts that relate to movies.

385
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,240
There's podcasts that relate to TV shows.

386
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,760
There's all sorts of relationships

387
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,480
between different types of media.

388
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,200
And it's nice to have fresh content without me having

389
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,760
to do the work sometimes.

390
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,440
Exactly.

391
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,400
And that's honestly, that's one of the other things

392
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,840
that we like about it is the barrier to entry to flex

393
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,960
historically has been, hey, go get a server.

394
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:43,320
Hey, go rip a bunch of CDs or DVDs or whatever.

395
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,120
That's hard, right?

396
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:44,720
You need a computer.

397
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,400
That's always on.

398
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,120
It's clearly not for everyone.

399
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,000
But with a podcast, you don't need a server.

400
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,320
So that makes it, hopefully, lowers the barrier to entry.

401
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,600
So that's also a good thing.

402
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,120
So I wanted to take a minute to just walk back a little bit.

403
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:07,600
The feedback from the users, I think sometimes the subreddit

404
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,480
in particular can be a little bit toxic.

405
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,840
I noticed one of your posts earlier had, yeah,

406
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,880
I've turned off notifications for obvious reasons.

407
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,480
I can only imagine how many times you get tagged a day.

408
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,880
Just on Reddit.

409
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,240
But there was one piece of feedback

410
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,280
one of the users put, which I just

411
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,800
wanted to get your response to really,

412
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,280
which is most annoying to me is the fact

413
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:34,640
that many bugs have gotten worse or have been unacknowledged.

414
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,200
Yet Plex does nothing but introduce new features

415
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,080
that I think the majority of users don't care about.

416
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,120
I would rather no new features and a stable app instead

417
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:47,360
of this feature waterfall.

418
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,720
That seems pretty harsh to me, having been a diehard Plex user

419
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,360
myself for at least, I don't know,

420
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,960
must be five plus years at this point.

421
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,640
I've seen a few bugs and a few issues.

422
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,120
But honestly, I don't see anything

423
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,120
that makes me feel as strongly as this guy does.

424
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:05,080
I just wanted to get your take on that kind of we

425
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,720
would rather a stable app than no new features.

426
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,880
I mean, I think generally building products,

427
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,560
building software specifically, there's

428
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,040
always a trade off between new features and bugs.

429
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,640
Software is never bug free.

430
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,000
There's always going to be bugs.

431
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,760
And marketing and there's always a push for new features.

432
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,920
So there's always going to be a trade off there.

433
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:28,840
But I think the trade off that we make,

434
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,840
it's not like all of our engineers

435
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,960
are working on new features.

436
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,400
It's not like all of our engineers

437
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,200
are working on fixing bugs.

438
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:40,480
There's always a ratio of some doing new work,

439
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,200
some doing bug work.

440
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:50,400
So it's tricky because there are certainly

441
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,360
bugs that have gone unaddressed for longer

442
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,360
than I would personally like.

443
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:59,200
There are definitely times when I wish

444
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,320
we were faster at fixing bugs.

445
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,920
But it's always the trade off.

446
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:10,440
And we definitely do try to address bugs.

447
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:14,240
I think one of the things that the user is referencing

448
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,560
and one of the things I've seen mentioned elsewhere

449
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:19,760
is they would love it if we at least acknowledged bugs.

450
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,760
And that's something that, again, we've

451
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,880
tried to be better at.

452
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,400
We try to respond in the forums.

453
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,400
I've encouraged our engineers to spend more time in there

454
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:31,120
and our support staff to say, hey, we're working on this.

455
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,240
Yep, known issue.

456
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,760
Yep, we're working on it.

457
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,200
But we're sort of outnumbered.

458
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:40,480
And there is clearly times when we don't.

459
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,920
We aren't able to acknowledge every single thing.

460
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:46,120
And there's a lot of balls in the air.

461
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:49,200
Well, as a user, I must say I've noticed over the last nine

462
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,200
months or so that things have gotten significantly better

463
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,840
on the messaging front.

464
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,760
The stability of the apps appears

465
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,160
to have improved quite a bit.

466
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,240
And the only thing that I've noticed

467
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,040
that's changed quite a lot has been the UI.

468
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,840
There's been quite a few different revisions

469
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,760
of the UI this year.

470
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,240
And I wondered, given you just rolled out a new version

471
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,680
a couple of weeks ago, is this the final revision

472
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,680
we're going to see for a while?

473
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,320
Yeah, I mean, that's a perfect example,

474
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:18,720
I think, of the feedback loop and listening to users

475
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,040
because we were heading down.

476
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,400
I think time flies when you're having fun.

477
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:27,480
But last year, we were heading a particular direction

478
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:32,520
with the UI, and we got feedback on it.

479
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,480
And it really kind of missed the mark

480
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,400
for what we were intending.

481
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,280
And so we went back to the drawing board.

482
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:44,440
And that's when we came up with the Uno, the UI

483
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,800
that we've termed called Uno.

484
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:51,320
And the response to that has been overwhelmingly positive.

485
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,720
And so what you've seen over the last few months

486
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:59,160
is essentially just a coalescing of all of our interfaces

487
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,200
to go in that direction because it seems to be one

488
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,000
that our users like and appreciate

489
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,320
the customizability of the home screen

490
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,720
and all that kind of stuff.

491
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,080
So essentially, what you're seeing

492
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,760
is just us converging on this.

493
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:14,520
We feel that this UI will last us for a while.

494
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,840
It's fairly scalable.

495
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,560
It works in multiple different scenarios,

496
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,320
from all I want to see on my home screen

497
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,600
is podcast and title to, hey, I have libraries

498
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,160
from five different servers I want to have on my home screen

499
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,120
and treat just as importantly.

500
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,560
I think it's the best UI I've ever

501
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,000
seen rolled out from the project.

502
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,720
And I can only imagine the incredible constraints

503
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,720
that there must be in designing for all

504
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:40,320
of the different types of set-top TV appliance

505
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:44,160
boxes from Apple TV down to the sticks of all different kinds

506
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,080
and random Android devices.

507
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,720
It must be a pretty large part of the business.

508
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,000
Yeah, and definitely.

509
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,400
I mean, as the tech guy, I really

510
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,000
like it when we can reuse code as much as possible

511
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,440
all over the place.

512
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,640
But you're absolutely right.

513
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,880
I mean, there's a wide variety of platforms that we hit.

514
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,960
The Shield is a very powerful Android platform.

515
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,120
There are way less powerful Android platforms.

516
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:14,240
There's the smart TVs that have very,

517
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,040
we call them potato devices sometimes,

518
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:19,320
just because they're not super fast.

519
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,000
That's pretty good.

520
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Do you mind if I borrow that?

521
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,800
That's a good call.

522
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,400
No, and in fact, just as I said it,

523
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,800
I'm like, I wonder why potato?

524
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,840
Spud gun?

525
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,360
Potato?

526
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,360
I guess potatoes are slow, but no vegetables move.

527
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,520
So I don't know why we're singling out a potato.

528
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,160
There's always that science experiment

529
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,760
from elementary school where somebody powers

530
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:42,160
something with a potato, so it's just enough power.

531
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:42,720
Thank you.

532
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,280
That makes perfect sense now.

533
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,960
Yeah, that's MacGyver.

534
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,040
Yeah, exactly.

535
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,600
Yeah.

536
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,880
Well, I mean, I can only imagine the constraints just

537
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:53,080
in shipping that software to on time to end users.

538
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,960
We're having to go through different vendors

539
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,400
and different app stores, and all of that

540
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,640
must be massively complex.

541
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,440
Yeah.

542
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,800
It's very hard.

543
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,960
Yeah, I mean, there's definitely not

544
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,360
an insignificant fraction of time

545
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:09,600
spent on the packaging and different release formats

546
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,000
and processes and all of that, for sure.

547
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I'm just still thinking about the 10-year mark.

548
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,800
It's pretty significant to be joining us right around then.

549
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:20,000
And I'd kind of like to know about some future plans.

550
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,640
There must be some stuff in the pipeline near term,

551
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,680
anything that you can share yet?

552
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:27,320
One of the things that's near and dear to my own heart

553
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:32,000
is the big upgrade of the music library.

554
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,680
As you may be aware of, we've been moving metadata sources,

555
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:40,640
and we've kind of revamped and upgraded the music

556
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,480
system and a bunch of our associated systems

557
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,960
in the cloud, and we think it's really awesome.

558
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,680
So we continue to make huge advances

559
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:55,280
in the personal media space for that media type,

560
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,760
and we're also looking to do some other cool stuff

561
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,160
with movies and TV shows that you're

562
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,240
going to see here shortly.

563
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:05,600
So I think there's kind of like the trinity of investments.

564
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:11,880
We definitely are working on making the personal media

565
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:15,120
features even more interesting.

566
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:22,200
And we're continuing to look to make the player space for us.

567
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,040
Like you kind of mentioned at the beginning,

568
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:28,000
you said very nicely about how you can play anything anywhere,

569
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,880
and that's kind of been our mantra for a while.

570
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,040
But we've been investing kind of behind the scenes,

571
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,620
and it might not be completely visible,

572
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:36,000
but in the actual player stacks of our platform.

573
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,840
So Android TV a couple of years ago

574
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,080
got the Exo player-based thing, which

575
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,720
is an FFmpeg-based player, and then on Apple TV and iOS,

576
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,400
we got the MPV-based player, which, again,

577
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,100
sounds like gobbledygook, which is probably

578
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,360
why it's sort of hidden.

579
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,320
But essentially, we've

580
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,200
No, our audience understands, and boy, do we appreciate it.

581
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:52,720
Yeah.

582
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,080
Awesome.

583
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,380
Well, I love your audience then.

584
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:57,320
Yeah, so that's been a key for us,

585
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,720
because we want the media to play well.

586
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,960
We want the media to play fast.

587
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,000
The more you can direct play, the more energy efficient

588
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,560
it is, the faster you can seek, the faster

589
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,320
playback time you have.

590
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,260
So we've really been investing heavily

591
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:14,280
in that core tech of player upgrades,

592
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,640
and we take it very seriously.

593
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,880
And so that's sort of another part,

594
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:26,080
because our platform playback is an incredibly huge part.

595
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,040
And then in the third part is kind

596
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:31,620
of where you've seen us play with podcasts and title

597
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,160
and stuff like that, which is we happen

598
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,840
to think that it's really cool to have access

599
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:39,080
to an even larger catalog of content, some of which

600
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,680
might not come from your own computer.

601
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,920
And we certainly don't want to force it on people.

602
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,800
People can turn it off if they don't want it.

603
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:50,840
But we think there's some really exciting opportunities

604
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:54,480
for remixing your own content, augmenting,

605
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,440
we call it internally.

606
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,240
Augmentation is kind of what the term we use.

607
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,560
And that's kind of what you're seeing with title.

608
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,100
And I'll just give another example.

609
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:08,200
If I go into Bob Dylan and I've got my title account set up,

610
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,920
if I have missing albums, if I'm missing any albums by Bob

611
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,480
Dylan, they'll show up right alongside the albums

612
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:17,280
that I own, one click to play them.

613
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,120
That's pretty cool.

614
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:24,920
So that's some of the innovation space we're playing in.

615
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,920
Yeah, that's really nice.

616
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:29,440
And it augments cloud services like Spotify

617
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,720
quite nicely to have something like that

618
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,160
available in high quality and everything.

619
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:37,560
I wanted to touch on the playback improvements

620
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,920
that you talked about.

621
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:42,240
This is a feature request from me, really.

622
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,840
I have a server that has about 10 or 12 people that

623
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,920
use it regularly.

624
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,920
And one thing I've noticed, I have gigabit upload here.

625
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:52,920
So I'm not constrained with my pipe going out.

626
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:59,280
I would love to be able to set an on-the-fly transcoding

627
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:02,240
preference, like prefer direct play over transcode

628
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,840
or something like that instead of the current default.

629
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:05,720
A server side?

630
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:09,720
Yeah, server side, yeah, like push it out to the clients.

631
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:13,000
I mean, I guess wouldn't that, I mean,

632
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:18,040
that would assume that your clients have the downstream

633
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:18,720
bandwidth, right?

634
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,560
Like there might be, let's say if someone

635
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,960
has a five megabit download, they're

636
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:27,000
not going to be able to direct play a 20 megabit.

637
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
That's true.

638
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,960
I would prefer to be able to push a direct play.

639
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,040
I take your point, though.

640
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:36,240
I mean, you're trying to aim at the lowest common denominator,

641
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,360
which is going to be probably the client's downlink

642
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,800
bandwidth or my upload bandwidth, which

643
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,520
I can control right now.

644
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,920
Or heaven forbid, somebody on mobile.

645
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,400
Yeah.

646
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,780
Yeah, I was going to say, like if someone's on an iPhone,

647
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:51,080
they probably don't have 20 megabits either.

648
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,760
I mean, what you've touched on there is some of the complexity

649
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,760
that we were trying to, or that we

650
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,960
have been trying to address with the streaming brain

651
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:04,280
project that we have, where the server is trying

652
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:07,240
to be very cognizant of all of those facts.

653
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,280
How much upload bandwidth do I have?

654
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,720
What's the bandwidth of file?

655
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:14,120
How loaded is the CPU right now?

656
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:16,700
How much bandwidth is the client?

657
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,500
How fast is the client able to transfer?

658
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,880
And sort of magically making adjustments.

659
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:26,920
So you'll see cases where if you have, let's say,

660
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:30,040
20 megabit upstream, you'll start with a transcode,

661
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,280
and you'll use up 15 megabits.

662
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:34,080
And then when a new client comes on,

663
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,160
literally they would only have five megabits left.

664
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,960
But what we do is we downshift so they can share more evenly

665
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:39,640
the bandwidth.

666
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:42,360
So there is a lot of magic going on behind the scenes

667
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,520
right now to try to make it automatic.

668
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:48,800
But that magic is essentially in the transcode,

669
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,800
because that's where you have the volume knob, essentially.

670
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,400
Direct play, there's no real volume knob on that.

671
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:58,320
I actually am very impressed by how intelligent

672
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,320
the entire back end is.

673
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,840
So this kind of collection of tools

674
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,800
is called the streaming brain, did you say?

675
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,240
Yeah, I'm not exactly sure why we decided to call it that.

676
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,640
But that just was kind of what we ended up

677
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,360
calling it internally, the streaming brain.

678
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:15,080
And amusing side note, when we'd have meetings around it,

679
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:18,480
there was one guy who, one of our project manager guys,

680
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,920
who loved to use emoji.

681
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,200
And he was trying to come up with emoji representation

682
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,000
of streaming brain.

683
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,480
And the best thing he could do is, while streaming,

684
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,000
he used the shower emoji.

685
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,240
And then brain, he used the robot.

686
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,120
So it was like robot in a shower.

687
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,960
And if you go to our online store,

688
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,600
I think we actually sell a t-shirt that's

689
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,720
a robot taking a shower.

690
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,400
Yeah, it's like the robot from, oh,

691
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,640
what was that old sci-fi movie with Hitchhiker's Guide?

692
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,000
No, no, the one with Leslie Nielsen in it.

693
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,240
Oh, it's a classic.

694
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,520
I can't believe I'm blanking on it.

695
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:54,520
It's in my Plex library, so I really should know.

696
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,720
Forbidden planet.

697
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,640
Yes.

698
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,160
Yes.

699
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,720
I'll put a link to the blog post that has a picture of it.

700
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,480
It's so good.

701
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,800
We'll have that in the show notes.

702
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,640
Yeah, that's our illustrator, Craig.

703
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:06,720
He is a brilliant, super talented guy.

704
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,440
And you'll see a lot of his work on our t-shirts.

705
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,480
That's awesome.

706
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,800
We always joke about pivoting to clothing.

707
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,280
You know, I'm saying, if it all looked like that,

708
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:20,080
that actually would be probably a lucrative side business,

709
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,640
a little Plex side hustle.

710
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,120
Move over, threadless.

711
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:23,620
Yeah.

712
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:26,000
Yeah.

713
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I thoroughly enjoyed that, and I hope

714
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,200
we get an opportunity to chat with him in the future

715
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,800
and just sort of check in on things.

716
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,880
But you did promise we'd talk about Ghost.

717
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,360
Ghost is a blogging platform that has exploded

718
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,240
over the last few years.

719
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:45,160
Last week, 4,286 new sites were made with Ghost.

720
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,400
And that's just last week.

721
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,960
And they have a brand new release.

722
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,280
I ain't afraid of no Ghost.

723
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,840
I can't believe you.

724
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,200
I suppose it had to be done.

725
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,840
It's one week away from Halloween.

726
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,560
You've got to embrace my new country.

727
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,120
That's right.

728
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,280
Good for you.

729
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,240
Yeah, OK, fair enough.

730
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,160
We are talking about Ghost near Halloween,

731
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,880
and somebody had to put it in there.

732
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,880
So you're a big fan, though.

733
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,320
I have daydreamed about using Ghost,

734
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:12,400
but never had enough reason to move off of WordPress,

735
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:16,040
another favorite of the open source community.

736
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:16,880
But you, you did.

737
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,000
You just have no WordPress for me.

738
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,720
Well, it was when Linux server was in the early days,

739
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,880
and I was doing a lot of blogging over there.

740
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:28,120
And it's just, I don't know, like, WordPress is fine,

741
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:31,280
but I always felt like it was an extremely big, heavyweight

742
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:34,840
application for what I wanted to achieve, which was just

743
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,720
write some text with a couple of images

744
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,480
and a couple of categories and tags and that kind of thing.

745
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,960
I don't need any of the CMS.

746
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,760
I don't need any of the e-commerce type stuff.

747
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,240
And Ghost fitted that bill really, really well.

748
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,280
It had a beautiful typography, because fonts do matter.

749
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:54,480
And the writer's interface, as well, is super clean.

750
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,920
So what do you consider notable about the new, what is it,

751
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,880
3.0 release they just announced?

752
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,920
There's a few things.

753
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:05,240
So firstly is they are looking to give creators

754
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:09,440
a way to receive money without relying

755
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,720
on a third party middleman like Patreon or something like that.

756
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,680
And what's particularly interesting about this

757
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,600
is it doesn't require the Ghost company

758
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,320
to remain in business either.

759
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:21,040
So there is a direct way for readers of a blog

760
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:25,440
to contribute to the writer of a blog, which is really nice.

761
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,160
The payments all go through Stripe.

762
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,040
So so long as Stripe stay in business,

763
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:32,240
then this mechanism will continue to work just fine.

764
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,040
There's another new feature in the release,

765
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,800
which changes the way in which the sites are generated.

766
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:40,000
And there's a lot more support now for static site generation

767
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,880
frameworks for things like Gatsby, Next.js, et cetera,

768
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,400
et cetera.

769
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:48,200
There's dozens of dozens of changes there around that stuff.

770
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,280
And if you want proof of the pudding,

771
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:55,240
the entire ghost.org website is actually a Gatsby.js app

772
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,240
hosted on top of Ghost.

773
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,640
The other change that I'm super excited about

774
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:02,800
is the way in which themes used to be developed.

775
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:06,960
So before this release, you had to upload themes as a zip file,

776
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:10,440
apply the change, and then pray that it worked.

777
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:13,160
Well, now with a combination of the JAMstack work

778
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,920
that they have, you can actually combine that with GitHub

779
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:19,000
Actions and then sync custom ghost themes

780
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,840
to your live production site with each commit

781
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:21,840
you make to Git.

782
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,880
All right, I might give that a go in the future.

783
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,120
You've tempted me, Alex.

784
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,840
And so if you do, it's really easy to get started

785
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,320
with a Docker compose file.

786
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:33,400
You can then couple that with an nginx image from the Linux

787
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:39,760
server, guys, and have a let's encrypt TLS HTTPS encrypted

788
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,440
website.

789
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,200
We'll put a link to a sample Docker compose and nginx

790
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,080
config file in the show notes for you.

791
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,560
Ah, you're a gentleman.

792
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:50,280
Well, just a quick project off-grid update for me.

793
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,320
I've ordered my cameras.

794
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,800
I'll reveal which cameras here in the near future.

795
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,320
And I can tell you and I are going

796
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,240
to need to have a storage chat soon.

797
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,440
We got to talk some storage.

798
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,320
I got to sort my storage out.

799
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:04,800
That sends shivers down my spine, Christopher.

800
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,640
I love talking about storage, Alex.

801
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:10,700
Head over to selfhosted.show to send us your feedback,

802
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:13,440
comments, any other stuff that you think we should

803
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,960
know about in this space.

804
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,880
How I could do storage for multiple Raspberry

805
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:20,000
Pies in a tiny network with low power requirements.

806
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
I'd love to know that.

807
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,560
Selfhosted.show, close contact.

808
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,320
I am at Chris LAS on the Twitter.

809
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,760
He's at Ironic Badger.

810
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,640
Thanks for listening.

811
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:42,760
That was selfhosted.show slash four.
