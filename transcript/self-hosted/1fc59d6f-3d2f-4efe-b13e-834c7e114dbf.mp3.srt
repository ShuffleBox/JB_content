00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,680
Coming up on Self Hosted 14, Wendell's back, he joins us and we talk about the perfect low power

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:12,880
home server, some great ideas for a firewall, and why Alex has orange knobs all over his office.

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:13,680
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,640
And I'm Alex.

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,160
And this is Self Hosted 14.

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,880
Welcome back to Self Hosted.

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,480
It's great to be here with episode 14.

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,480
And Alex, we have a special one today.

9
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,200
Another one.

10
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:23,920
I know.

11
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,440
Another special episode.

12
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,280
I feel like every episode is special.

13
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:30,160
It's like I used to say every show was a big show, but now they're not as long.

14
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,760
So now they're just special shows.

15
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,800
But this one really is because Wendell is joining us.

16
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,960
He was on episode one and we knew we'd want to have him back.

17
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,200
So Wendell, welcome back to the Self Hosted podcast.

18
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,640
How's it going?

19
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,680
I've been following the show and it's very, there are so many people that are like, yes,

20
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,320
self hosted.

21
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,160
Before we start, Alex, we had something we had to cut from last week's episode.

22
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,400
Do you want to just maybe start with that?

23
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,000
A little tip you had with, I think it was SSH Shuttle or SSH Shuttle.

24
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,320
SSH Shuttle is one of those tools.

25
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,720
I've used it for several years now.

26
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:09,520
And obviously this predates WireGuard being a thing and it lets me tunnel traffic over

27
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:14,000
SSH and essentially creates a poor man's VPN over SSH.

28
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,920
So I used to use it a lot when I worked in a bank and they had a very restrictive outbound

29
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,440
SSH policy.

30
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:26,960
So I used to use that in conjunction with Corkscrew out on port 443 to make all my traffic

31
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,040
look like what was SSL traffic.

32
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:37,120
And then I could route all my DNS through that tunnel as well and get to any website

33
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:37,620
I wanted.

34
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,440
The point for me being was I could actually get to my homeland very easily that way.

35
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:49,120
I wasn't really too worried about going to silly sites at work, but yeah, it's a tool

36
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,320
that I've used for many years.

37
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:55,760
And I've had a blog post sat in drafts for what must be four years at this point.

38
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,800
And I looked at it.

39
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,560
I sat at Nashville airport last week and I thought, you know what?

40
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,240
I need to publish this post.

41
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,600
So here we go.

42
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,320
Good.

43
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,200
We'll link that up in the old show notes.

44
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:07,680
That's a great tool.

45
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,280
I might actually play around with that myself.

46
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,240
So thank you.

47
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:10,960
It's really nice.

48
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,360
I use it a lot for Red Hat stuff.

49
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,400
We have an internal VPN that we have to connect to and I have a droplet that's running that's

50
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,400
perma connected to that VPN.

51
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,440
And so when I want to route traffic through the internal VPN to view the intranet or whatever,

52
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:32,080
I have a bash alias that routes all my traffic for those few minutes through the tunnel and

53
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,160
then through the droplet into Red Hat.

54
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,440
And it works really nicely.

55
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,240
That's a great tip.

56
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,840
That's something I'm going to check out.

57
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,880
Now, I had a realization this week that I wanted to share with you guys.

58
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,720
Curious if this happens to you.

59
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,920
So at home, I have several Raspberry Pi 4s that I set up doing various different jobs.

60
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,960
I think I've talked about it quite a bit on the show, but I had a realization that the

61
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,080
details of how I set it all up are already beginning to fade.

62
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,360
Do you have this happen where you just you go all out on something?

63
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,920
It's like a passion project and then the details fade away.

64
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,240
I'll give you one better.

65
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:08,080
You go all out on a passion project and then you're like, oh, wait.

66
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,960
And then this just random thought occurs to you.

67
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:15,120
And then it's like, I know instead of putting this in the wiring closet with everything

68
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,040
else, I'll put it here and then you open up that cabinet and there's already one there.

69
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,560
And it's like, did I already do this and forget?

70
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,800
I don't think that's ever happened to me that I've forgotten a piece of hardware exists.

71
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,320
But I could, you know, having been to your place, I can imagine that that's happened

72
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,080
once or twice.

73
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,680
Yeah, it's sort of a reminder that you're kind of predictable in a sense because I've

74
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,280
also done that with like, oh, I need to save something on the computer and I'll download

75
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,800
a PDF and I'll go to put it in a very specific place so that way I can get to it later.

76
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,640
And I'll open the directory and the PDF is already there and I've already done it.

77
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,400
I just completely forgot that.

78
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,360
Yeah, that's where I'm at.

79
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,960
And I did do some documentation.

80
00:03:54,080 --> 00:04:00,400
So I'm not totally out in the woods, but I'm looking at it now and I'm thinking, I wish

81
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,400
I would have done this through some sort of automated deployment because the scenario

82
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,400
I now fear is I've become super dependent on this hardware.

83
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,680
And I'm just concerned about hardware failure.

84
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,800
And if there's a hardware failure because they are Raspberry Pis, they are swappable.

85
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:21,440
So in theory, I could just take a dead one out, put a full who even cares what's wrong,

86
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:21,920
right?

87
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:26,960
Just buy an extra one, swap out the dead one, put in a good one and then have something

88
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,200
reset it up completely as per some system.

89
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,240
And I just haven't done that.

90
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,440
And now I'm regretting it.

91
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,760
Yeah, that's why that's where I am right now.

92
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:40,640
I've got the four gig Raspberry Pi with the POE hat with the fixed USB-C power and all

93
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,560
of that. And it's like, yes, finally.

94
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,600
And I've been experimenting with the watchdog thing for about the last six months or so,

95
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,960
like six or eight months.

96
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,880
And the watchdog thing works really well.

97
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,360
But you can also ethernet boot the Raspberry Pi.

98
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,800
And so it's like, do I even need storage for the Raspberry Pi at this point?

99
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,560
Because that's another point of failure.

100
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,400
And maybe I can just be like, no, this Mac address boots and has this hat attached to

101
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:04,960
it.

102
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,200
And I can just sort of go from there.

103
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,280
Do you still need the SD card for that, though?

104
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,960
Even for pixie booting?

105
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,720
You might just for like the bootloader or whatever.

106
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,240
There's nothing actually stored.

107
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:22,320
Like you wouldn't need to do anything, although it may be able to load from the EEPROM because

108
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,840
some of the documentation online is like, oh, there's an EEPROM that blah, blah, blah.

109
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,120
And it's like, does that actually work?

110
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:27,600
I don't know.

111
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,720
I haven't gotten there yet.

112
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,160
Can I trace back a little bit?

113
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,920
What's the watchdog thing?

114
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:36,720
On the Raspberry Pi, you can load a kernel module that if you don't poke the watchdog

115
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,000
every 10 seconds, it will hard reset the Raspberry Pi.

116
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,640
So if the Raspberry Pi locks up or has some sort of hardware failure or overheats or something,

117
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,880
it will just reset itself.

118
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,720
And that's not going to cause any issues with the SD card corrupting itself or?

119
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,320
Well, that's why I want a PXE boot.

120
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,200
Ah, yes.

121
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:53,760
Yep.

122
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:58,720
If not PXE boot, the SD card should be completely read only, maybe mechanically read only.

123
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,680
And just a super, super, super minimal boot environment.

124
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,920
Although there's the security consideration with that.

125
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:08,000
But I'd rather just completely raw boot and deal with it from there.

126
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,320
Right.

127
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:12,320
And then you could just have another SD card standing by if that one were to die for some

128
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:12,720
reason.

129
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,080
Just if it's such a minimal boot environment, doesn't need to do much.

130
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,280
But how do I do all of this?

131
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,360
Like, what is too much for a home project?

132
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,960
I don't want to create another monster that within six months, I'll forget how it's set

133
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,200
up.

134
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,400
That's what I'm worried about.

135
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,960
That's where I am, too, because it's like, I don't know.

136
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,560
For me, most of the Raspberry Pi stuff is just information logging and monitoring in

137
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,440
a tiny, tiny little bit of control.

138
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,360
So like, you know, the amazing Grafana dashboard that's like, this is what the boiler is doing.

139
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,080
This is the pressure.

140
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,200
And this is the thing over time.

141
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,640
And this is the other stuff that's happening.

142
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,360
Yeah, it's not the end of the world if you lose it.

143
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,400
What do you guys tend to use for that kind of thing?

144
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,680
Like config management?

145
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:55,120
You know, my personal flavor is Ansible and mixed with a bit of Terraform sometimes.

146
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,880
What do you use?

147
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,560
Ansible mostly.

148
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:05,840
Although, there are a few scripts that are just a bash script piped into SSH with keys.

149
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,880
That's my setup.

150
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,480
That's me over here.

151
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,480
I don't think there's anything wrong with that, really.

152
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:15,200
I mean, if you're being a super elite hacker, like Popey last week was giving me a hard

153
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,600
time that I'm an elite hacker because I like IRC.

154
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,640
No, I don't think that's true.

155
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,560
But I think bash scripts do have their place.

156
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,360
And coming back to your point, Chris, sometimes if you build a complex house of cards that

157
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,160
you don't fully understand, you then don't touch it.

158
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:37,520
So the magic bullet to making config management work for me is that you have to ensure every

159
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:42,480
change you make to a system is made through that config management tool.

160
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:46,720
So if you want to install just one package, you add that to your dictionary of packages

161
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,040
or whatever, run Ansible, and it goes and installs that one package.

162
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:54,080
I'm going to explain Ansible very briefly for those that aren't familiar with it.

163
00:07:54,080 --> 00:08:02,160
It's an SSH-based tool that is a declarative state type tool.

164
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,320
So you say, I want my system to look like this.

165
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,080
I want it to have these packages.

166
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,880
I want Samba config to look like this, et cetera.

167
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,720
You run the Ansible playbook command.

168
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,760
It SSHs out to all of your different hosts and does all of the stuff based on what's

169
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,800
in the playbooks.

170
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,440
Once the playbooks have executed, the host state should match what is declared in the

171
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,720
playbook, hence the declarative state name.

172
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:32,560
And so if you let that config drift on those nodes from the declared state in the infrastructure

173
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:37,440
as code type playbooks that you've written, you end up with this config drift between

174
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,640
the two and it becomes really hard quite quickly to reconcile those differences unless you're

175
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,920
quite strict about it.

176
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:50,000
Even things like just minor point upgrades to the underlying distro can cause a problem

177
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,480
and then it's like, oh, I didn't really want to spend three hours troubleshooting this

178
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,040
today.

179
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,440
Yeah, that's a thing as that happens.

180
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,320
So what are you thinking, Chris?

181
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,240
You want to do that for your pies now?

182
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,040
Yeah, although I am worried that's a bit much.

183
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:01,840
But is it?

184
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:05,040
So here's what my alternative is, is like an image-based approach.

185
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,400
Once a month, I pull out the SD cards and it's very manual.

186
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,840
So it's very unlikely, isn't it?

187
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,800
I mean, even just saying it out loud, I started to think it's a bad idea, but that's what

188
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:18,640
I was thinking was just images and then Duplicati gets the config data.

189
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:24,480
Offsite and the actual large data is stored on a spinning disk, or actually it's a solid

190
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,240
state disk, not an SD card.

191
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:30,160
So the OS really just has to get back to base.

192
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:37,360
Then I could pull down the latest containers, restore the configs with Duplicati, but it's

193
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,320
a lot of manual work.

194
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,920
That's probably a good couple of hours.

195
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:45,920
And that's it for me, like containers have changed how disposable my hosts are.

196
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,480
I don't really care if my host dies because all my data lives on some persistent storage

197
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,600
somewhere else and the application is separated from it.

198
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,600
So, yeah, I almost, yeah, I don't know.

199
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,520
And I don't know what point I should pull the eject lever and just say, OK, I have to

200
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:04,480
go to some massive management system or if I just...

201
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,400
Ansible is not a massive management system.

202
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,680
I think if you've never used it before, there is this kind of fog.

203
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:14,400
Yeah, but it's like half a day's effort, I think, to, you know, demist the fog.

204
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,960
Oh, really?

205
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,880
Yeah, I'll give you some help.

206
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,880
All right, then that might be the route I want to go.

207
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,000
If you think it's not...

208
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,640
See, that's kind of...

209
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,840
I just didn't want to have to bite off like a whole new thing, but I actually don't mind

210
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,040
picking up something new, really.

211
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,920
If it's not so bad, I could do it.

212
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,280
Now, let's talk about hardware whilst we have Mr. Wendell with us.

213
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,080
One of your recent videos was all about the new Fractal case.

214
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:41,520
They've gone in a really interesting way, really interesting direction.

215
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:47,600
Yeah, well, it's the Fractal Define 7 XL and the 7.

216
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,080
And the 7 XL, I wasn't expecting to like it.

217
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,920
It's just a giant tower case.

218
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,840
I wasn't expecting to like it as much as I did.

219
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,960
But it was like, man, this case would be perfect if it had wheels.

220
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,800
It's like, is there a wheels option?

221
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,520
And they're like, no.

222
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,240
And it's like, wait, I have a 3D printer.

223
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,120
I can fix this.

224
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,280
So I 3D printed my own adapters for the feet.

225
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,120
And so I went through a couple iterations.

226
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,360
Like, this is like an early iteration.

227
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,480
But it sort of centers the wheel actually on the screw.

228
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,160
Because I thought that would be a little mechanically stronger.

229
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,880
But it turns out sort of this like saddle thing is a better approach.

230
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,840
And then I ended up 3D printing a donut shaped hole in the foot

231
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,920
so that you can feed a zip tie through it.

232
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,760
And the whole thing will go inside the case.

233
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,360
And you can screw and zip tie the foot to the case.

234
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,560
And then you've got the wheel that will go in like this.

235
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,440
And so you can have a really nice case on wheels.

236
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,240
That just looks like an office chair caster, like a roller blade wheel or something.

237
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,840
Yeah, that's literally this is like you can order these on Amazon.

238
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,800
So like if you have hardwood floors, you're not supposed to use office

239
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,040
chair casters on hardwood floors because it'll wear a hole in it.

240
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,400
You get these.

241
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,760
And that's literally what this is.

242
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,240
It's just an office chair caster that goes in there.

243
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,400
And then this screws into the bottom of the fractal case.

244
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:09,600
And then you have a pretty nice full tower case that's really heavy and will roll around.

245
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,960
Now, is there a way you could figure out a reason to charge $400 for those wheels?

246
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:18,240
Because I knew you were going to go there.

247
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,560
No, it's like $35 on Amazon and like a dollar of plastic.

248
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:28,800
So hmm, OK, also 3D printed an M.2 hot swap.

249
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:34,880
So like not really hot swap, but like for like a U.2 device and so you just zip tie

250
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:40,720
the connector in the end here and then the U.2 two and a half inch NVMe SSD just slides in.

251
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,840
And so I've got these laying in the bottom of the case as well.

252
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:47,840
And so it's like, oh, I need to pop in a different Linux distro or whatever.

253
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:51,600
I'll just pop out my main hard drive and pop in a new hard drive and it's PCIe connected

254
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,200
and it's out of the way and it's nice.

255
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,560
That is great.

256
00:12:54,560 --> 00:13:00,160
And these are those wonderful Intel, what, four terabyte SSDs that you found?

257
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,680
Yeah, they're on eBay, right?

258
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,960
Yeah, I bought a few of those.

259
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:07,840
They're hard to get now, but yeah, yeah, it turns out they're they're kind of nice.

260
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:12,880
And this has got standard two and a half inch drive, like screw holes in it.

261
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,400
So you just screw this in the same way that you would a two and a half inch drive.

262
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,160
And it's a lot taller, obviously.

263
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,320
Doesn't that look like a TIE fighter to you, Chris?

264
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,200
Yeah, I could.

265
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,320
That's a good way to describe it.

266
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,520
Yeah, visualize a TIE fighter, folks, and that's kind of what it looks like.

267
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,320
That's a great idea.

268
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,760
I got to get one.

269
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:34,160
Yeah, I think zip ties are really underrated in kind of low, low budget things like this.

270
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,160
I use them for all my drones and stuff.

271
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,960
They're a major mechanical component of the Prusa 3D printers.

272
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,480
Yes, they are.

273
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,320
Yeah, yeah, I have two sat behind me.

274
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,400
I have one of the minis and the i3.

275
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:45,760
I love it.

276
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,040
Yeah, that's what these were printed on.

277
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:47,440
It works.

278
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,520
It works really well for what it is.

279
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,720
So slight tangent about 3D printing for a moment.

280
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,360
How did you get into 3D printing?

281
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,920
I needed to make things that didn't exist.

282
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:03,280
When I got a 3D printer, it was very early in the MakerBot days when they were open source

283
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,760
and you could kind of get it out of the laser cut wood.

284
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,120
And the first 3D printer that I had was basically made out of laser printer parts

285
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,960
because it was like, oh, step promoters, laser printer.

286
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,460
Yeah.

287
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,360
I thought that I would be doing a lot more creative stuff with it because I was pretty

288
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,440
good with AutoCAD because I had some experience with CNC machining.

289
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,280
Are you still using AutoCAD now?

290
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,160
No, no.

291
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,040
I made these with just Tinkercad, which is infuriating because it doesn't give you a

292
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,320
CLI interface.

293
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,640
With AutoCAD, it sort of taught me to just not even use the mouse, to just visualize

294
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,960
the part that I wanted to build and start typing coordinates.

295
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:39,920
Because using the calipers and doing the CNC thing, and that works brilliantly with AutoCAD

296
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,720
when you're going to do that.

297
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,160
But if you need to use the mouse, it's not good.

298
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:50,560
90% of what I make in the 3D printer is parts for something that I've lost or something

299
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,280
to fix something.

300
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:56,000
So I've got a bookshelf, I've got a bunch of bookshelves that have adjustable shelves

301
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,200
and sometimes I'll put tall things in and so I'll take a shelf out and then I'll rearrange

302
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,760
and then it's like, OK, I need to put that shelf back in and the little plastic things

303
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,720
are gone.

304
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,720
And they're not just pegs, they're like the ones that the shelf snaps into it.

305
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,200
And so I have about seven different models of those and it's like, oh, time to rearrange

306
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:11,680
the shelf.

307
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,840
I'll just go and 3D print some more clips and that's just what I do.

308
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,680
Right next to me here, I have a pair of Ikea Lack tables.

309
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,560
I'm going to point them on the webcam to you both and they are stacked together with two

310
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:29,280
or no, well, obviously four, one for each leg, 3D printed things with a couple of screws

311
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,080
and it is brilliant.

312
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:34,960
And then my 3D printer station behind me, you can see all the orange, everything orange

313
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:39,680
is 3D printed and designed in, I use Fusion 360, which...

314
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,640
Oh yeah, the hobby license for that is nice.

315
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,320
The hobby license only lasts a year.

316
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,520
It's the education license that's in perpetuity.

317
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,960
So you've got to be careful with that.

318
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:54,240
But it's annoying because it tethers me to windows and I've got Adobe stuff and Fusion

319
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:59,120
360 that tethers me to windows, which gives me an excuse to do PCI pass through, but I'd

320
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,080
really rather not have to.

321
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,400
You know, it could be worse.

322
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,880
Yeah, at least it works, Alex.

323
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,600
For the most part.

324
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,280
It's funny you say anything orange was 3D printed.

325
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,240
There's just your whole office is covered in orange little things everywhere.

326
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,560
You put it all together.

327
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,680
Yeah, kind of is.

328
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:24,400
I've got a few videos that are coming out and the first one is on something called the

329
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:29,760
Iron Fireman and I think I'm going to take an old thermostat because it's literally,

330
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:33,520
it's a coal loader for the boiler, but the thermostat part of it still works, but it's

331
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:37,360
mercury switch on a spring, so it's not super sensitive.

332
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,800
I think I'm going to retrofit that.

333
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,880
Did you see the Hackaday mod that was the rotary dial cell phone?

334
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:49,520
I'm going to try to take a Raspberry Pi W and shove it inside this thermostat and modernize

335
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,560
it and 3D print all the stuff to make it actually kind of nice.

336
00:16:53,200 --> 00:17:01,360
But there's a tiny, tiny little OLED SPI screen that is just about as wide as the thermostat

337
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:06,720
and it is taking every fiber of my being to resist having some kind of a thing to where

338
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,120
when you get close there's a proximity or something and a servo causes the screen to

339
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,320
lift out of the thermostat.

340
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:18,880
But it's so anachronistic because it's just a brass cover with some knobs for setting

341
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,160
day and night temperature, but it's like you get close to it and I want an OLED screen

342
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:27,680
to just pop up out of it and then powered from a piece of Cat 6 or something and that

343
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,720
would be amazing.

344
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,920
That would be really great.

345
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,720
I want that too.

346
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,720
That does sound awesome.

347
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,840
I want that.

348
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:41,280
Well, I kind of have a hardware question that's a bit of a conundrum, so maybe I could pick

349
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,400
both your brains on this one.

350
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:48,960
I think my next piece of hardware for my home setup, it's got to be my edge device, my

351
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,440
firewall.

352
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,080
So right now I have that GL, what's it called?

353
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:56,560
The GL Net, those little tiny routers, Alex, that we've talked about before on the show?

354
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:01,200
Yeah, the new version that we mentioned, I forget what episode it was, like two or three

355
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,720
or something, the Slates.

356
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,840
Yes, the Slates.

357
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,720
That's it.

358
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:10,720
Which I really like because it has a great UI that lets you switch between multiple upstream

359
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,440
network options.

360
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:16,480
So MiFi, Wi-Fi, Cat 5, whatever, you can just switch between them through their GUI.

361
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,200
But if you don't like that, you can drop under the hood and it's got a nice Linux command

362
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,720
line and it works pretty well.

363
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,760
But it's very appliance based.

364
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,280
It's not very flexible.

365
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:30,640
And the number one issue I have with it is although it touts some level of WireGuard

366
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,280
support, there doesn't seem to be quite what I want.

367
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:38,720
So I'm thinking about building, I don't know anymore if I should go with OpenSense or

368
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:44,400
PFSense, but I'm thinking about building a new edge device that also has WireGuard support

369
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,640
that would allow me to select multiple networks from different options at different times.

370
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,760
But let me keep all of the devices behind the LAN.

371
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:56,480
You know, they stay the same, their IPs don't change.

372
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,320
And that the edge device needs to provide DNS for the LAN so I can resolve all the LAN

373
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,120
devices by name.

374
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:06,800
Those basic kinds of things, so obviously DHCP, DNS, I'd even like to provide NTP for

375
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,520
the home network.

376
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,920
But some of the key things I'd want is low power if possible, low noise is a requirement

377
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,920
and even fanless would be ideal.

378
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,160
Is this a thing that exists?

379
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,240
I would probably, it's not fanless, but it's a lot of horsepower.

380
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:28,720
I'd probably go with like the Ryzen Embedded, which is probably like way, way, way extreme

381
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,320
maximum overkill for your needs.

382
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,520
But you can spin up microcontainers and microservices.

383
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:38,080
Like you can start with PFSense, but then you can expand that into a full free BSD

384
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:42,240
installation, but maintain the PFSense GUI, because that will give you containers.

385
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,320
And then you can start running jails and then inside the jail you can start running Docker

386
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,440
and stuff like that.

387
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,760
Because I've been experimenting with modifying PFSense to be able to better support things

388
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,920
like LAN cache for steam caching.

389
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,420
Yes.

390
00:19:54,420 --> 00:20:03,780
So like I did this work with Dr. Ian Cutress at Anandtech and the Chinese servers.

391
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:07,940
And so like these are, you know, sort of the forbidden technology.

392
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:11,620
It's like, this is, you know, don't do business with these companies, blah, blah, blah.

393
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:13,220
But it's like, I must explore the technology.

394
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:16,020
And so that's on a secure network.

395
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:21,700
And the way that works is there's a PFSense machine that has a VPN connection and all

396
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,580
of the traffic is tunneled, but it's also logged.

397
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:27,140
So like every packet in and out is logged.

398
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:30,820
And it doesn't matter what protocol it is, because sometimes you can hide things in non-IP

399
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:33,140
protocol stuff because people always forget about that.

400
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:37,940
Or, you know, like weird, like, oh, this looks like one of those really weird, you know,

401
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:40,500
like IGMP packets and it's completely benign.

402
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,060
And it's like, oh, no, this is actually a way to exfiltrate data.

403
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:45,140
Yeah, it's like, yeah, it's not good.

404
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:50,420
So I've got a fairly elaborate setup on PFSense where it has, you know, the LAN interface

405
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:55,220
and then it has like the red zone and then it has, you know, a bunch of other interfaces

406
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,500
and a couple of VLANs.

407
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:01,540
And there's more stuff running on PFSense than you normally would for things like packet

408
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:04,980
capture and analysis and IDS.

409
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:09,460
And those things chew up a fair bit of horsepower.

410
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:14,260
A really super inexpensive option are those ultra small form factor DELs.

411
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:16,740
Like you can get, you know, a Haswell or Ivy Bridge.

412
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:20,420
I mean, Intel mitigations aside, but you can get Intel, you can get like the Ivy Bridge

413
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:25,460
or Haswell micro form factor DELs now for like a hundred bucks and throw in eight or

414
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:26,500
16 gigs of RAM in those.

415
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:30,820
And they're not fanless, but they're whisper quiet, at least until one of the fans die.

416
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:34,180
Throw in a quad port NIC and you can do a lot with that.

417
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,380
That's a great suggestion.

418
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:38,340
Yeah, as long as it's fairly quiet, really, that's probably fine.

419
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:41,620
And you can also just, you know, roll straight Linux on it if you want.

420
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:42,660
That's an option.

421
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:44,580
And not bother with the whole PFSense stuff.

422
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:50,580
Yeah, that has also crossed my mind is just do a Linux box and then just roll bind, do

423
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:52,900
wire guard by hand, set up DHCP.

424
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:58,180
It's in fact, roll Linux box and maybe put PyHole on there to just make a few things

425
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:59,300
easy in a container.

426
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,060
Yeah, like having the whole thing.

427
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:04,580
That's that's where I'm going is like not even doing very much on the host at all.

428
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:06,500
Literally everything is container.

429
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:12,580
Everything is, you know, Docker compose or Ansible or whatever.

430
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:15,220
And if those containers all live on one machine, great.

431
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:19,220
And if those containers need to be split up across a couple of different machines, great.

432
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:25,860
But all of it sort of works together because like the PyHole and the LAN cache for Steam

433
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:30,580
game caching and other game caching and all of that, all of that magic depends on DNS.

434
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:33,780
Plus, you also want the DNS experience to be like the most amazing thing ever, because

435
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:37,620
if your local DNS resolver is garbage, your whole Internet experience is going to feel

436
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:38,660
like garbage.

437
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:43,060
So you want that to be as good and fast as possible, and maybe it's worth having a premium

438
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,260
device for that.

439
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,780
That is very good point.

440
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:49,540
Can you talk a little more about the steam cache aspect and how it requires DNS?

441
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:51,940
Because that's something I definitely want to get set up.

442
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:56,340
It's been on my to do list for a long time, and so I'm curious what I'll need to accommodate

443
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:57,940
DNS wise to enable it.

444
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:03,940
There's a GitHub repository for LAN cache that sort of goes into detail with everything,

445
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:11,300
but Steam will do a DNS lookup for a record that is expected to be rewritten by your ISP

446
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:14,180
or local provider or whatever, and you can just do it yourself.

447
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:19,300
And it does not depend on HTTPS, there's no encryption, nothing like that.

448
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:24,900
And so if you rewrite that DNS request and you have a corresponding web server that can

449
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:29,700
proxy requests, then Steam is designed to work with the caching system.

450
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:34,900
It's just normally it's like your ISP that's going to be doing the caching, but in this

451
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,820
case it's you that's going to be doing the caching.

452
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:41,700
And generally that's true with Blizzard and Activision and a bunch of other games.

453
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:46,260
Sometimes HTTPS becomes a problem because they'll forget and they'll enable required

454
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:52,900
HTTPS, and so any HTTPS traffic that you have is proxied but not cached because it's encrypted,

455
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:56,980
and that encryption is sort of temporal, so it might be able to cache it, but then if

456
00:23:56,980 --> 00:24:00,420
it goes to playback that cache later, it's sort of nonsensical at that point in time,

457
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:05,540
so the fact that it was cached encrypted data doesn't really help you.

458
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:09,020
But most game providers will let you do that, and Windows Update is the same way.

459
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:13,620
It manages its own integrity checking, so it doesn't need HTTPS, and so you can get

460
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:16,980
your Windows updates if you have Windows machines on your network or your family has Windows

461
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,580
machines or whatever.

462
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:25,220
Same thing with repositories, so our local, the same container that is doing Steam caching,

463
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:29,220
also with DNS magic, we're caching Debian and Fedora.

464
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:32,340
And so it's just completely transparent, and it's like it's going to download the package

465
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:36,260
and it's going to do its own integrity checking on the package, even though the connection's

466
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:40,940
not encrypted, but because the connection's not encrypted, I can have that local cache.

467
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:43,540
And so it's like, oh, it's time to update Debian.

468
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:46,000
Oh, that's happening at a gigabit per second.

469
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
That's nice.

470
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,340
Yeah, really.

471
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:51,140
Have you tried it with Ubuntu, or is it just Debian proper?

472
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:55,100
No, yeah, no, you can totally do it with Ubuntu, you can totally do it with any other distro

473
00:24:55,100 --> 00:25:02,060
where you can set up an HTTP non-S mirror, and then that URL will be cached if you do

474
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:03,060
some DNS magic.

475
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,060
Guys, that sounds nice.

476
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:08,220
Yeah, I definitely want to do the Steam cache one, because there are times when I'm on a

477
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:13,700
MiFi, it's just so brutal, it's so bad, and I just think to myself, why haven't I set

478
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,180
that Steam cache up yet?

479
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:18,900
And that would be a good reason to have an Edge device with a little more horsepower,

480
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,380
is to do kind of that stuff.

481
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:27,100
Asrock has a, it's like the Desk Mini A320, I think.

482
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:34,900
It's an APU, but it's got two 3.5 inch bays, and I really, really want to add an M.2 SSD

483
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:38,860
and two 4 terabyte mechanical hard drives to that, so that it's like a cheap system.

484
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:42,340
And that could be my travel cache system, because I find myself in the same situation

485
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:46,900
a lot of the time, where I'm somewhere, and maybe I'm going to go to Computex, and maybe

486
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:51,540
I want to do hardware testing in my hotel room, but the hotel room connection is garbage,

487
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:55,860
and I need terabytes and terabytes of Fire Strike and games and crap like that.

488
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:59,900
What if I could plug the hardware or laptop or whatever it is I'm testing in with a local

489
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:04,100
connection, and I've got my little six inch cube of information, basically, and it's just

490
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:07,900
shoving all of the information that I could possibly ever need onto the machine to be

491
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,900
tested at wire speed, and then I don't have to worry about it.

492
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:11,900
That's glorious.

493
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:12,900
I love that idea.

494
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:15,900
I'm making a project list over here, Alex.

495
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:18,900
I've got a list of stuff I'm writing down over here.

496
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:19,900
All right, I'm going to do that.

497
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:24,140
You can add that to the pile of shame.

498
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:26,900
The things I'll do one day.

499
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:30,340
I was watching a video, I think it was Jay's Two Cent, where we went behind the scenes

500
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:35,100
at one of these massive LAN parties, where he was talking with the networking team about

501
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:41,580
how they ran fiber to each row of people doing LAN, and they had the LAN cache there, and

502
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:44,980
that was really interesting, because he was talking about, I think it was Origin that

503
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:50,340
uses HTTPS, which meant that they couldn't cache that one particular vendor.

504
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:52,900
There have been a lot of complaints for that.

505
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:57,820
I think that was Kane and Max CFM, and those guys for Dreamhack, because Kane does a lot

506
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:03,780
of work for Dreamhack, and they get the world record on the LAN cache speed.

507
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:09,220
It was 45 or 55 gigabytes per second, I think, or was it gigabit?

508
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:10,820
It might have been gigabit.

509
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:11,820
It was fast.

510
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,620
It was insanely fast.

511
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:19,980
Even Linus's mega, crazy, super SSD server might struggle going much faster than that.

512
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:24,460
Wendell, you said something in there earlier that I thought would be worth touching on.

513
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:28,460
Sounds like you're doing sort of my approach of minimum viable Linux for the host OS.

514
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:34,300
It's just a really base install for your system, and then everything's either VM or containers?

515
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:38,060
Yeah, because repeatability, and ain't nobody got time for that.

516
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,540
Yeah, no kidding, right?

517
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:40,540
I know.

518
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:47,060
Well, and also, it's less to update, it's less to break, it's less security attack surface.

519
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,560
There's a lot of benefits to it.

520
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:52,100
The one thing that drives me insane about Docker containers is they never have good

521
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:55,940
internal log management, and you will need that for incident response.

522
00:27:55,940 --> 00:28:02,020
So I usually have things on the Docker side of it for Docker Compose.

523
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:05,420
It's like, okay, I'm just going to go ahead and map those directories to the host, but

524
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:09,700
I'm also actually going to bother with log shipping to a machine on the network that's

525
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:13,180
super hardened, just so that there's a logging device.

526
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:16,900
And then it's like, hey, I'm not getting a heartbeat from this machine, but I started

527
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:19,940
getting emails, like something may, and it's, you know, a lot of the time it's just that

528
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:24,300
machine locked up or the power went out and the battery on the other thing is lasting

529
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,420
a little bit longer.

530
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:30,100
But that's a great thing to do with the Raspberry Pi as well, because it's not x86.

531
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:36,660
So like the ScriptKitty binary exploit is like, oh, it's Raspberry Pi.

532
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:40,380
You can't just, you know, upload a binary and ELF binary to it and have it actually

533
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,380
work correctly.

534
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:42,380
Right.

535
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:46,660
And the fact that you can, you know, store the logs or export the logs or send it to

536
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:51,020
something else or just have it stored there on that device, then it's like, it's nice

537
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:54,540
because it's just right there on a separate device and it's hard to sort of compromise

538
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,420
that and everything else.

539
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:58,220
So let's get to a little bit of feedback.

540
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:00,060
I have an email here from Ian.

541
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:04,180
Thanks for writing in, Ian at Ask SSH.

542
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:08,920
It's to do with hardware and he would like to know with all the AMD hardware releases

543
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:14,520
right now, it's kind of hard to keep track of what is good for a low power server.

544
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:19,660
What would you recommend as the best bang for budget AMD based system right now for

545
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:22,220
a 24 seven based system?

546
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:26,260
Best bang for the buck is probably the Ryzen 1600 AF.

547
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:33,820
If you can find it, it's like 89 bucks and it's technically a 2600 because the 1600 on

548
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:39,420
the old process sold so well, they're like, eh, we'll call it 1600 AF and it's a little

549
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:45,620
slower than a 2600 so it didn't quite make the cut for a 2600 but it is essentially 2600

550
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:51,780
and that CPU is incredible, an incredible, you know, bang for the buck because it's basically

551
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,540
a 2000 series Ryzen.

552
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:55,340
Where does that fit broadly speaking?

553
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:58,660
I'm fairly familiar with the Intel lineup.

554
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:02,580
What's the Intel kind of comparative chip there?

555
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:06,300
Probably one of the Xeon E3s but it's actually going to be faster than just about all of

556
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,300
the Xeon E3s that are available.

557
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,300
Is that in single or multi-thread?

558
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,460
Single thread is going to be close.

559
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:14,540
It might slightly favor Intel.

560
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:19,940
If you want to beat Intel in single thread with that Xeon E3, you could go with the Ryzen

561
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:28,140
5 3600 and that's going to be a six core and that will handily outperform any Xeon E3 available

562
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:29,140
today.

563
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:33,740
Back to Ian's question, he's talking about the 24 by 7 piece.

564
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:36,540
What's the sort of idle energy draw on these things?

565
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:39,600
It depends on the motherboard and it depends on the implementation.

566
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:44,120
If you go like super, super, super low power, which actually is a little tricky to do on

567
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:49,140
Ryzen because you have to have a power supply that properly supports C6 and some power supplies

568
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:54,540
that advertise the C6 deep sleep don't actually support the C6 deep sleep and some power supplies

569
00:30:54,540 --> 00:31:00,160
implement the C6 deep sleep as turn on this big old bank of resistors just to keep things

570
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:05,900
ready in case the system wakes up, which generates heat so it doesn't actually consume less power.

571
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:09,780
You got to really look at the power graph because it's like, oh, it's 80 plus gold or

572
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,700
it's 80 plus bronze or it's 80 plus platinum.

573
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:18,640
When you start playing with the 1% power utilization, that power efficiency goes to like 50% or 30%.

574
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:23,100
So like literally half the energy that you're burning just goes to idle.

575
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:27,940
DC to DC converters in that case might actually be a better choice, like one of the micro

576
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:32,380
power supplies if you really, really want to be super frugal on the power, but it also

577
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:37,460
depends a lot on the motherboard in terms of like the actual CPU itself.

578
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:42,300
It's on the order of like one or two Watts per core while on the 3000 series plus whatever

579
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,220
the IO die is using.

580
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:48,940
So like the CPU itself in its lowest power state can be around like four or five Watts,

581
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:52,820
maybe less than that, but it really depends on the rest of the system.

582
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:53,820
Wow.

583
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:55,100
That's like Raspberry Pi level.

584
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,100
Yeah.

585
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,100
Well, it's not doing anything.

586
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,100
So I mean,

587
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:02,700
Yeah, no, but my Xeons downstairs are doing nothing and they're sucking down 150 Watts

588
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:03,700
each.

589
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:04,700
Thank you very much.

590
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:08,140
Your power usage is not going to be five Watts at the wall, no matter what you do, it's just

591
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:12,300
that the power usage is going to be dominated by everything else in the system other than

592
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,300
the CPU.

593
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,300
Sure.

594
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:17,540
So just keeping the NVMe on standby is going to be five Watts.

595
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:19,020
Oh, that's good to know.

596
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,740
I didn't know that.

597
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:23,660
And now a logical question to follow that, and this one's from me.

598
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:26,340
What sort of motherboards would we be looking at?

599
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:27,820
Is there anything with IPMI?

600
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:28,820
Yes.

601
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:29,820
ASRock.

602
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:30,820
ASRock rack.

603
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:31,820
Thank you.

604
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:34,140
They have an X470 and X570 board.

605
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:40,100
The X470 board has dual Intel 10 gig optional and you don't really pay that much more like

606
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:45,580
the board plus a 10 gig card, you know, is like 350, 300, 350, something like that.

607
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:48,420
And so three to $400 for that board.

608
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:49,420
It's great.

609
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:54,140
It's got the AST 2500, same exact thing that you'd have in a server.

610
00:32:54,140 --> 00:33:00,100
Full RAM, full VGA implementation and with the American mega trends flavored implementation

611
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,100
of the IPMI.

612
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:07,380
It's got all the features, the watchdog, SSH access, command line, the whole nine yards,

613
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:11,580
but it's an AM4 platform and they just came out with the X570 version, but I haven't been

614
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:12,740
able to source it.

615
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:16,420
I think it's a little more, I think it's like on the order of $600 and I think that's just

616
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:20,720
an availability issue, not like an actual expected end user cost.

617
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:27,900
But the 470 version is totally fine unless you need PCIe 4 or even more PCIe bandwidth.

618
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:30,980
I assume those boards require DDR4, do they?

619
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:31,980
Yeah.

620
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:32,980
Yep.

621
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:33,980
Yep.

622
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:34,980
Okay.

623
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:35,980
Good to know.

624
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:39,620
So what a total system is going to cost you 400 for the board, a hundred ish for the CPU

625
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:42,780
and then what 150 for 32 gigs of RAM?

626
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:44,660
You can get unbuffered UDIMs.

627
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:49,740
So I'd probably budget closer to 200 for the RAM and get unbuffered ECC.

628
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:50,740
Okay.

629
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:51,740
That's not bad though.

630
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:53,300
That's a lot of performance for that money.

631
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,940
And that would be a solid box.

632
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:55,940
Yeah.

633
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:58,380
And I think your idle current consumption on that, if you've got a good power supply,

634
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:00,500
would probably be around 65 Watts.

635
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,500
That's not bad at all.

636
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,500
Very good.

637
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,500
Yeah.

638
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,500
All right.

639
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,500
I want to go build one of those.

640
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,500
So that's good.

641
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,500
Add that to the pile.

642
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,500
Yeah.

643
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,900
Add that to the list of shame.

644
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:16,480
I can give you a poor man's IPMI and that is a serial port.

645
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,420
So here's the project for you.

646
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:20,740
Maybe we can do a video on this because I already got all the stuff to do this.

647
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:22,220
I just got to document it.

648
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:23,220
Okay.

649
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:28,780
So Raspberry Pi zero or regular Raspberry Pi if you want.

650
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:39,120
The GPIO pin is wired into reset RS232 is connected to the RS232 on the host machine.

651
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:42,980
The Raspberry Pi is available on a separate network or the same network depending on whatever

652
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:43,980
you want to do.

653
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:50,380
So the Raspberry Pi has enough wherewithal to reset the machine and it will at least

654
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,680
get you to grub.

655
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:56,760
So you can get grub on the serial terminal and do whatever you need to do as far as manipulating

656
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,540
or booting the machine.

657
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:00,180
That's a really great idea.

658
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,780
Can you mount ISOs that way?

659
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:03,300
Is that a thing you can do?

660
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:06,520
If you wanted to do ISOs, you can't do ISOs over the serial port.

661
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:10,600
What you do there is you put a USB stick in your computer that already has everything

662
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:16,420
that you need to recover or if your motherboard has like one of those onboard micro SD cards.

663
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:20,540
Not bootable, but you put that or bootable if you want, but you put that in there that

664
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:27,700
has that stuff that you need on it already and then you hardwire the BIOS to only boot

665
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:30,760
from the built-in hard drive and not consider other options.

666
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:35,800
And then from the grub prompt, you can specify the other partition on the USB stick and use

667
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,060
that as a recovery.

668
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:38,060
I can see it now.

669
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:40,860
I'm ringing my wife when I'm at work.

670
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:43,580
Hey, wife, I've forgotten to plug my USB stick in.

671
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:46,020
Please go and plug it in.

672
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,020
Thank you.

673
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:51,860
Yeah, it's not as good as an ASPEED 2500, but for, you know, $15, it's not bad.

674
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:54,820
And it retrofits to any board with a serial port.

675
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:55,820
Yeah.

676
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:56,820
Yeah, you should do a video on that.

677
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:58,380
I think people would love that.

678
00:35:58,380 --> 00:35:59,380
That's a great idea.

679
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:01,420
Alex, is there anything else on our list today?

680
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:05,660
Well, when we went to see you, Wendell, I swear you talked a little bit about a Bluetooth

681
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:08,660
low-energy presence detection beacon.

682
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:09,660
I finished that.

683
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:12,300
There's a write-up of that on the forum and I haven't released the video, but probably

684
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,960
by the time this is out, I will have released it.

685
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:19,260
Forgetfulness is the only reason that I haven't released it, but that's on the Linux channel

686
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,340
and there's a write-up on the forum.

687
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:25,100
It's Bluetooth low-energy presence detection for like your house or whatever.

688
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:29,580
And this is really the only Internet of Things stuff that I get into that is like genuinely

689
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:33,940
like super useful because it's like, okay, if I'm in the workshop, I want some certain

690
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:39,060
things to happen automatically, and if I leave the workshop and go into the house, whatever,

691
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:43,860
and the Wi-Fi is not good enough, and Wi-Fi also is like, oh, I'm outside, and it's like,

692
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:44,860
you're inside.

693
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:47,380
It's like, I'm really not, but okay, that's fine.

694
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:52,120
So it would be nice if when I'm outside, the outside lights are on, and if I'm inside,

695
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,660
it doesn't care about the state of the outside lights.

696
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:56,620
So the logic there is very simple.

697
00:36:56,620 --> 00:37:02,100
It's like if outside and outside lights are not on, turn on outside lights, but if inside

698
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:04,260
don't care about outside lights.

699
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,260
If they're on, leave them on.

700
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:10,560
If they're off, turn them off, or leave them off, but don't mess with the state of it.

701
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,920
If I transition from inside to outside, turn them on.

702
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,500
If I transition from not there to outside, turn them on.

703
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:23,120
If I transition from not there to inside, it's probably fine to leave them alone.

704
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:29,160
So Bluetooth low-energy works better for that in my experience than Wi-Fi and pretty much

705
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,240
every other technology that I've tried.

706
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:34,460
And so are you just carrying your phone in your pocket and it's picking that up, or do

707
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,460
you carry a special...

708
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:36,460
No, just...

709
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:37,980
There's no special tiles or anything you need to carry?

710
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:39,100
No, you can.

711
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:42,980
The tiles do actually work a little better than the phone because sometimes the phone

712
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:48,540
puts the Bluetooth thing to sleep to save power, but generally the phone works fine.

713
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:52,300
They do track people going through shopping centers and shopping malls and stuff using

714
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,220
these Bluetooth beacons.

715
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:56,820
Cruise ships use a lot of them as well, airports.

716
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:00,900
So this stuff is being used commercially, so we may as well make use of it at home,

717
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:01,900
right?

718
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:02,900
Yeah.

719
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:03,900
And you can combine stuff like that.

720
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:07,300
I love the idea of it being Bluetooth LE because you're right, that is going to work better

721
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:09,800
than Wi-Fi and you can put it all around your house.

722
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:14,140
The other thing that I've done around the studio, I've got one that I'll show it to

723
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:15,140
you guys.

724
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:16,500
It's right here.

725
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:23,900
I have these little NFC tags around the studio and when I go into an area, I put my phone

726
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:28,340
on that NFC tag and then it triggers a Home Assistant automation for me for that area.

727
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:33,220
I like the idea of supplementing location awareness from Bluetooth with these tags too

728
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,900
for manual overrides and whatnot.

729
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:38,980
I just want to put one in my mailbox to know when the mailman comes.

730
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:42,740
When you start to think in terms of Bluetooth low energy tags or even just QR codes, like

731
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:47,460
printed QR codes, suppose that there was no effort at all involved.

732
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:51,060
It's like I'm in the kitchen, it's like, oh, it's grocery shopping day, what all do I need?

733
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:54,120
You just open the pantry and there's a sticker on the inside of the door.

734
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:59,220
If you can effortlessly take out your phone, hey phone, it's grocery store day, but the

735
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:03,720
abbreviated way to say, hey phone, it's grocery store day, not even tapping an icon or finding

736
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:08,020
the app among the thousands and thousands of apps on the phone with the completely stupid

737
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:11,460
user interface of scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll.

738
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:16,100
It's just like I've opened the pantry, phone, look at this, it's like, oh, it must be grocery

739
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:17,100
day.

740
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:20,340
Correct phone, let's go down the checklist of things that I usually buy.

741
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:25,940
Yeah, the one that I just did recently is I exit out the studio, I tap that with the

742
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:32,540
phone and it sends a text message to the wife with an estimated time of arrival and then

743
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:36,420
it waits five minutes and then it brings up Waze and my podcast player.

744
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:37,420
And that's just all.

745
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:41,540
So that way I'm down the road and I'm clear of the Wi-Fi network so I don't have to wait

746
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:45,820
for the phone to figure out the Wi-Fi network versus LTE network, I'm clear of that and

747
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:49,820
then those other apps open up and they have a data connection and it kicks off just fine.

748
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:53,380
Imagine a Bluetooth low energy beacon when you're sitting at your couch in front of your

749
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:58,180
big screen TV and you just touch your phone to the thing and then you're in Plex and it's

750
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:02,120
like not only are you in Plex, but you're in Plex controlling the giant TV.

751
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:06,100
You didn't have to fiddle with finding the app and cast to this and the other thing,

752
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,860
it literally is just, it knows.

753
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:10,060
Damn you Wendell.

754
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:14,620
I haven't done that, I've tried to set that up and it turns out that's actually kind of

755
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:18,940
a hard problem, but that's because we're using rocks and sticks to try to bang out these

756
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:25,500
human interfaces and we really need somebody to come along and just set all this garbage

757
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,500
on fire and start over.

758
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:32,580
Yeah, it does feel a lot like a stone age sometimes, like we humans are still the critical

759
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:36,740
translation layer and sometimes not so perfect.

760
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:40,900
I although think we have a theme here gentlemen and it's essentially automate whatever you

761
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:43,220
can really, that's what the theme is here.

762
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:45,700
Yeah, has been throughout the show I guess, hasn't it?

763
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:50,860
The subtext of that for me is can you do this in such a way that it is unlikely to bother

764
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:54,380
you at least for years and years into the future?

765
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:59,780
Like can I set this thing up so that it works and is largely automated and I just don't

766
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:02,420
have to worry about it anymore?

767
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:08,360
And I could see at some point, because the Amazon grocery delivery thing in my area has

768
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:14,580
gotten to the point where I really want to take some time off and build an interface

769
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:20,140
for like a Kroger, Walmart, and Meyer, and Amazon and just have them all fighting with

770
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:22,980
each other for my API grocery list.

771
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:26,100
And I don't want to buy everything from the API because I really do like to walk around

772
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:30,680
the produce section and the bakery and like hand pick a few things.

773
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:36,480
But in terms of like grocery procurement, I would really like to have an application

774
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:42,820
that is, hey, if you buy two extra cartons of Charmin this week, it's going to be 15%

775
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:47,460
less overall and it's like, great, make it so AI that's handling that for me.

776
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:48,460
Yes.

777
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:49,460
I would love that.

778
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:50,460
Yeah.

779
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:51,740
I just have all of that be handled.

780
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:56,260
But the fact that you have three different grocery APIs that you can interface with,

781
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:57,500
you literally can leverage that.

782
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:00,740
And if enough people do that, it's going to be a race to the bottom and it's going to

783
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:02,820
be glorious in terms of pricing.

784
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:07,700
Probably bad in terms of local businesses, but probably good in terms of consumer pricing.

785
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:09,820
Should we approve Wendell's time off request for that?

786
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:10,820
Yeah, I'll approve that.

787
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:11,820
Yeah.

788
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:14,420
As long as we get early access.

789
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:18,300
Well, that's probably it for us today, isn't it, Alex?

790
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:19,660
Yeah, I think so.

791
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:20,760
So thanks very much for listening.

792
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:23,380
You can find us on Twitter at self-hosted show.

793
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:28,020
And of course, self-hosted.show is the website, self-hosted.show slash subscribe for all the

794
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:30,120
ways to get new episodes.

795
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:32,860
And Wendell, give the people a way to catch what you do.

796
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:36,460
Youtube.com slash level one techs or level one techs.com.

797
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:42,220
And definitely, I'm looking for volunteers to build the AI hotel from Altered Carbon.

798
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:47,580
I've got two Tesla V100s we can load into that AI and so it's just start doing all this

799
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:48,580
stuff for us.

800
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:49,580
And it's like, great, sounds good.

801
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:50,580
Let's do it.

802
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:51,580
Of course you are.

803
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:52,580
Why wouldn't you be looking to do that?

804
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:55,580
I think it's a great idea.

805
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:59,780
Yeah, do go and check those forums out over on the level one techs site.
