WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.800
I'm feeling that big 80 energy. We're just one shy as I'm prepping to hit the road.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.240
Episode 80 is going to be from the road because this is my last in-studio self-hosted.

00:10.240 --> 00:14.720
I'm doing all the things, all the pre-flight checks, you know, doing all the updates, Alex.

00:14.720 --> 00:18.560
I'm getting everything ready to go, except for Home Assistant, obviously.

00:18.560 --> 00:22.000
You're a madman. You should do all that stuff when you get back,

00:22.000 --> 00:25.600
because things right now are presumably working fine-ish.

00:25.600 --> 00:30.080
I got a week, right? So I got enough time to fix it if it breaks. No, you don't.

00:30.080 --> 00:35.040
You're prepping for a road trip. But this is how I avoid doing it on the trip.

00:35.040 --> 00:39.040
Because, you know, when you sit there and you see the thing needs updates, it's so tempting.

00:39.040 --> 00:42.960
Yeah, I suppose so. So this is how I avoid it, is I do it now before the trip.

00:43.520 --> 00:48.240
You know, and I go around to like, if the sensors got low battery, like I got a couple,

00:48.240 --> 00:51.920
like in my bays and stuff, I'm just going to replace them now. Just going to get all that done.

00:51.920 --> 00:55.920
Some minor fixes, you know, stuff like that. That's a good idea. Yeah, absolutely.

00:55.920 --> 00:59.680
So, you know, what's got me thinking is three years ago,

01:00.240 --> 01:02.560
Memorial Day weekend was when we went to see Wendell,

01:02.560 --> 01:05.920
which means self-hosted is three years old somehow.

01:05.920 --> 01:08.880
Well, happy show birthday, buddy. How about that?

01:08.880 --> 01:10.560
Thank you very much, friend guy.

01:10.560 --> 01:12.960
That was pretty good there, pal. I like that.

01:12.960 --> 01:14.320
I'm not your buddy guy.

01:14.720 --> 01:21.120
Okay there, pal. Yeah. Wow, that goes by fast, but also slow, but yet really fast.

01:21.120 --> 01:29.840
It seems like just, I don't know, a year ago we were in the Smoky Mountains on the Tale of the Dragon.

01:29.840 --> 01:30.400
That's it.

01:30.400 --> 01:38.000
Doesn't seem like it was that long ago, but 80 episodes almost. That feels like a long time ago.

01:38.000 --> 01:45.040
There's a suggestion that for each decade now of episodes, we have a rich area of musical

01:45.040 --> 01:49.920
history to tap into so we can really lean heavily on the 80s tunes for the next 10 episodes.

01:49.920 --> 01:56.320
Oh, I like this idea. What happens when we get to like, you know, episode 200 or something?

01:56.320 --> 01:59.200
What do we do? Do we go into the future?

01:59.200 --> 02:02.080
200? Oh my goodness. That's a long way away.

02:02.080 --> 02:05.120
Well, by then we'll be the self-hosted franchise, I would imagine, you know,

02:05.120 --> 02:08.720
with the self-hosted blog and the self-hosted YouTube channel and the self-hosted-

02:08.720 --> 02:13.440
We'll have been bought out by Google and then we'll have unmerged from Google,

02:13.440 --> 02:15.440
of course, because that's how JB rolls.

02:15.440 --> 02:20.000
Yeah, yeah. You got to do both. Let's be honest.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.280
It's not a one-way deal with you.

02:22.960 --> 02:26.560
Man, you know what? You get married, you get divorced, you get married again. You know,

02:26.560 --> 02:30.960
it's really that second marriage you wanted to stick. It's that second wife, I always say.

02:31.760 --> 02:38.720
Well, I wanted to get an update from you on that new fancy, shiny ARK Intel GPU. How did that go?

02:38.720 --> 02:42.400
I know you ended up receiving it, but I imagine now you've had a chance to actually plug it into

02:42.400 --> 02:43.040
something.

02:43.040 --> 02:48.400
Yeah, it's plugged into my little test box behind me. I ordered the Intel ARK GPU, as you say,

02:48.400 --> 02:56.000
the ASRock A380 is the model number. And I got a notification, I think it was on Reddit or

02:56.000 --> 03:02.240
something saying, you know, these GPUs will be in stock on Newegg tomorrow. So I, you know,

03:02.240 --> 03:07.200
went and ordered one or pre-ordered one, I think it was, and it shipped. I didn't actually expect

03:07.200 --> 03:12.880
to actually get one as soon as I did. The thing is, when it arrived and I plugged it in, I thought,

03:12.880 --> 03:19.440
okay, cool, right, I'm going to plug it in. And I'd read online with gamers Nexus and a few others

03:19.440 --> 03:24.400
that the drivers weren't particularly good on Windows. I'm like, well, I don't really care.

03:24.400 --> 03:29.600
I'm not going to be gaming on it. My primary use case for this thing is to stick it in a server,

03:30.320 --> 03:36.160
pass it through, and then maybe get rid of my Blue Iris dedicated box.

03:36.160 --> 03:39.360
Because I could use the quick sync functionality that's built into this GPU

03:39.360 --> 03:46.080
for hardware encoding, maybe, maybe Blue Iris, maybe Plex, whatever. So I installed Proxmox

03:46.080 --> 03:51.200
on my system behind me, got the pass through working in five minutes because it's super easy

03:51.200 --> 03:58.080
on Proxmox these days. Code 43 in the Windows VM, just like we used to get with Nvidia back in the

03:58.080 --> 04:03.120
day. So something in the drivers, and I don't know what because I'm not clever enough to figure that

04:03.120 --> 04:11.120
out. But code 43 basically is the warm, warm sad trombone moment when you when you get the drivers

04:11.120 --> 04:17.280
installed. So pass through to a Windows VM was no go. And I thought, okay, can't be that difficult

04:17.280 --> 04:23.200
to do pass through to a Linux VM. How wrong I was, Chris, how wrong I was.

04:23.200 --> 04:29.440
Yeah. Is it just too freaking new? Is that the problem? Because I don't know anybody that has

04:29.440 --> 04:33.920
one of these. Michael Larivelle over at Ferronix has one too, thankfully. And he's written a couple

04:33.920 --> 04:40.800
of articles about this thing. And this graphics card is so new that of course, because Intel ship

04:40.800 --> 04:47.280
all their drivers as part of the Linux kernel, I need to go and download the 6.0 RC release from

04:47.280 --> 04:53.680
GitHub and actually run mainline kernel and compile it and pass a couple of kernel arguments to force

04:53.680 --> 05:01.600
it to use the the GPU. And so how's that going, Alex? How's that been going? It's more effort

05:01.600 --> 05:07.520
than I'd imagined so far, Chris, I'm going to be honest with you. And it's like one of those things

05:07.520 --> 05:14.400
where how motivated are you right now? Because if you wait three months, it's probably going to be

05:14.400 --> 05:18.880
done for you. Right? It's like, God, how much you just want to do it right now versus just wait?

05:18.880 --> 05:22.640
Well, I'd love to do it right now. Because I actually think as part of the public service,

05:22.640 --> 05:30.160
angle that this show kind of fills that a media server oriented card like this that has a lot of

05:30.160 --> 05:38.000
really exciting new hardware encoding stuff on it with the AV1 encoders. I'd like to give the people

05:38.000 --> 05:43.760
an idea of how well this thing does or does not perform with Plex with Jellyfin with Handbrake and

05:43.760 --> 05:48.720
FFmpeg and all those kinds of things. I suppose all of those things actually lead to FFmpeg under

05:48.720 --> 05:53.280
the hood, really. But I follow what you mean. It's like, do people want to know, is this worth their

05:53.280 --> 05:58.080
money? Is this worth actually investing in? Is this the next way to build my next media server?

05:58.080 --> 06:02.240
Yeah, because, you know, potentially you could you could that old Xeon that you've got chugging

06:02.240 --> 06:08.400
along, you could throw this graphics card in there and potentially have a very low power,

06:08.960 --> 06:13.920
highly performant hardware encoding setup for your media server. You could do that with an AMD

06:13.920 --> 06:19.200
chip as well, or even an Intel CPU that doesn't have a latest QuickSync in there, you know,

06:19.200 --> 06:24.640
like an old third or fourth gen, something like that. So lots of options if we can get it working.

06:24.640 --> 06:30.640
And I've been really busy playing Factorio this week. And that's not the best excuse in the world,

06:30.640 --> 06:35.680
that's why I haven't done my homework, teacher. But the factory must grow, you know?

06:35.680 --> 06:39.840
Are you playing this on your new shiny Steam Deck by chance?

06:39.840 --> 06:45.120
Actually, no. That also arrived this week. It's been an expensive month.

06:45.120 --> 06:49.600
Hold on a second here now. Hold on, hold on. So you get a new Steam Deck, you're playing a Steam

06:49.600 --> 06:56.720
game, but you're not playing it on the Steam Deck. So here's the thing about Factorio,

06:56.720 --> 07:01.600
particularly, and a lot of the games I seem to like, are these kind of isometric kind of city

07:01.600 --> 07:07.200
builders, where you need a big canvas to see all the different bits and bobs all, you know,

07:07.200 --> 07:14.560
gesticulating on the screen. And unfortunately, the 1280 by 800 little screen that the Steam Deck has

07:14.560 --> 07:16.400
ain't quite it, chief, you know?

07:16.400 --> 07:20.560
And it would struggle, it would, it would struggle mightily if you tried to hook that thing up to a

07:20.560 --> 07:26.080
monitor that big. I've experimented and you go much higher on the resolution and you start to

07:26.080 --> 07:28.800
leave the optimal zone of the Steam hardware.

07:28.800 --> 07:34.240
I've been really, really impressed with the Steam Deck for the, you know, sort of casual gaming,

07:34.240 --> 07:41.120
like, you know, Forza Horizon or F1 2022 or whatever, you know, playing those sorts of games,

07:41.120 --> 07:45.280
like I'm taking a flight to LA soon, it's going to be amazing on the plane to be able to do that

07:45.280 --> 07:54.400
kind of stuff. But for more air quotes, serious gaming, like Factorio, it's not quite the right

07:54.400 --> 07:58.000
fit. But my goodness is an impressive device overall.

07:58.000 --> 08:07.040
And what a fantastic retro emulator. Absolutely the most solid retro emulator experience I've had

08:07.040 --> 08:13.360
for the Super Nintendo. I got the nostalgia feels like it was the good old days playing the Super

08:13.360 --> 08:19.760
Nintendo on a CRT. It just is so tight, the way everything works. And then also there's just,

08:19.760 --> 08:24.160
like, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game, Shredder's Revenge, also just plays incredible

08:24.160 --> 08:30.240
on the deck. And you can hook up controllers to it either over Bluetooth or over USB. And so like,

08:30.240 --> 08:35.200
for example, my son and I are sitting there, I set the deck down, and we both have controllers,

08:35.200 --> 08:40.400
and we're playing Turtles Shredder's Revenge on the deck. And it's great for that kind of stuff.

08:40.400 --> 08:44.800
And it's killer, killer for anything that works really good with a controller.

08:44.800 --> 08:49.520
I saw you pop up in my notifications in Steam saying Chris Lass is now playing Turtles. I was

08:49.520 --> 08:55.120
like, yes, good for him. Yeah, that's great for that. It is. I really think that they've got

08:55.120 --> 09:01.280
something there. And the fact that it's open, that you can install stuff, you can get to the desktop,

09:01.280 --> 09:07.680
you can tinker with it. I love that trend. And I hope that takes off. Others see this, I hope.

09:07.680 --> 09:14.880
It's a first generation device, so it's not perfect. But again, besides the battery life at

09:14.880 --> 09:19.520
two hours, which on a flight is going to be a bit of a problem. I mean, at home, it's absolutely not

09:19.520 --> 09:25.120
a problem because I just plug in a cable. For a first generation device, I think Valve must be

09:25.120 --> 09:31.040
absolutely commended for everything they've done to progress and further the Linux narrative with

09:31.040 --> 09:37.120
Proton. Everything they've done over the last, I guess, seven or eight years since they announced

09:37.120 --> 09:42.560
that very first Alienware Steam box, I suppose. That's what this has been leading. It's been

09:42.560 --> 09:46.960
coming since then, really. There've been a few things happened in the meantime that have kind

09:46.960 --> 09:54.400
of made this possible, I suppose, like AMD's propensity to create gaming console quality

09:54.400 --> 10:00.080
mobile chips that things like what go in the Switch and what have you, although that's Nvidia,

10:00.080 --> 10:04.320
that one. And their work to upstream those, right? So that stuff's just in the kernel.

10:04.320 --> 10:09.040
That's just it. And I was saying to someone the other day, I got the one with the anti-glare

10:09.040 --> 10:17.040
screen and the 512 SSD that's in there. So it wasn't a cheap device. I think it was about 650

10:17.040 --> 10:22.400
or so. I would pay that again, quite happily, just to support Valve and what they're doing.

10:22.400 --> 10:27.760
And I think voting with your wallet really is the only way to send a true message. And there's so

10:27.760 --> 10:34.080
many companies out there, like Nintendo, that want to lock people into gaming so hard that when you

10:34.080 --> 10:39.680
buy a new Nintendo Switch, for example, which I did when my wife was pregnant, I realized that

10:39.680 --> 10:44.960
actually I have to spend another couple of hundred bucks on games for this thing. Whereas when I buy

10:44.960 --> 10:49.760
my Steam Deck, I've got the last 10 years of my Steam library sat there ready to go. And we can

10:49.760 --> 10:56.000
have an argument about Steam DRM probably till we're blue in the face. But the fact is that I

10:56.000 --> 11:02.320
didn't get locked into a proprietary ecosystem. I'm running Linux so I can go under the hood and

11:02.320 --> 11:08.800
as you say, run EmuDeck, all of that emulation stuff as well on the same device. And it's just

11:08.800 --> 11:15.520
so, so cool. I'd be curious to know if anybody out there in the audience has integrated the deck

11:15.520 --> 11:20.960
into their home lab setup somehow. Is there something there? I had a real wow moment. I've

11:20.960 --> 11:26.000
got a USB-C monitor just here. Oh yeah. And it's got Ethernet in the back of it as well as a couple

11:26.000 --> 11:32.400
of USB ports. One cable into the Steam Deck charged it, gave me Ethernet and gave me a 4K

11:32.400 --> 11:38.400
output to display to do all the tinkering. And I'm like, okay, this is convergence in action right

11:38.400 --> 11:46.560
here. I know it works. It actually works. They've done it, Jim. Yeah. I'm really impressed as well.

11:46.560 --> 11:50.000
So let us know how you're using it. If you've picked up a Steam Deck and if you're considering

11:50.000 --> 11:54.080
it, it's a thumbs up from both of us. I agree with Alex. I think one of the best things is you take

11:54.080 --> 11:57.760
it out of the box, you log in and you've got games. You don't have to go spend a bunch of money.

11:57.760 --> 12:02.320
I just need an 18 terabyte hard drive to go in that thing now. Cause even though I've got the

12:02.320 --> 12:08.560
512 one, it's, you know, F1 is a hundred gig. The Witcher is a hundred gig. Red Dead is, you know,

12:09.120 --> 12:14.080
three or four games and it's full. You know what I mean? I do. I do know what you mean. We've been

12:14.080 --> 12:21.040
getting a lot of feedback around our topic in episode 78. It seems like it had a big impact

12:21.040 --> 12:26.080
on a lot of people. That story that Google flagged a dad and then auto-batched up his

12:26.080 --> 12:31.920
entire Google account history from the early aughts and sent it to the cops. That seems to

12:31.920 --> 12:35.680
have really stuck with people. And I think it stuck with both you and I a lot too. Cause we've

12:35.680 --> 12:39.760
talked off air that you and I are still thinking about it. It feels like something's changed. A

12:39.760 --> 12:45.440
real line has been crossed by Google. Like the risk reward calculation about using Google services

12:45.440 --> 12:50.640
has changed. And for some of us pretty dramatically. Last episode, I was talking to you in Chrome and

12:50.640 --> 12:56.480
this time I'm talking to you in Firefox. Uh-huh. Interesting. Yeah. I've also switched to using

12:56.480 --> 13:02.080
Firefox. I just cold turkey quit. I, uh, I exported my bookmarks and just switched over.

13:02.080 --> 13:08.160
I actually looked into self-hosting the Firefox sync server. Uh, there's a couple of things that

13:08.160 --> 13:12.720
go into it as well. If you want, if you want to go into the weeds of it, you've got to self-host

13:12.720 --> 13:17.280
the authentication server as well. And it really starts to get pretty complicated, pretty fast.

13:18.240 --> 13:21.520
So I didn't end up doing that for now, but it is something I'm going to keep an eye on. There's a

13:21.520 --> 13:26.720
rust based implementation of the sync server. That's fairly new. There's an older one, which is

13:26.720 --> 13:32.640
no longer supported by Mozilla. So there's a few options there, but, um, you know, I suppose if I

13:32.640 --> 13:39.680
think about it, what's the sync session syncing my browser history and, uh, my bookmarks really

13:39.680 --> 13:44.480
passwords are in bit warden. They're not being synced extensions, I suppose extensions. Yeah,

13:44.480 --> 13:50.080
of course. So I don't really know what the future holds, but I still have to use Chrome through

13:50.080 --> 13:54.800
work because Red Hat or a Google suite, uh, company. So, I mean, I guess I could use Firefox,

13:54.800 --> 14:00.080
but it's easier to use Chrome. Even still, Mozilla feels like a way less bigger threat,

14:00.080 --> 14:05.520
you know, like galactically smaller threat than, than Google. I feel like for me, what's,

14:05.520 --> 14:12.640
what's shifted is I now see all of Google services as a bit of a minefield and you could see how they

14:12.640 --> 14:18.160
can really compound to screw you really good. And now, like, am I going to one day find out that

14:18.160 --> 14:24.160
they are also parsing communications to try to detect things that could be harmful for children

14:24.160 --> 14:28.880
in our communications? You know, they are, you know, if they're not the NSA already. So it just

14:28.880 --> 14:32.960
kind of compounds the risk kind of compounds the more you use Google. So when I get back from the

14:32.960 --> 14:38.080
road trip, I'm going to cancel Google Fi. I'd, I had kind of gotten it over the years. I have

14:38.080 --> 14:43.200
a T-Mobile SIM coming tomorrow. I've already canceled my Google Fi. Yeah, I almost did it.

14:43.200 --> 14:47.600
And then I was like, this might be really stupid to go on a road to be right about to go on a road

14:47.600 --> 14:53.840
trip to cancel cell service. But when I get back, I'm done. You know why I did it before the trip

14:53.840 --> 15:00.400
is because I'm flying Delta and they have free Wi-Fi with T-Mobile. Well, okay, there you go.

15:00.400 --> 15:04.480
That's the incentive you needed. I think that's great. But I was thinking about it, you know,

15:04.480 --> 15:09.280
you know, I'm a big proponent of tail scale. I realized I actually use the Google authentication

15:09.280 --> 15:14.800
for tail scale, which is a problem. So I'm gonna have to fix that. Probably gonna move to head

15:14.800 --> 15:20.800
scale as a result of all this. Finally, finally do the self hosted thing, you know, eat my own dog

15:20.800 --> 15:25.280
food. But there's so much stuff on the web that tracks you when you actually start reading and

15:25.280 --> 15:30.160
looking into the privacy stuff. This might sound obvious to some people, but it hadn't occurred to

15:30.160 --> 15:35.760
me that every time you see that little login with Facebook button on a web page, whether you use it

15:35.760 --> 15:39.600
or not, they're using that to track where you are. Yeah, they're getting they're getting info,

15:39.600 --> 15:46.160
aren't they? It's gross. It is gross. And a lot of people use it because it, it does it, you know,

15:46.160 --> 15:52.320
it takes care of the username authentication. That's a tricky one. It's really tricky one.

15:52.320 --> 15:55.680
I don't really know what the solution is there. I really got to figure out where I draw the line

15:55.680 --> 16:02.080
with Google because I've also got the set up for Google apps. Prozac boosted in with a row of ducks

16:02.080 --> 16:06.240
along this line of thinking. He said, I don't know how I feel after listening to episode 78. I left

16:06.240 --> 16:11.360
Google a long time ago and I switched to DuckDuckGo. My mail is in a paid service in Norway,

16:11.360 --> 16:16.720
yada, yada, yada. But I guess I'm still magnifying my tinfoil hat. Now that the new normal is for

16:16.720 --> 16:22.240
our tech overseers to be the judge and the jury, that makes me a complete target because I'm not in

16:22.240 --> 16:28.080
the system, a system that says maybe I'm guilty by default. It's a no win game unless a large number

16:28.080 --> 16:33.200
of people get away from those services. So in other words, you almost put a target on your back

16:33.200 --> 16:39.200
by not participating in these systems is what Prozac is saying. Do you though? I mean, there's

16:39.200 --> 16:45.760
already, there's so much noise. I guess, I guess he has a point actually. There's so much noise.

16:45.760 --> 16:51.040
There's so much signal to noise that they've got to process with, with these things. But that's

16:51.040 --> 16:56.080
where machine learning comes in is to help, help do that. And a machine can't do much learning if

16:56.080 --> 17:00.720
you're not part of the system, I suppose. Yeah, that's true. You're protected in the,

17:00.720 --> 17:06.400
in the like automatically flagging you because the machine learning thingy just misunderstood

17:06.400 --> 17:09.680
what you took a picture of or what you had a voicemail about or something. You're like

17:09.680 --> 17:15.680
avoiding all of that trap. There is a dystopian future playing out here though already, isn't

17:15.680 --> 17:22.800
there? Where if you're not, if you're not part of the, uh, the Amazon or the Google ecosystem,

17:22.800 --> 17:26.800
you know, you're not allowed to buy prime. You're not allowed to buy stuff off Amazon.

17:26.800 --> 17:33.280
You're not allowed to, I dunno, whatever the, whatever the problem would be. And Josh in the

17:33.280 --> 17:38.480
chat says, don't put all your eggs in one basket. And to that, I would just counter that there's

17:38.480 --> 17:43.760
only three or four baskets to really choose from with, with big tech in air quotes. You know,

17:43.760 --> 17:48.480
there's really not as much choice as you might imagine when it comes to the, the internet.

17:48.480 --> 17:54.640
Has anyone out there successfully cut off Amazon completely? I mean, how do you do that? Especially

17:55.360 --> 17:59.760
in the day and age where a lot of people can't get stuff, but Amazon can still get it.

17:59.760 --> 18:04.960
Can you imagine if somehow your social credit score prohibited you from accessing AWS based

18:04.960 --> 18:11.280
services? That already does. They won't let me on. No, I don't mean as a customer. I mean,

18:11.280 --> 18:16.880
as an end user, you, you are not allowed to load any traffic that traverses Amazon's network

18:16.880 --> 18:22.080
somewhere. That'd be pretty awful. That'd be most of the internet, wouldn't it? What about this

18:22.080 --> 18:27.680
concept of just don't put all your eggs in one basket? Like, so maybe Mozilla's handling your

18:27.680 --> 18:34.800
syncing and maybe fast mail's handling your email. Trevdev boosted insane. He switched to fast mail.

18:34.800 --> 18:38.880
I know. I think you mentioned you're looking at fast mail. Yeah. Yeah. I've been with fast

18:38.880 --> 18:45.360
mail for a while now. I use proton mail for some things. You're still using somebody else's service,

18:45.360 --> 18:50.320
but you're kind of spreading the risk out. Is that better? Well, I mean, I found it interesting.

18:50.320 --> 18:53.680
You think talking about email specifically, there's, there's a link in the show notes. There

18:53.680 --> 19:00.080
was a blog post doing the rounds this week about a guy who's been self-hosting email for 23 years

19:00.080 --> 19:05.920
and has finally thrown in the towel and basically gave all the reasons that you might imagine as to

19:05.920 --> 19:12.080
why he stopped. Email is not distributed anymore. He says you cannot create another first-class

19:12.080 --> 19:18.320
node in this network. Email is now an oligarchy, a service that is gate kept by a few big companies,

19:18.320 --> 19:23.120
which does not follow the principles of net neutrality. First, they cut off the residential

19:23.120 --> 19:28.800
IPs. Then they cut off the VPSs. Now they've basically cut off all self-hosters. He says,

19:28.800 --> 19:35.520
my emails are just simply not getting delivered anymore. After running a mail server since 1999,

19:35.520 --> 19:41.120
the day he got a broadband service. And ever since then, he's been running a mail server and he says,

19:41.120 --> 19:45.920
now it's just completely, he's throwing in the towel. He says hell banning everybody,

19:45.920 --> 19:50.960
except other big email providers is a lazy way to fight spam and it's dishonest.

19:51.680 --> 19:56.480
He uses spam as a scapegoat to nerf deliverability and stifle competition.

19:56.480 --> 20:02.560
Absolutely. It's all about stifling competition in my opinion. And the issue isn't necessarily

20:02.560 --> 20:09.200
that your IP gets blacklisted and you get sent straight to spam. The issue is that you get part

20:09.200 --> 20:15.360
of a block of IPs and your mail just simply gets rejected before it even gets that far.

20:16.160 --> 20:18.880
And what do you do then? You completely SOL.

20:18.880 --> 20:22.880
Your really only best option, if you find you can't self-host your mail,

20:22.880 --> 20:27.600
is you need to at least own your domain. Don't have an at Gmail domain. Don't have an iCloud.

20:27.600 --> 20:33.840
Though Apple would love to tell you that they have the most private system. Actually,

20:33.840 --> 20:39.920
I probably believe them that they do actually, of all of them, of the big three or four, I suppose,

20:39.920 --> 20:42.560
with that, what's it called? iCloud Plus or something?

20:42.560 --> 20:43.120
For now.

20:43.120 --> 20:43.600
For now.

20:43.600 --> 20:47.680
For now. Though as they begin to monetize services and things like that, they're going to have to

20:47.680 --> 20:52.960
drive revenue from advertising. And they're launching more and more resources and staff

20:52.960 --> 20:57.920
around their advertising department. So we shall see. Carlos, the guy that had this email,

20:58.480 --> 21:04.160
shutting down his email server, he says it's a huge, invisible problem that really isn't

21:04.160 --> 21:08.960
getting fixed. Email is basically going to the big tech companies. I think he's right.

21:08.960 --> 21:13.200
I think the future for that kind of stuff is Matrix. I mean, not that it's going to replace

21:13.200 --> 21:19.040
email, but for something that you can self-host and federate and is truly decentralized and open.

21:19.040 --> 21:24.640
I just wonder where email will be in 10 years time. Answers on the postcard.

21:24.640 --> 21:27.920
selfhosted.show.com Yeah, let us know.

21:29.520 --> 21:34.400
Okay, then photos. I just have a quick update. You mentioned image last week.

21:34.400 --> 21:37.360
Image. I-M-M-I-C-H.

21:37.360 --> 21:42.160
And we got a little bit of knowledge from Fuzzy Mistborn. He says, I think he might be a lawyer,

21:42.160 --> 21:45.120
he says, the Fourth Amendment only protects against government searches.

21:45.120 --> 21:49.920
So, a EULA can and does allow for Google to search all of your photos.

21:49.920 --> 21:53.920
So, I think it came up, you know, does the Fourth Amendment protect you here?

21:55.120 --> 21:57.120
Fuzzy Mistborn says it does not.

21:57.120 --> 22:00.320
I think I tried to sound intelligent and say they needed a warrant or something.

22:00.320 --> 22:02.720
I wish they did. I wish they did.

22:03.520 --> 22:08.720
So, I gave Image a try, which is a self-hosted photo and video backup solution that's

22:08.720 --> 22:15.120
aiming to have a client on Android and iOS that auto backs you up, just like Google Photos does.

22:15.920 --> 22:17.920
Only you self-hosted all yourself.

22:19.120 --> 22:26.320
And the basic UI of the web app is very much like the early days of Google Photos.

22:26.320 --> 22:27.920
Yeah, it looks pretty promising, huh?

22:27.920 --> 22:33.120
It does. I'm very excited about this. However, having used it for a bit,

22:33.120 --> 22:40.720
I'm also a little sad because I realized after using it, we're like five years out.

22:41.920 --> 22:46.320
I mean, like, you're going to get really basic functionality where you can look at your photos

22:46.320 --> 22:50.320
and probably put them in albums and you can probably upload them.

22:50.320 --> 22:53.120
Although, it sounds like iOS is giving the developer a hard time.

22:53.120 --> 22:54.720
He's an iOS user himself.

22:54.720 --> 22:59.520
But they just did a big update this week and they got Android auto backup working.

22:59.520 --> 23:00.720
They got deduplication working.

23:00.720 --> 23:05.520
They got dark mode on mobile, but iOS users, he's having a hard time with the background killing.

23:05.520 --> 23:07.920
Yeah, it's those background APIs, huh?

23:07.920 --> 23:09.920
There's a lot of finesse there to get that working.

23:09.920 --> 23:14.320
Yeah, and I think that's where Apple probably have an anti-competitive advantage in that

23:14.720 --> 23:20.720
they have system level access to APIs that normal mortal developers just simply don't have.

23:20.720 --> 23:22.720
It might just be for iOS users.

23:22.720 --> 23:27.920
The solution is to just let iCloud have the photos for a bit, pull them off of iCloud,

23:27.920 --> 23:31.920
with the backup scripts we've talked about on the show before, and then upload them to something like this.

23:31.920 --> 23:39.520
I do think image is probably the emerging leader in the pack of all of these different photos apps.

23:39.520 --> 23:43.520
I mean, I wrote for Ars Technica, I guess, 18 months ago, a couple of years.

23:43.520 --> 23:45.120
I can't remember when exactly.

23:45.120 --> 23:50.320
You know, I did a roundup of all the runners and riders at the time, you know, Photo Prism and,

23:50.320 --> 23:54.320
you know, there was about 10 or 12 in that list at the time.

23:54.320 --> 23:59.120
And I think image has come along out of nowhere since the article, really.

23:59.120 --> 24:08.720
And really, if he delivers, which so far, the developers given us absolutely no reason to believe that he won't deliver on his promise.

24:08.720 --> 24:13.520
If he delivers on it, then I think this is probably going to be the app to beat.

24:13.520 --> 24:14.320
Agreed.

24:14.320 --> 24:19.520
You know, we get Photo Prism recommended a lot, and it is part of a solution, definitely.

24:19.520 --> 24:24.720
But this is a complete, this is like, give it to your family, give them this app.

24:24.720 --> 24:27.120
It just auto uploads in the background, that kind of stuff.

24:27.120 --> 24:28.720
That's really exciting.

24:28.720 --> 24:30.320
And it's pretty easy to get up and running in Docker.

24:30.320 --> 24:31.920
It just takes a few seconds.

24:31.920 --> 24:32.720
So here's the thing.

24:32.720 --> 24:35.120
I mean, it's been architected as microservices.

24:35.120 --> 24:38.720
So, you know, it's what, four or five containers all linked together.

24:38.720 --> 24:46.720
But for me, I think we're at a point where these services need some kind of financial incentive.

24:46.720 --> 24:53.120
To be able to have the resources to beat Google or Apple or whoever.

24:53.120 --> 25:04.320
I mean, Google's budget for Google Photos must be astronomical for the development, for all the machine learning bills that it has, et cetera, et cetera.

25:04.320 --> 25:11.120
Now, obviously, we're outsourcing a bunch of that cost to our servers, to our hard drives, to our CPUs, whatever.

25:11.120 --> 25:17.520
So the argument sort of kind of goes away.

25:17.520 --> 25:30.720
But with that comes a lot of vertical integrations that Google can do with, you know, matching lots and lots of different dogs and making their algorithms better and more accurate and that kind of thing.

25:30.720 --> 25:32.720
I'm sure it's very valuable for them in that regard.

25:32.720 --> 25:39.520
And so I wonder, you know, if you're listening to this show, if you were in the market to pay for this app.

25:39.520 --> 25:42.720
Let's just, for example, say image.

25:42.720 --> 25:50.720
If you were to pay a subscription to support the development of this application, not to unlock any functionality like what Plex do, for example.

25:50.720 --> 26:01.120
Just simply, I guess, sort of like the Home Assistant model to say, here's five bucks a month to support this developer's ability to go to the grocery store.

26:01.120 --> 26:05.920
Is five bucks, would you be willing to pay that for a completely self-hosted application?

26:05.920 --> 26:07.520
Where does the line draw?

26:07.520 --> 26:17.920
Because I know personally subscription fatigue is real, but also I'm fatigued of giving up my privacy to these big companies.

26:17.920 --> 26:30.320
And I remember one of the things you said to me in the car on the way to Wendell was we can't have self-hosted just be cloud bad, local good, because the cloud isn't all bad.

26:30.320 --> 26:34.320
And I don't wish to sit here and say that cloud is all bad at all.

26:34.320 --> 26:39.920
Just bash on Dropbox, bash on Google, bash on all these big companies, because they do offer a lot of cool stuff.

26:39.920 --> 26:46.720
But at the same time, got to draw a line somewhere, and I feel like that line is inching, inching.

26:46.720 --> 26:50.720
It's moving like the border in Georgia.

26:50.720 --> 27:03.920
I think the part that's really shifted is the automatic just batching up and transferring of your Google account to the authorities where they can review your chat history with your wife and your friends to see all the stupid stuff you said for the last 15 years.

27:03.920 --> 27:07.520
I think that's where the line got crossed, and that's the new calculus.

27:07.520 --> 27:10.320
And that's why I'm willing to look at things like image.

27:10.320 --> 27:15.120
Yeah, I'm looking, you know, I'm looking, does he take GitHub sponsorships?

27:15.120 --> 27:16.720
You know, I'm looking at this.

27:16.720 --> 27:19.920
I don't like the buy me a coffee stuff.

27:19.920 --> 27:23.920
His work is worth more than a cup of coffee.

27:23.920 --> 27:25.920
I also don't like calling it a tip.

27:25.920 --> 27:27.120
It's not a tip.

27:27.120 --> 27:28.720
He's working really hard.

27:28.720 --> 27:35.920
In fact, he even says in this Reddit thread that he posted, he likes he'd like to be able to do this full time because he thinks it's a full time job.

27:35.920 --> 27:37.920
And I agree after using it.

27:37.920 --> 27:46.720
The reason I got sad is I realized this is a massive undertaking like huge.

27:46.720 --> 27:51.120
I didn't I didn't really connect with it until I actually used it in its current state, which is super early.

27:51.120 --> 27:57.920
And he says right here, you know, he'd love some more get up sponsorships because he would love to eventually work on this project full time.

27:57.920 --> 27:59.920
I think he's going to need to.

27:59.920 --> 28:04.720
And I don't know if there is the will out there to sponsor something like this.

28:04.720 --> 28:05.520
Maybe that's changed.

28:05.520 --> 28:10.320
I don't love that it's going to be through a GitHub sponsorship or the buy me a coffee thing.

28:10.320 --> 28:12.720
I wish it was a better system than that.

28:12.720 --> 28:23.120
If only there was a free and open decentralized way to send people money that wasn't under the control of capricious tech companies that have lots of things to protect.

28:23.120 --> 28:24.720
What could that be, Chris?

28:24.720 --> 28:28.720
I don't know, Alex. I don't know.

28:28.720 --> 28:33.520
Leno.com slash SSH.

28:33.520 --> 28:36.720
Go there to get a hundred dollars in 60 day credit on your new account.

28:36.720 --> 28:39.920
It's a great way to support the show while checking out something really awesome.

28:39.920 --> 28:43.920
It is the Geeks Cloud with 11 data centers around the world.

28:43.920 --> 28:51.120
They've been hard at work for nearly 19 years, creating the best experience to run your applications on Linux in the cloud under your control.

28:51.120 --> 28:53.520
This is my go to cloud platform.

28:53.520 --> 28:58.720
It is a model in which they have actual support.

28:58.720 --> 29:00.720
I love this about Linode.

29:00.720 --> 29:06.720
But on top of that, they've continued to invest in their hardware aggressively over that 19 years.

29:06.720 --> 29:11.120
In this last few months, MVME storage has been rolled out to the rigs.

29:11.120 --> 29:14.720
They're constantly updating the CPUs as new models become available.

29:14.720 --> 29:17.920
They are their own ISP, so they always have the optimal routes.

29:17.920 --> 29:25.520
And then they have a bunch of really great services like S3 compatible object storage, which can really change your offsite game.

29:25.520 --> 29:33.120
Easy to use API with lots of libraries that you can take advantage of, cloud firewalls, physical boxes if that's your thing.

29:33.120 --> 29:38.720
I mean, there's really like a thousand reasons I could list.

29:38.720 --> 29:43.120
I think that's why they did the hundred bucks, because then you can just go there and try it yourself and see what I'm talking about.

29:43.120 --> 29:44.320
The performance is incredible.

29:44.320 --> 29:46.720
I wouldn't host JB's new website anywhere else.

29:46.720 --> 29:49.920
And the other thing I love about Linode is they get the big picture.

29:49.920 --> 29:51.520
They invest in the community.

29:51.520 --> 29:53.520
You know, they're making our road trip possible.

29:53.520 --> 29:55.120
They're making these meetups possible.

29:55.120 --> 29:56.320
They're supplying the swag.

29:56.320 --> 30:00.320
They're not going to make a million bucks off us taking a road trip to go meet the audience.

30:00.320 --> 30:04.720
They're investing in the community because they know long term that pays dividends.

30:04.720 --> 30:07.920
After you've used Linode for a minute, you'll understand.

30:07.920 --> 30:11.520
If you're like me, you'll also start to use some of the more advanced features as well.

30:11.520 --> 30:13.120
And then you're really going to love it.

30:13.120 --> 30:19.920
So for the best customer support, super fast rigs, super fast networking and a Linux culture that runs deep.

30:19.920 --> 30:22.720
Those are just some of the reasons I choose to use Linode.

30:22.720 --> 30:24.320
I think you'll find your own.

30:24.320 --> 30:26.320
Go get that hundred bucks and try it.

30:26.320 --> 30:28.720
Put it over the top, kick the tires.

30:28.720 --> 30:31.120
Linode.com slash SSH.

30:31.120 --> 30:33.920
Support the show, get a hundred dollars to try out something awesome.

30:33.920 --> 30:37.520
That's Linode.com slash SSH.

30:37.520 --> 30:46.320
So it was our third birthday this week, Home Assistant also celebrates a birthday nine years old.

30:46.320 --> 30:47.920
That's impressive.

30:47.920 --> 30:48.320
Yep.

30:48.320 --> 30:53.120
September 17th, 2013, Paulus made his first commit for Home Assistant.

30:53.120 --> 31:00.720
And then today they announced as we record version 22.9, which is their birthday release.

31:00.720 --> 31:05.120
They've revamped the automation screen.

31:05.120 --> 31:10.920
I don't know if you've had a chance to look at it, but they now have collapsible cards for triggers, conditions and actions.

31:10.920 --> 31:18.320
And they also have an overflow menu where they've moved some of the less common use things and some of the more frequently commonly used things.

31:18.320 --> 31:20.320
But it is a nicer UI overall.

31:20.320 --> 31:23.920
And they've added a new weekly schedule calendar element.

31:23.920 --> 31:29.920
So you can actually you get a seven day calendar and you can draw on there like it's your meeting calendar.

31:29.920 --> 31:31.220
So that's kind of nice.

31:31.220 --> 31:35.820
It's actually it looks like a pretty clever way to to solve that particular problem.

31:35.820 --> 31:38.920
Big revamp in the UI, Alex.

31:38.920 --> 31:40.420
I updated today.

31:40.420 --> 31:43.720
I don't really notice a difference, but I haven't built an automation since.

31:43.720 --> 31:45.520
You updated to a dot zero release.

31:45.520 --> 31:47.420
You are raw dog.

31:47.420 --> 31:49.020
You are braver than I.

31:49.020 --> 31:50.420
I do it for the show.

31:50.420 --> 31:51.820
I do it so you don't have to.

31:51.820 --> 31:52.120
Right.

31:52.120 --> 31:52.720
Yes, that's right.

31:52.720 --> 32:00.020
I do remember saying to you before the show that when stuff breaks, I think we call that content in the business, right?

32:00.020 --> 32:01.320
That's probably true.

32:01.320 --> 32:02.620
There was a lot of talk.

32:02.620 --> 32:09.920
I watched the release announcement, which is like long and there was a lot of talk in there about improvements to Bluetooth.

32:09.920 --> 32:10.720
Bluetooth speed.

32:10.720 --> 32:16.120
If you're using they stress, you really need to be using home assistant OS to take advantage of all these improvements.

32:16.120 --> 32:22.420
But a lot of speed improvements for Bluetooth communication esp to 32 devices can be used as Bluetooth proxies.

32:22.420 --> 32:29.120
Home assistant is actually now selling some Bluetooth proxies easy for me to say in their online store.

32:29.120 --> 32:33.520
Big improvements for Bluetooth devices and they think it's going to open up to a lot more devices.

32:33.520 --> 32:34.220
Wow, nice.

32:34.220 --> 32:35.520
Yeah, it is nice.

32:35.520 --> 32:36.920
That's a good area to improve.

32:36.920 --> 32:41.120
If only you had received your home assistant yellow by now though, huh?

32:41.120 --> 32:49.420
It was supposed to be here yesterday, but I got an updated email saying it should promptly arrive after I've been gone for about a week on the road.

32:49.420 --> 32:51.120
So I'll have to wait till I get back.

32:51.120 --> 32:52.620
I guess one of these days.

32:52.620 --> 32:54.620
We'll do a show and we'll be able to actually review it.

32:54.620 --> 32:58.420
Whereas all the YouTube has had theirs like a year ago.

32:58.420 --> 33:00.020
Yeah, maybe ours will be like a better though.

33:00.020 --> 33:01.820
It'll be like the final edition.

33:01.820 --> 33:03.320
Yeah, maybe the shipping one.

33:03.320 --> 33:04.120
Maybe productive.

33:04.120 --> 33:04.820
What do they call it?

33:04.820 --> 33:09.320
Like a production sample, not an engineering sample, right, right.

33:09.320 --> 33:16.020
ZigBee users are going to be happy to know that there's now a ZigBee backup and restore option in home assistant.

33:16.020 --> 33:17.120
So that's actually really nice.

33:17.120 --> 33:17.720
That's you.

33:17.720 --> 33:19.420
You're a ZigBee user these days.

33:19.420 --> 33:20.020
I am now.

33:20.020 --> 33:28.220
I'm a big ZigBee guy now, don't you know and it turns out I didn't realize this but I would have been so well if I had to if I had done like a

33:28.220 --> 33:32.520
restore of home assistant on like maybe on a new device or something.

33:32.520 --> 33:35.320
I guess none of my ZigBee stuff would have worked.

33:35.320 --> 33:40.320
I had not even realized that nor had I to be literally just said that I know.

33:40.320 --> 33:41.620
Thank you, Chris.

33:41.620 --> 33:42.620
Good to know, right?

33:42.620 --> 33:46.620
They now have fixed that and you can back up and restore your ZigBee stuff.

33:46.620 --> 33:50.320
But also they now have a really slick migration assistant.

33:50.320 --> 33:55.120
If you just maybe like want to move to a new radio, you want to upgrade your ZigBee radio for some reason.

33:55.120 --> 33:58.920
They'll handle all that migration stuff because I guess some of that's written to the controller.

33:58.920 --> 34:03.020
I think that's really neat to see there because ZigBee is going to be the future.

34:03.020 --> 34:03.820
We'll see.

34:03.820 --> 34:06.820
They did actually do some updates to the Z-Wave support as well.

34:06.820 --> 34:13.420
I did see the verge pick up this week that they were doing they were controlling a home kit compatible.

34:13.420 --> 34:17.820
I think that the headline was this is why it matters.

34:17.820 --> 34:22.620
Well, I can control home kit from somewhere else and I was like, yeah, okay good headline chaps.

34:22.620 --> 34:24.020
Well done.

34:24.020 --> 34:27.520
I might have grabbed a matter related story for the member post show.

34:27.520 --> 34:28.120
Oh, yeah.

34:28.120 --> 34:28.520
Okay.

34:28.520 --> 34:29.520
I can't wait to get there.

34:29.520 --> 34:33.620
I may have I may have also there's just been a few UI updates.

34:33.620 --> 34:36.720
You can see a processor and memory usage in the home assistant UI,

34:36.720 --> 34:41.120
which is nice for people using it on a hardware device and then a couple integrations.

34:41.120 --> 34:43.020
There's so much more in the release announcements.

34:43.020 --> 34:46.620
These are just my highlights but a couple integrations that caught my eye.

34:46.620 --> 34:51.820
The Android IP webcam app is now available as an integration into home assistant.

34:51.820 --> 34:54.620
So you can easily set up tablets that you're using as a dashboard

34:54.620 --> 35:01.720
or your Android phones as cameras that feed into home assistant now super easy to do that slick.

35:01.720 --> 35:06.020
And then also there's an integration now for the fully kiosk browser.

35:06.020 --> 35:10.020
So if you're using a tablet with the fully kiosk browser to display home assistant,

35:10.020 --> 35:17.020
there's now an integration that allows you to control certain things get information about the tablet

35:17.020 --> 35:23.020
like its battery level what current page is displaying how much RAM is available.

35:23.020 --> 35:26.520
You can also do things like you can remotely refresh the kiosk page.

35:26.520 --> 35:28.020
Bring it to the front lock the device.

35:28.020 --> 35:32.120
You can turn motion detection on and off the screensaver on and off from home assistant.

35:32.120 --> 35:36.320
Now for your Android tablets that you might have around your house

35:36.320 --> 35:40.520
or should have around your house acting as a dashboard for home assistant.

35:40.520 --> 35:42.020
I just think that's a neat integration.

35:42.020 --> 35:43.720
That is a really cool integration.

35:43.720 --> 35:47.420
I was I had one of those aha moments with home assistant this week

35:47.420 --> 35:53.520
when I have bought a new an Elgato key light to make my face look more beautiful,

35:53.520 --> 35:59.020
you know from from my camera for those of you listening on audio makes zero difference,

35:59.020 --> 36:03.620
of course, but for the live stream, I mean you can see how many gray hairs I have.

36:03.620 --> 36:06.020
That's just what brings the people to Jupiter tube Alex.

36:06.020 --> 36:07.320
That's what it is. Exactly.

36:07.320 --> 36:13.320
Yeah, but when I plugged in this Elgato light it connected to my network via the app on my phone

36:13.320 --> 36:16.820
and then within a minute or two home assistant picked it up

36:16.820 --> 36:19.020
and was like there's an Elgato integration.

36:19.020 --> 36:20.620
Do you want to enable it and I was like click?

36:20.620 --> 36:26.020
Yes, I do boom boom done moments like that remind me that actually this stuff super cool.

36:26.020 --> 36:30.020
I love that had the same experience obviously with the Shelly devices,

36:30.020 --> 36:35.820
you know, they just get on the Wi-Fi network and boom home assistant just sees it.

36:35.820 --> 36:37.320
You know, you click a button.

36:37.320 --> 36:42.120
I just set up another Shelly smart plug on my test bench upstairs.

36:42.120 --> 36:45.320
I have a super secret rig that I'm testing right now.

36:45.320 --> 36:51.920
And so one of the things that I do in my test is I want to know what the power usage is in various scenarios.

36:51.920 --> 36:56.620
And I you know, I used to have what I used to do Alex is I used to get a kilowatt.

36:56.620 --> 37:01.020
I don't know if you've seen these kilowatt devices and then I would just I would I would run a benchmark

37:01.020 --> 37:04.220
and I would walk over to the kilowatt and I would write down with the power usage was right

37:04.220 --> 37:09.320
and then when the benchmark and I'd walk over to the kilowatt right down with the power usage was

37:09.320 --> 37:12.220
and now with the Shelly I just pull it into home assistant

37:12.220 --> 37:14.820
and then I can just look back over the entire,

37:14.820 --> 37:19.420
you know review period and see what the power usage was and you know,

37:19.420 --> 37:22.020
that's so freaking valuable for me.

37:22.020 --> 37:24.720
So there's a lot of interesting ways you can use home assistant.

37:24.720 --> 37:28.820
Are you exporting any of this stuff to influx so you could do historical data?

37:28.820 --> 37:33.220
It's a good idea. There's a there's an exporter built into home assistant that you can enable

37:33.220 --> 37:38.620
which will ship out that data to influx DB, which is a time series database.

37:38.620 --> 37:42.020
And then you could put if you if you wanted to a Grafana front end in front of that

37:42.020 --> 37:47.620
and make pretty graphs or query it based on whatever, you know query logic you want to use.

37:47.620 --> 37:50.620
So I found that very useful for stuff like hard drive data where I want to know

37:50.620 --> 37:54.920
what the temperatures were from season to season so I can actually look

37:54.920 --> 38:01.020
and see on average how warm or cool my my basement is just simply based on the fact

38:01.020 --> 38:04.820
that my hard drives are 10 degrees warmer on average in the summer than they are in the winter.

38:04.820 --> 38:07.420
That's a great idea. I'd love to know that data.

38:07.420 --> 38:11.220
I don't care so much for the bench stuff, but boy for dupes with influx.

38:11.220 --> 38:16.120
You've got to be careful though because it's writing constantly obviously not an SD card.

38:16.120 --> 38:19.820
Otherwise that will burn out pretty dang quick peely.

38:19.820 --> 38:24.920
Yeah, so I don't know just some kind of SSD or something is probably the way to go for that.

38:24.920 --> 38:29.720
That's a good tip. I have one other like home assistant related tip.

38:29.720 --> 38:35.620
If you have hacks, which do you still use hacks at all on the HACS community store, right?

38:35.620 --> 38:37.820
Yeah, the home assistant community store.

38:37.820 --> 38:42.320
I believe I don't remember if it's in there or if you have to go find the repo,

38:42.320 --> 38:46.220
but there is a tail scale integration now.

38:46.220 --> 38:51.920
So my home assistant blue has tail scale

38:51.920 --> 38:53.920
and I you know, when you're on the home assistant OS,

38:53.920 --> 38:57.020
it's not like you can just SSH in and install the tail scale package

38:57.020 --> 38:59.720
and get it on your tail scale network.

38:59.720 --> 39:05.720
And I already have one home assistant system that is subscribed to Nebuchadnezzar cloud.

39:05.720 --> 39:10.420
And I don't know how to have two different home assistant systems on one Nebuchadnezzar cloud account.

39:10.420 --> 39:14.620
So instead of getting two Nebuchadnezzar cloud accounts with two different email addresses,

39:14.620 --> 39:20.020
I just put one home assistant on tail scale and it's working great.

39:20.020 --> 39:24.020
It's better than that darling. It's an official add-on these days.

39:24.020 --> 39:26.820
Is it? Well, there you go.

39:26.820 --> 39:31.820
I have to say it's been working really well for me and it's how I am doing remote control

39:31.820 --> 39:35.220
of one of my home assistant instances now and I give it a big thumbs up.

39:35.220 --> 39:38.420
Not a sponsored thing, just telling you this is one of the things I've done recently.

39:38.420 --> 39:41.420
I still think it's worth paying for Nebuchadnezzar if you don't.

39:41.420 --> 39:44.920
So I'm not saying avoid paying.

39:44.920 --> 39:49.520
I just didn't want to have two accounts, although I did consider it actually.

39:49.520 --> 39:50.520
I did consider doing it,

39:50.520 --> 39:53.620
but I just didn't want to have to manage it with two different logins and all that kind of stuff.

39:53.620 --> 40:00.120
So Lord Pandemic asks in the chat room, anyone know if you can use Nebuchadnezzar and tail scale at the same time?

40:00.120 --> 40:02.520
And so I think the answer to that would be yes.

40:02.520 --> 40:05.120
With tail scale, if you use the split DNS functionality,

40:05.120 --> 40:09.920
so let's say you have a specific subdomain you use just for your LAN stuff.

40:09.920 --> 40:14.020
For me, I have a couple of letters which delineate the site that I'm at, for example.

40:14.020 --> 40:18.720
So, you know, let's just say AB would be site one and CD would be site two.

40:18.720 --> 40:22.720
So it'd be ab.domain.com and cd.domain.com.

40:22.720 --> 40:28.820
And in tail scale, you can go into their magic DNS settings and do what's called split DNS

40:28.820 --> 40:36.020
and actually have tail scale route to the specific DNS server in that local subnet in that location

40:36.020 --> 40:40.320
and look up the home assistant domain name in your LAN that way.

40:40.320 --> 40:46.220
But if you're also paying for Nebuchadnezzar, you've pretty much got it open to the internet anyway.

40:46.220 --> 40:49.920
I know it's obfuscated through a long series of letters and numbers,

40:49.920 --> 40:54.520
but it's security through obscurity, that one, and it's open to anybody.

40:54.520 --> 40:58.920
So if you're worried about people accessing your home assistant remotely,

40:58.920 --> 41:04.520
maybe the Nebuchadnezzar thing isn't the remote access portion of it anyway, isn't the way to do that.

41:04.520 --> 41:08.020
Maybe tail scale is, but I'll leave that up to the listener.

41:08.020 --> 41:15.920
And there is one key difference between the community tail scale version that I'm using and the official add-on.

41:15.920 --> 41:22.120
So the official add-on is kind of like a control panel for your devices in tail scale,

41:22.120 --> 41:27.820
but it does not put your home assistant instance on the tail scale network.

41:27.820 --> 41:32.620
So the community edition actually puts the machine on the network.

41:32.620 --> 41:38.520
That's the difference. And you need that if you have a home assistant OS based system.

41:38.520 --> 41:41.920
If you're just, you know, rolling your own OS and then, you know,

41:41.920 --> 41:48.320
doing like container version of home assistant, you just install tail scale on the base OS like you normally would and it'd be fine.

41:48.320 --> 41:52.820
I'll put a link to both of them in the show notes so you can, you know, pick and choose the one that works best for you.

41:52.820 --> 41:54.820
Because if you got like the Nebuchadnezzar cloud thing,

41:54.820 --> 41:58.820
then you probably just want the tail scale control panel where you can control devices and stuff.

41:58.820 --> 42:02.420
But if you don't have Nebuchadnezzar yet or you got an additional home assistant box,

42:02.420 --> 42:09.220
you might want the full tail scale stuff. For that, you're going to need the community add-ons.

42:09.220 --> 42:17.020
humio.com slash H C E. That's where you go to ingest all of your logs in one place.

42:17.020 --> 42:20.920
Humio is a centralized log management and observability platform.

42:20.920 --> 42:26.820
The company was founded by developers in Denmark in 2016 as an alternative to legacy logging solutions

42:26.820 --> 42:32.420
that make it cost prohibitive to ingest and search tons of logs.

42:32.420 --> 42:35.420
I mean, you know how many logs just one of your boxes produce these days.

42:35.420 --> 42:39.420
What if you threw all of your systems in there? That's the real beauty of Humio,

42:39.420 --> 42:43.020
is it takes the logs from any source and it makes them usable.

42:43.020 --> 42:47.820
You don't have to constantly massage the format. You don't need to provide it a schema.

42:47.820 --> 42:53.520
You just pump them all into Humio and they're there when you need them with a great dashboard.

42:53.520 --> 42:55.520
And their platform is crazy fast.

42:55.520 --> 42:59.620
Humio's index-free architecture means you can ingest over a petabyte of data per day

42:59.620 --> 43:03.320
and then search that data with sub-second latency.

43:03.320 --> 43:08.820
But I'll tell you what, I think the best way to get going with Humio is probably the Community Edition.

43:08.820 --> 43:14.820
Humio Community Edition is the largest no-cost data ingestion offering on the market today,

43:14.820 --> 43:18.820
allowing you to ingest up to 16 gigs per day with seven-day retention.

43:18.820 --> 43:21.820
It's not a trial period. You get it for the long haul.

43:21.820 --> 43:24.520
This is perfect for self-hosters who are maybe trying to do a little troubleshooting,

43:24.520 --> 43:27.820
figuring out what's going on. Maybe you want to put all your devices in there

43:27.820 --> 43:30.320
and get a view on your entire environment at once.

43:30.320 --> 43:33.320
So much simpler when you're trying to troubleshoot.

43:33.320 --> 43:38.320
Actually going to every place to check every log, especially when you're dealing with Home Assistant.

43:38.320 --> 43:42.320
Now, yeah, it'll also take your Home Assistant logs.

43:42.320 --> 43:45.320
It's great. You could use it to monitor power consumption.

43:45.320 --> 43:47.320
You could use it to monitor the health of your system.

43:47.320 --> 43:50.320
You could use it to monitor your system log and more.

43:50.320 --> 43:52.320
And the best part is, Humio just figures it out.

43:52.320 --> 43:54.820
So go try the Community Edition. It's awesome.

43:54.820 --> 43:57.320
We already have listeners out there that are trying it out right now.

43:57.320 --> 44:00.320
Some of them out and they're off-grid setups. Very jealous.

44:00.320 --> 44:02.320
It's such a great system.

44:02.320 --> 44:05.320
And the best part is, you get that forever.

44:05.320 --> 44:07.820
That seven-day retention, 16 gigs per day.

44:07.820 --> 44:12.320
But you got to get started by going to humio.com slash H-C-E.

44:12.320 --> 44:14.320
That's the Community Edition. It's free.

44:14.320 --> 44:17.320
humio.com slash H-C-E.

44:19.320 --> 44:22.320
I did something I should never do today.

44:22.320 --> 44:23.320
Smoke crack?

44:23.320 --> 44:26.320
I updated to the iOS 16 beta.

44:26.320 --> 44:27.320
Oh, you did?

44:27.320 --> 44:29.320
It's the release candidate, in fairness.

44:29.320 --> 44:32.320
I put that on my iPad. I didn't dare put it on the phone.

44:32.320 --> 44:33.320
It's nice.

44:33.320 --> 44:34.320
Yeah?

44:34.320 --> 44:35.320
It works well.

44:35.320 --> 44:37.320
I just wanted that lock screen. I just wanted to try out the...

44:37.320 --> 44:38.320
Sure.

44:38.320 --> 44:40.320
Literally, I just wanted to try the lock screen.

44:40.320 --> 44:43.320
Yeah, it's always nice to know what apps might need updating or might break, too.

44:43.320 --> 44:46.320
You know, if you got the ability.

44:46.320 --> 44:47.320
And you work from home.

44:47.320 --> 44:50.320
My favorite feature so far is the battery percentage.

44:50.320 --> 44:51.320
Really?

44:51.320 --> 44:52.320
That's it.

44:52.320 --> 44:57.320
Oh, Apple. They give it so, so slowly.

44:57.320 --> 44:59.320
They really do.

44:59.320 --> 45:02.320
Yeah, the iPhone 14 has always on display.

45:02.320 --> 45:04.320
And I jokingly said to a buddy of mine,

45:04.320 --> 45:06.320
Yeah, welcome to 2014.

45:06.320 --> 45:09.320
Yeah, my Pixel 3 has that.

45:09.320 --> 45:10.320
Yeah.

45:10.320 --> 45:13.320
Now, the satellite calling actually kind of legit.

45:13.320 --> 45:14.320
That's pretty cool.

45:14.320 --> 45:15.320
Yeah.

45:15.320 --> 45:18.320
I could see, you know, even though I'm not like some extreme hiker,

45:18.320 --> 45:20.320
I could see being on a back road somewhere

45:20.320 --> 45:22.320
and, you know, need to make an emergency call.

45:22.320 --> 45:25.320
Or you're in the middle of nowhere in your RV,

45:25.320 --> 45:27.320
and there's a couple of dodgy looking dudes coming your way.

45:27.320 --> 45:28.320
You know what I'm saying?

45:28.320 --> 45:30.320
Yeah, that has happened. You're right.

45:30.320 --> 45:34.320
And the thing is, is they said that it's not only going to be restricted to emergency calling.

45:34.320 --> 45:39.320
Like, there'll be some other limited functionality like you can use Find My with it.

45:39.320 --> 45:40.320
So, if you needed some...

45:40.320 --> 45:43.320
Oh, could I order a pizza to the middle of Death Valley?

45:43.320 --> 45:45.320
Probably. Yeah, I think you probably could.

45:45.320 --> 45:47.320
I hope so. Otherwise, what a waste.

45:47.320 --> 45:49.320
I wonder what the delivery fees would be for that.

45:49.320 --> 45:53.320
What you do is you sign up for DoorDash.

45:53.320 --> 45:54.320
You get the free membership delivery.

45:54.320 --> 45:57.320
Right. Yes, life hack.

45:57.320 --> 45:58.320
Hey, you know what?

45:58.320 --> 46:02.320
Maybe we'll order a pizza at our Airbnb because the crew is getting together.

46:02.320 --> 46:03.320
We have meetups coming up,

46:03.320 --> 46:10.320
and the Jupiter Broadcasting crew is renting an Airbnb next to JPL.

46:10.320 --> 46:12.320
So, we have a whole series of meetups along the West Coast,

46:12.320 --> 46:19.320
meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting, including one in Southern California near JPL.

46:19.320 --> 46:20.320
Oh, I am so excited.

46:20.320 --> 46:22.320
We got the JPL tour.

46:22.320 --> 46:24.320
We got the roadshow.

46:24.320 --> 46:27.320
You know, somehow I talked Brenton to join us again, or he talked me.

46:27.320 --> 46:28.320
I'm not exactly sure.

46:28.320 --> 46:32.320
This is one of those events that I can't quite believe is actually really happening.

46:32.320 --> 46:37.320
Like, it's just too cool for just a bunch of dudes, right?

46:37.320 --> 46:39.320
It is too cool.

46:39.320 --> 46:40.320
I'm really excited about it.

46:40.320 --> 46:42.320
I'm also excited about all the meetups along the way.

46:42.320 --> 46:44.320
We're going to do some geocache stashing.

46:44.320 --> 46:47.320
So, even if people can't make it to the meetup, if they're in that area later on,

46:47.320 --> 46:50.320
they might be able to go find like a swag bag or a box or something.

46:50.320 --> 46:53.320
We're going to have shirts and some Linode plushes.

46:53.320 --> 46:56.320
If you bump into a wild Brent at any of these meetups,

46:56.320 --> 47:01.320
I did seed him with a few of those self-hosted stickers I made for London that were left over.

47:01.320 --> 47:06.320
So, meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting for these meetups and future ones.

47:06.320 --> 47:07.320
We will have future ones.

47:07.320 --> 47:12.320
And then we also have – we have what's called a space in Matrix.

47:12.320 --> 47:14.320
It's like a way to organize several rooms together.

47:14.320 --> 47:17.320
And we have what's called a meetup Matrix space.

47:17.320 --> 47:20.320
So, we have a chat room for Raleigh near Alex.

47:20.320 --> 47:23.320
We have a chat room for Ohio for the Ohio Linux Fest.

47:23.320 --> 47:24.320
We have a chat room for London.

47:24.320 --> 47:26.320
We have a chat room for the West Coast.

47:26.320 --> 47:28.320
As we go, as we build out, we'll just add more chat rooms.

47:28.320 --> 47:35.320
So, eventually, we'll probably have different East Coast and Central and I don't know, Australia.

47:35.320 --> 47:37.320
I mean, no, it just kind of depends as we kind of spread out.

47:37.320 --> 47:38.320
We'll build different ones.

47:38.320 --> 47:39.320
You joke.

47:39.320 --> 47:43.320
We've had people in Matrix asking about an Australian meetup.

47:43.320 --> 47:46.320
Does anybody know of a self-hosted meetup app that we can run?

47:46.320 --> 47:49.320
Because I think we need to just – we just need to bite the bullet

47:49.320 --> 47:52.320
and let people, you know, start setting up their own meetups, Alex.

47:52.320 --> 47:53.320
True.

47:53.320 --> 47:54.320
Right?

47:54.320 --> 47:55.320
I think that'd be pretty cool.

47:55.320 --> 47:57.320
If anybody does know, send it in.

47:57.320 --> 47:58.320
That'd be great.

47:58.320 --> 48:00.320
We got some boosts into the show.

48:00.320 --> 48:03.320
Our first one comes in from the Linux Trucker, 30,000 SATs.

48:03.320 --> 48:07.320
He says, I was listening to the latest show and I wanted to write in with my experience with ZigBee.

48:07.320 --> 48:12.320
The first thing you bullshit do is switch over to ZigBee to MQTT.

48:12.320 --> 48:15.320
It's so much better than ZHA.

48:15.320 --> 48:17.320
It makes adding a new device a breeze.

48:17.320 --> 48:20.320
Second, the Aquare brand is top notch.

48:20.320 --> 48:24.320
In fact, the Aquare buttons are way better than the Tradfy ones.

48:24.320 --> 48:25.320
Or is it Tradify?

48:25.320 --> 48:27.320
How do you say that, do you suppose, Alex?

48:27.320 --> 48:28.320
Tradfy?

48:28.320 --> 48:32.320
I say Tradfree, but I have no – it's like,

48:32.320 --> 48:38.320
when I first read Harry Potter, I read Hermione or Hermione for like three years.

48:38.320 --> 48:39.320
So don't ask me.

48:39.320 --> 48:40.320
I have no idea.

48:40.320 --> 48:41.320
You've never said it out loud?

48:41.320 --> 48:42.320
Okay.

48:42.320 --> 48:44.320
He also says the contact sensors are phenomenal.

48:44.320 --> 48:46.320
I just wanted to let you know about a little gem I found.

48:46.320 --> 48:49.320
It's called the KiwiSet cover kit.

48:49.320 --> 48:54.320
It will connect with any deadbolt and turn it into a ZigBee lock.

48:54.320 --> 48:56.320
Forget the August and all the other expensive ones.

48:56.320 --> 48:57.320
This is a game changer.

48:57.320 --> 49:00.320
You keep your existing locks, you keep your existing keys,

49:00.320 --> 49:02.320
you just make them ZigBee.

49:02.320 --> 49:06.320
It uses AA batteries and it works all the time.

49:06.320 --> 49:09.320
I'm sometimes gone overnight for a few days,

49:09.320 --> 49:13.320
and anything smart I put in my home has always managed to break before I get back.

49:13.320 --> 49:17.320
But the Aquare and the KiwiSet are both very reliable.

49:17.320 --> 49:19.320
Thanks for the show.

49:19.320 --> 49:21.320
Well, that's some really great recommendations, Linux Trucker.

49:21.320 --> 49:22.320
Thank you.

49:22.320 --> 49:27.320
Yeah, I need to make sure I'm grabbing devices that can be gone for a while

49:27.320 --> 49:30.320
and reconnect because sometimes things go offline and I don't get to it for a few days,

49:30.320 --> 49:33.320
or I leave an area and leave a device behind.

49:33.320 --> 49:34.320
That's good to know.

49:34.320 --> 49:36.320
I don't know about going to MQTT though.

49:36.320 --> 49:40.320
Well, I don't really add a device to my ZigBee network all that often.

49:40.320 --> 49:48.320
I mean, I go through phases where I add a dozen at once and then nothing for six months.

49:48.320 --> 49:49.320
And that's fairly simple.

49:49.320 --> 49:51.320
You turn the Add to Network thing on.

49:51.320 --> 49:53.320
It stays just in discovery mode.

49:53.320 --> 49:55.320
You plug it in or whatever.

49:55.320 --> 49:56.320
You tap the button.

49:56.320 --> 49:57.320
I mean, it's not that hard.

49:57.320 --> 49:58.320
I don't know what I'm missing.

49:58.320 --> 50:00.320
I feel like I should try it for science.

50:00.320 --> 50:04.320
But again, everything's just working, so I don't want to jinx it.

50:04.320 --> 50:07.320
So why has Papa John boosted him with 10,000 SATs?

50:07.320 --> 50:10.320
He wants an update on your thoughts on iPhone versus Android.

50:10.320 --> 50:12.320
He says he knows we've talked about this before,

50:12.320 --> 50:15.320
but he's looking at a Pixel phone currently,

50:15.320 --> 50:17.320
and he's having a hard time choosing between Android and iOS

50:17.320 --> 50:21.320
because he needs a second phone for some personal applications he's going to be using.

50:21.320 --> 50:23.320
He's been in the Android ecosystem for years,

50:23.320 --> 50:25.320
but he's not opposed to trying the fruit.

50:25.320 --> 50:27.320
So he wants our thoughts.

50:27.320 --> 50:30.320
And you're the most recent Android convert,

50:30.320 --> 50:32.320
so I'm curious what your update is.

50:32.320 --> 50:34.320
Well, I've still got my OnePlus 7T knocking around.

50:34.320 --> 50:42.320
It's actually just my sofa phone because I much prefer the Reddit client for Android,

50:42.320 --> 50:44.320
which is called Boost that I used to use.

50:44.320 --> 50:45.320
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

50:45.320 --> 50:47.320
I can't let that pass.

50:47.320 --> 50:49.320
Your sofa phone, Alex?

50:49.320 --> 50:50.320
That's amazing.

50:50.320 --> 50:52.320
Well, here's the thing.

50:52.320 --> 50:55.320
If I was to sell it, it's only worth like $70 or $80,

50:55.320 --> 50:58.320
so I'd just rather keep it.

50:58.320 --> 51:00.320
I've got a sofa laptop, right?

51:00.320 --> 51:01.320
It's an old laptop.

51:01.320 --> 51:03.320
It's nothing fancy.

51:03.320 --> 51:04.320
I'm not going to throw it away, though.

51:04.320 --> 51:07.320
It still browsers the web, so I'm just giving you a hard time.

51:07.320 --> 51:10.320
In terms of feature parity and stuff like that,

51:10.320 --> 51:13.320
I mean, there's a few headline features,

51:13.320 --> 51:15.320
like if you want to watch a smartwatch,

51:15.320 --> 51:17.320
then there's only really one game in town.

51:17.320 --> 51:21.320
If you want to integrate with your laptop and your tablet

51:21.320 --> 51:24.320
and AirPods and all that kind of stuff,

51:24.320 --> 51:31.320
there's only really truly one game in town that's actually worth the prices they charge.

51:31.320 --> 51:34.320
From a usability perspective on both platforms,

51:34.320 --> 51:36.320
they've each got their quirks.

51:36.320 --> 51:43.320
I really still strongly dislike the new Google Material UI that they went with.

51:43.320 --> 51:48.320
Those used to have five or six quick settings along the top in Android 10 and 11.

51:48.320 --> 51:55.320
I thought that was a perfect balance and blend of screen real estate to usability and functionality

51:55.320 --> 51:58.320
if you long pressed them and all that kind of stuff.

51:58.320 --> 52:02.320
I don't find Control Center on iOS to be particularly intuitive,

52:02.320 --> 52:05.320
although it does get the job done.

52:05.320 --> 52:07.320
Just the way that Google kind of took their UI,

52:07.320 --> 52:11.320
the direction they took it in last year, I think, with Android 12,

52:11.320 --> 52:13.320
I just don't like it.

52:13.320 --> 52:16.320
So it's just personal preference on whether you like the UI or not.

52:16.320 --> 52:19.320
But I think it boils down to this for me.

52:19.320 --> 52:23.320
I'm taking a lot of photos with a toddler running around,

52:23.320 --> 52:27.320
and often they're in questionable lighting situations.

52:27.320 --> 52:35.320
I've never, and I've tried a lot of Android phones from OnePluses to Samsungs to Pixels to,

52:35.320 --> 52:38.320
there's another brand whose name escapes me,

52:38.320 --> 52:43.320
and nothing really came close to the iPhone with regards to that low light performance

52:43.320 --> 52:46.320
of keeping up with a toddler.

52:46.320 --> 52:51.320
And for me, the camera at the moment, as a fairly new parent,

52:51.320 --> 52:55.320
is the most important thing about the device I have with me all the time.

52:55.320 --> 52:59.320
Everything else I can kind of make do and kind of make work,

52:59.320 --> 53:05.320
and it doesn't quite feel as comfortable on iOS even a year in or so,

53:05.320 --> 53:08.320
because I think I switched around Christmas.

53:08.320 --> 53:10.320
But it's fine. It's good enough.

53:10.320 --> 53:12.320
I can get everything done that I need to get done,

53:12.320 --> 53:15.320
all my messaging is through Telegram and other places.

53:15.320 --> 53:21.320
So switching from one platform to the other these days is really not a big deal.

53:21.320 --> 53:25.320
It might feel like it before you do it, because I certainly felt that way.

53:25.320 --> 53:28.320
But it's just, just try it.

53:28.320 --> 53:31.320
You know, what's the worst that happens? You go back after six months.

53:31.320 --> 53:34.320
Just avoid the iMessage trap, because that can be a bit of a black hole.

53:34.320 --> 53:36.320
But yeah, I think Alex has nailed it.

53:36.320 --> 53:40.320
I also find iOS to be, on average, more stable.

53:40.320 --> 53:43.320
Apps on average to be slightly better, a little more polished,

53:43.320 --> 53:47.320
a little more performant. Generally, they're going to be native, not always.

53:47.320 --> 53:51.320
And then obviously, the privacy situation is hopefully better with Apple,

53:51.320 --> 53:54.320
but I think you could argue either way.

53:54.320 --> 53:56.320
All right, last couple of boosts.

53:56.320 --> 53:59.320
We had a blank user from Podverse boosted in.

53:59.320 --> 54:01.320
And we got this from a lot of people, so I wanted to get this in here.

54:01.320 --> 54:02.320
We did.

54:02.320 --> 54:05.320
I think I must have had about two dozen pings about this app,

54:05.320 --> 54:07.320
even though we talked about it.

54:07.320 --> 54:09.320
We just cut it from the show, unfortunately.

54:09.320 --> 54:12.320
There is an overseer fork for Jellyfin called JellySeer,

54:12.320 --> 54:15.320
and it does work great.

54:15.320 --> 54:18.320
And you know what? Fair enough.

54:18.320 --> 54:19.320
That I think is worth mentioning.

54:19.320 --> 54:24.320
We also had authorities boost in with 5,555 sat,

54:24.320 --> 54:27.320
saying, this episode has me moving from Plex to Jellyfin.

54:27.320 --> 54:31.320
But the issue is I like Plex's remote feature for listening to music on the road.

54:31.320 --> 54:35.320
What are your recommendations for streaming content from Jellyfin

54:35.320 --> 54:37.320
when outside your home network?

54:37.320 --> 54:39.320
I've come across a few articles that mention doing it with tail scale,

54:39.320 --> 54:42.320
but I'm wondering if that would actually work seamlessly with the phone.

54:42.320 --> 54:43.320
Love the show.

54:43.320 --> 54:45.320
So there is actually a couple of options here.

54:45.320 --> 54:47.320
Jellyamp is one of them.

54:47.320 --> 54:50.320
It's a web-based player that you can also use on the desktop.

54:50.320 --> 54:52.320
And it is not the same as Plexamp.

54:52.320 --> 54:53.320
I'm going to say that right up front.

54:53.320 --> 54:55.320
This is not the same.

54:55.320 --> 54:59.320
But it does kind of accomplish what you're looking for potentially.

54:59.320 --> 55:04.320
And then I think the one that really has some promise is the Jellyfin audio player,

55:04.320 --> 55:06.320
which is now in open beta testing on iOS.

55:06.320 --> 55:09.320
Now this is a local app a la Plexamp.

55:09.320 --> 55:12.320
And it actually looks really great.

55:12.320 --> 55:14.320
You got to set it for the test flight beta.

55:14.320 --> 55:16.320
And I think there is an Android build as well.

55:16.320 --> 55:18.320
But yes, there is an Android build as well.

55:18.320 --> 55:21.320
And that I think might be the way to go.

55:21.320 --> 55:24.320
So we'll put links to both of those in the show notes.

55:24.320 --> 55:28.320
This is an area I'm going to look into as well because I have decided as well,

55:28.320 --> 55:31.320
Jellyfin for me when I get back from the road trip.

55:31.320 --> 55:35.320
I'm going Jellyfin both in the RV and I'm going Jellyfin here at the studio.

55:35.320 --> 55:39.320
I appreciate all of the hard work from the guys at Plex,

55:39.320 --> 55:42.320
but I need a system that just is rock solid offline too.

55:42.320 --> 55:45.320
There's a couple more as well, of course, with all these things,

55:45.320 --> 55:47.320
particularly with Jellyfin.

55:47.320 --> 55:50.320
It seems like there's a pretty good proliferation of clients.

55:50.320 --> 55:59.320
There's one called Geli, G-E-L-L-I, as well as Finamp is another option as well.

55:59.320 --> 56:01.320
So there's lots of options with Jellyfin.

56:01.320 --> 56:03.320
I think that's really the name of the game.

56:03.320 --> 56:08.320
With Plex, it's almost like the Apple way, like this is how it is, boys.

56:08.320 --> 56:09.320
This is what you do.

56:09.320 --> 56:12.320
Whereas with Jellyfin, there's about 20 different clients

56:12.320 --> 56:14.320
you could use for different platforms.

56:14.320 --> 56:20.320
And there's one I know I'm going to have to pry from my wife's cold dead fingers,

56:20.320 --> 56:23.320
and that's Prologue, the audio book app for iOS.

56:23.320 --> 56:27.320
I'll be interested to see what Hadir makes of you switching away from Plex

56:27.320 --> 56:30.320
because I know she loves the Prologue.

56:30.320 --> 56:34.320
Oh, crap.

56:34.320 --> 56:35.320
You're right.

56:35.320 --> 56:38.320
So if anybody in the audience, that's what that sigh means,

56:38.320 --> 56:44.320
if anybody in the audience has a good audio book solution for Jellyfin

56:44.320 --> 56:48.320
that's in the same class as Prologue, let us know.

56:48.320 --> 56:50.320
And obviously, we know about audio bookshelf already

56:50.320 --> 56:54.320
because we covered that previously, so you can keep that one to yourself.

56:54.320 --> 56:58.320
But if you know something that's in the Jellyfin ecosystem,

56:58.320 --> 57:02.320
then let us know at selfhosted.show slash contact.

57:02.320 --> 57:04.320
Indeed, that would be great.

57:04.320 --> 57:05.320
You can also send us a boost.

57:05.320 --> 57:07.320
I'm trying out Podverse right now.

57:07.320 --> 57:08.320
I think it's going to stick.

57:08.320 --> 57:12.320
I like it because it's totally GPL, which I think I've just decided

57:12.320 --> 57:17.320
with all of this recently, sometimes I'm just going to pick the free software app,

57:17.320 --> 57:22.320
even if it's slightly not as optimal as maybe like say Overcast or something

57:22.320 --> 57:25.320
or, you know, Podcast Addict, I know people love that,

57:25.320 --> 57:28.320
or Antennapod, people love Antennapod's free software.

57:28.320 --> 57:31.320
But it's like, at least I'll know where to be around for a while.

57:31.320 --> 57:33.320
You know, at least I know it's not going to rug pull me.

57:33.320 --> 57:35.320
And those screw pulls are intact.

57:35.320 --> 57:37.320
And they have iOS and Android versions.

57:37.320 --> 57:38.320
I like to flip-flop sometimes.

57:38.320 --> 57:40.320
They have an F-Droid repo.

57:40.320 --> 57:41.320
I appreciate that.

57:41.320 --> 57:44.320
They got a web player, and it's embedded in the new JB website.

57:44.320 --> 57:48.320
So Podverse.fm, I think that's a great one.

57:48.320 --> 57:51.320
Also, Fountain is really great.

57:51.320 --> 57:53.320
And if you don't want to switch podcast players to Boosted,

57:53.320 --> 57:56.320
you can check out things like Albee and, of course, Breeze.

57:56.320 --> 57:58.320
We'll have links in the show notes if you want to try it out.

57:58.320 --> 58:02.320
We do get that question a surprising amount about what do you recommend as a podcast player.

58:02.320 --> 58:04.320
So for you, it's Podverse.

58:04.320 --> 58:07.320
I've been using Pocket Casts personally for many years,

58:07.320 --> 58:13.320
but I do think with all this Boost stuff, you just earn satch just for listening to other podcasts,

58:13.320 --> 58:17.320
and then you can send them to creators just as a little tip to say thank you.

58:17.320 --> 58:18.320
Yeah.

58:18.320 --> 58:20.320
In the Fountain app, check out Fountain.fm.

58:20.320 --> 58:21.320
I'll put a link.

58:21.320 --> 58:23.320
You know what, I'll put a link to my profile in Fountain.

58:23.320 --> 58:26.320
Sometimes I share clips on there and stuff, and then I get a referral bonus.

58:26.320 --> 58:28.320
How about that?

58:28.320 --> 58:33.320
Because I think this Google Photos thing, going right back to the beginning of the show,

58:33.320 --> 58:36.320
there's got to be more support for independent creators,

58:36.320 --> 58:41.320
because there was a plea you made in this week's Linux Unplugged that kind of resonated with me.

58:41.320 --> 58:43.320
I was just a lowly listener this week.

58:43.320 --> 58:48.320
I wasn't in the episode, but where you were talking about the future of independent podcasting

58:48.320 --> 58:53.320
and making a plea for people to wake up and sort of see what's happening around

58:53.320 --> 58:55.320
and not being preachy about it.

58:55.320 --> 58:59.320
Especially with dynamic ads, that's where I really think things are going sideways,

58:59.320 --> 59:05.320
is the dynamic ad companies have figured out the best thing to do would be to get on as many podcasts as possible,

59:05.320 --> 59:08.320
even tiny podcasts, and then just saturate all of them with ads,

59:08.320 --> 59:12.320
sell one sponsor across a thousand podcasts at once, and that's what they want to start doing.

59:12.320 --> 59:19.320
And so if you like content like this, you can always become a subscriber over at selfhosted.show.sre.

59:19.320 --> 59:25.320
That's obviously a very direct way to fund the JB Network and all the shows on it, including this one, of course.

59:25.320 --> 59:28.320
But there are other ways as well through the boosts.

59:28.320 --> 59:35.320
That's what they're for, that's what they're part of the show for, is to help support Chris's podcasting habit.

59:35.320 --> 59:37.320
Yeah, it might be a podcast disease now, Alex.

59:37.320 --> 59:40.320
Oh yeah, maybe. Is it graduating?

59:40.320 --> 59:46.320
I think so. I think it went from hobby to career to disease now. It's all I do. Good thing I like it.

59:46.320 --> 59:50.320
Perhaps. So we do this show live every two weeks on a Wednesday,

59:50.320 --> 59:56.320
although I think next week you might be on the road, so the live thing is potentially up for debate.

59:56.320 --> 59:57.320
We'll see when we get there.

59:57.320 --> 01:00:02.320
We'll give it a shot. Yeah, we'll try. I mean, we may have to do it offline if the bandwidth is rough,

01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:05.320
but if we can do it, we'll be at jupyter.tube on a Wednesday.

01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:12.320
And you can get that converted to your local time at our brand new, fancy, shiny website, jupyterbroadcasting.com.

01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:20.320
That's right. The fancy new website, jupyterbroadcasting.com, with dynamic live, jblive embedding on the live page,

01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:26.320
and it's fully built in Hugo and completely self-hosted up on Linode and all that good stuff.

01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:30.320
So go and take a look over on our GitHub if you want to contribute to that website.

01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:36.320
We've talked about it a bunch in LUP and office hours as well with the fantastic work that Brent's been doing over there.

01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:43.320
And I really look forward to seeing some of you at the upcoming meetups, meetup.com slash jupyterbroadcasting.

01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:48.320
As I've mentioned a few times, self-hosted.show slash contact is the place to go to get in touch with us.

01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:51.320
And you can find me on Twitter at ironicbadger.

01:00:51.320 --> 01:01:00.320
And also Twitter too, at Chris LAS, the show is at self-hosted show and links to what we talked about today are at self-hosted.show slash 79.
