00:00.000 --> 00:04.880
While I'm talking to you today from England, hello to all my British compatriots.

00:05.760 --> 00:07.280
Is that even a word? I'm not sure.

00:07.840 --> 00:08.720
Comrades.

00:08.720 --> 00:10.320
Comrades? That's a...

00:10.320 --> 00:10.960
Yeah.

00:10.960 --> 00:12.960
Uncle Vlad might want a word about that.

00:13.840 --> 00:15.200
Yeah, that's all right.

00:15.200 --> 00:17.360
Today's a mouth organ sort of day, is it for you?

00:17.360 --> 00:19.120
I do have it right here with me in the studio.

00:20.240 --> 00:23.840
You never know when you might need to like just kind of punctuate a point.

00:23.840 --> 00:27.200
I need to paint a picture for those listening via audio.

00:27.200 --> 00:31.520
I have my microphone in front of me resting on a couple of pillows

00:31.520 --> 00:34.880
on a desk in the corner of my wife's childhood bedroom.

00:35.840 --> 00:37.120
It's quite the setup.

00:37.120 --> 00:40.560
Yeah, and also it's another way of saying if you have problems with it, it's not Drew's fault.

00:40.560 --> 00:43.520
I mean, you know, that's not necessarily a Drew approved, but...

00:43.520 --> 00:49.040
No, I'm not sure it would be sound engineer 101 microphone placement or anything like that.

00:49.040 --> 00:51.120
Are you getting hyped for the new microphone?

00:51.120 --> 00:55.760
It's getting close. I am. Well, first of all, it's my sister's wedding this weekend,

00:55.760 --> 00:59.280
which is the entire reason that we're over here.

00:59.280 --> 01:03.200
And then my mind will move to the good people of the JB community,

01:03.200 --> 01:04.960
and I can start getting excited about that.

01:04.960 --> 01:08.960
But August 5th, for those of you that have forgotten or didn't know,

01:08.960 --> 01:10.480
or are just hearing about it for the first time,

01:10.480 --> 01:14.880
August 5th, underneath the London Eye in the Jubilee Park Gardens,

01:14.880 --> 01:18.240
we're having a London meetup. I'll be there, Joe Ressington will be there,

01:18.240 --> 01:22.400
and about 100 other people, 100 other podcast friends. I've got stickers.

01:22.400 --> 01:27.600
So if you'd like a self-hosted sticker, limited edition diamond cut. Very nice.

01:27.600 --> 01:30.800
I just saw in the London Colony Matrix chat room,

01:30.800 --> 01:35.360
one of the listeners that made it to the Raleigh meetup there in the States

01:35.360 --> 01:39.840
is getting on a plane in the next few days and flying out to London for the meetup.

01:39.840 --> 01:42.560
No way. That's so cool.

01:42.560 --> 01:45.600
He had that good of a time at the Raleigh meetup, at the Raleigh meetup.

01:45.600 --> 01:48.400
Which, I don't know, I take that as a compliment.

01:48.400 --> 01:48.880
No pressure.

01:48.880 --> 01:50.400
The meetups have been well received, right?

01:50.400 --> 01:56.000
No. So meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting for the details and timing and all that.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.240
I feel a little less organized for this one. I mean,

01:58.240 --> 02:02.400
the last one was 20 minutes from my house. This one is a little further than that.

02:02.400 --> 02:06.480
And, you know, I can't bring a tent this time and snacks and stuff.

02:06.480 --> 02:11.920
Yeah, I hear you. I feel unprepared when I show up to a meetup without Lady Joe.

02:11.920 --> 02:16.480
I feel unprepared when I show up to a meetup without Lady Joups, my RV.

02:16.480 --> 02:19.200
So I can imagine, you know, like, oh, OK, we don't have the swag.

02:20.080 --> 02:23.200
OK, we don't have food. We got beer. No, we don't got the beer.

02:23.200 --> 02:24.800
OK, well, I guess it's just us.

02:25.440 --> 02:30.720
But you are off where I presume is also your future new offsite backup.

02:30.720 --> 02:33.200
Or are you building something with the house you're staying at now?

02:33.200 --> 02:35.440
Tell us a little bit about that aspect of the trip.

02:35.440 --> 02:41.680
Yeah, it's been so exciting. It's been a magical mystery tour of England for me this last couple of weeks.

02:41.680 --> 02:42.720
How's it now?

02:42.720 --> 02:48.560
We stayed at my sister's, my mom's, my dad's, and now we're staying at the mother-in-law's.

02:48.560 --> 02:53.520
And each of them have had their own unique levels of what they deem acceptable Internet,

02:53.520 --> 02:59.280
which is often far from what Alex deems acceptable Internet.

02:59.280 --> 03:00.560
I know exactly what you mean.

03:00.560 --> 03:07.840
Yeah, 50 meg down and a couple of meg up is just about fine for remote working.

03:07.840 --> 03:13.120
So it's been interesting. The most interesting one was my dad's.

03:13.120 --> 03:21.280
He moved to a new house a few months ago and his new Internet was one step above garbage.

03:21.280 --> 03:29.040
You know, we're talking single digits down four or five meg down and half a meg up through DSL, ADSL.

03:29.040 --> 03:30.240
It's just no good.

03:30.240 --> 03:31.920
So he got Starlink.

03:31.920 --> 03:36.320
And when we stayed with him for a few days, I got to try out Starlink for the first time,

03:36.320 --> 03:37.760
which is pretty interesting.

03:37.760 --> 03:39.040
That's it? Interesting?

03:39.680 --> 03:42.480
I mean, for some of us, it's like a life changer.

03:42.480 --> 03:43.280
It's so cool.

03:43.280 --> 03:49.280
But yeah, I'm guessing not a great experience by that descriptor.

03:49.280 --> 03:54.800
As a city dweller who is used to the latency of a cable connecting me into the matrix,

03:55.680 --> 03:56.880
it's quite an adjustment.

03:57.520 --> 04:04.480
You can definitely tell when a certain satellite is direct overhead versus when it's off center.

04:04.480 --> 04:09.440
And so I actually took a time lapse of Dishy in the garden just to see if I could see it moving around.

04:09.920 --> 04:10.880
You can't.

04:10.880 --> 04:15.040
I mean, I left it on there for 10 minutes and I couldn't see any movement of the Dish,

04:15.040 --> 04:16.400
which I found interesting.

04:16.400 --> 04:22.800
But if you put your ear right next to the Dish, you can actually hear the motors kind of adjusting as it goes over,

04:22.800 --> 04:24.400
which I found fascinating.

04:25.200 --> 04:29.600
But yeah, my very short review of Starlink, even though it was only for three or four days,

04:29.600 --> 04:38.880
is that in a pinch, it'll do, but I would never buy a house that relies on Starlink as the primary internet connection.

04:38.880 --> 04:46.160
And I think for me, it's been an incredibly useful exercise, actually, to try Starlink out in the real world.

04:46.160 --> 04:47.280
Yeah, you were what?

04:47.280 --> 04:51.280
You're probably seeing ping times on average in the mid 40s, hopefully.

04:51.280 --> 04:52.960
That's usually pretty good for Starlink.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.800
The speeds were fine, actually.

04:54.800 --> 04:58.320
We were getting 100 meg down and anywhere from 20 to 60 up,

04:58.320 --> 05:04.000
which is honestly, it's perfectly fine for big bursts of traffic.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.320
We could stream videos just fine and things like that.

05:06.320 --> 05:15.680
But video calls, which are real time in nature, were not as reliable as I would like for a full time solution.

05:15.680 --> 05:21.200
And given that I work 100% remotely, it's very important to me.

05:21.200 --> 05:25.440
So that's really the main thing is just the fact that it wasn't consistent

05:25.440 --> 05:32.080
and that sometimes the pings were 10 to 30 milliseconds and sometimes they were up near 100.

05:32.080 --> 05:37.600
So it really depended on what mood it was in, it felt like.

05:37.600 --> 05:42.400
Yeah, on average, just collecting data for the weeks that I have, right around mid 40s,

05:42.400 --> 05:46.720
seems to be like my average ping time when you consider the high end and the low time you'll see.

05:46.720 --> 05:49.120
And I completely agree with your assessment.

05:49.120 --> 05:57.920
It's great for folks that want to watch Netflix and it's fine for a lot of activities online, really.

05:57.920 --> 06:03.280
It's real time communications where it's still a little tricky and also game streaming.

06:03.280 --> 06:09.600
I have actually done some game streaming, but as I'm playing from time to time, that latency changes.

06:09.600 --> 06:12.240
So, of course, then the performance in the game changes.

06:12.240 --> 06:18.720
Now, the one thing that is nice is because, like you said, Alex, it is tied to the orbit of the satellite.

06:18.720 --> 06:23.040
So what that means is your ping times change gradually, right?

06:23.040 --> 06:28.640
It's not like you're getting 44 milliseconds, 44 milliseconds, 280, 280, 44.

06:28.640 --> 06:30.080
It's not that kind of choppy.

06:30.080 --> 06:34.800
It's a more consistent latency that it does matter on the distance.

06:34.800 --> 06:40.320
You know, it's just physics that is traveling up to that satellite compared to LTE,

06:40.320 --> 06:47.680
which especially in the States is often met with bandwidth caps that I would exceed within a few days

06:47.680 --> 06:55.120
and then throttling on top of that and then capricious carriers that just change the rules and plans on you all the time.

06:55.120 --> 06:57.920
Or like you go the other route and you buy like these reseller packages.

06:57.920 --> 07:03.280
I have I actually have one of those right now where it's technically it's like some enterprise plan that they're like relabeling.

07:03.280 --> 07:04.640
So you've got you got it on some deal.

07:04.640 --> 07:10.560
It's crazy kind of a gray market for cellular data and they're always complicated.

07:10.560 --> 07:12.320
They always inevitably blow up on you.

07:12.320 --> 07:13.520
They're really expensive.

07:13.520 --> 07:16.240
They're more expensive than Starlink is per month.

07:16.240 --> 07:22.880
So when you look at what the options were for a lot of people compared to Starlink, Starlink is such an upgrade.

07:22.880 --> 07:36.320
But what I think is ridiculous is and you're seeing this a lot on the East Coast is people in homes are buying Starlink just because they don't want the they don't like their ISP or whatever it is.

07:36.320 --> 07:43.120
So they're dropping their cable and DSL connections and switching over to Starlink, which is probably more expensive,

07:43.120 --> 07:48.400
I would think definitely slower and is overburdening the Starlink network.

07:48.400 --> 07:52.880
And now that Starlink has this RV package where they'll ship the dish to you immediately.

07:52.880 --> 08:01.680
And any, you know, Tom or or Jane can buy one of these RV packages and then they can set it up at home and they have Starlink.

08:01.680 --> 08:07.600
They don't have to wait for Starlink to approve them through the current queue, which is based on capacity.

08:07.600 --> 08:15.200
And I think the whole thing is going to degrade the quality of the network and it's it's going to be that way until they can launch more satellites.

08:15.200 --> 08:22.560
But all that said, it's what I use every, you know, every day for my home connection in dupes.

08:22.560 --> 08:25.760
And for me, it was it's been it's been a really big deal.

08:25.760 --> 08:33.440
The reality is it's better than most other rural options, especially for people like you who are fully mobile.

08:33.440 --> 08:44.960
But I think for me, really, it was answering the question of could I buy a house in the sticks and rely on Starlink and not want to slit my wrists full time?

08:44.960 --> 08:52.000
Like, does this actually open up areas of real estate to me that were previously off limits?

08:52.000 --> 08:58.240
I don't think so. And I think it's just a personal judgment call that you've got to make.

08:58.240 --> 09:08.960
Yeah. And for some people like the remote off grid elements are so much more of a priority that they'll take the, you know, the the less ideal Internet connectivity.

09:08.960 --> 09:12.960
But if you do a lot of VoIP calls like you do right for work specifically, I think you're right.

09:12.960 --> 09:16.480
You really got to think about it. And there will be other options.

09:16.480 --> 09:24.000
Amazon's working on some stuff. There's some other companies that are working on other solutions and some of them will be even a lower distance of travel.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.600
So maybe they'll be even better.

09:25.600 --> 09:31.360
The other thing about Starlink that's worth talking about, I think, is the crappy router that they ship with that thing nowadays.

09:31.360 --> 09:40.000
So my dad got the square Starlink dishy dish, which is the newer one, as I understand it, which has got a built in cable.

09:40.000 --> 09:50.720
And it comes into this futuristic looking router that has a cool SpaceX logo on it, Starlink logo on it.

09:50.720 --> 10:00.080
But he had to buy the Ethernet adapter, which I think we got off the gray market on eBay for about 100 pounds, which is crazy just for an Ethernet adapter.

10:00.080 --> 10:08.160
But there you go. It's the only option to get it into the rest of the network, into the real the real world, for want of a better phrase.

10:08.160 --> 10:12.160
So he could hook it into his existing Unifi set up and all the rest of it.

10:12.160 --> 10:21.440
But when I was there, I was using Tailscale a lot to get back home and do a lot of stuff with, you know, everything that I do.

10:21.440 --> 10:30.720
And my subnet at home includes the range 192.168.1.0.20, I think.

10:30.720 --> 10:38.800
And the trouble with that is that the default Starlink subnet is 192.168.1.0.

10:38.800 --> 10:49.040
And if in Tailscale, you have an overlapping subnet in the remote LAN versus where you are now, and then you try and do a DNS query.

10:49.040 --> 10:55.680
Obviously, it doesn't know where to route the packet because it thinks, well, that particular subnet is over here when actually it's in both places.

10:55.680 --> 10:58.880
So it just loses its mind. It's not Tailscale's fault.

10:58.880 --> 11:04.320
Obviously, it's the network design. And, you know, it's my fault, really.

11:04.320 --> 11:10.720
And so I thought, OK, cool. How hard can it be to customize the subnet in a Starlink router?

11:10.720 --> 11:16.240
How hard could it be? Not possible. It's just not possible.

11:16.240 --> 11:28.640
I feel like the hardware is decent. I like that it's OpenWRT based and they've they've done some really smart things in there in terms of like diagnostic capabilities and being able to speed test your Wi-Fi from the app and all that kind of stuff.

11:28.640 --> 11:30.960
That's really cool. I really like that bit.

11:30.960 --> 11:47.200
However, with the square dishy, they have a dependency now on this router, which is just awful, in my opinion, because in the past with the circular dish, I could go directly from the dish.

11:47.200 --> 11:57.920
And take that ethernet cable and just plug it in the back of my router, no Starlink router needed, and then I could manage it with my Peplink where I mixed it with my LTE and Wi-Fi connections.

11:57.920 --> 12:03.520
It was glorious. And now I have a router in the mix and I don't like it.

12:03.520 --> 12:06.800
And it's another piece of gear that sucks power. And I don't like that.

12:06.800 --> 12:12.080
Although overall, the whole dishy setup, the square dishy setup takes less power than the circular dish.

12:12.080 --> 12:19.280
But, you know, you get it right for like you got to figure it's got to be 95 percent of people who buy this.

12:19.280 --> 12:23.840
This is probably a significantly better router than their ISP would give them.

12:23.840 --> 12:33.600
Probably, but it's annoying knowing that it's open WRT under the hood and they don't expose even basic knobs like customizing the DHCP range.

12:33.600 --> 12:42.000
I think the whole thought is that such a few amount of users would ever need that, that they don't want to they don't want the support burden of it.

12:42.000 --> 12:45.840
It's got to be it. But I've I've just kind of worked it out as much as I can.

12:45.840 --> 12:47.520
But I agree with you. It could be a lot better.

12:47.520 --> 12:51.280
So moving on to the next stage of my trip, we're now at the mother-in-law's in Norfolk.

12:51.280 --> 12:56.800
I brought my old UK server with me and it's now living at its new home.

12:56.800 --> 12:58.880
Best part is that she now has fiber.

12:58.880 --> 13:04.240
It's 500 down and 70 up, which is plenty for all for my needs remotely.

13:04.240 --> 13:05.920
There you go. That's better.

13:05.920 --> 13:09.120
Now we're talking with good ping times and everything else.

13:09.120 --> 13:17.520
The downside is she lives in well over 100 year old cottage with, you know, several foot thick stone walls.

13:17.520 --> 13:19.280
Wi-Fi is a challenge.

13:19.280 --> 13:26.480
I have two or three Unifi repeaters that I have installed here over the last few years and it works well enough.

13:26.480 --> 13:33.280
But obviously now she's got fiber, which she was using an LTE mast on the roof to get her Internet before.

13:33.280 --> 13:38.320
I had to think about running Ethernet through the house to, you know, cope with the new speeds and, you know, my servers here.

13:38.320 --> 13:41.360
I want that hardwired. I don't want that on Wi-Fi, etc, etc.

13:41.360 --> 13:49.200
So I spent most of yesterday morning up a ladder running Ethernet through the walls and drilling holes and pulling Ethernet cable.

13:49.200 --> 13:51.040
Around the outside and over the top of the roof.

13:51.040 --> 13:58.400
And it was it was it was fun, you know, it's not something I want to do every day, but as a one off, it's good fun.

13:58.400 --> 14:04.240
But it got me thinking about, you know, the various different things that you might want to start thinking about when cabling a house.

14:04.240 --> 14:09.520
You know, Cat 6a versus Cat 6 pass through Ethernet connectors.

14:09.520 --> 14:11.800
What type of crimping thing do you need?

14:11.800 --> 14:19.840
This was the first time I pre-ordered some pass through Ethernet connectors, Jax RJ45 plugs.

14:19.840 --> 14:24.600
And essentially these things, I think, are going to change my Ethernet termination game.

14:24.600 --> 14:30.080
They are the way to go. OK, you line up all your cables in the right order.

14:30.080 --> 14:36.000
So you've got your orange and then your blue and green, whatever the spec you've chosen is.

14:36.000 --> 14:42.840
And then you line them all up and you shove them through the plug so that the strands actually poke out of the far side of the plug.

14:42.840 --> 14:47.920
And then you use a crimping tool that actually snips off those cables at the perfect length.

14:47.920 --> 14:59.280
Beforehand, what I've done is most Ethernet plugs I've used before, you'd have to look really closely and sort of hope and check that all of the cables had got into the terminals.

14:59.280 --> 15:07.080
And hope that all eight of your connections were in the right order and hadn't jumped a slot when you're shoving it in.

15:07.080 --> 15:14.920
But with the pass through cables, you can actually look at the cables that have come out the other side and go, right, there's four solid colours there and there are four stripey colours there.

15:14.920 --> 15:19.160
They look about in the right order. Clip. Done. Test.

15:19.160 --> 15:28.600
I only did four plugs yesterday, but I think that's the first time I've done four plugs and got four plugs working first time.

15:28.600 --> 15:30.080
Right. I know what you mean.

15:30.080 --> 15:44.480
So if ever you're thinking about what cables to buy, what connectors to buy, spend a little bit extra if you're someone like me that does it once or twice every century and get the pass through stuff.

15:44.480 --> 15:47.960
It does make your life a lot, lot easier.

15:47.960 --> 15:51.760
That is a great little tip right there. I have seen those and totes agree.

15:51.760 --> 15:55.280
They're nice. It's such an easier way to do it because of the reason you said right there.

15:55.280 --> 15:59.680
You can just check your colours, make sure you got everything in the right order and then you chop it.

15:59.680 --> 16:03.160
Now, the next thing that was on my plate was trying to figure out the firewall situation.

16:03.160 --> 16:08.840
So her fibre connection is a PPPoE fibre to the home connection.

16:08.840 --> 16:14.200
So I built an open sense router. I bought some parts off eBay.

16:14.200 --> 16:21.120
I brought an old CPU with me from the States, an i3 3200 or 3220, I think.

16:21.120 --> 16:24.800
All right. Eight gigs of DDR3 L RAM.

16:24.800 --> 16:28.320
I ordered a lot of the only thing I brought with me was the CPU.

16:28.320 --> 16:35.440
Everything else I ordered from eBay basically at the airport whilst I was thinking about what I had to do whilst I was here.

16:35.440 --> 16:38.000
Not last minute at all. OK.

16:38.000 --> 16:41.840
And so it was it was, you know, ten days before I needed it.

16:41.840 --> 16:45.760
And luckily everything arrived. I even remember to order thermal paste.

16:45.760 --> 16:49.600
Somehow my brain remembered that thermal paste was the thing I was going to need.

16:49.600 --> 16:52.440
Wow. You really channeled that PC build energy.

16:52.440 --> 17:01.920
Nice. Yeah. And so I built this I built this router, sat on my lap and assembled the Intel DQ77KB motherboard.

17:01.920 --> 17:05.920
That rolls off the tongue. This is a really nice mini ITX motherboard.

17:05.920 --> 17:10.120
It's got two gigabit NICs in it. One of them is coloured red.

17:10.120 --> 17:13.560
So I use that one as my WAN port and the other one is just black.

17:13.560 --> 17:17.880
They're both Intel NICs. So OpenSense picks them up right away.

17:17.880 --> 17:21.280
Install of OpenSense took about four minutes.

17:21.280 --> 17:25.080
Really super simple. You burn the image onto a USB stick.

17:25.080 --> 17:29.200
I think I used Rufus on my mother-in-law's desktop.

17:29.200 --> 17:34.720
Running Windows. Four minutes to install the OpenSense operating system.

17:34.720 --> 17:43.400
Then it automatically detects the WAN and LAN links based on the IP addresses it's getting or not getting in some cases.

17:43.400 --> 17:48.840
And that's it. It could not be simpler to install an OpenSense system.

17:48.840 --> 17:57.720
But I've got to say that that moment when you post a system that you've built from assembled parts of random eBay sellers for the first time.

17:57.720 --> 18:03.440
Yeah. When you know you've only got two or three days, so you don't have time to wait for more parts to come in.

18:03.440 --> 18:06.960
It's a squeaky bum moment. I'm going to tell you that.

18:06.960 --> 18:12.800
Those eBay purchases are a roll of the dice a little bit, although honestly, so is buying stuff new.

18:12.800 --> 18:19.160
I have probably more often than not received things brand new that haven't been functional than I have from eBay.

18:19.160 --> 18:27.480
I'm impressed that you had the forethought to get the thermal paste and that you're doing all of this ordering in the chaos of an airport.

18:27.480 --> 18:32.280
Which means you're like looking at the eBay listings. You're like reviewing the eBay listing.

18:32.280 --> 18:34.440
Maybe you're checking the reviews of the seller, too.

18:34.440 --> 18:39.960
You're making all these decisions while the wife and kid are with you in an airport and it all managed to work out.

18:39.960 --> 18:46.240
I'm going to say that's a little bit of luck and a little bit of ninja, both.

18:46.240 --> 18:51.920
I'm going with 95% luck on that one, that it all just worked.

18:51.920 --> 18:56.760
I put a 60 gig M SATA SSD in there, 8 gigs of RAM, as I said.

18:56.760 --> 19:01.840
And the reason I put so much RAM in this system is because I wanted to run a couple of services on this box.

19:01.840 --> 19:10.640
Now, I've mentioned this before, but you can install packages on OpenSense from a guy's repo called, I think it's memugmail.

19:10.640 --> 19:14.320
I really don't know if I'm saying that right, but there'll be a link in the show notes.

19:14.320 --> 19:19.040
I'm able to run two critical packages directly on the firewall.

19:19.040 --> 19:25.680
The first of those is tail scale. I can run tail scale on the router.

19:25.680 --> 19:28.320
That's great. That's worth it right there.

19:28.320 --> 19:35.000
Absolutely. I mean, obviously I'm going to be setting up a direct wire guard endpoint on the firewall as well, just as a backup.

19:35.000 --> 19:45.200
But running tail scale on the router itself is so nice because it gives me access to the entire subnet without worrying about if a particular machine is turned on, anything like that.

19:45.200 --> 19:49.320
You know, I've got exit node capabilities, all that good stuff with tail scale.

19:49.320 --> 19:55.280
So then I just installed tail scale actually on my router in Raleigh and the router at my mum's house, which has got the Synology.

19:55.280 --> 20:00.280
So I've now got a three node tail scale OpenSense network going on.

20:00.280 --> 20:02.240
It's pretty sweet. That's great.

20:02.240 --> 20:07.840
And then the other package that I've started installing on OpenSense is AdGuard Home directly on the router.

20:07.840 --> 20:11.640
So I use that as the primary DNS server on the router itself.

20:11.640 --> 20:18.520
I disable unbound and then I point port 53 through into that service that's running on the router itself.

20:18.520 --> 20:26.920
So I have ad blocking on the router and it means I can do DNS rewrites and all that kind of stuff if I need to for DNS reasons.

20:26.920 --> 20:29.760
It's just so nice.

20:29.760 --> 20:32.720
How did you communicate any of this to the family members?

20:32.720 --> 20:35.200
Do you say you're going to have ad blocking now on your network?

20:35.200 --> 20:39.600
You're welcome. Or do you kind of not say anything and just see if they report an issue?

20:39.600 --> 20:44.160
What's your what's your approach? It's easier to ask for forgiveness, isn't it?

20:44.160 --> 20:49.760
Yeah. Well, there is something to the fact that, like, if you tell them, I mean, my family does this to me all the time.

20:49.760 --> 20:54.720
If I sit at their computer and then something breaks afterwards, it's my fault, even if I didn't even change anything.

20:54.720 --> 21:01.400
Right. So there's a bit of a logic to just not saying anything and just seeing how things go and just knowing that they're taken care of.

21:01.400 --> 21:04.160
So is that is that your is that your approach?

21:04.160 --> 21:12.560
Yeah. Particularly for the ad blocking stuff, because, you know, I know that mobile games are quite popular in this in this household.

21:12.560 --> 21:21.360
And they are really bad for ads. And whenever I'm traveling with my wife, she always goes, God, I always forget when I'm at home just how many ads you're saving me.

21:21.360 --> 21:26.080
Thank you. So I'm hoping that in six months time we'll have a conversation and she'll be like, oh, yeah.

21:26.080 --> 21:32.240
Well, look at all these ads. And by the way, you know, when I was out there, I did a little something for you.

21:32.240 --> 21:37.200
And the upshot is for me, I can do, you know, easier DNS rewrites and that kind of stuff.

21:37.200 --> 21:42.160
And then I've got a standardized set up between the three different places because I do ad guard on all three.

21:42.160 --> 21:45.480
I do tail scale now on all three. I've got open sense at all three sites.

21:45.480 --> 21:52.680
So, yeah, that is really nice. Just keep it nice and consistent for you. Less mistakes, easier to support.

21:52.680 --> 21:55.560
There will be a link in the show notes, by the way, to how I set that up.

21:55.560 --> 21:58.360
I am using ad guard as the primary DNS.

21:58.360 --> 22:09.360
I think it uses unbound as a recursive or upstream provider, which then finally after those two hops goes out to cloud flare to the internet to do the final internet based DNS resolution.

22:09.360 --> 22:18.200
You know, it's so funny what you've done here. There is a place in the business world where this could be sold as a product for businesses and doctor's offices and whatnot.

22:18.200 --> 22:22.520
You come in, you set up, you know, an open, audible firewall.

22:22.520 --> 22:26.920
And then if they have multiple branches, something that they're always trying to solve is how to link those branches together.

22:26.920 --> 22:30.200
So then you offer tail scale as a solution to link those branches together.

22:30.200 --> 22:35.000
Ad guard does the DNS for them and the ad blocking to help make their system safer.

22:35.000 --> 22:43.960
Like this, just this little thing that you've done on this trip could be sold as a standalone like service and offering product that a consulting company goes around.

22:43.960 --> 22:46.560
Because I have seen that in my days in I.T.

22:46.560 --> 22:55.120
I have seen businesses that were using a lot worse technology, a lot worse software and hardware going around making a killing selling setups like this.

22:55.120 --> 23:01.000
I know that tail scale aren't sponsoring today, but I have used the heck out of tail scale on this trip.

23:01.000 --> 23:10.800
It is it's like dark magic sitting down in a foreign country, typing a DNS entry that, you know, is at your house 3000 miles away.

23:10.800 --> 23:15.760
And it just loads behind a firewall. It's just so cool.

23:15.760 --> 23:21.640
We still have the URL or, you know, we could use coders to tail scale dot com slash coder or tail scale dot com slash SSH.

23:21.640 --> 23:25.600
But yeah, they are not a sponsor on this show, but we love it. Still use it. So there you go.

23:25.600 --> 23:28.960
And you're right. If I was traveling over to families, that's what I'd be setting up.

23:28.960 --> 23:31.440
You're really making me consider OpenSense and AdGuard.

23:31.440 --> 23:35.040
I have to be honest with you for the network here at the studio.

23:35.040 --> 23:40.040
I've been mostly for the content reasons and because it sounds fun.

23:40.040 --> 23:48.240
I've been really considering just doing like a next base Raspberry Pi Compute Module four on a carrier board that has dual gigabit Ethernet.

23:48.240 --> 23:58.000
And then next is the OS and then just a really simple, really basic command line firewall setup and just do everything through an SSH connection.

23:58.000 --> 24:01.000
And just see how slim and minimal of a firewall I can make.

24:01.000 --> 24:08.760
But Alex, you make OpenSense seem so attractive, especially with those add ons that that really does get me.

24:08.760 --> 24:12.280
Tail scale and AdGuard sound really nice. So I don't know.

24:12.280 --> 24:19.080
It's been it's been great for me. I know I have a bit of a bugbear about people saying, oh, it's been rock solid.

24:19.080 --> 24:21.840
What does that phrase even mean? Like, you know what I mean?

24:21.840 --> 24:29.800
But, ah, it's been rock solid for me, you know, there it is.

24:29.800 --> 24:33.360
Yeah, I know it's been it's been really solid. I do know what you mean.

24:33.360 --> 24:36.320
I appreciate the stability that you're trying to imply with that.

24:36.320 --> 24:42.120
So Alex likes it so much, you know, he's installing it for mom and dad.

24:42.120 --> 24:48.160
So now the only question is, are you going to leave them with any kind of docs or user logins or anything?

24:48.160 --> 24:49.120
What do you do there?

24:49.120 --> 24:55.400
I've got a bookstack instance set up for them, but I wondered what other people are using for family members and friends and things.

24:55.400 --> 25:03.120
When you need to communicate basic information like what the Wi-Fi password you set up is or what, you know, IP.

25:03.120 --> 25:07.520
Do family members need to know what IP address you have the access point set to?

25:07.520 --> 25:12.320
Probably not. But, you know, basic stuff about the network that you've done.

25:12.320 --> 25:17.880
If you got hit by a bus tomorrow, they might need to know the answer to, you know, basic stuff like that.

25:17.880 --> 25:22.480
I've actually taken just to just a simple GitHub flavored markdown file.

25:22.480 --> 25:37.280
I then print out and leave in a drawer. It's not secure or anything like that, but I feel like it speaks the language of, you know, non slightly less technical people, which isn't to say a bad thing.

25:37.280 --> 25:40.160
It's just, you know, how it is.

25:40.160 --> 25:44.600
Yeah, I don't think you want to leave them something that they have no control over.

25:44.600 --> 25:48.920
I mean, like, you know, God forbid something happens to you, you don't want them to have to tear everything out.

25:48.920 --> 25:51.200
You want somebody to come in and go, oh, I see what Alex did here.

25:51.200 --> 25:54.280
Yeah, OK. Oh, I see what the problem. Yeah, yeah, we can take care of this.

25:54.280 --> 25:57.280
Right. That's what. So I think that's a good goal.

25:57.280 --> 26:04.880
I would also be really interested to know what people are using for that, because I feel like I've probably got a few family members I should document things for.

26:04.880 --> 26:09.520
Not to mention the wife. So let us know.

26:09.520 --> 26:15.440
Lino dot com slash SSH go there to get one hundred dollars and 60 day credit on a new account.

26:15.440 --> 26:19.160
And it's just a great way to support the show. Linode is the Geeks Cloud.

26:19.160 --> 26:23.880
It's the DIY Geeks Cloud with 11 data centers worldwide.

26:23.880 --> 26:28.640
They got something close to you, a client, a family member, whatever you're trying to do.

26:28.640 --> 26:34.800
They've been hard at work for nearly 19 years, creating the best experience for running things in the cloud.

26:34.800 --> 26:38.480
If you want to build it yourself from the ground up, their support is there for you.

26:38.480 --> 26:42.680
They'll understand what you're talking about. That's huge in our space.

26:42.680 --> 26:48.560
But if you're still new and you're just trying to get experience, they've also got a lot of really nice one click stacks.

26:48.560 --> 26:51.720
You hit the button, Linode deploys it for you.

26:51.720 --> 26:56.040
And of course, the performance is always incredible. That's one of the things I love about it.

26:56.040 --> 27:01.320
Their reliability is unmatched. They have built out and own their own network.

27:01.320 --> 27:07.000
I mean, really, nobody does it like Linode because you'd have to have been around for nearly 19 years.

27:07.000 --> 27:10.240
I wouldn't host all of JB stuff on there unless I felt nobody did it better.

27:10.240 --> 27:16.680
Seriously, I think you're going to really enjoy it when you get that one hundred dollars and you kick the tires to go to Linode dot com slash SSH.

27:16.680 --> 27:20.240
Check them out. They've been rolling out new MVME storage.

27:20.240 --> 27:21.720
They got database as a service.

27:21.720 --> 27:28.040
If you are done with running a Postgres or a MongoDB or a MySQL database and you just want to have somebody else as an expert,

27:28.040 --> 27:32.880
run it and manage it and back it up and take care of it and love on it for you, they'll do that.

27:32.880 --> 27:39.320
They got a great dashboard. Their object storage is super cool. Like, use that as your own backup strategy, guys.

27:39.320 --> 27:43.040
Go check out the object storage and connect it to a backup tool.

27:43.040 --> 27:49.400
You're really going to be cooking with gas then. That's a really great way to get some good, solid offsite backups.

27:49.400 --> 27:58.880
It's a great way to use that hundred bucks to go to Linode dot com slash SSH for the best customer support, super fast rigs, great networking and a Linux culture that runs deep.

27:58.880 --> 28:00.440
Well, there's a lot of reasons to choose Linode.

28:00.440 --> 28:08.120
So go put it over the top, get that hundred bucks and support the show. Linode dot com slash SSH.

28:08.120 --> 28:10.640
My daughter helped me this morning clean out the server.

28:10.640 --> 28:12.840
It hasn't been powered on for about four months.

28:12.840 --> 28:17.760
And before that, I don't think it's had a proper cleaning in, certainly since I was here last September.

28:17.760 --> 28:20.840
But some of the fans looked a little bit more crusty than that.

28:20.840 --> 28:25.800
So we're outside on the patio with a little paintbrush, you know, dusting out the fans.

28:25.800 --> 28:34.160
And she was helping, you know, like kids do, which got me thinking about different, you know, the hard drives that are in there and things like that.

28:34.160 --> 28:39.760
And I just want to underscore the importance of directed airflow to the audience right now.

28:39.760 --> 28:51.680
So my server here is in a Fractal Define R5 case, and it was missing just one of the five and a quarter inch blanking plates on the front of the CD-ROM drives.

28:51.680 --> 28:54.200
There's two of them. So it's missing one of those.

28:54.200 --> 28:56.720
And it's got two, I think they're 120s.

28:56.720 --> 29:02.320
They might be 140mm fans directly underneath to pull air in at the front of the case.

29:02.320 --> 29:09.720
Last night, the hard drives were running at about 50 Celsius, and this is in an ambient temperature of about 24 Celsius.

29:09.720 --> 29:11.880
So they were running pretty warm.

29:11.880 --> 29:18.760
And so I thought this morning, I'll just make a little blanking plate out of some duct tape and some cardboard and stick it over that little hole at the front.

29:18.760 --> 29:23.120
Just doing that lowered the drive temps by 11 Celsius.

29:23.120 --> 29:24.480
I couldn't believe it.

29:24.480 --> 29:26.280
That's way more than I would expect.

29:26.280 --> 29:30.400
Jeez, man, I come to think of it, I've got a bad airflow situation right now with my hard drives.

29:30.400 --> 29:33.000
I have the case cracked at the moment. That's probably not good.

29:33.000 --> 29:37.040
Yeah, just a little thing. And I didn't expect it to make such a difference either.

29:37.040 --> 29:48.200
But I think it just goes to show that with hard drives, you've got to have the airflow directed in just the right way so that it's actually going across them and not doing any kind of weird turbulence stuff.

29:48.200 --> 29:55.040
Anyway, speaking of hard drives, did you see this Backblaze latest hard drive blog post that came out?

29:55.040 --> 29:57.160
Indeed, I love this post.

29:57.160 --> 30:01.960
They've been doing this like forever now since 2013.

30:01.960 --> 30:08.840
They select 10 drive models and then they, of course, have a ton of data like smart metrics and whatnot.

30:08.840 --> 30:16.720
And they look at different models and different size ranges, four terabytes, eight terabytes, 12 terabytes.

30:16.720 --> 30:22.840
And now 14 terabytes to see what kind of reliability data that they can find.

30:22.840 --> 30:30.280
And I always kind of find this a little stress inducing, I have to be honest with you.

30:30.280 --> 30:40.240
Like anything these days, it seems to me that there's only two, maybe three companies, if we're being generous, involved in what is a global market.

30:40.240 --> 30:44.480
You know, we were actually sat having dinner the other day looking around on the table.

30:44.480 --> 30:50.720
And I made a joke that I bet you on this table there were like five or six different companies worth of condiments.

30:50.720 --> 30:54.680
I said, I bet you there's only two or three companies behind all these different things.

30:54.680 --> 30:58.320
Turned out it was two. It was Nestle and some other company I'd never heard of.

30:58.320 --> 31:03.400
But Nestle have so many subsidiaries that you just you can't even fathom.

31:03.400 --> 31:07.000
They are just so unbelievably huge.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.720
And the same factors are at play in the hard drive market.

31:09.720 --> 31:12.440
So you've got Seagate and Western Digital.

31:12.440 --> 31:19.600
And over the years, those two companies have swallowed up everybody else, including Hitachi Global Storage Tech,

31:19.600 --> 31:25.560
HGST, Toshiba, Samsung used to have a hard drive division, loads of others.

31:25.560 --> 31:37.520
And so quite often on the Internet, people will get into slinging wars about PlayStation versus Xbox or Apple Mac versus PC or Linux versus Windows.

31:37.520 --> 31:40.000
And the hard drives are absolutely no different.

31:40.000 --> 31:45.360
People are some people swear by Seagate, some people swear by Western Digital.

31:45.360 --> 31:52.080
And I think what this blog post just goes to show is that the entire Internet's full of shit.

31:52.080 --> 32:02.080
Yeah. And like they even dig into how even some drives that are labeled a Western Digital on the outside are actually an HGST on the inside.

32:02.080 --> 32:07.800
And there's just so much shenanigans going on in the hard drive market.

32:07.800 --> 32:14.160
I did not really fully appreciate how bad it has gotten until I read through all of this.

32:14.160 --> 32:19.480
And honestly, it just seems like outside of two years, things just really start to get pretty shaky.

32:19.480 --> 32:23.240
I mean, there's definitely some models that last longer, but beyond two years.

32:23.240 --> 32:27.520
And I'm just like, yikes. And I've got I've got several.

32:27.520 --> 32:32.840
Oh, I don't know, 20 ish drives that are probably about four or five years old that I'm relying on right now.

32:32.840 --> 32:35.840
Oh, that's get into the danger zone, bro.

32:35.840 --> 32:37.640
And they just have a lot of data, right?

32:37.640 --> 32:40.680
They've got a ton of disks. They've got years of data.

32:40.680 --> 32:49.120
They do. And they you know, they're putting consumer grade drives through what are ostensibly enterprise grade workloads.

32:49.120 --> 32:53.840
You know, they're in data centers full of lots of other drives, full of lots of other vibrations.

32:53.840 --> 33:00.880
Yes, you could argue that the temperature controls and maintenance schedules might be a bit better than your average home user.

33:00.880 --> 33:09.640
But, you know, the other environmental conditions like the vibrations I mentioned probably balance it out so that it's a fairly average picture of what's going on.

33:09.640 --> 33:14.640
And I don't know of anybody else that publishes data on the scale that Backblaze does.

33:14.640 --> 33:16.760
Certainly not for drives that I can buy.

33:16.760 --> 33:23.080
You know, I'm sure AWS buy specific white label drives that are just for Amazon because they buy at such volume.

33:23.080 --> 33:28.840
Whereas Backblaze will buy model numbers that you and I, mere mortals, can go ahead and buy, which is lovely.

33:28.840 --> 33:39.640
For me, I'm looking at this data and I see that, you know, like you say, two or three years after that kind of lifespan, I'm going to want to start thinking about rotating my drives.

33:39.640 --> 33:47.640
Maybe not all at once because of the bathtub curve and the sheer cost of buying multiple hard drives all at once.

33:47.640 --> 33:55.600
But it just goes to show you that, you know, probably every year you should be replacing 20 percent of your hard drive.

33:55.600 --> 34:01.440
So that within a five year span, you are replacing the entire lot completely.

34:01.440 --> 34:03.320
There's lots of things you can do with old hard drives.

34:03.320 --> 34:05.520
You can put them in backup servers.

34:05.520 --> 34:07.560
You can make clocks out of them.

34:07.560 --> 34:11.680
You could make coasters. You could do all sorts of things. You could sell them if you want to.

34:11.680 --> 34:13.680
So it's not like they go completely to waste.

34:13.680 --> 34:19.720
And, you know, if you think about the kind of storage increases that we see every five years as well,

34:19.720 --> 34:28.400
you might go from a four terabyte drive to a 16 terabyte drive in the same slot and then suddenly you don't need as many drives anymore.

34:28.400 --> 34:33.360
And your five year 20 percent become, I don't know, there's a lot to consider.

34:33.360 --> 34:39.480
I'm looking at it thinking, OK, if you're really serious about data integrity, you're probably looking at after about two years,

34:39.480 --> 34:42.480
you're going to want to start rotating those disks to a different job at least.

34:42.480 --> 34:48.560
Maybe they're not done, but maybe whatever you're like really critical data is newer disk go in.

34:48.560 --> 34:50.840
I don't practice that. I really don't.

34:50.840 --> 34:59.200
But, geez, I think at some point what I've got to do is I've got to figure out a budget for just rolling disk replacements.

34:59.200 --> 35:03.280
And, you know, we've had these ups and downs in the pricing market for these drives.

35:03.280 --> 35:06.720
That's something the Black the Backblaze article touches on as well.

35:06.720 --> 35:13.040
And so it sort of wrecked my ability to kind of just incrementally buy because there was periods where it was super cheap.

35:13.040 --> 35:15.160
So you wanted to buy a lot and there's periods where it's super expensive.

35:15.160 --> 35:22.600
So I didn't want to buy any. And what we really need is just hard drive price stability in a way where I can just, OK, you know,

35:22.600 --> 35:25.400
every year we're going to buy 10 disks or something like that.

35:25.400 --> 35:27.920
You know, we're going to buy it throughout the year or whatever.

35:27.920 --> 35:32.920
Well, you talk about dollar averaging with Bitcoin in in other aspects of your life.

35:32.920 --> 35:34.960
You should do dollar averaging with hard drives.

35:34.960 --> 35:37.640
Yeah. Disk averaging. Yeah. Like once a month.

35:37.640 --> 35:47.480
And the way I look at it is every Black Friday, I spend anywhere between 200 and 250 is my kind of sweet spot, in air quotes, per drive.

35:47.480 --> 35:55.280
Dollars I'm talking about. The best terabytes per dollar that I can get in that price range is typically what I'll buy every Black Friday.

35:55.280 --> 35:58.240
And there were some decent deals around Prime Day this year.

35:58.240 --> 36:09.680
If you look on shucks.top, so shuckstop, you can get a good idea of the overall kind of shucking kind of hard drive pricing scene with a snapshot of,

36:09.680 --> 36:15.400
you know, what the drive fluctuations have been and when the last historical low was and all that kind of stuff.

36:15.400 --> 36:21.160
And generally speaking, you'll find that 200 to 250 dollar range is at the moment,

36:21.160 --> 36:27.560
I think there are about 14 or 16 terabyte drives in that price range, which is I think I think it's pretty decent.

36:27.560 --> 36:32.920
Oh, man. All right. I needed to hear this. This is good for me.

36:32.920 --> 36:36.840
I just I hate the actions I'm going to have to take as a result.

36:36.840 --> 36:39.360
I appreciate the backblaze continues to put that data out.

36:39.360 --> 36:41.400
Of course, we'll have the whole write up linked in the show notes.

36:41.400 --> 36:45.880
There's some really good graphs. And I don't know, tell me if you see something in there.

36:45.880 --> 36:52.640
But to me, it looks like looks like the smaller drives tend to be a little more reliable.

36:52.640 --> 37:00.680
I'd like to know your take on it. So, Alex, we got some feedback from a listener about leak detectors from Deckbot.

37:00.680 --> 37:04.720
We did from Deckbot, who's in the Discord. Hello, Deckbot. I hope you're having a nice day.

37:04.720 --> 37:09.760
Yeah. Thanks for joining us live. Hey, Chris and Alex. In episode 75, you were discussing leak detectors.

37:09.760 --> 37:19.000
In a previous job, we used leak detector tape to detect flooding on the water fittings in semiconductor LPCVD furnaces.

37:19.000 --> 37:24.200
I have no idea what that means, but liquid propane, I'm guessing, but I don't know after that commercial.

37:24.200 --> 37:31.920
Maybe probably. Yeah. These were about 10 feet of cloth tape with two wires running on the outside edge.

37:31.920 --> 37:41.720
Any liquid or heavy feet on the tape would cause the electrical circuit between the two wires to short and trigger the water leak error in the PLC.

37:41.720 --> 37:44.160
And this would also power down the equipment.

37:44.160 --> 37:49.960
These tapes were a few meters long, and we'd also make the tape snake across the floor in three inch strips.

37:49.960 --> 37:57.560
I like these much more than typical flood sensors, since you can draw a box around a leak prone device like a water heater or sink,

37:57.560 --> 38:04.280
rather than waiting for the compartment holding the faulty devices to fill up enough to trigger a flood sensor.

38:04.280 --> 38:12.360
While in my professional life, they were a bane as any drop of water or isopropyl alcohol misplaced on the tape powered off the furnace.

38:12.360 --> 38:20.160
I wish I had the few extra bucks to add a few of these to my home assistant to watch for failed sump pumps and rusted out water heaters.

38:20.160 --> 38:24.400
There'll be a link in the show notes to Deckbot's recommendation of these water leak detectors.

38:24.400 --> 38:26.960
But you went a different route this week, Chris, no?

38:26.960 --> 38:33.440
I did. I mean, this does look really great because the whole rope is essentially a sensor, and that does seem pretty clever.

38:33.440 --> 38:37.840
But I actually decided to go with a recommendation that we got into the show.

38:37.840 --> 38:47.480
I got a Shelly flood sensor here, and these Shelly flood sensors are Wi-Fi sensors that have little contacts on the bottom of them that detect water.

38:47.480 --> 38:54.760
And they also have a temperature sensor in them, and they're reasonably priced somewhere around 30 US bucks.

38:54.760 --> 39:00.120
No hub required. When it arrives, it produces its own Wi-Fi network.

39:00.120 --> 39:08.160
You join that Wi-Fi network and then you go to the web address like it's a 192.168.0.1 kind of a thing,

39:08.160 --> 39:11.040
and you configure it to join your actual Wi-Fi network.

39:11.040 --> 39:18.600
And then pretty much shortly after that, home assistant detects it and says, hey, would you like to use the Shelly integration?

39:18.600 --> 39:23.320
Now, this, my friends, this is where a choice will be made.

39:23.320 --> 39:26.920
This is where early in the process you will reach a fork in the road.

39:26.920 --> 39:32.120
You must choose if you want to go with native Shelly integration or if you want to use MQTT,

39:32.120 --> 39:41.400
because, of course, everything in home assistant is just three steps away from using MQTT and the Shelly flood is no different.

39:41.400 --> 39:48.320
Now, I, because I had really no time to mess around, just decided to use the native integration.

39:48.320 --> 39:53.160
I had heard that in the past there was some issues, but those issues had been resolved.

39:53.160 --> 39:57.840
So I thought, OK, self, we'll use the native Shelly integration.

39:57.840 --> 40:04.720
So I went ahead and did that, and now as we're looking right here at it during the show, I have what everybody has,

40:04.720 --> 40:09.720
and that is that now the Shelly temperature sensor is completely offline.

40:09.720 --> 40:17.360
Home assistant can no longer talk to it because the way the system is supposed to work is that when the temperature drops.

40:17.360 --> 40:24.960
Or when it detects a leak, the device is supposed to wake up, join your Wi-Fi and report back to home assistant.

40:24.960 --> 40:31.040
And you can kind of configure that threshold of is it one percent? Is it one degree in temperature?

40:31.040 --> 40:37.480
Is it point five degrees at two degrees in temperature? What's the what's the threshold to wake up the device and then report back?

40:37.480 --> 40:39.720
However, that doesn't seem to be working for me.

40:39.720 --> 40:43.960
Clearly, I should have gone the MQTT route, which the rest of the Internet would tell you as well.

40:43.960 --> 40:49.120
I'm not particularly interested in doing that for reasons, but I may eventually.

40:49.120 --> 40:54.000
However, my overall experience with the Shelly was pretty good.

40:54.000 --> 41:01.320
And I am kind of in the process of looking at getting rid of some of my Z-Wave devices.

41:01.320 --> 41:07.000
I am considering when I get back from my September West Coast tour.

41:07.000 --> 41:10.720
Thinking about doing a nuke and pave and redoing my home assistant setup.

41:10.720 --> 41:14.040
You have been threatening that for a number of months now.

41:14.040 --> 41:18.200
So annoyed, dude. I'm so annoyed.

41:18.200 --> 41:24.400
I really just don't want to. I have, you know, 60 Z-Wave devices or something stupid like that, and I just don't want to go through and reset them up.

41:24.400 --> 41:27.000
So we're going to eliminate some of them.

41:27.000 --> 41:29.960
And I'm also going to eliminate some of my home kit devices.

41:29.960 --> 41:37.160
And I think I'm going to look at different Shelly devices that are Wi-Fi capable to see what I can replace with.

41:37.160 --> 41:42.200
And so I kind of wanted to get some experience with the Shelly devices to see if I liked them, to see if they'd be a candidate.

41:42.200 --> 41:46.800
And I had some new plumbing in jupes that I want to put a leak sensor on anyways.

41:46.800 --> 41:49.320
And so this just seemed like a great opportunity to try it.

41:49.320 --> 41:51.880
And I also kind of would like to know what the temperature is in that area.

41:51.880 --> 41:55.560
So great. This device does both. And I like that it uses Wi-Fi.

41:55.560 --> 41:58.480
It's not Z-Wave or ZigBee.

41:58.480 --> 42:01.680
They claim you can get 12 to 18 months of battery life.

42:01.680 --> 42:08.400
It uses one of those three volt lithium CR123A, a little batteries, little dirt cells or whatever from wherever.

42:08.400 --> 42:14.520
And the fact that Home Assistant just detects it within seconds and offers up an integration in theory,

42:14.520 --> 42:18.400
if that integration worked the way I wanted, is a really nice experience.

42:18.400 --> 42:22.680
And there is a ton of documentation to actually make this thing work the way I want.

42:22.680 --> 42:25.920
Do you know what I thought, Alex, is when I was using this?

42:25.920 --> 42:36.520
One of the things that struck me was there are areas where the Home Assistant developers could be closing the gap to make this a better user experience.

42:36.520 --> 42:40.640
Like when you connect something like a flood sensor.

42:40.640 --> 42:46.040
You've got to figure there's a pretty like a 95 percent chance that if you get a flood connect,

42:46.040 --> 42:51.280
if Home Assistant sees a flood sensor connect to the system and start receiving data.

42:51.280 --> 42:56.160
You probably want an alert when the flood sensor detects a flood, right?

42:56.160 --> 42:59.760
Like you can almost it's probably some people that don't, but probably like 90,

42:59.760 --> 43:04.400
95 percent of the use cases they want to know when the flood detector detects a flood.

43:04.400 --> 43:07.080
And there are lots of ways you can do this, man.

43:07.080 --> 43:09.320
I could get a notification of Matrix and Telegram.

43:09.320 --> 43:11.760
I could rig up some push notifications.

43:11.760 --> 43:18.360
I mean, there's a lot of ways, a lot of really great ways you can solve push notifications in Home Assistant.

43:18.360 --> 43:21.960
But a nothing tells you you need to do it, be nothing helps you do it.

43:21.960 --> 43:28.520
And see, nothing's like I push a button and now I'm getting push notifications from this integration.

43:28.520 --> 43:34.080
And to me, this just seems like a no brainer Nebuchadnezzar integration.

43:34.080 --> 43:39.040
Like if you're paying for the monthly Nebuchadnezzar Home Assistant service.

43:39.040 --> 43:46.120
It seems like a no brainer that they could be routing push services through that to the app that I already also have connected to the Nebuchadnezzar cloud service.

43:46.120 --> 43:50.760
And the Nebuchadnezzar servers offer push notification capabilities for developers.

43:50.760 --> 43:54.320
So like the infrastructure is there, like everything's there.

43:54.320 --> 43:58.160
I just need a button that says get push notifications about this.

43:58.160 --> 44:02.560
And oh, by the way, if you're a Home Assistant member, you get those push notifications automatically.

44:02.560 --> 44:05.960
Like that just seems like a no brainer value add that they could do.

44:05.960 --> 44:14.160
And you would need something in particular that would work with iOS as time sensitive notifications and whatever the equivalent is on Android.

44:14.160 --> 44:16.600
Because you need something that will break through, like do not disturb.

44:16.600 --> 44:21.800
Because for a flood sensor, like I'm in a recording focus mode right now.

44:21.800 --> 44:25.440
Nothing but my wife and maybe a kid can get through this.

44:25.440 --> 44:27.680
But a leak sensor, I'd also like to get through.

44:27.680 --> 44:31.280
So you need something that could actually support time sensitive notifications on iOS.

44:31.280 --> 44:37.440
And I've conveniently linked the documentation for that from Apple's developer portal in the show notes.

44:37.440 --> 44:44.040
You know, I'd like to see things like that as part of the Works with Home Assistant program that we covered last week on the show.

44:44.040 --> 44:47.480
You know, just imagine if Shelly were on that program.

44:47.480 --> 44:58.360
And as part of that program, there was a bunch of magic that became available to those developers, such as exactly what you just articulated.

44:58.360 --> 45:06.680
Yeah, it'd be so great. However, I got to say, all that aside, really impressed with the Shelly set up.

45:06.680 --> 45:13.040
You know, the fact that it was super quick to connect to had a really easy to use admin interface built into it.

45:13.040 --> 45:21.280
Anybody that's probably used a Shelly has seen this before, that even though this device isn't functioning with Home Assistant the way I want,

45:21.280 --> 45:26.920
I've decided to go ahead and pick up a couple of other products from them because I was overall very impressed.

45:26.920 --> 45:35.200
And so I'm getting the Shelly plus H&T, which is their e-ink humidity and temperature sensor that has a little display.

45:35.200 --> 45:39.280
And then, of course, reports back to Home Assistant over Wi-Fi.

45:39.280 --> 45:40.400
We'll see how this works.

45:40.400 --> 45:46.920
I'm assuming probably going to be the same thing. MQTT would be a probably a better route to go, but I'm going to give it a shot.

45:46.920 --> 45:51.960
That looks remarkably similar to the Xiaomi sensors that I have, which are BLE.

45:51.960 --> 45:54.640
Is this a Wi-Fi thing? It is. Yeah.

45:54.640 --> 46:02.080
Because those BLE ones I have are about 90 percent reliable, which is just about enough.

46:02.080 --> 46:04.840
But if it's yeah, they look really great.

46:04.840 --> 46:07.480
No Bluetooth is ideal to me.

46:07.480 --> 46:15.440
I'm coming around to the idea of just having everything I can on Wi-Fi and just like saturate that IOT network because I mean, that's you know, that's what I have it for.

46:15.440 --> 46:17.560
The other nice thing, though, about it, look at this.

46:17.560 --> 46:22.000
It's thirty it's thirty nine fifty for this Shelly plus H&T.

46:22.000 --> 46:25.880
It's a pre-order right now, but it's shipping, I think, like mid-August or early August.

46:25.880 --> 46:30.120
And it's e-ink is yours. Are the BLE ones also e-ink for the display?

46:30.120 --> 46:34.520
No, I don't think so. I think they use those typical kind of LCD segment displays.

46:34.520 --> 46:40.800
Yeah. So they're saying, you know, at least a year of battery life with the e-ink display.

46:40.800 --> 46:47.840
And then it has USB-C for always on power or, you know, charging.

46:47.840 --> 46:52.840
So one of the things I think I'm going to do is I'll have mine connected to USB power permanently.

46:52.840 --> 46:55.560
And so then they'd be reporting constantly.

46:55.560 --> 46:59.240
I just noticed this sucker needs four AA batteries.

46:59.240 --> 47:01.960
Yeah, that's quite a lot. Right.

47:01.960 --> 47:06.480
I'll just do continuous USB, so that way it's always reporting because I think that's the difference.

47:06.480 --> 47:09.480
Right. If it's on battery power, it wants to save that battery power.

47:09.480 --> 47:13.120
So it shuts everything down and home assistant loses connection with it.

47:13.120 --> 47:20.400
So the Shelly plus H&T I've already ordered, it'll be a bit and then I have not ordered yet.

47:20.400 --> 47:26.160
But I think this is going to be one of the next things I try from them is the Shelly plug, which is this is the U.S.

47:26.160 --> 47:32.880
edition and also, again, Wi-Fi, the smallest Wi-Fi plug I've ever seen.

47:32.880 --> 47:41.840
I've only seen Z-Wave devices this small, and that means it doesn't block the other power port on like a wall plug.

47:41.840 --> 47:47.080
You could stack two of them on one wall outlet. Doesn't require a hub.

47:47.080 --> 47:58.360
That looks to me like they're reusing the housing of the Tekin SP20 and actually the Cloudfree.Shop smart plug.

47:58.360 --> 48:00.480
I thought so, too. I thought it looked very similar.

48:00.480 --> 48:02.040
I did try to I thought the same thing.

48:02.040 --> 48:06.680
I tried to compare some pictures and I thought maybe I saw a few small housing differences,

48:06.680 --> 48:10.120
but it's like the same exact size, the buttons in the same place.

48:10.120 --> 48:15.080
I wonder if there's some kind of regulatory shortcut they've taken there with,

48:15.080 --> 48:19.280
you know, getting that particular device through the FCC or something like that.

48:19.280 --> 48:23.760
Just an interesting observation. Not all these smart plugs let you pull like a lot of power through.

48:23.760 --> 48:25.720
This thing can go up to like twenty five hundred watts.

48:25.720 --> 48:31.080
It can have going through it, which is great if you want to have like a space heater or a really powerful other device on there.

48:31.080 --> 48:35.280
And it does power metering. So it'll do live power collection stats.

48:35.280 --> 48:37.440
I'm hoping that that'll just feed right into Home Assistant.

48:37.440 --> 48:40.800
But we shall see when I do finally get around to ordering these.

48:40.800 --> 48:48.600
So those are what I'm looking at right now is these Shelly's and I'm hoping that this will be kind of the components I can put together,

48:48.600 --> 48:54.640
combined with keeping like the best of my Z-Wave devices, like I love my Aotech multi sensors.

48:54.640 --> 48:57.360
I'm hoping that I'll keep some of my Z-Wave devices.

48:57.360 --> 49:00.400
I'll eliminate some of the ones that are kind of a pain in my butt.

49:00.400 --> 49:07.240
I'll eliminate some of the HomeKit devices and I'll replace them with some Shelly, Shelly and maybe something else.

49:07.240 --> 49:11.080
I'm actually would really like to know people's recommendation and what they've done here.

49:11.080 --> 49:16.320
I'd be interested to see what you think of replacing the firmware on a couple of the Shelly devices.

49:16.320 --> 49:20.120
It's a pretty common thing to do. Some people put TAS motor on them.

49:20.120 --> 49:22.920
I've done that in the past and it's worked out just fine.

49:22.920 --> 49:26.000
Other people swear by putting ESP home on them instead,

49:26.000 --> 49:32.080
which opens up a similar level of configuration to what you can do with the the default Shelly firmware.

49:32.080 --> 49:35.960
So a couple of options for you to try and I'd be curious to get your feedback on that.

49:35.960 --> 49:38.560
And is there any reason not to just keep the Shelly firmware?

49:38.560 --> 49:46.240
It's a great question. I mean, it's the do you fully own it unless you have a fully open firmware on their question?

49:46.240 --> 49:49.600
Because you can, perhaps.

49:49.600 --> 49:53.360
You know, honestly, for us, that might just be enough of a reason.

49:53.360 --> 49:56.200
Did you see Home Assistant did announce today as we're recording?

49:56.200 --> 49:59.360
They do have their first works with Home Assistant partner announced.

49:59.360 --> 50:05.240
Yeah, it's great, isn't it? I do wish they'd announced the program and the partner at the same time.

50:05.240 --> 50:07.320
That would have been a much better announcement, if you ask me.

50:07.320 --> 50:11.760
But I'm extremely pleased to see that they've got Levitan on there, which is a huge brand.

50:11.760 --> 50:16.680
You'll see those guys in Home Depot and lots of other big DIY stores around the Earth.

50:16.680 --> 50:19.440
So great job to the Home Assistant team there.

50:19.440 --> 50:24.640
Yeah, that's a good get. Makes me kind of want to go check out some of their gear and their Z-Wave devices.

50:24.640 --> 50:28.000
Oh, here we go again.

50:28.000 --> 50:40.080
Visit humio.com. That's humio.com to ingest and view all of your logs in one place.

50:40.080 --> 50:44.280
Humio is a centralized log management and observability platform.

50:44.280 --> 50:47.240
Here we go. This is great, you guys.

50:47.240 --> 50:55.440
The company was founded by developers in Denmark in 2016 as an alternative to legacy logging solutions that were just crazy expensive.

50:55.440 --> 50:57.120
I had to deal with some of those in the old days.

50:57.120 --> 51:02.000
But I think the real beauty of Humio is that it can take logs from any source and then make them usable.

51:02.000 --> 51:05.280
You don't need to constantly massage and tweak the format.

51:05.280 --> 51:06.840
It doesn't need a schema.

51:06.840 --> 51:10.160
You just pump all your logs in there and they're ready when you need them.

51:10.160 --> 51:12.640
And the dashboard is great.

51:12.640 --> 51:14.120
The platform is pretty crazy, actually.

51:14.120 --> 51:22.000
Humio's index free architecture means that you can ingest over a petabyte of data per day and then search that with sub-second latency.

51:22.000 --> 51:30.560
And what's just so great is Humio is 80 percent cheaper than competing platforms like Splunk or Elastic, thanks really to reduced hardware and the computational footprint.

51:30.560 --> 51:34.640
I think the best way to get going with Humio is probably their community edition.

51:34.640 --> 51:45.640
The Humio community edition is the largest no cost data ingestion offering on the market today, allowing you to ingest up to 16 gigabytes per day with seven days of retention.

51:45.640 --> 51:47.520
And it's not a trial period.

51:47.520 --> 51:49.520
You just got that for the long haul.

51:49.520 --> 51:56.720
This is perfect for us self-hosters who just want to get your logs in somewhere and get a single view of everything going on in your entire environment.

51:56.720 --> 51:58.160
This is it right here.

51:58.160 --> 52:08.720
Rather than having to do the separate places to look thing where you're checking all these different places and you miss something, Humio brings it all together and then you can correlate them in one place, which makes troubleshooting easier.

52:08.720 --> 52:12.080
You can look at your download speeds, water consumption, router information.

52:12.080 --> 52:13.600
I put all of my router stats in there.

52:13.600 --> 52:15.040
I've got electricity stats in there.

52:15.040 --> 52:16.960
You can visualize it with Humio.

52:16.960 --> 52:18.960
It'll help you monitor your power consumption.

52:18.960 --> 52:21.040
We have a listener in Australia who does just that.

52:21.840 --> 52:22.720
They go off grid.

52:22.720 --> 52:23.440
They got solar.

52:24.000 --> 52:26.560
They're bringing all of that into home assistant and no red.

52:26.560 --> 52:30.400
So they're getting real time information on what's using power.

52:30.400 --> 52:34.080
They're troubleshooting technical problems their neighbors think is the greatest thing ever.

52:34.080 --> 52:37.440
You got to go check out Humio and see what you can do for your environment.

52:37.440 --> 52:39.600
Get all of your logs into one place.

52:39.600 --> 52:42.800
I mean, when it's your hobby, you want it easy and quick, right?

52:42.800 --> 52:44.240
You don't want it to be the job.

52:44.240 --> 52:50.880
Let's go get started with Humio Community Edition for free right now at humio.com slash H-C-E.

52:50.880 --> 52:54.880
That's H-U-M-I-O.com slash H-C-E.

52:56.880 --> 52:57.360
All right.

52:57.360 --> 52:59.600
So Stuart wants a better smoke detector.

52:59.600 --> 53:00.720
Hey, Chris in the badger.

53:00.720 --> 53:03.040
I was wondering if you had a suggestion for a smoke detector.

53:03.760 --> 53:08.960
I've been using the trusty home assistant for about three years and so far I've managed to avoid the Z things.

53:08.960 --> 53:12.000
Thanks to Shelly, ESP Home and a few other useful tools.

53:12.000 --> 53:17.200
All the smoke detectors I've seen seem to depend on Z-Wave or ZigBee or whatever.

53:17.760 --> 53:25.520
Are there any other hybrid ones where it works well, but simply provides an interface via Wi-Fi to notify if away?

53:25.520 --> 53:26.800
Wouldn't such a thing be nice?

53:26.800 --> 53:33.200
And just to kind of go on top of that, Jonathan wrote in and said, I'm not actually so sure about these Z-Wave smoke detectors, guys.

53:33.760 --> 53:34.800
Time appropriate greetings.

53:35.840 --> 53:37.520
I had one for a couple of years.

53:37.520 --> 53:42.800
I ended up having to disconnect it when all of a sudden it started having false alarms every other day.

53:42.800 --> 53:45.520
I just couldn't find a solution and I had to tear them down.

53:46.400 --> 53:49.920
Yikes, because I have those Z-Wave ones that you find on Amazon.

53:49.920 --> 53:51.440
I have those right now.

53:51.440 --> 53:54.400
So hopefully they don't start giving me false alarms all the time.

53:54.400 --> 54:01.600
If there's one device that you don't want to be giving you false alarms or going wrong in any way, it's a smoke detector.

54:01.600 --> 54:03.840
And in a lot of ways, it's worse when you're not home.

54:03.840 --> 54:04.880
You know, you get the alert on your phone.

54:04.880 --> 54:06.320
You're like, is there anything wrong?

54:06.320 --> 54:08.880
You get the alert on your phone, you're like, is there actually a fire?

54:08.880 --> 54:10.000
I don't know.

54:10.000 --> 54:13.760
So our friends over at Shelley, boy, maybe Shelley should be advertising this week.

54:13.760 --> 54:19.440
They do have a Wi-Fi hubless smoke detector coming soon.

54:19.440 --> 54:20.800
It's not yet available.

54:20.800 --> 54:29.200
However, their gas detector, which can detect match gas and propane, those are available and shipping.

54:29.200 --> 54:32.960
So I imagine it's probably not too long until the smoke detector is available.

54:32.960 --> 54:40.640
I always consider Shelley, perhaps, but we'd love any ideas from the audience if you want to boost it in or go to selfhosted.show.com.

54:40.640 --> 54:41.680
Yes, we would.

54:41.680 --> 54:50.400
Now, Shiram writes in, every time you guys mention Jellyfin on your show, and that's quite often, I get a huge smile on my face.

54:50.400 --> 54:54.080
I'm a Jellyfin user and my girlfriend loves it a lot as well.

54:54.080 --> 54:59.040
I recently discovered a Jellyfin feature, which I'm excited about and wanted to share.

54:59.040 --> 55:08.000
You can change the complete look and feel of the Jellyfin UI, web and app by adding custom CSS, which then gets applied to all of your users.

55:08.000 --> 55:12.480
People have made very cool looking skins with lots of interactions.

55:12.480 --> 55:18.240
This can be configured in the admin dashboard general branding section of the settings.

55:18.240 --> 55:20.800
There'll be a link to documentation in the show notes.

55:20.800 --> 55:24.400
Maybe you guys already knew about this, but I still felt like sharing.

55:24.400 --> 55:27.200
Keep making podcasts. Cheers, Shiram.

55:27.200 --> 55:36.640
I kind of expect now the next time I come over to your house and I turn on the TV, I am going to get a fully Badger branded Jellyfin experience at Alex's house.

55:36.640 --> 55:41.120
I'm just going to brand it with those lady badges he used last week.

55:41.120 --> 55:43.600
Might as well. I'll get you the source material, right?

55:43.600 --> 55:46.880
Yeah, that's a neat idea. I could definitely see it, too, like in an office space.

55:46.880 --> 55:51.120
I've been in a dentist's office where they had some videos that were looping on a TV.

55:51.120 --> 55:52.160
Could be great for that.

55:52.160 --> 56:02.880
Or a school or something, some kind of educational environment, or even for your kids or something where you wanted to make it absolutely clear that it was a kid-friendly platform or something, I don't know.

56:02.880 --> 56:08.960
I'm still a Plex guy. I wish that Jellyfin was just a little bit better.

56:08.960 --> 56:17.200
It's getting close. It's getting really, really close. I'm excited for the future, but as of today, I'm still a Plex guy.

56:17.200 --> 56:24.000
My Plex server is off at the moment because it's too dang hot, so I just decided to just turn things off, you know?

56:24.000 --> 56:40.080
We got some boosts this week, and I want to take a moment and let you know that we have some links in the show notes because one of the things that we don't really mention, but it is intensely awesome in my opinion, is that the boosts are all self-hosted, open source, and it's all a peer-to-peer network.

56:40.080 --> 56:49.040
It's a messaging network that's peer-to-peer, and then it arrives on my server that runs here locally at the studio up in my office.

56:49.040 --> 56:59.280
It's a completely distributed, peer-to-peer, free software messaging system for you to send your feedback with a little bit of value attached into the show, and it is awesome.

56:59.280 --> 57:13.120
And I don't talk about it much because it's, you know, related to Bitcoin, but when you think about the technology that's being used, like my setup upstairs is an Umbral box which has a controller system that has a bunch of Docker containers underneath it that it's orchestrating.

57:13.120 --> 57:26.320
It's doing all kinds of stuff to run all of that locally, and I just love that it's become a great way for people to send messages into the show, so if you want to boost in, get a new podcast app at newpodcastapps.com.

57:26.320 --> 57:42.480
Marcel came in with 1,997 SATs. He says, Alex, I'm curious what service you use to ship things overseas. Do you have any advice on this? I am moving overseas soon, and I'm debating shipping all of my stuff, or maybe just buying new. What do you think?

57:42.480 --> 57:53.440
Oh man, this was a whole process. When we emigrated, we moved from London to Raleigh, as I'm sure most people know, listening to this podcast because I talk about it all the damn time.

57:53.440 --> 58:03.680
But essentially, on the day in question, we actually moved out of London. All I had with me was a couple of suitcases and a backpack, and we didn't really have an awful lot with us.

58:03.680 --> 58:24.880
But for the preceding two or three months before the big move, we actually used a service. I think it was from Seven Seas Worldwide, and they had this three by six foot by eight foot container that we could rent a cube of. I think it's like a 40 foot container, and they give you this wooden pallet crate thing.

58:24.880 --> 58:42.560
So what we ended up doing was taping out on the floor, and I'll always remember this for the rest of my life, because we'd got rid of all the furniture in our house in London, and in the bedroom was this taped cube that I'd measured the height and the width, and I'd put masking tape on the floor, and I got boxes.

58:42.560 --> 59:01.040
And right next to it, because the whole house was being renovated and completely refloored, ready to sell it, I was cramped in this little corridor next to like eight, ten feet worth of boxes on this little rollout camp bed mattress with a sleeping bag thing. It was a fun memory.

59:01.040 --> 59:15.360
But yeah, Seven Seas Worldwide, and what happened was they came to our house in London, and there was a man with a van. We picked up all the boxes and put them in the back of his van. The crate was in the back of the van already loaded, I guess, with like a forklift truck or something.

59:15.360 --> 59:34.880
They then sealed it up in front of us, put screws in it and a seal across it, and the next thing we saw, they gave us that sort of semi-regular shipping update. It's like we knew when it had left Folkestone in England. We knew when it had arrived onto the East Coast. I think it came in through New Jersey in the States.

59:34.880 --> 59:50.880
And then they give you, I think, like a two-week grace period to go and pick it up at the other end before they start charging you storage fees. And so we just waited for it to come in, tell us it had cleared customs, and then they said, right, you've got two weeks. Off you go. So we rented a van, drove up to New York or New Jersey.

59:50.880 --> 59:52.880
And then you were the man with the van.

59:52.880 --> 01:00:01.880
Yeah, I mean, some of these services do offer door-to-door service, but we were being a bit frugal, and so we were willing to do that last little bit of the adventure on our own.

01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:08.880
You must have still had to pick and choose what went, what you got rid of, what you tried to resell. There must have still been a lot of that.

01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:34.880
It's not a very big amount of space, let me tell you. I brought with me no soft furnishings, no couches, no beds. I mean, there was a couple of do-thes in there maybe, but honestly, I think we gave most of that stuff to family and friends. Tables, chairs, everything was, I was ruthless, absolutely ruthless.

01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:50.880
Our bikes made it in there, and there was a couple of bits of tech, like big floor-standing speakers and that kind of stuff. But yeah, for the most part, we just thought we're moving to America. The voltages are going to be different for a lot of the equipment.

01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:59.880
It's a chance for us, just turn 30, to kind of push the reset button on a lot of the hand-me-down stuff that we'd had over the years.

01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:17.880
So my advice, such as it is, would be try, and it's expensive, first of all. I think we paid like $3,000. I might be completely off base with that. It was in the two to three grand range, I think, to ship all that stuff over. It took about four months.

01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:30.880
But my advice would be sell as much as you can at your origin and buy as much as you can at your destination, whether it's all used at the destination or what have you, whilst the other stuff comes in from the boat.

01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:37.880
Because a lot of our kitchen stuff, like pots and pans and cutlery and all that kind of stuff, dishes, that was all on the boat.

01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:48.880
I ended up, on the first night I was there, going to Walmart and just filling up my trolley with like $500 worth of basic stuff like towels and plates.

01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:56.880
It was a real experience, particularly as that week there was a hurricane coming to Raleigh, so most of the rest of Walmart had been picked completely clean.

01:01:56.880 --> 01:02:01.880
I couldn't buy a tin of tuna, but I could go and buy a spatula. It was okay.

01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:07.880
Welcome to Raleigh. The Walmart's been ransacked. There's a storm coming. Yeah, dude, it was an experience.

01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:14.880
Not one I would ever wish to actually repeat because it was, you know, it's one of those things. It was super stressful.

01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:21.880
I bet. Yeah. But at the same time, I'm so glad I did it. And I wish Marcel the absolute best of luck with his move.

01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:27.880
Feel free to hit me up for any other questions you've got on Discord or Twitter or anything. I'll happily share my experience in a bit more detail.

01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:32.880
And there you are now visiting again, which is pretty great. It's been weird.

01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:37.880
We've done a whole lap of England this time up to the north and back down to the south again.

01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:45.880
And I'm used to driving long distances in the States now, like four hours, six hours, nine hour drives do not faze me in the slightest.

01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:51.880
But a couple of days ago when we were driving from Middlesbrough to Norwich, it was supposed to be a four hour drive.

01:02:51.880 --> 01:03:03.880
It took us six hours. And one of those hours, it wasn't even like we were stuck in traffic. It was just sort of stop, start that kind of annoying BS sort of traffic on the A1M past Peterborough.

01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:07.880
But then the worst part was the service station that we went into.

01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:17.880
So the best way I can describe this to you as an American is it's a bit like a rest stop, but a lot worse, a lot more cramped and not very nice.

01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:23.880
This particular one, it serves both carriageways. So there's a big roundabout above the motorway.

01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:29.880
Both directions come into this thing and they get funneled into these into the services off the roundabout.

01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:35.880
First warning sign should have been that there was a queue to get into the damn place.

01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:41.880
Finally, after like 15 minutes, we make it inside. We have a wee, we go and get a coffee, whatever.

01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:46.880
It took us 45 minutes to get out of the car park.

01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:54.880
I just I was absolutely raging. I was fuming. I was trying my best not to be angry in front of the baby because she doesn't like that.

01:03:54.880 --> 01:04:01.880
Yeah, but it's really hard not to get angry when you think I've got to be somewhere to be because I'm remote working in an hour.

01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:05.880
Yeah, it'd be hard to be at my best. I'm just sat here in traffic. Yikes.

01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:15.880
So anyway, I've had a lot of a lot of memories of why we left in the first place about how crowded England is and how expensive everything is and everything else.

01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:22.880
I do like it to visit, but I don't necessarily think I'll see myself moving back anytime soon.

01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:27.880
It's nice in short bursts, but I found it quite an adjustment to be back.

01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:30.880
Interesting. Yeah, I can totally understand that.

01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:37.880
Onk Busen with 8,520 sets says he absolutely loves the self-hosted podcast and want to say thanks for the show.

01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:46.880
So Chris and Alex, you guys make a good on air team. Do you have any tips for building a blueprint or maybe instructions for your self-hosted set up?

01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:54.880
And what you would do, maybe in the case of one of you dying, I don't expect my SO to keep my 30 plus services running.

01:04:54.880 --> 01:05:02.880
But there are certain pieces of data such as family media, scan docs, etc. that would really suck to be lost.

01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:06.880
How much time do you invest in this? Well, we just talked about this a little bit.

01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:15.880
I think, Alex, you have the right note. I don't think Onk should go diagramming things and making essentially a visio map of the infrastructure.

01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:19.880
I don't think anybody's going to be able to interpret that in his absence.

01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:24.880
I think your route, a simple printout, just the basics is probably the better way to go.

01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:32.880
I think we've talked about this before, and the conclusion we came to was, sadly,

01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:37.880
nobody else cares about your set up quite as much as you do.

01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:46.880
I know it's a hard pill to swallow, but if I think about deaths in my life where we've lost a family member or something,

01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:52.880
there's been a meticulously crafted stamp collection involved, for example.

01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:58.880
I'm just not interested. I don't know enough about it. I don't really understand the why behind it.

01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:03.880
You take it to a collector and hope you get a good price for it when you sell it on.

01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:12.880
It's probably a similar situation when all of my hardware, if and when I pass, all of my crap.

01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:15.880
That extends to digital media as well.

01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:20.880
The one exception I would place on that is things like photographs and documents and things.

01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:26.880
I would try and make sure that there are clear instructions for how family members can access that kind of thing written down somewhere.

01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:33.880
But beyond that, largely speaking, I think it's just your media collection, for example.

01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:39.880
You've just got to accept that's your hobby, that's something you enjoy, but other people probably will just pay for Netflix.

01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:46.880
I wish I could think of a better term, a market opportunity for this.

01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:55.880
Honestly, when it comes to photos and certain documents, I would like it to just be super straightforward for my spouse to get access to that stuff.

01:06:55.880 --> 01:07:02.880
Or you think about if you've got Bitcoin stored and you pass away and maybe there's thousands of dollars worth of value in there, how do you pass that on to them?

01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:07.880
Photos, which some people would consider to be absolutely priceless.

01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:13.880
I'm surprised that this hasn't been properly addressed in some...

01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:20.880
Synology doesn't have an add-on for this, right? There's not a QNAP app to do this.

01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:25.880
Home Assistant hasn't solved it yet either, but it does seem like somebody should.

01:07:25.880 --> 01:07:31.880
The thing is with photos in particular, though, is in the old days, photos were quite limited.

01:07:31.880 --> 01:07:35.880
Maybe a roll of film had, what, 24 or 36 shots on it.

01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:37.880
Right. You had a few photo albums.

01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:44.880
It was a real process, whereas now I take a dozen or more photos every single day.

01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:50.880
For someone else to go through that in any kind of detail, it's not going to mean an awful lot to them.

01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:57.880
Sure, I wish there was a curated album of life moments or life events or what have you that they could access,

01:07:57.880 --> 01:08:03.880
but they're not going to want to see every single time my daughter ate a strawberry.

01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:05.880
This is a feature in PhotoPrism, right?

01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:11.880
Import a deceased member's photo library, not to be morbid about this, but just think about it.

01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:17.880
Import a PhotoPrism, let you do that, and then you could train it what type of photos that you're the most interested in.

01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:23.880
Go through 50 of them, flag the ones you think is best, have it build a model of some kind,

01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:28.880
and then it just auto-generates a best of from their photo album for you.

01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:34.880
Honestly, even that is probably more effort than most people would be willing to go through,

01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:36.880
but having something like that would be nice.

01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:44.880
It just tries to pull out some of the best, gets rid of the thousands of pictures of your feet that you took while you were opening the app.

01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:46.880
Absolutely.

01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:52.880
Now, if you want to come to London and take lots more pictures of your feet with me in front of the London Eye,

01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:58.880
make sure you're going to the meetup page at meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting for all the latest details on that meetup.

01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:01.880
Are you going to post pictures on Twitter so we can see them?

01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:07.880
I will do my best, yeah, but I plan on the day in question to actually be busy meeting people, that's kind of the idea, right?

01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:08.880
Yeah, that's true.

01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:12.880
Okay, other people take pictures for Alex, would you?

01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:14.880
Because otherwise I'm not going to get any pictures.

01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:18.880
We need like a nominated driver, like a nominated photographer.

01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:19.880
All right, well, we'll wrap it up.

01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:24.880
Thank you everybody who else boosted in Trev Dev, user 5619, and of course,

01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:32.880
CastPlan boosted in with 3690 SATs, go grab Boost CLI or a new podcast app and we'll have links to Shelley Flood

01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:37.880
and the other stuff that we talked about, including the links to the information about the Lightning Network,

01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:41.880
if you want to figure out how to set up your own channels, if you're going to be boosted frequently and all that stuff.

01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:48.880
And then last but not least, let's say big thank you to our SREs, our site reliability engineers,

01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:52.880
our members who support the show, they get an ad free show and they get the post show,

01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:54.880
something only our members get access to.

01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:57.880
You can join us at self hosted dot show slash SRE.

01:09:57.880 --> 01:09:58.880
Thank you.

01:09:58.880 --> 01:10:04.880
You give us the runway to say yay or nay to individual sponsors that approach us that don't fit.

01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:08.880
And that really I mean, that makes you our number one customer.

01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:10.880
And I think that's that's a big deal.

01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:15.880
Alex, where can people get a hold of you for like meetup stuff between now and the meetup actually starts?

01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:17.880
What's the best avenue to get you quick?

01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:20.880
I think Discord's probably the best place at Alex KTZ.

01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:21.880
There you go.

01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:28.880
Of course, the podcast is on Twitter at self hosted show and the whole dang network at Jupiter signal.

01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:32.880
And of course, if you're on the West Coast, we got a whole bunch of meetups coming in September.

01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:33.880
Yes, we do.

01:10:33.880 --> 01:10:39.880
And if you're interested in coming to the JPL tour, those of you that listen to luck probably already have all the details.

01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:42.880
There are a limited number of spots available.

01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:45.880
I think it's in the region of 15 or something like that.

01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:51.880
Where can folks go to enter the raffle that you're running to to get a spot on that tour, Chris?

01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:53.880
Linux Unplugged dot com slash JPL.

01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:55.880
It's just a quick next cloud form.

01:10:55.880 --> 01:10:57.880
And then we're going to pull some names.

01:10:57.880 --> 01:10:59.880
We only have about 15 slots.

01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:02.880
We're going to pull some names and we're going to pull a few backup names.

01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:08.880
The only thing that we ask is that please make it like if you sign up, please make sure you can be there.

01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:11.880
Please make it because there's only so many slots.

01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:12.880
So that's it.

01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:20.880
Linux Unplugged dot com slash JPL and that will be on September the 29th, I believe, at about noon on the West Coast.

01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:21.880
Yes, exactly.

01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:22.880
So thanks for listening, everybody.

01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:43.880
That was self hosted dot show slash 76.
