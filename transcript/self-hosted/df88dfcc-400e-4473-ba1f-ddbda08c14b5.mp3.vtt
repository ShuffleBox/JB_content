WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.680
We teased last week, Chris, that you've been doing some camera stuff, right?

00:03.680 --> 00:07.480
And I think I certainly because I'm just about to buy a house.

00:07.840 --> 00:12.240
I certainly want to know more about your cameras, the good and the bad.

00:12.920 --> 00:14.920
But let's just address the elephant in the room.

00:14.920 --> 00:17.480
You were pretty hard on Shinobi last week.

00:17.480 --> 00:20.680
First of all, congratulations on the news on the new house.

00:20.680 --> 00:22.920
That's going to be epic project material for the show.

00:23.120 --> 00:25.040
That's amazing.

00:25.040 --> 00:26.960
Yeah, so last week we talked a little bit about Shinobi.

00:26.960 --> 00:28.720
I'm a Raspberry Pi four.

00:28.720 --> 00:30.160
It was going bad.

00:30.160 --> 00:32.760
I don't know if you remember, but I was like pegging out the CPUs

00:32.760 --> 00:34.960
and I hadn't even added all the cameras yet.

00:34.960 --> 00:36.520
Three cameras is what you said.

00:36.520 --> 00:40.680
Yeah, well, I'm happy to say I've got five cameras now

00:40.880 --> 00:45.920
and the CPU usage is high, but that's because I've also turned on motion

00:45.920 --> 00:49.320
detection and recording, which saves some storage space.

00:49.720 --> 00:52.760
So you're able to get five cameras with all of those kind of

00:53.760 --> 00:56.960
advanced features working through a Pi four.

00:56.960 --> 01:02.520
Yeah, I suppose for full disclosure, the fifth camera is more of an on or off.

01:02.520 --> 01:07.680
I actually set up my dash cam as a camera feed that feeds into the Shinobi DVR system.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.600
Of course you did.

01:10.200 --> 01:11.640
So I just turned that one on or off.

01:11.640 --> 01:16.680
So that's not motion detection based because that's that's really where

01:16.680 --> 01:17.800
a lot of the process here goes.

01:17.800 --> 01:19.400
Alex is the motion detection.

01:19.400 --> 01:24.840
Turns out last week I was trying this out on Ubuntu LTS and fine

01:24.840 --> 01:28.440
distro Alex, but not quite there for the Raspberry Pi four yet.

01:29.320 --> 01:33.000
And when I switched over to Raspbian, when I just nuked and paved

01:33.000 --> 01:37.080
and rebuilt it on Raspbian, when I when I selected the hardware

01:37.080 --> 01:39.960
acceleration options and I could just choose auto, but when I just

01:39.960 --> 01:45.160
turned them on in Shinobi works with Raspbian and my CPU used

01:45.160 --> 01:47.160
to just completely drop to the floor.

01:47.280 --> 01:48.680
It was just it was gone.

01:48.760 --> 01:49.680
So what is that then?

01:49.760 --> 01:51.960
It must be some hardware acceleration at play here.

01:51.960 --> 01:56.160
Yeah, I think so, because like every now and then the camera feeds

01:56.160 --> 01:58.200
just kind of stop recording.

01:58.760 --> 02:02.400
And I think it's like a GPU acceleration failure.

02:03.440 --> 02:05.920
So about every couple of days I've rebooted the box.

02:06.440 --> 02:09.960
Now that I've switched over to motion capture, that hasn't been an issue yet.

02:10.000 --> 02:13.320
But so maybe I should recap a little bit.

02:13.320 --> 02:18.000
Just to remind you, I have those wise cameras, those little $25 wise cameras.

02:18.360 --> 02:20.720
I've mounted them all around the inside of my RV.

02:20.720 --> 02:24.640
Had to run like the USB cords and stuff, which is what it is.

02:25.280 --> 02:28.200
But I popped on a new firmware onto those wise camps.

02:28.240 --> 02:28.960
It's pretty simple.

02:28.960 --> 02:32.560
You just download their official RTSP firmware file.

02:33.280 --> 02:37.440
The downside is, is I don't think it's really quite feature complete compared

02:37.440 --> 02:39.160
to the official official firmware.

02:39.160 --> 02:39.760
What do you think?

02:39.920 --> 02:42.680
As I understood it, it's like a fork in time.

02:42.760 --> 02:46.920
So they, it's not a build that they keep up to date with the modern features.

02:47.280 --> 02:50.360
I believe they fork every couple of months, although there's no

02:50.360 --> 02:55.000
commitment to doing so that is so here's a snapshot in time with RTMP turned on.

02:55.280 --> 02:57.040
We'll release another one when we feel like it.

02:57.360 --> 03:00.000
It seems to be like a very highly demanded feature though.

03:00.000 --> 03:04.080
So it's unlikely they're going to abandon it, but quite frankly, my goal

03:04.080 --> 03:07.160
here is to cut these things off from the internet anyways.

03:07.560 --> 03:09.760
So I, I care less.

03:10.360 --> 03:13.040
Why do you need a dash cam into Shinobi?

03:13.040 --> 03:15.480
Like are you using one of those wise cams as a dash cam?

03:15.880 --> 03:16.200
Yeah.

03:16.240 --> 03:16.440
Yeah.

03:16.440 --> 03:19.360
I haven't actually gone down the road yet, but I have one set up looking

03:19.360 --> 03:21.080
out the windshield in your car.

03:21.320 --> 03:22.080
Oh, on the RV.

03:22.320 --> 03:22.880
Oh, okay.

03:23.120 --> 03:23.480
Wow.

03:23.520 --> 03:27.400
I mean, if you're driving a flipping bus down the road, I can see, I can see

03:27.400 --> 03:28.440
that little camera not being a thing.

03:28.440 --> 03:30.960
I was thinking in your golf, man, I was trying to figure where that

03:30.960 --> 03:32.320
little thing fitted in your golf.

03:33.120 --> 03:35.520
No, I put it up front there and, uh, we'll see.

03:35.680 --> 03:38.800
I haven't actually been on a road trip with it yet to test it, but anyways,

03:38.800 --> 03:41.120
I got this RTSP firmware, popped it on the file.

03:41.120 --> 03:45.760
You just rename it to like demo dot bin, I think reboot the cameras

03:45.760 --> 03:47.080
holding down the setup button.

03:47.080 --> 03:50.040
They'll detect the file and just reflash themselves.

03:51.000 --> 03:55.120
And your real only immediate tell, unless you memorize the version numbers

03:55.120 --> 03:59.800
is when you relaunch the wise app, they'll now be an advanced RTSP section.

04:00.080 --> 04:01.000
You can turn that on.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.960
It'll give you the URL and you can plug that in anything.

04:04.680 --> 04:08.960
Uh, VLC, Shinobi, there are a few things though to make it work, right?

04:09.000 --> 04:13.280
So if you want to try this Alex, I put a link in the show notes, um, on an

04:13.280 --> 04:17.520
article that tells you how to optimize Shinobi for RTSP capture, because there

04:17.520 --> 04:21.800
are a couple of things that aren't necessarily obvious, especially if you

04:21.800 --> 04:25.760
want to grab the audio and maybe the other disclaimer of using these wise

04:25.760 --> 04:30.560
cams like this is they don't support that device standard that so many

04:30.560 --> 04:31.880
security cameras support.

04:32.680 --> 04:35.160
I think it's what, Oh, Oh, N VIF or whatever.

04:35.440 --> 04:36.080
What's that for?

04:36.080 --> 04:42.680
It's like a standard control and features baseline that all cameras, if

04:42.680 --> 04:45.520
they're certified to support this, then, you know, you can plug them into

04:45.520 --> 04:49.680
whatever security software and control it remotely, make it pan or tilt or

04:50.000 --> 04:51.880
get certain time information off of it.

04:52.120 --> 04:53.120
So what is it like?

04:53.120 --> 04:55.320
Um, not E P N P what's the other one?

04:55.320 --> 04:57.480
D D N L a or something.

04:57.520 --> 05:00.400
Is it a similar kind of universal protocol like that?

05:00.840 --> 05:04.160
Yeah, you could think of it, but in terms of like, this is how I control

05:04.160 --> 05:08.280
certain aspects of the camera, um, so then vendors of software can just make

05:08.280 --> 05:11.960
a general interface that works with any camera that meets the standard.

05:12.320 --> 05:14.600
The wise don't have that, but they're $25.

05:14.640 --> 05:17.280
So you can forgive a lot for that price.

05:17.280 --> 05:20.680
Can't you, the $25 and the other thing that surprised me, and I haven't pushed

05:20.680 --> 05:24.800
it beyond two, but I have a feed that's going into Shinobi on that Raspberry

05:24.800 --> 05:29.760
PI 24 seven, but I also can pull them up in home assistant and I can pull them

05:29.760 --> 05:30.440
up an MPV.

05:30.440 --> 05:33.480
So I now have a tab and home assistant that's called my security tab.

05:33.960 --> 05:39.360
And in there, I have a, a tile for each camera and a tile for each motion sensor.

05:39.920 --> 05:42.520
And I've also integrated our ring camera.

05:42.520 --> 05:42.720
Yes.

05:42.720 --> 05:44.200
I got one of those a long time ago.

05:44.800 --> 05:49.440
I no longer have an active subscription, but I do have an account still and I have

05:49.440 --> 05:52.400
an API key so I can actually pull the ring feed into home assistant.

05:52.800 --> 05:54.440
So that's kind of a neat real time snapshot.

05:54.760 --> 05:55.600
That's really neat.

05:55.640 --> 05:55.960
Yeah.

05:56.440 --> 05:59.400
I wanted to ask you actually, so remember when you were doing the

05:59.400 --> 06:04.440
security, so remote access for Shinobi and I guess home assistant as well.

06:04.440 --> 06:09.000
I'm going to add to my question trying to use the wise app is a bit rough remotely.

06:09.040 --> 06:13.760
I found, um, I don't know if that's just the URLs I'm using or whatever, but I

06:13.760 --> 06:14.840
haven't had great success.

06:14.840 --> 06:17.880
Like my nest cam, which again, I bought a long time ago.

06:18.840 --> 06:22.200
I can just pull that up wherever I am in the world and it just, just works.

06:22.360 --> 06:24.480
And the wise cam doesn't do that for you.

06:24.480 --> 06:28.320
The wise app for some reason, no reliably, I can't seem to use the

06:28.320 --> 06:35.480
home I set in of that, I have not solved remote access yet.

06:36.320 --> 06:39.360
Theoretically I would solve it with a wire guard VPN.

06:39.560 --> 06:44.480
However, I am behind some enterprise grade double net systems here,

06:44.720 --> 06:46.280
carrier grade as they like to call it.

06:46.600 --> 06:51.600
So I have this super convoluted system that I'm working on where I wire

06:51.600 --> 06:56.160
guide out to a remote system that establishes a two way tunnel.

06:56.160 --> 06:58.120
And then I remote from my other systems into that.

06:58.160 --> 07:01.520
I have IP table set up and some DNS and all of that.

07:01.520 --> 07:04.080
And it routes everything for me, but I haven't gone that far yet.

07:04.360 --> 07:09.320
So right now I use the wise app for remote access when I, when I need it,

07:09.320 --> 07:10.800
but I don't generally.

07:11.440 --> 07:14.000
So I'm really kind of using this to go back in time.

07:14.000 --> 07:17.560
If something were to happen, you know, maybe there was a mini fire or an

07:17.560 --> 07:20.440
accident with the kids or a mini fire.

07:20.920 --> 07:21.920
I still sound scary.

07:22.440 --> 07:23.720
Like a fridge fire, no big deal.

07:23.720 --> 07:26.720
Just burn up the whole side of the rig or something, you know, maybe for

07:26.720 --> 07:31.680
insurance purposes, I want that or burglars comes in or some crazy listener.

07:31.680 --> 07:32.240
I don't know.

07:33.360 --> 07:35.280
It's all on camera, crazy listeners.

07:35.680 --> 07:37.480
I have had them show up at campgrounds.

07:37.480 --> 07:39.400
I have had them knock on my door at rest stops.

07:39.440 --> 07:39.920
I love it.

07:39.960 --> 07:42.600
Actually, most of the time when we're on the road, I love it.

07:43.240 --> 07:46.600
Um, one time and I bet he's listening, somebody showed up.

07:46.600 --> 07:51.760
We were in Montana and we were in a gravel lot and somebody

07:51.760 --> 07:55.480
came, pound, pound, pound, police, open up on my door.

07:57.200 --> 07:58.880
My heart just dropped.

07:59.320 --> 08:01.400
Like I just stopped breathing for a second.

08:01.400 --> 08:04.600
I opened up the door and it was a listener is just screwing with me.

08:05.520 --> 08:06.040
Good job.

08:06.040 --> 08:08.760
You know, I felt if I ever get the chance to troll you like that,

08:08.760 --> 08:10.080
I would definitely do that.

08:10.280 --> 08:10.840
It's all right.

08:10.840 --> 08:11.240
It's okay.

08:11.240 --> 08:11.600
I'm good.

08:11.600 --> 08:12.040
I'm good.

08:12.400 --> 08:13.440
Just makes me jumpy.

08:13.640 --> 08:15.640
Luckily I live far enough away that it's unlikely.

08:15.640 --> 08:18.720
I'm just going to turn up at a random parking lot with dupes.

08:19.520 --> 08:20.360
Unless they come to you.

08:20.360 --> 08:23.360
And we should clarify, by the way, we had a few people that didn't actually

08:23.360 --> 08:25.240
know that Chris lives full-time in an RV.

08:25.480 --> 08:25.680
Yeah.

08:25.680 --> 08:27.040
Since, uh, what?

08:27.040 --> 08:30.680
I mean, it's been about five years now I've upgraded once in there.

08:30.680 --> 08:32.360
So I've been in this one for about four years.

08:32.840 --> 08:33.720
Full-time yeah.

08:33.720 --> 08:37.160
With the wife and the kids and a dog, we affectionately call it

08:37.160 --> 08:38.520
lady dupes on the network.

08:38.560 --> 08:41.880
So we have JB one, which is the studio that we record most of the podcasts

08:41.880 --> 08:44.560
from in Seattle anyway, Chris and Wes.

08:44.920 --> 08:49.320
And then, um, lady dupes is Chris's home on wheels, I guess.

08:49.320 --> 08:54.160
Yeah, the remote studio set up with, uh, multiple cellular networks

08:54.280 --> 08:56.920
and, um, a little recording spot.

08:57.360 --> 08:59.160
So I can do shows from the road.

08:59.160 --> 09:03.080
I can work from the road, but we also have offline media part of my, well,

09:03.080 --> 09:06.520
this is all part of my project off-grid is to really, really make that thing

09:06.520 --> 09:08.640
a fully workable machine, even without internet connection.

09:08.640 --> 09:13.480
And that's why I wanted to get these cameras into Shinobi is I was slipping

09:13.480 --> 09:16.480
into, uh, the Logitech circle cameras.

09:16.480 --> 09:19.360
They're not great, but they're kind of the best cloud connected

09:19.360 --> 09:20.800
priced camera in my opinion.

09:21.600 --> 09:25.520
And then you have things coming along like the blink cameras that are really

09:25.520 --> 09:29.080
cheap and then the wise cameras came out at $25.

09:29.120 --> 09:30.200
Yeah, they cleaned up.

09:30.400 --> 09:34.720
So the fact that I could get something at that cloud connected or cloud

09:34.720 --> 09:39.080
subsidized price, but then I can use it for my, my own offline system.

09:39.320 --> 09:41.320
It makes me comfortable putting these throughout my house.

09:41.720 --> 09:45.480
Cause before that, if you wanted to have a camera that was cheap, you pretty

09:45.480 --> 09:50.680
much, you know, at that $25 price point, it was, in fact, it was pretty impossible

09:50.680 --> 09:52.400
to beat that price, to be honest.

09:52.480 --> 09:56.200
Um, but you could put a, you know, a raspberry pie with a raspberry pie cam

09:56.200 --> 10:02.200
somewhere and that would get you in the sort of $40, $50 price point.

10:02.200 --> 10:05.640
But even so at that point, like the, the other ones you mentioned, like the

10:05.640 --> 10:10.680
logi stuff, the blink, et cetera, like the nest stuff, I mean, the nest is

10:10.680 --> 10:14.880
expensive, but it's a, it's nice physical hardware, like it's machined to

10:14.880 --> 10:16.440
aluminium and all that kind of stuff.

10:16.440 --> 10:18.240
It looks nice.

10:18.280 --> 10:23.040
Um, so the cameras that I've been looking at for my new house, um, which hopefully

10:23.040 --> 10:27.480
I'll move into in about six to eight weeks, um, I don't want wifi cameras.

10:27.520 --> 10:30.600
So this is for me, the biggest downfall of the wise cameras.

10:30.800 --> 10:35.360
I've got two or three here and they're perfectly fine, but frames drop on

10:35.360 --> 10:41.640
occasion and some, you know, it's chewing up wifi bandwidth where if I'm buying a

10:41.640 --> 10:44.440
house, I'm going to live there for the next 10, whatever years you're going to

10:44.440 --> 10:48.200
wire them, I'm going to run a cable, you know, I'm not driving down the road like

10:48.200 --> 10:50.920
you, I'm going to run a cable and kind of run POE.

10:50.960 --> 10:52.240
It's going to be a POE camera.

10:52.560 --> 10:53.280
Good for you.

10:53.520 --> 10:57.160
So I'm looking heavily at the unified gear right now, but damn, it's expensive.

10:57.280 --> 10:57.720
Yes.

10:57.880 --> 11:01.200
I just, just one 1080p camera is about 130 bucks.

11:01.600 --> 11:05.800
I know my entire setup is probably under $300, including the

11:05.800 --> 11:07.360
raspberry PI to record it.

11:07.360 --> 11:11.920
Now that does not include storage, which right now is still in flux.

11:11.920 --> 11:16.560
I'm cheating and I'm using a big old thumb drive as I experiment, but I like

11:16.560 --> 11:18.760
what you're doing because you're investing in something that could

11:18.760 --> 11:20.720
last you a very long time.

11:20.960 --> 11:21.480
I hope so.

11:21.560 --> 11:24.640
I don't, I don't consider these wise cameras probably more than

11:24.640 --> 11:26.560
like a three year setup.

11:26.840 --> 11:27.720
They're disposable, right?

11:27.720 --> 11:29.600
They're like the little windup cameras you used to have.

11:29.840 --> 11:31.960
So you could do a full POE setup.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.880
You could do high resolution that could be swapped out to even higher

11:34.880 --> 11:36.200
resolution down the road.

11:36.720 --> 11:38.360
What are your minimum requirements?

11:38.360 --> 11:38.760
Do you think?

11:38.760 --> 11:44.640
One for the driveway, one internally on the front and back doors and, uh, the

11:44.680 --> 11:47.520
other, uh, in the garage too, cause that's another ingress point.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.800
That's one of the last cameras I did here at the studio, because I did a trial run

11:51.800 --> 11:53.160
of this camera set up here at the studio.

11:53.160 --> 11:56.400
So I have a similar wise setup here at the studio.

11:56.400 --> 11:57.360
In fact, even larger.

11:57.360 --> 12:00.080
And my favorite camera is the one in the garage, surprisingly.

12:00.360 --> 12:00.840
Yeah.

12:01.240 --> 12:01.560
Yeah.

12:01.600 --> 12:05.280
I like to just, like, if there's a noise or something, I like to check in and make

12:05.280 --> 12:07.760
sure that everything's okay and the car is okay.

12:07.760 --> 12:11.080
So where my desk is in this current house, I can't see the front door.

12:11.400 --> 12:15.800
So I have, I have a monitor up top and I just throw my nest driveway feed

12:15.800 --> 12:16.680
up there all the time.

12:16.680 --> 12:20.200
So when I'm just sat here working from home, I can just, you know, glance up and

12:20.200 --> 12:21.360
say, oh, that's what that noise was.

12:22.120 --> 12:26.480
But in terms of my requirements, self-hosting obviously, uh, is important.

12:26.520 --> 12:30.680
I don't want to have to pay a subscription, um, for two reasons.

12:30.720 --> 12:35.760
One is it's a hidden cost effectively in the ticket price of the item.

12:35.760 --> 12:39.200
You know, you, you spend, let's say for a nest cam.

12:39.200 --> 12:41.600
I know I keep coming back to those, but that's cause that's the ones I have.

12:41.640 --> 12:42.720
I have two of those right now.

12:43.680 --> 12:48.960
You spend a hundred plus dollars, nearly 200, I think on the external one on a

12:49.000 --> 12:53.640
camera, and then you've got to spend another 50, 60 bucks a year for

12:53.640 --> 12:54.920
their cloud connected service.

12:54.920 --> 12:59.760
Now I appreciate for most people, that's a great solution because for most people,

12:59.760 --> 13:02.520
they don't want to have hard drives in their house.

13:02.520 --> 13:03.600
They don't want to have to think about it.

13:03.600 --> 13:06.000
It's just press a button done. Thank you for me.

13:06.000 --> 13:09.960
I've already got a hundred terabytes in my basement, so I may as well use that

13:09.960 --> 13:15.160
with the unify, uh, NVR stuff that they, that they let you self-host.

13:15.480 --> 13:17.880
Would you put a nest camera in your bedroom?

13:18.280 --> 13:19.640
Well, I've already got a Google home in there.

13:19.640 --> 13:24.600
So a camera though, that's doing person detection and object detection and sound.

13:24.640 --> 13:25.960
I don't need a camera in the bedroom.

13:26.480 --> 13:27.520
Nobody wants to see that.

13:29.080 --> 13:32.960
The very powerful object detection and person detection that comes with the

13:32.960 --> 13:37.640
nest cameras is also, I think what's gives me out and I'm not necessarily cloud

13:37.640 --> 13:38.160
bad guy.

13:38.640 --> 13:43.680
I do want to be comfortable walking around on camera, just being myself.

13:43.720 --> 13:47.880
Maybe I'm in a robe or something like that, uh, in the RV because of such a

13:47.880 --> 13:53.000
small space, I literally have nearly full camera coverage of everywhere in the

13:53.000 --> 13:53.920
entire RV.

13:54.360 --> 13:58.200
So there's really no way where you can be off camera unless you're in the

13:58.200 --> 13:58.720
bathroom.

13:59.200 --> 13:59.560
Yeah.

13:59.560 --> 14:03.720
And so I really wanted to be comfortable when I looked up and looked at that

14:03.720 --> 14:07.840
camera lens and saw that light was on, I didn't want to be thinking about where

14:07.840 --> 14:10.680
that could get, could get processed or get stored.

14:10.880 --> 14:14.680
Well, there was that whole thing, wasn't there with the, uh, was it Siri?

14:14.720 --> 14:17.560
I think our Apple employees were listening into those recordings.

14:17.880 --> 14:21.720
Actually, I guess nest also has had a significant rash of people compromising

14:21.720 --> 14:25.560
accounts and then, um, like jumping on people's nest cams and talking through

14:25.560 --> 14:27.080
the two way microphone system.

14:27.320 --> 14:28.800
Have they, uh, didn't know that.

14:28.800 --> 14:32.560
Yeah, I heard some tech journalists ranting about it on a podcast recently.

14:32.560 --> 14:36.000
And then they looked into it and found that it's a fairly regular thing that

14:36.000 --> 14:37.920
they go out of their way to kind of keep quiet.

14:38.160 --> 14:43.000
Well, you would, if you were them, so, uh, you know, black Friday's coming up soon

14:43.000 --> 14:47.120
in the States and, uh, Best Buy have started their shenanigans already.

14:47.560 --> 14:49.080
Are you deal shopping already?

14:49.200 --> 14:49.760
Well, I am.

14:49.760 --> 14:50.120
Yes.

14:50.160 --> 14:54.160
Obviously I'm looking for appliances for the house, but couldn't help notice

14:54.160 --> 14:56.520
going in there, looking at TVs and stuff like that.

14:56.520 --> 14:58.120
I mean, what's a guy to do, right?

14:58.320 --> 14:58.800
Oops.

14:59.800 --> 15:08.440
I haven't bought anything yet, but they have a 75 inch, uh, LED LG TV for like $900.

15:08.480 --> 15:09.400
Stop it.

15:09.640 --> 15:10.120
Uh-huh.

15:10.200 --> 15:15.440
You don't even want to know what I spent for my first 60 inch Pioneer plasma.

15:15.600 --> 15:19.360
Well, I've got one of these TCL Roku jobs, uh, in my lounge right now, which

15:19.360 --> 15:23.760
I bought last year, I think it's 55 inches and it was like 300.

15:23.880 --> 15:24.360
I like it.

15:24.360 --> 15:24.560
Yeah.

15:24.560 --> 15:25.040
I remember.

15:25.040 --> 15:28.880
For the price, it's great that the image quality, uh, like, you know,

15:29.200 --> 15:30.440
dark scenes and stuff like that.

15:30.440 --> 15:34.040
Like the episode of game of Thrones a few months ago, that was just dark.

15:34.560 --> 15:37.520
Like all I saw was like compression artifacts.

15:37.520 --> 15:39.000
I literally couldn't see anything.

15:39.040 --> 15:40.320
That's my TV right now too.

15:40.520 --> 15:44.480
And I really want to get an OLED, but damn, they're expensive.

15:44.640 --> 15:44.920
Yeah.

15:44.920 --> 15:50.400
I feel like I'm going to wait one more cycle of television so that the top of

15:50.400 --> 15:55.600
the line bumps down one notch because one of, I think, I don't know, this could

15:55.600 --> 15:59.160
be past Chris being an idiot, which happens a lot, so future Chris will

15:59.160 --> 16:04.240
determine, but current Chris is thinking that home kit integration could be a

16:04.240 --> 16:08.600
pretty big deal in the televisions because I have had tremendous success working

16:08.600 --> 16:12.480
with home kit and home assistant, and there's no cloud connectivity required.

16:12.480 --> 16:13.440
It's all over the land.

16:13.440 --> 16:20.040
And so integrating input control and power control and things of that nature

16:20.120 --> 16:21.360
into home assistant.

16:21.400 --> 16:25.720
Well, did you know those TCL TVs, the Roku TVs have an API?

16:25.920 --> 16:29.560
Oh, so I mean, if one was willing, you could probably do it yourself.

16:29.720 --> 16:32.440
Well, I turn my TV on and off using curl effectively.

16:32.480 --> 16:33.880
It's just a command from home assistant.

16:34.360 --> 16:35.200
Oh, no kidding.

16:35.440 --> 16:35.440
Yeah.

16:35.440 --> 16:36.800
I do it already and it works great.

16:36.840 --> 16:38.440
Oh, that's wonderful.

16:38.480 --> 16:39.640
You can set inputs.

16:39.640 --> 16:41.000
You can turn the TV on and off.

16:41.040 --> 16:41.920
You can turn it off.

16:41.920 --> 16:43.480
You can turn the TV on and off.

16:43.520 --> 16:45.400
You can set the volume, all that.

16:45.440 --> 16:46.600
I'm legit jealous of that.

16:47.080 --> 16:51.160
Like, I think I'll tackle a full solar install and be completely off-grid

16:51.160 --> 16:53.080
before I get my TV fully automated.

16:53.760 --> 16:54.680
Yeah, probably.

16:54.880 --> 16:56.560
See, I had a Harmony hub before that.

16:56.560 --> 17:01.880
And again, that was a cloud connected device, which Logitech decided to switch

17:01.880 --> 17:05.680
the APIs off for in January or February this year.

17:06.680 --> 17:10.320
Right around the time I was getting into home assistant and writing that talk for

17:10.320 --> 17:15.840
LinuxFest Northwest that I was doing, you know, the DIY smart LEDs, which leads me

17:15.840 --> 17:19.600
very, very nicely into a little plug I wanted to do on the show today, which is

17:19.600 --> 17:25.240
that LinuxFest Northwest's 2020 is a call for papers is open.

17:25.360 --> 17:25.960
Yes.

17:26.320 --> 17:27.240
Are you going to submit?

17:27.440 --> 17:28.560
I am going to submit something.

17:28.560 --> 17:29.320
I don't know what yet.

17:29.840 --> 17:31.920
We've got about 60 days at the time of recording.

17:31.920 --> 17:34.120
So it closes like mid January, I think.

17:34.640 --> 17:39.560
Um, so yeah, if you've been thinking, oh, I'd like to talk at a conference, but I

17:39.560 --> 17:40.960
always miss the submission dates.

17:41.200 --> 17:43.400
You've got a couple of months, give it some thought.

17:43.400 --> 17:47.480
Don't rush into submitting upfront cause there's no benefit from doing that.

17:47.480 --> 17:51.520
Take your time, put together a good proposal, try and think of something

17:51.720 --> 17:52.840
that people want to listen to.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.080
I just got a great idea.

17:54.120 --> 17:55.200
I'd have to get clearance.

17:55.560 --> 18:01.120
What if I did a talk about the lady jupes automation, but at the start of my talk,

18:01.120 --> 18:05.160
everybody stands up and they follow me out to the RV and I just give

18:05.160 --> 18:06.640
them a tour of it in person.

18:07.040 --> 18:07.800
Does that scale?

18:07.800 --> 18:11.400
Well, I'd have to do it in probably batches of like 10 people or something.

18:11.440 --> 18:11.720
Yeah.

18:11.720 --> 18:14.720
I mean, it's an RV, Chris, it's, it's small.

18:15.040 --> 18:17.160
Did you use how many people were in there for the barbecue?

18:17.160 --> 18:18.640
We probably had 15 people in there.

18:18.800 --> 18:19.160
Yeah.

18:19.200 --> 18:19.400
Yeah.

18:19.400 --> 18:20.960
It was, it was a whole thing.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.800
Um, I'd, I'd love that though.

18:22.800 --> 18:25.600
Like if, if you've got some legit automations finished by then.

18:26.000 --> 18:26.280
Yeah.

18:26.560 --> 18:29.600
So far, this has been our most comfortable summer just due to the

18:29.600 --> 18:30.920
automations that I have got.

18:31.880 --> 18:33.600
When you can make your quality of life better.

18:33.800 --> 18:34.080
Yeah.

18:34.600 --> 18:36.800
You know, that's something I was thinking about talking to you about with these

18:36.800 --> 18:41.160
cameras, one of the things I noticed when I was taking my time and kind of doing

18:41.160 --> 18:44.720
it slowly and, and applying some craftsmanship to it, like we talked about

18:44.720 --> 18:50.040
with Wendell, I got a much deeper sense of satisfaction when the work was over.

18:50.400 --> 18:53.920
Like, and it struck me cause I'd had a day where like a lot of things were

18:53.920 --> 18:56.560
thrown at me cause I'm doing some traveling and all this stuff had come up

18:56.600 --> 19:02.480
and it was like this crazy weekday and I got home and I had a little bit of time

19:02.480 --> 19:06.920
in the, in the, in the evening and I had the energy and so I banged out a few of

19:06.920 --> 19:10.520
these things and got the, you know, the Shinobi system reloaded and got the, got

19:10.520 --> 19:14.240
the, got the two additional cameras installed and I had did a really good

19:14.240 --> 19:19.000
job with the wiring and I, I, like I showed you, I Velcroed the components

19:19.000 --> 19:21.040
inside the dinette seat.

19:21.040 --> 19:23.800
So everything looks and is routed really clean and nice.

19:23.800 --> 19:27.240
And the power cables are all clean and it's really proud of myself.

19:27.560 --> 19:31.200
And I had like this sense of accomplishment after having kind of a rough

19:31.200 --> 19:34.320
day where I was kind of like, I got knocked down all day long.

19:34.680 --> 19:37.800
I came home and, and like, I felt really good about what I had done.

19:37.800 --> 19:41.120
And I realized that that's sort of like, my dad used to talk about, he'd come

19:41.120 --> 19:45.960
home and he'd work on like part of the deck and fix that part of the deck in

19:45.960 --> 19:49.160
the evening and feel he'd have a rough day at work, but at least he got that

19:49.160 --> 19:50.720
damn deck fixed, you know?

19:51.680 --> 19:54.480
And that's, that's how this, even like working with home assistant and

19:54.480 --> 19:56.040
automating things has made me feel.

19:56.040 --> 20:01.360
Making stuff, whether it's, uh, home automation or whether it's 3d printing

20:01.360 --> 20:06.760
or building something out of wood, I, I just, I need to do something, uh, I

20:06.760 --> 20:10.440
know home assistant isn't analog technically, but a lot of the stuff

20:10.440 --> 20:15.240
it's controlling is so, for example, I had to, um, replace the, this is a

20:15.240 --> 20:16.480
rental house I'm in right now.

20:16.800 --> 20:20.440
And I replaced the, uh, thermostat controller board thing on the wall

20:20.440 --> 20:24.080
that changes the, the AC and the furnace.

20:24.080 --> 20:27.000
Uh, I replaced that with a nest thermostat that someone was selling

20:27.040 --> 20:28.560
cheap locally on Craigslist.

20:28.920 --> 20:30.080
They found it off the back of a car.

20:31.680 --> 20:32.480
No, I don't think so.

20:32.600 --> 20:33.480
In the boot, I should say.

20:34.200 --> 20:35.320
Uh, in the trunk.

20:36.200 --> 20:36.280
Yeah.

20:36.280 --> 20:39.760
I had to learn all about, you know, HVAC wiring over here.

20:39.760 --> 20:43.000
You know, there's five, like wires that do different things.

20:43.000 --> 20:46.760
And like, you just trace one end to the control board down in the basement.

20:46.760 --> 20:49.400
And then there's five wires at the top, the same color, and you just

20:49.400 --> 20:50.800
figure out which one goes where.

20:50.800 --> 20:55.720
Um, and for me, it was really interesting because the HVAC unit, like the wire that

20:55.720 --> 21:00.360
had been run was a five core wire, but only four wires were in use with the old

21:00.360 --> 21:03.720
one and someone has just stuffed the fifth one back in the wall.

21:03.760 --> 21:04.840
And I, so I didn't know it was there.

21:04.840 --> 21:08.040
So I went to Home Depot and I bought a five core thing and I was prepared

21:08.040 --> 21:08.880
to pull it all through.

21:08.880 --> 21:12.280
And then I went down to the basement to look at the other end of the wire.

21:12.280 --> 21:14.280
And I was like, there's a loose wire here.

21:14.680 --> 21:15.440
Oh, shit.

21:16.240 --> 21:17.120
That's both great.

21:17.160 --> 21:18.840
And also a bit of a pain in your back.

21:18.840 --> 21:21.360
Yeah. So I've now got a five core wire sat here.

21:21.360 --> 21:25.080
I've opened, but I don't know what to do with, um, but I learned a bunch

21:25.080 --> 21:28.520
of stuff that, that weekend, uh, like you say, it's, it's that sense of

21:28.520 --> 21:33.200
accomplishment that self hosting and self building and making and all that

21:33.200 --> 21:36.680
kind of stuff is, is really, you know, not to be underestimated.

21:36.920 --> 21:37.280
Yes.

21:37.320 --> 21:40.560
And I, I just didn't expect that.

21:41.040 --> 21:43.920
Um, I got into this for practical reasons.

21:43.920 --> 21:48.240
I wanted to, to really just sort of declutify the RV and be able to go offline

21:48.240 --> 21:52.680
completely so I could go like kind of on a tech diet over a weekend, somewhere

21:52.680 --> 21:56.680
with no connectivity, because I just didn't really expect that applying a

21:56.680 --> 21:59.720
little bit of craftsmanship to it and taking, making it take a little bit

21:59.720 --> 22:00.920
longer, but doing it right.

22:00.920 --> 22:03.160
We give me that much more sense of satisfaction.

22:03.720 --> 22:06.600
Um, and I'm proud of that system.

22:07.160 --> 22:09.800
And I'm really proud of the system we've built here at the studio as well.

22:10.120 --> 22:13.720
Not quite as good as I thought it was going to be, but it's, it's, it's

22:13.720 --> 22:17.440
quite as much craftsmanship, but it's running really well.

22:17.920 --> 22:21.240
And yeah, we didn't expect like to get that sensation from this.

22:21.240 --> 22:23.680
I just thought it'd be a practical thing.

22:24.040 --> 22:28.440
It's it speaks to the, one of the key points of my, uh, Lennox fest Northwest

22:28.440 --> 22:32.720
talk this year, which is solve a real problem because if you do that, you have

22:32.720 --> 22:36.120
the motivation to see the project through to the end, and then once you've done

22:36.120 --> 22:38.880
one, you're like, well, that actually wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.

22:39.120 --> 22:39.880
What else can I do?

22:40.160 --> 22:43.640
That has helped with Shinobi because to be honest, it's sometimes it's

22:43.640 --> 22:44.760
felt a little rickety.

22:45.120 --> 22:46.880
It feels sort of like it's tossed together.

22:46.880 --> 22:47.880
It's kind of awkward.

22:47.880 --> 22:54.160
It has, it has a bunch of different user levels and a super URL that's only used

22:54.160 --> 22:58.960
for really managing users and restarting services, and it's kind of an odd duck.

22:59.360 --> 23:03.080
And you need to really kind of follow docs and read community

23:03.080 --> 23:04.880
threads to, to put it all together.

23:05.600 --> 23:07.960
I'd ran the wires, I'd set up the cameras.

23:07.960 --> 23:09.600
I invested all of that time and money.

23:10.120 --> 23:13.240
And so I just sort of kept plucking at it until I, you know, had wittled

23:13.240 --> 23:15.080
into a setup that's mostly good.

23:15.080 --> 23:19.520
I'm, I'm now going down the route of experimenting with motion detection,

23:20.080 --> 23:25.000
which is interesting because you take the camera shot that comes in the GPU

23:25.000 --> 23:30.360
processes it, then it sends it off at a lower frame rate to FFmpeg, which then

23:30.360 --> 23:33.760
analyzes it for motion using a series of MPM plugins.

23:34.280 --> 23:37.200
And then if it detects motion above a threshold that you set.

23:37.200 --> 23:39.480
So my case, I have them pretty low.

23:39.480 --> 23:44.120
So if there's 2% motion in the frame, so that's like 2% of the area

23:44.120 --> 23:45.920
changes, it triggers motion.

23:46.280 --> 23:47.680
You can change that to whatever you'd like.

23:47.680 --> 23:52.120
You can also say, if, if it exceeds a certain level of, of motion,

23:52.160 --> 23:53.480
just don't bother, just drop it.

23:53.520 --> 23:58.480
That can be useful with an RTSP feed that has frame drops or like bars

23:58.480 --> 24:01.600
across the video feed that where you can see there's been some signal loss

24:02.040 --> 24:05.560
that you could essentially say, ignore if it's just what, if it's essentially

24:05.560 --> 24:08.040
the whole frame's changing, something's going on, drop that.

24:08.040 --> 24:11.800
But if it's somewhere between 2% and 70%, record that.

24:12.200 --> 24:13.440
So that's what I'm doing right now.

24:13.920 --> 24:18.560
And that uses CPU, but I'm saving disc because I'm only recording

24:18.560 --> 24:19.200
when there's motion.

24:19.200 --> 24:22.080
And I have some cameras that see very little activity during the day.

24:22.320 --> 24:27.360
And, um, getting that just right now is, is like a finessing process

24:28.040 --> 24:32.040
because each camera has different contents with different lighting

24:32.440 --> 24:33.600
and different areas.

24:33.920 --> 24:37.600
And I can go in Shinobi and I can highlight with boxes exactly the spot

24:37.600 --> 24:38.520
so I want motion.

24:38.840 --> 24:42.760
So in some cameras I have just the windows selected and the couch is

24:42.760 --> 24:43.720
completely out of the shot.

24:43.720 --> 24:46.080
So we can sit there on the couch and not trigger recording.

24:46.440 --> 24:46.720
Yeah.

24:46.720 --> 24:48.320
Those zones make a big difference.

24:48.480 --> 24:48.800
Yeah.

24:48.800 --> 24:50.400
And saves a lot of disc.

24:51.000 --> 24:51.280
Yeah.

24:51.640 --> 24:54.400
Unless you get it too sensitive and then it's just recording all the time.

24:54.400 --> 24:57.320
Like I did it first and it just blasted my desk.

24:58.040 --> 25:02.640
I have a, in my Google photos, I have a period from about three years ago where

25:02.640 --> 25:06.120
I started messing about with my own cameras for the first time where every

25:06.120 --> 25:09.160
single time my dog walks past the camera, I've got a snapshot of my lounge.

25:10.960 --> 25:12.120
There's thousands of them.

25:13.240 --> 25:13.520
Okay.

25:13.520 --> 25:17.440
So I just listened on my run this morning to last week's Linux action

25:17.440 --> 25:21.720
news, where you and Joe talked about, uh, proton male and hoard male and

25:21.720 --> 25:25.360
squirrel male and self-hosting all the males.

25:25.720 --> 25:29.320
And to that end, uh, we have a relevant ask SSH.

25:29.720 --> 25:30.360
Ah, great.

25:30.520 --> 25:31.720
It comes from Tom Broughton.

25:32.120 --> 25:35.560
Uh, one of the biggest questions I have is whether I should self host my

25:35.560 --> 25:40.040
own email or use something like the mail in a box I've been trying to

25:40.040 --> 25:44.080
get away from Google who hasn't, um, I write a lot of notes.

25:44.120 --> 25:47.240
I'm not convinced by proton male or others that require you

25:47.240 --> 25:48.720
to have their client installed.

25:49.040 --> 25:49.760
It's quite a long one.

25:49.760 --> 25:54.960
So I'll, uh, abbreviate, um, is self-hosting email robust and secure.

25:55.520 --> 25:57.080
What do you use?

25:57.440 --> 26:02.040
Is it worth the risk or would it be better to just pay or use a service

26:02.040 --> 26:03.440
that gives away your privacy?

26:03.440 --> 26:08.640
This is like, this is one that I debate in our Jupiter broadcasting

26:08.640 --> 26:14.800
telegram group frequently, because I am of like a dozen mindsets on this

26:14.800 --> 26:17.080
because part of me says, no, don't ever do it.

26:17.080 --> 26:18.240
It's way too much hassle.

26:18.600 --> 26:21.600
It's not so much the difficulty in setting up email.

26:21.600 --> 26:23.440
That's that can be relatively easy.

26:24.000 --> 26:27.960
It's that you get so frustrated when you get blacklisted and then your

26:27.960 --> 26:30.800
family in front of you and you're like, okay, I don't want to do this.

26:30.800 --> 26:33.840
I'm frustrated when you get blacklisted and then your family and friends

26:33.840 --> 26:36.480
are affected that are using the service and you have to hunt this thing down.

26:36.720 --> 26:38.040
And it's so insulting.

26:38.360 --> 26:40.480
It's so it's so irritating.

26:40.760 --> 26:41.760
Emails so basic.

26:41.760 --> 26:43.560
It should just effing work.

26:43.680 --> 26:44.040
Yeah.

26:44.080 --> 26:46.680
And what happens, it'll smack you when you least expect it.

26:46.680 --> 26:48.680
You'll be like seven months, a year into it.

26:48.680 --> 26:49.520
You'll be busy.

26:49.520 --> 26:50.240
You'll be traveling.

26:50.240 --> 26:51.880
You'll be on vacation or whatever.

26:52.280 --> 26:56.000
And it breaks eventually it will happen, but that's true of

26:56.000 --> 26:59.720
self-hosting almost anything, you know, home assistant, trust me.

26:59.720 --> 27:03.120
Break when you least want it to, when you're, you know, trying to do a

27:03.120 --> 27:07.240
demo to your mother-in-law of the ramifications though, of not receiving

27:07.280 --> 27:11.680
email can be pretty broad depending on the individual that's a fair point.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.240
Now here's another take on it.

27:14.680 --> 27:20.360
The federated by its basic nature aspect of email is vitally important.

27:20.520 --> 27:25.680
And I think it's critical that hobbyists continue to self-host

27:25.680 --> 27:30.400
email so that way it continues to be even a thing that's possible.

27:30.800 --> 27:33.920
Cause you could see this get locked down so that a certain agreements

27:33.920 --> 27:36.120
get set up by certain commercial carriers.

27:36.120 --> 27:40.320
And then they have like protected email that passes between their

27:40.320 --> 27:42.800
systems and people outside that might have to qualify.

27:42.800 --> 27:44.600
So, I mean, you never know where this could go.

27:44.880 --> 27:48.520
Don't we kind of have that with WhatsApp and telegram and like,

27:48.520 --> 27:50.600
aren't they miniature emails in a way?

27:50.600 --> 27:55.600
Or are they miniature IRCs or are they all just miniature using it?

27:55.600 --> 27:59.240
They're not decentralized at the core of, of email is it's a

27:59.240 --> 28:02.440
decentralized, anybody can do it protocol.

28:02.520 --> 28:05.840
Also, it's a handy to have a quick way to bounce out emails from

28:05.840 --> 28:10.600
systems that do reporting, you know, like my Shinobi system would be nice

28:10.600 --> 28:13.400
to just have a quick little easy way to send out some emails.

28:13.400 --> 28:14.840
There are several ways to do that, but.

28:15.120 --> 28:16.840
So I've never self-hosted my email.

28:17.480 --> 28:19.960
It's something that's crossed my mind on more than one occasion, but I

28:19.960 --> 28:25.080
just, whenever you tap that phrase into Google, should I self-host my email?

28:25.240 --> 28:28.400
The almost unanimous answer is no.

28:29.200 --> 28:29.440
Yeah.

28:29.440 --> 28:33.240
Well, that's because folks like me that set it up for themselves and for

28:33.240 --> 28:37.040
friends and for family and for companies over the years say, don't do it.

28:37.720 --> 28:39.080
Yeah, don't do it Alex.

28:39.280 --> 28:41.520
Cause there's the whole spam blacklisting thing.

28:41.520 --> 28:45.720
If your server gets compromised, some ISPs don't open certain ports.

28:45.720 --> 28:47.360
Although these days that's less of an issue.

28:47.360 --> 28:51.120
Yeah, well, it's difficult to understand how valuable of a target

28:51.120 --> 28:53.000
an email server is until you run one.

28:53.200 --> 28:54.680
You don't even have to be a popular one.

28:54.680 --> 28:56.480
You could have one with a dozen users.

28:57.200 --> 28:59.480
One of those accounts gets compromised and that server

28:59.480 --> 29:01.360
is immediately used for spam.

29:01.640 --> 29:02.800
It's, it's amazing.

29:02.800 --> 29:07.240
It's speed and efficiency at which these lists work just takes one weak point.

29:07.240 --> 29:11.120
It could be in your software stack, could be in a user account.

29:11.480 --> 29:14.920
So one of the listeners actually replied, Matty McGraw, who I think

29:14.920 --> 29:16.320
was our ask SSH last time.

29:16.320 --> 29:20.640
Oh yeah, he replied to the ask SSH, uh, as did you, cause this was a while

29:20.640 --> 29:25.280
ago with a link from our self-hosted, the Reddit self-hosted Reddit.

29:25.440 --> 29:29.880
And, um, the, uh, the title of the article is you should not run your

29:29.880 --> 29:32.160
own mail server because mail is hard.

29:33.120 --> 29:34.400
You know, lots of stuff is hard.

29:34.400 --> 29:35.480
That doesn't mean you shouldn't do it.

29:35.640 --> 29:36.480
I don't actually agree.

29:36.480 --> 29:40.560
Mail's hard either, uh, setting up a basic IMAP server and an SMTP

29:40.560 --> 29:42.800
server, that's not hard.

29:43.000 --> 29:44.280
Think about the price of entry, right?

29:44.280 --> 29:48.400
So th this article claims that he presupposes that you're a sys admin

29:48.400 --> 29:52.040
with tech knowledge, who knows basic networking, basic protocol

29:52.040 --> 29:52.960
knowledge, all that kind of stuff.

29:53.240 --> 29:53.600
I agree.

29:53.600 --> 29:58.480
You, you need to, so just to get to zero in this situation actually

29:58.800 --> 30:00.520
assumes a lot of basic knowledge.

30:01.160 --> 30:03.320
And you probably should be a fairly decent one at that.

30:03.760 --> 30:08.520
So the answer to the question, Tom, is probably not for most people.

30:08.520 --> 30:12.040
I would say it's, in my opinion, at least it's something I've never done.

30:12.040 --> 30:14.600
I don't have any desire to do it. Oh, I kind of do.

30:15.280 --> 30:19.160
Oh, but Gmail is so easy and I know that's a cop-out and they can mind

30:19.160 --> 30:20.480
my data and all that kind of stuff.

30:20.480 --> 30:24.600
But like you said, the ramifications of email not working, like I'm buying

30:24.600 --> 30:27.040
and selling a house right now, if those contracts can't come through.

30:27.680 --> 30:28.840
That's a problem for me.

30:28.960 --> 30:29.240
Yeah.

30:29.240 --> 30:29.760
Taxes.

30:29.760 --> 30:32.080
And it's a problem if I need to get emailed from the school about the kids.

30:32.080 --> 30:32.680
It's a problem.

30:32.680 --> 30:34.320
I mean, there's a lot of ways it's a problem.

30:34.720 --> 30:39.600
I would, if I was going to do it, look into what VPS people have had success

30:39.600 --> 30:40.080
doing it on.

30:40.080 --> 30:42.880
I don't think I would do it on my home connection unless I had a very kind of

30:42.880 --> 30:45.800
special home connection or a business connection.

30:45.960 --> 30:46.960
You raise a good point.

30:47.080 --> 30:51.960
My Gmail goes back to when I was, I was in lower sixth in England.

30:51.960 --> 30:56.200
So I guess I was 16, 17 when Gmail was brand new and invite only.

30:56.840 --> 30:58.240
I think that's 2005.

30:58.640 --> 31:02.160
So I've got emails in there going way, way back and I've quite often

31:02.240 --> 31:05.400
reconstructed portions of my life using my Gmail inbox.

31:05.600 --> 31:06.280
So has Google.

31:06.320 --> 31:07.240
Well, there you go.

31:07.240 --> 31:11.000
Every Amazon purchase, any receipt ever sent to your mailbox.

31:11.400 --> 31:12.080
Think about that.

31:12.480 --> 31:17.680
Saying that I got, I got a, an email or it was a targeted Facebook ad the other

31:17.680 --> 31:24.480
day, actually saying, Alex, are you missing home British airways for Christmas?

31:24.640 --> 31:26.360
Oh, wow.

31:26.480 --> 31:27.760
I thought that was kind of interesting.

31:28.400 --> 31:30.000
That's pretty clever.

31:30.200 --> 31:30.680
Yeah.

31:31.480 --> 31:34.160
I mean, would you have, maybe you were actually, I mean, if you weren't trying

31:34.160 --> 31:35.280
to buy a house, you might be.

31:35.280 --> 31:37.400
Right? Yeah, yeah.

31:37.400 --> 31:42.160
Um, uh, yeah, to be honest with you, like targeted advertising is a bit

31:42.160 --> 31:43.800
of a double-edged sword, right?

31:43.800 --> 31:48.840
I mean, on the one side, I don't want to see any ads ever, but in reality,

31:48.840 --> 31:50.040
that's not the world we live in, is it?

31:50.040 --> 31:52.560
So I'd rather see an advert about something that's relevant to me

31:52.560 --> 31:55.040
than, I don't know, shoe polish.

31:55.560 --> 31:59.080
I don't mind if Amazon wants to review my purchase history with their own

31:59.080 --> 32:01.880
servers and then figure out what I might be into that doesn't really

32:01.880 --> 32:02.800
bother me that much.

32:02.800 --> 32:07.840
It's more like the total surveillance to try to piece me up into many different

32:07.840 --> 32:09.480
markets for many different ad purposes.

32:09.480 --> 32:10.800
That's sort of what bothers me.

32:11.000 --> 32:11.520
Yeah.

32:11.840 --> 32:13.560
I, uh, I don't know.

32:13.560 --> 32:15.720
I feel like we should set ourselves a challenge.

32:15.960 --> 32:19.120
We're going to really regret something like this, but like some, something crazy,

32:19.120 --> 32:20.480
like I don't like where this is going.

32:21.160 --> 32:26.600
If we make it to 100 episodes to celebrate, we launch our own self-hosted

32:26.600 --> 32:28.840
mail server for our, for our email.

32:29.240 --> 32:31.720
We do some, you know, we get our email, we get our email, we get our email,

32:31.720 --> 32:34.160
we do something, you know, we get our own, like, you know, we, we could just use

32:34.160 --> 32:37.680
our self-hosted dot show domain and we could just have like show at, and we'll

32:37.680 --> 32:39.320
throw it on the raspberry PI seven.

32:42.840 --> 32:45.600
I just say, maybe we should, somebody should hold us accountable to that.

32:45.600 --> 32:47.000
Cause we'll surely forget that.

32:47.200 --> 32:48.400
I hope we do forget that one.

32:48.640 --> 32:49.000
Me too.

32:49.000 --> 32:53.680
But anyways, I'd say, I'd say consider all of, all of the things like do the

32:53.680 --> 32:57.280
research about where you'll be sending the mail from if it's had issues, because

32:57.280 --> 33:02.320
if you can just get on a list that an entire block of IPS, like an entire VPS

33:02.320 --> 33:06.440
provider can be blocked and maybe you've been a good citizen, you've never had a

33:06.440 --> 33:10.240
problem, but if anyone else in that IP block has, then you're pretty much

33:10.240 --> 33:10.560
screwed.

33:10.560 --> 33:12.840
So you really need to do some due diligence first.

33:13.000 --> 33:13.320
Yep.

33:13.600 --> 33:14.800
That's where email is hard now.

33:14.840 --> 33:16.480
It's not actually setting up the software.

33:16.720 --> 33:17.360
Totally agree.

33:17.960 --> 33:21.600
So before we go, I just remember the reason I even went, went to that best

33:21.600 --> 33:25.960
buy area of conversation was to bring up the 12 terabyte easy store hard drive

33:25.960 --> 33:26.640
situation.

33:26.640 --> 33:30.880
Oh, it wasn't a talk about beautiful 75 inch televisions.

33:32.080 --> 33:33.400
Wasn't to talk about TVs.

33:33.400 --> 33:39.200
It was to talk about hard drives, uh, $179, I think, um, right now for a 12

33:39.200 --> 33:43.560
terabyte hard drive in the U S um, so yeah, if you're in the market for that

33:43.560 --> 33:48.360
kind of thing, you can shut those drives, do the 3.3 volt mod that we talked about

33:48.360 --> 33:52.760
last week and get yourselves a darn good hard drive for a pretty unbeatable price.

33:52.760 --> 33:56.440
Yeah. Or grab some of those and just set your family up with

33:56.440 --> 33:57.600
backups for the holidays.

33:57.680 --> 33:57.920
Yeah.

33:57.920 --> 33:59.920
USB hard drives with a raspberry PI.

34:00.200 --> 34:00.600
Why not?

34:01.000 --> 34:01.480
Why not?

34:01.880 --> 34:02.320
Right.

34:02.360 --> 34:03.640
I think it's probably about that time.

34:03.640 --> 34:03.960
Don't you?

34:04.240 --> 34:05.320
Oh, all right.

34:05.720 --> 34:10.360
I really have had a lot of fun setting up these cameras and I can't wait to talk

34:10.360 --> 34:11.960
about some of the other things we've been working on.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.440
I know you've got some stuff coming up.

34:13.480 --> 34:13.920
Oh my gosh.

34:13.920 --> 34:16.880
Could you imagine the shows we're going to get out of you getting a new place?

34:17.280 --> 34:18.120
No, it's going to be good.

34:18.120 --> 34:23.560
I'm looking at running a cat six, a cable so I can do 10 gig ethernet and all this

34:23.560 --> 34:25.000
stuff, you know, it's going to be great.

34:25.120 --> 34:29.040
Oh, I, I think it might have to take multiple trips, just might have to come

34:29.040 --> 34:31.880
down there and maybe the timing once everything is settled would be around

34:31.880 --> 34:33.960
the spring by coincidence.

34:34.840 --> 34:35.240
Gosh.

34:35.280 --> 34:37.680
Well, I mean the things I'll have to do for this show next year.

34:39.040 --> 34:42.960
All I can say is Riley and April is a, well actually that's Linux fest Northwest.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.960
So March rally in March is lovely.

34:46.520 --> 34:47.640
Surprise, surprise.

34:47.640 --> 34:48.320
Surprise.

34:48.520 --> 34:49.920
Thank you for listening everybody.

34:50.000 --> 34:53.200
And you can find me on Twitter at ironic Badger.

34:53.520 --> 34:54.720

34:54.840 --> 34:59.320

34:59.840 --> 35:05.640
And you can find more of Jupiter broadcasting on Twitter at Jupiter signal.

35:05.840 --> 35:06.240
Yes.

35:06.480 --> 35:08.560
Maybe a quick plug for Jupiter extras.

35:08.560 --> 35:13.560
We've done some recent extras with the merger FS developer, as well as some

35:13.560 --> 35:17.040
basics on containers and reverse proxy.

35:17.040 --> 35:20.840
So extras dot show for additional and supplemental content to this year's show.

35:21.040 --> 35:22.040
So thanks for listening everyone.

35:22.040 --> 35:50.480
That was self-hosted dot show slash six.
