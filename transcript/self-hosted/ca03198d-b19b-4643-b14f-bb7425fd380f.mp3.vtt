WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.240
Would I be a bad man if I ran Arch on the server?

00:03.520 --> 00:06.560
You can't do that. Why not? You don't really do that, do you?

00:06.560 --> 00:09.920
I might. No, I don't, but I've often considered it.

00:09.920 --> 00:12.400
I stream a lot of important things from that server.

00:12.400 --> 00:15.440
I have often considered it. No, I use Debian primarily.

00:16.640 --> 00:20.960
However, lately I switched out to Ubuntu for the ZFS stuff.

00:22.320 --> 00:25.360
And this was after coming to Linux Fest Northwest in April.

00:25.360 --> 00:28.880
I listened to Jim and Alan Jude, who are very persuasive gentlemen.

00:28.880 --> 00:31.040
They are. They really can convince you.

00:31.040 --> 00:37.280
Yeah, and Ubuntu has ZFS baked into the user space tool.

00:37.280 --> 00:39.520
All you need to install is a user space tool.

00:39.520 --> 00:42.400
And in future releases, it sounds like it's getting even easier.

00:43.120 --> 00:46.800
For me, though, you just can't beat the stability of a Debian or a CentOS

00:46.800 --> 00:49.520
or something like that. Yes, on the server.

00:49.520 --> 00:51.120
On the server. Yeah, I agree.

00:51.120 --> 00:54.240
I think actually if I was going to pick one true OS to rule them all

00:54.240 --> 00:57.120
for my personal servers, I would pick Debian.

00:57.120 --> 01:01.600
Why? Because it is very much so out of many of the distros,

01:01.600 --> 01:04.640
the most set it and forget it. Even more so, I think, than CentOS.

01:05.520 --> 01:09.520
It's just my personal opinion, though. I don't actually run Debian.

01:10.160 --> 01:15.360
I get a good sense of stability whenever I run apps update or apps upgrade in Debian.

01:15.360 --> 01:19.040
There's maybe a dozen packages a week that change, if that.

01:19.760 --> 01:23.680
Well, I kind of feel like this question is sort of irrelevant too, in a way,

01:23.680 --> 01:29.600
because in the past, I would avoid using Debian because it was so slow moving

01:29.600 --> 01:31.680
that the packages would be horribly out of date.

01:31.680 --> 01:33.440
And so it was just not really a contender.

01:33.440 --> 01:35.600
That kind of moved me up to Ubuntu and things like that.

01:35.600 --> 01:39.600
But now I'm really, to be honest with you,

01:40.320 --> 01:42.000
of the opinion that it just doesn't matter.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.880
Whichever one you are comfortable managing.

01:44.880 --> 01:48.000
And what matters more is how you deploy and run the applications

01:48.560 --> 01:51.040
and how you secure them and how you manage all of that.

01:51.040 --> 01:53.040
That's like what I think matters a lot more.

01:53.040 --> 01:55.760
And then the OS is an implementation detail,

01:55.760 --> 01:57.680
and it just needs to be one you're comfortable with.

01:57.680 --> 01:59.120
Containers changed everything.

01:59.120 --> 02:03.040
Yeah, basically. Or VMs too. But for me, it was containers, really.

02:03.040 --> 02:05.120
Because VMs, you still had to answer that server question.

02:05.120 --> 02:06.880
Because VMs, you still got to pick an OS.

02:06.880 --> 02:12.160
Whereas a container, okay, the maintainer has picked a base image to base it off of.

02:13.440 --> 02:16.400
It could be an image based on Debian or Arch or Fedora

02:16.400 --> 02:20.880
or some other esoteric thing, Alpine or something.

02:20.880 --> 02:24.480
But when you're able to separate the application runtime from the base OS,

02:24.480 --> 02:29.760
you end up in a situation where, like you say, the base OS doesn't matter anymore.

02:30.240 --> 02:34.480
The only time it matters is when you want to have things like extra file system support,

02:34.480 --> 02:36.480
like Ubuntu's ZFS support.

02:37.280 --> 02:42.320
And Debian is still a bit old and crusty.

02:42.320 --> 02:45.280
And that's what makes it great, in a way.

02:45.280 --> 02:49.520
Well, okay, just going to throw this out to play devil's advocate.

02:49.520 --> 02:52.080
To play devil's advocate, just to have a rounder conversation.

02:53.120 --> 02:54.160
What about Windows Server?

02:54.880 --> 02:55.760
Well, what about it?

02:55.760 --> 03:01.120
Well, you get disk management in the typical Windows disk management stuff.

03:01.120 --> 03:03.600
You get some decent features with NTFS.

03:03.600 --> 03:06.720
You get shadow copy volumes for your users data to be safe,

03:06.720 --> 03:08.640
which is kind of a nice backup.

03:08.640 --> 03:11.360
You've got plentiful application availability.

03:11.360 --> 03:14.240
You've even got the capability of running containers.

03:14.240 --> 03:17.760
And Hyper-V isn't that bad of a virtualizer if you want to run VMs.

03:17.760 --> 03:19.440
Containers, in inverted commas.

03:20.240 --> 03:22.320
They're still running a Linux kernel somewhere.

03:22.320 --> 03:23.600
I know, but it works.

03:24.240 --> 03:27.600
So, I mean, what if Windows is the OS you're the most comfortable with?

03:27.600 --> 03:30.560
Because from where I've just positioned myself,

03:31.360 --> 03:33.040
I've kind of backed myself into that corner.

03:33.040 --> 03:35.200
Because if you're running the applications in a container,

03:35.200 --> 03:36.880
it doesn't really matter at the host OS.

03:36.880 --> 03:37.920
I was just that guy.

03:37.920 --> 03:40.000
To a point, here's my counter to that.

03:41.200 --> 03:46.560
Learning Linux is an incredible enabler from a career standpoint.

03:46.560 --> 03:47.280
Mm-hmm.

03:47.280 --> 03:50.160
You're investing in yourself by learning these things,

03:50.160 --> 03:51.840
by learning about what SSH is,

03:51.840 --> 03:54.720
by learning about port forwarding and opening things in your firewall.

03:55.360 --> 03:59.680
You're doing stuff that is being done in the enterprise,

04:00.240 --> 04:01.760
that is being done in business,

04:01.760 --> 04:04.640
that you go to your next job interview and you can be like,

04:04.640 --> 04:07.200
well, hey, I've done X, Y, and Z in my home lab.

04:07.200 --> 04:07.700
Mm-hmm.

04:09.200 --> 04:10.720
I run these services for my family.

04:10.720 --> 04:12.320
I run an XCloud instance.

04:12.320 --> 04:14.400
And then I had to set up a reverse proxy

04:14.400 --> 04:17.920
that means I don't have to open loads and loads of ports.

04:17.920 --> 04:20.160
I can just have a let's encrypt certificate

04:20.160 --> 04:22.480
that does this stuff automatically.

04:22.480 --> 04:25.040
And you can talk authoritatively in an interview on these topics.

04:25.040 --> 04:27.360
And that, for me, is the answer.

04:28.160 --> 04:30.960
Yeah, that was a big revelation I had not too long ago.

04:31.520 --> 04:37.040
I was using enterprise grade production deployed tools

04:37.040 --> 04:39.200
to run my home lab stuff.

04:39.200 --> 04:40.320
And I just thought for a second,

04:40.960 --> 04:42.720
it's been a long time since I've done that.

04:42.720 --> 04:46.800
Yeah, that is very much what learning Linux felt like back in the day.

04:46.800 --> 04:47.680
So that's a great point.

04:47.680 --> 04:50.720
And I can't argue it because the skill set of the future,

04:51.440 --> 04:53.760
I made this point on a Linux Unplugged recently,

04:53.760 --> 04:55.600
is, quote unquote, the cloud.

04:55.600 --> 04:57.200
When you look at open job searches right now,

04:57.200 --> 05:00.160
there'll be a couple thousand for a traditional sys admin.

05:00.160 --> 05:04.000
And then there'll be like 10,000 for a, quote unquote, cloud admin.

05:04.000 --> 05:04.560
Cloud.

05:04.560 --> 05:06.160
Yeah, well, the cloud's made of Linux.

05:06.160 --> 05:07.760
Just someone else's computer, you know?

05:07.760 --> 05:08.080
It is.

05:08.080 --> 05:10.960
Well, it can be your own computer in the case of our preference.

05:10.960 --> 05:14.240
This is something I wanted to ask you, what does self-hosted mean to you?

05:14.880 --> 05:18.880
For me, it's having something on a box that I control.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.280
I think that's kind of the root of it,

05:21.280 --> 05:27.840
because I consider servers that I run on DigitalOcean to be my boxes.

05:28.880 --> 05:32.080
Maybe that's not a safe illusion to be under,

05:32.080 --> 05:33.680
because in theory, they could just go in there

05:33.680 --> 05:35.600
and probably get access to that image.

05:35.600 --> 05:37.600
They have root access to the box they're all running on.

05:38.640 --> 05:39.920
So maybe I shouldn't feel that way.

05:39.920 --> 05:41.360
But I do right now.

05:41.360 --> 05:44.640
My current frame of thought is services I've implemented,

05:44.640 --> 05:49.520
data I'm responsible for, and applications and security

05:49.520 --> 05:51.200
that's totally under my control.

05:51.200 --> 05:51.440
Yeah.

05:52.080 --> 05:55.040
And there are a number of considerations you've got to make

05:55.040 --> 05:58.000
when deciding where to self-host a particular service.

05:58.800 --> 06:01.360
Do I host it in my garage or my basement or a closet?

06:02.080 --> 06:05.920
Or do I need more uptime than I can guarantee with that

06:05.920 --> 06:09.040
and put it on a droplet or an EC2 instance or something like that?

06:09.040 --> 06:10.880
And then obviously, you've got cost considerations

06:10.880 --> 06:14.720
when you come on to cloud hosting versus local hosting.

06:15.200 --> 06:18.640
So local hosting, you're going to be spending a lot of money upfront,

06:18.640 --> 06:22.240
probably at least $1,000 to build a system

06:22.240 --> 06:25.520
with half a dozen disks and multiple terabytes.

06:26.320 --> 06:28.960
Whereas the draw of something like a cloud service,

06:29.920 --> 06:31.200
what do you call it, a VPS,

06:31.200 --> 06:36.080
is that you can get started in, what, 35 seconds, 40 seconds?

06:36.080 --> 06:38.560
And maybe an entry price of $5 a month?

06:38.560 --> 06:39.120
Yeah.

06:39.120 --> 06:42.880
Which is much easier to eat than $1,000 upfront.

06:42.880 --> 06:46.000
And there's no power bill, there's no heat considerations.

06:46.720 --> 06:48.960
Because I built a new server in September last year,

06:48.960 --> 06:50.560
and I have some regrets, you know.

06:51.600 --> 06:52.100
Really?

06:52.100 --> 06:53.600
Mm-hmm.

06:53.600 --> 06:57.280
I'd like to talk about that, because I went through a phase

06:57.280 --> 06:59.840
where I went, I'm going to try to cloud all of the things,

06:59.840 --> 07:04.560
on boxes I run, and have only dumb, small appliances in the house.

07:04.560 --> 07:09.440
And now I'm swinging back to big rig, lots of disk,

07:09.440 --> 07:12.560
draws a lot of power, but also provides a lot of benefits.

07:12.560 --> 07:14.160
And I'm not having any regrets.

07:14.960 --> 07:17.440
Well, okay, so let me be more specific.

07:17.440 --> 07:20.800
I love having 100 terabytes on my LAN.

07:20.800 --> 07:21.300
Right.

07:21.680 --> 07:22.720
I love being able to...

07:22.720 --> 07:24.400
Just think of the cost to do that in the cloud.

07:25.280 --> 07:26.720
Well, but you wouldn't do that.

07:26.720 --> 07:28.560
It just takes it out as an option, basically.

07:28.560 --> 07:29.200
I wouldn't do that.

07:29.200 --> 07:31.440
I mean, I needed somewhere to store my drone footage,

07:31.440 --> 07:32.800
all of my photography stuff.

07:32.800 --> 07:35.120
Mm-hmm, same.

07:35.120 --> 07:37.360
And I'm sure you've got production requirements

07:37.360 --> 07:38.720
for your storage as well.

07:38.720 --> 07:41.760
But for me, looking at my power bill every month,

07:41.760 --> 07:47.440
my server draws, it's a dual Xeon, E5-2690v2.

07:47.440 --> 07:48.960
So they're pretty powerful CPUs.

07:48.960 --> 07:52.080
They score like 15,000 on PassMark each.

07:52.800 --> 07:56.560
So that is the minimum you want for a 4K Plex transcode.

07:56.560 --> 07:59.600
And do you find that your CPUs stay fairly active,

07:59.600 --> 08:01.280
like you are using that much horsepower?

08:01.280 --> 08:03.680
Because sometimes people, you know, they overbuild,

08:04.480 --> 08:06.800
which then gets you down to overpower.

08:06.800 --> 08:09.120
And that's where I thought I could go all appliance space.

08:09.120 --> 08:11.440
I could have just little small boxes of Raspberry Pi here

08:11.440 --> 08:13.920
and Nvidia Shield there, and then have all of the horsepower

08:13.920 --> 08:14.480
up in the cloud.

08:15.280 --> 08:16.080
That was my dream.

08:16.080 --> 08:17.120
I mean, it's tempting.

08:17.120 --> 08:17.840
It was.

08:17.840 --> 08:18.960
I'm looking at my server load here,

08:18.960 --> 08:20.080
and it's currently sat at 11.

08:20.800 --> 08:26.480
So, you know, 40 thread, 20 core boxes, CPUs.

08:26.480 --> 08:29.440
So the work is kind of bursty when those CPUs are actually in use.

08:29.440 --> 08:31.280
And otherwise, they're kind of sitting there idle.

08:31.280 --> 08:33.440
Yeah, like when a Plex transcode comes in,

08:33.440 --> 08:35.360
it'll burst the first 10 minutes,

08:35.360 --> 08:37.920
and then it will just sort of blip, blip, blip

08:37.920 --> 08:40.960
every few seconds, the next bit of transcoding.

08:40.960 --> 08:41.920
Well, that's a tough call, though,

08:41.920 --> 08:44.160
because you do want to overbuild at least a little.

08:44.160 --> 08:46.240
So it lasts a while and has plenty of headroom.

08:46.240 --> 08:47.600
Well, so here's what I found.

08:47.600 --> 08:50.720
Like Plex has this wonderful offline sync feature

08:50.720 --> 08:55.360
where I can effectively download and transcode media

08:55.360 --> 08:58.400
from whatever format Plex sees it in to my iPad

08:58.400 --> 09:02.320
or to my phone at 8 to 10x speed on these CPUs.

09:02.320 --> 09:06.080
I used to have an Atom C2750,

09:06.800 --> 09:09.200
one of these old ASRock boards, Atom 8 core things.

09:09.200 --> 09:10.080
And that was wonderful.

09:10.080 --> 09:15.360
It sipped power, had like a 30 watt kind of maximum power draw.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.080
And that worked great when it was just me doing Plex.

09:19.280 --> 09:21.200
But my new house, I have gigabit upload.

09:21.200 --> 09:23.520
And so I was like, well, let's share the love a little bit.

09:23.520 --> 09:25.760
Let's let, you know, you have access.

09:25.760 --> 09:27.120
My parents, you know, in England,

09:27.120 --> 09:30.480
and my uncle in Canada have access to this thing.

09:30.480 --> 09:34.000
And you think, well, I want to be able to do at least,

09:34.000 --> 09:36.160
let's say, 10 streams at once.

09:36.160 --> 09:37.680
And then when you start looking at that,

09:37.680 --> 09:39.280
there's a whole rabbit hole you could go down

09:39.280 --> 09:42.240
of doing hardware transcoding with this new Nvidia stuff,

09:42.240 --> 09:44.400
NVENC, which has come popularized

09:44.400 --> 09:46.160
because of Twitch streaming and that kind of thing.

09:46.160 --> 09:47.840
But does have some limitations.

09:47.840 --> 09:51.760
Yes, Nvidia arbitrarily limit their GPU drivers

09:51.760 --> 09:54.160
to two streams on consumer cards,

09:54.160 --> 09:55.920
like a 1080Ti for crying out loud.

09:55.920 --> 09:58.000
That's capable of doing 20 or 30 streams

09:58.000 --> 09:59.360
and they limit it to two.

09:59.920 --> 10:04.080
And really not all codecs and bit rates are supported.

10:04.080 --> 10:05.920
So if you want something that's more flexible,

10:05.920 --> 10:07.280
you still end up on CPU.

10:07.280 --> 10:09.840
So you still need to account for that in your CPU build.

10:09.840 --> 10:13.920
Yeah. And so going back a bit to my power bill,

10:13.920 --> 10:18.240
I look at these dual Xeons and they idle at around,

10:18.240 --> 10:21.200
I mean, there's 15 hard drives in this box as well.

10:21.200 --> 10:21.920
Yeah.

10:21.920 --> 10:24.720
But they idle, that box idles at around 300,

10:24.720 --> 10:26.400
box idles at around 300 watts.

10:27.520 --> 10:29.680
And now some rough maths that I use

10:29.680 --> 10:30.960
to calculate what that costs me.

10:32.000 --> 10:36.080
North Carolina, my power is about 11 cents per kilowatt hour

10:36.080 --> 10:42.080
and you can approximate that to roughly $1 per watt per year.

10:43.040 --> 10:47.120
So that server costs me approximately $300 a year to run.

10:47.120 --> 10:49.600
Now, if I was to look at what I could get in Digital Ocean

10:49.600 --> 10:52.240
or Amazon for that kind of money, wouldn't come close.

10:52.240 --> 10:56.880
Yeah. Not in horsepower and not in storage.

10:56.880 --> 10:59.040
And also bear in mind that you're getting the benefit

10:59.040 --> 11:00.800
of raw metal performance,

11:00.800 --> 11:03.680
not a virtual machine up on a shared system.

11:04.640 --> 11:06.480
So I run Proxmox as my base OS,

11:06.480 --> 11:08.240
which is based on top of Debian.

11:08.240 --> 11:10.560
And then all of my application workloads

11:10.560 --> 11:12.080
are within an Ubuntu VM,

11:12.080 --> 11:14.720
which I use pass-through on to send

11:14.720 --> 11:16.160
a couple of disk controllers through.

11:16.960 --> 11:17.760
And that works great.

11:17.760 --> 11:22.480
And I don't notice any performance penalty for real on that.

11:22.480 --> 11:23.920
But I can't help escape this thing,

11:23.920 --> 11:25.760
particularly with this new Ryzen launch.

11:25.760 --> 11:28.000
I can't help escape the fact that I could build a system

11:28.000 --> 11:31.840
with similar performance that only drew 100 watts from the wall.

11:33.200 --> 11:36.960
And I've still got the new Ryzen 3 Zen 2 stuff.

11:37.600 --> 11:39.440
I could have the same performance

11:39.440 --> 11:41.600
for less than half the energy draw.

11:42.720 --> 11:44.960
Yeah, but there's no way that math works out price-wise.

11:44.960 --> 11:46.560
Since you've spent the money on the server,

11:46.560 --> 11:48.720
it would take you so long to make that up.

11:49.280 --> 11:51.120
Yeah, I mean, a Ryzen build is going to cost me at least,

11:51.120 --> 11:52.960
what, $1,000, $1,500?

11:53.680 --> 11:55.920
To be honest for you, it's probably closer to $2,000.

11:55.920 --> 11:56.880
Come on, you know yourself.

11:58.480 --> 11:59.760
Yeah, and you know, there's another thing

11:59.760 --> 12:02.080
that this old enterprise gear has

12:02.080 --> 12:05.520
that you can't necessarily get cheaply

12:05.520 --> 12:07.600
on the AMD side right now, and that's IPMI.

12:08.320 --> 12:10.400
So I could log into my PFSense box from here,

12:11.520 --> 12:13.040
bring up the IPMI interface,

12:13.040 --> 12:16.640
and remotely see what is being output through the VGA port.

12:16.640 --> 12:19.280
I'm in Seattle, my server's in Raleigh, North Carolina,

12:19.280 --> 12:21.840
and I can just bring up the display as if I was there.

12:22.720 --> 12:24.800
KVM over IP, it's amazing.

12:24.800 --> 12:26.400
That is, especially when you have family members

12:26.400 --> 12:27.520
that are depending on it.

12:27.520 --> 12:29.360
That is really nice to have that.

12:29.360 --> 12:32.800
We use the word depending in inverted commas as well, I think.

12:32.800 --> 12:35.120
The whole thing is a big math equation to me.

12:35.120 --> 12:37.600
I look at what I expect this box to do,

12:37.600 --> 12:41.920
how core to my, how, quote unquote, dependent am I on this?

12:41.920 --> 12:44.480
How core to my daily use of my network is it?

12:45.040 --> 12:46.960
I.e., is it doing DNS?

12:46.960 --> 12:48.400
Is it doing DHCP?

12:48.400 --> 12:51.680
Is it doing Samba or NFS, some kind of storage?

12:51.680 --> 12:54.640
So then how performant does that need to be,

12:54.640 --> 12:56.480
and how dependable does it need to be?

12:56.480 --> 12:58.560
And then from that, I try to derive

12:58.560 --> 13:01.120
how reliable I need the server hardware to be.

13:02.240 --> 13:05.200
And then the only other kind of two factors

13:05.200 --> 13:09.360
I have to figure there is how much CPU and disk,

13:09.360 --> 13:12.160
because often the other things will drive the RAM requirements.

13:12.160 --> 13:17.280
And I often end up on a mix of x86 Xeon hardware

13:17.280 --> 13:20.880
with 64 gigs of RAM was kind of like my standard build right now,

13:20.880 --> 13:22.320
and then a ton of disk.

13:22.320 --> 13:23.360
And it is the same thing.

13:23.360 --> 13:24.480
It's drawing around.

13:24.480 --> 13:25.600
I don't think it's drawing that much.

13:25.600 --> 13:29.440
I don't have as many disks as you do, but it does.

13:29.440 --> 13:30.480
It does have a big cost.

13:30.480 --> 13:31.920
I look at it as a business expense

13:31.920 --> 13:36.160
since it is also file services for our team and whatnot.

13:36.160 --> 13:37.760
But it was a hard calculation to make

13:37.760 --> 13:43.360
because I did really like when I could go in lower power

13:43.360 --> 13:45.440
because I often went that also meant less noise,

13:46.240 --> 13:49.920
less heat, less costs, less complexity.

13:49.920 --> 13:52.560
So I do kind of want to encourage like when possible,

13:53.680 --> 13:55.440
don't overbuild if possible.

13:55.440 --> 13:57.840
I've kind of gotten away with that so far in the RV.

13:57.840 --> 14:00.880
I don't have any hard work equipment

14:00.880 --> 14:03.200
that requires a fan or anything like that running in the RV.

14:03.200 --> 14:05.840
It's all appliance space so far, but I can feel it slipping.

14:05.840 --> 14:06.800
It's slipping.

14:06.800 --> 14:08.880
You're not tempted to put a Pi in the RV then?

14:08.880 --> 14:11.520
Oh, I got like an idea for like three different ones right now.

14:13.280 --> 14:15.600
The Raspberry Pi fits in a weird place in all of this

14:15.600 --> 14:17.520
because it's perfect to run small stuff

14:17.520 --> 14:19.040
that doesn't have much IO.

14:19.040 --> 14:20.640
But the minute you want to attach

14:20.640 --> 14:23.600
more than one SATA type disk to it,

14:23.600 --> 14:26.240
you have to have lots of USB converters.

14:26.240 --> 14:28.480
And maybe with the four, we should do some testing maybe

14:29.520 --> 14:32.160
because they've separated out the ethernet bus

14:32.160 --> 14:33.600
from the USB bus finally.

14:33.600 --> 14:33.920
Yep.

14:33.920 --> 14:35.760
The early benchmarking I've done shows

14:35.760 --> 14:37.040
it really makes a big difference.

14:37.040 --> 14:37.520
I'm sure.

14:38.400 --> 14:40.960
So I think the four is the first Raspberry Pi

14:40.960 --> 14:43.920
that's truly ready to be a home server.

14:43.920 --> 14:47.120
And I think so regardless of what hardware you pick

14:47.120 --> 14:48.480
and regardless of what OS,

14:48.480 --> 14:50.080
even though I think we both kind of recommend

14:50.080 --> 14:51.600
if you're starting out, people try out Debian

14:52.240 --> 14:53.840
or Ubuntu therefore.

14:53.840 --> 14:54.800
Well, there are others.

14:54.800 --> 14:55.040
Yep.

14:55.040 --> 14:56.720
CentOS would be another good choice, I think.

14:56.720 --> 14:59.280
Well, we haven't mentioned FreeNAS or Unraid yet.

14:59.280 --> 15:01.440
Oh, I feel like we could have a whole conversation

15:01.440 --> 15:02.240
on those suckers.

15:02.240 --> 15:02.720
Right?

15:02.720 --> 15:03.120
Yeah.

15:03.120 --> 15:04.720
I mean, if you're just starting out,

15:04.720 --> 15:07.840
Unraid I would say is possibly the easiest thing around.

15:07.840 --> 15:08.480
Yeah.

15:08.480 --> 15:09.280
Is that good though?

15:10.880 --> 15:12.800
It's a proprietary piece of software

15:12.800 --> 15:14.240
which you have to pay a license for.

15:15.040 --> 15:16.880
So it's not completely free and open source

15:16.880 --> 15:19.200
like our Debian recommendation would be.

15:20.160 --> 15:22.800
And that's something that I struggle with quite often

15:22.800 --> 15:26.240
when speaking to people in Discord or on Reddit

15:26.240 --> 15:29.520
is trying to gauge you as a person.

15:30.960 --> 15:32.960
What are you trying to get out of this purchase

15:32.960 --> 15:33.920
or this build?

15:33.920 --> 15:36.320
Are you trying to learn skills

15:36.320 --> 15:39.600
that will make you more marketable for a job

15:39.600 --> 15:41.200
or are you just trying to solve a problem

15:41.200 --> 15:43.600
which is how do I stream media around my house?

15:43.600 --> 15:45.600
You could also be somebody who just likes to know

15:45.600 --> 15:47.040
how the things work

15:47.040 --> 15:49.040
and so you want to build it yourself, put it together.

15:49.040 --> 15:50.800
You want to know all the parts of the recipe.

15:51.440 --> 15:52.880
You know, what is the right box for you?

15:52.880 --> 15:54.080
Is it a Synology maybe?

15:54.960 --> 15:59.360
Is learning Linux the right thing for you to do whatsoever?

15:59.920 --> 16:02.160
There are so many options in this space.

16:02.160 --> 16:03.360
It can be bewildering.

16:03.360 --> 16:04.800
Bewildering as a new guy.

16:04.800 --> 16:07.280
It's like we need some sort of show

16:07.280 --> 16:10.000
that has time to discuss and explore

16:10.000 --> 16:12.160
all these different options and help sort all of this out.

16:12.160 --> 16:12.960
Something to help you.

16:13.600 --> 16:14.560
Is that what this is?

16:14.560 --> 16:15.120
Yeah, maybe.

16:16.960 --> 16:18.960
Maybe something to help you navigate those complexities.

16:18.960 --> 16:19.680
What a great idea.

16:20.240 --> 16:22.400
I think my other checklist

16:22.400 --> 16:23.840
if you're considering self-hosting

16:23.840 --> 16:25.280
is you need to be willing to take on

16:25.280 --> 16:27.600
some personal responsibility for security.

16:27.600 --> 16:28.320
Absolutely.

16:28.320 --> 16:31.600
You know, be willing to use SSH key authentication

16:31.600 --> 16:33.520
whenever possible, don't use passwords

16:33.520 --> 16:35.040
for any kind of login.

16:35.040 --> 16:38.320
Be willing to explore isolating applications and services

16:38.320 --> 16:41.520
either through VMs, through containers,

16:41.520 --> 16:42.960
whatever works for you.

16:43.680 --> 16:47.520
Also, where possible, restrict your file systems to read only.

16:48.240 --> 16:48.880
There's no read.

16:48.880 --> 16:50.240
If you don't need to have write access

16:50.240 --> 16:52.720
or if you can easily enable write access to make a change,

16:52.720 --> 16:56.880
consider that and also stay tuned for future discussions

16:56.880 --> 16:58.320
on setting up reverse proxies

16:58.320 --> 17:00.000
because that's going to be a key part of this too.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
You got to be willing to deep dive a little bit

17:02.000 --> 17:03.280
into reverse proxy.

17:03.280 --> 17:05.280
And if you're willing to do those kinds of

17:05.280 --> 17:08.480
self-responsibility items that aren't related to the CPU

17:08.480 --> 17:10.720
or the hardware or the operating system,

17:11.360 --> 17:13.360
if you're willing to do those things in addition,

17:13.360 --> 17:15.600
I think you're probably a good candidate to self-host.

17:15.600 --> 17:16.800
But the other thing is, right,

17:16.800 --> 17:19.520
if you were to just buy an off-the-shelf Synology

17:19.520 --> 17:22.880
or a QNAP or any of the other kind of NAS in a box

17:22.880 --> 17:23.920
like Drobo maybe,

17:24.640 --> 17:27.280
you're still going to have to figure a lot of this stuff out.

17:27.280 --> 17:30.240
The minute you, for me, what woke my mind up to all this

17:30.240 --> 17:32.560
was five or six years ago, I bought a Drobo,

17:33.600 --> 17:36.000
returned it because it was expensive.

17:36.880 --> 17:38.080
I've owned a couple of them.

17:38.080 --> 17:39.200
And then I bought a Synology.

17:40.720 --> 17:41.840
And then I sort of thought to myself,

17:41.840 --> 17:44.400
well, I've got this thing sat there with blinky lights

17:44.880 --> 17:46.800
that's on, what else can I do with it?

17:47.920 --> 17:52.080
And that single thought sparked my entire journey rabbit hole

17:52.080 --> 17:54.320
into, I guess, being sat here with you right now.

17:54.320 --> 17:58.560
Now, was that before you worked for Red Hat or was that?

17:58.560 --> 18:00.000
Oh, a long time, yeah.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
This was, I was still working at the Apple Store.

18:02.000 --> 18:02.640
Oh, okay.

18:02.640 --> 18:05.520
I was a genius on the genius bar at the Apple Store.

18:05.520 --> 18:06.880
You have that moment, you say to yourself,

18:06.880 --> 18:08.000
I want to solve this problem.

18:08.560 --> 18:09.200
What would it take?

18:09.200 --> 18:12.160
For me, it was a 1.5 terabyte Seagate hard drive,

18:13.040 --> 18:14.640
which are notorious now.

18:14.640 --> 18:15.680
They have a reputation.

18:16.560 --> 18:18.640
I woke up one morning, I powered my computer off this.

18:18.640 --> 18:19.600
I was still running Windows.

18:20.160 --> 18:21.040
I'm sorry to say.

18:21.040 --> 18:22.080
No, that's it.

18:22.080 --> 18:22.960
Windows happens, man.

18:22.960 --> 18:24.880
We're okay with that.

18:24.880 --> 18:25.920
I was still running Windows.

18:25.920 --> 18:30.320
I had a bunch of movies and TV shows on this 1.5 terabyte hard drive,

18:30.320 --> 18:32.080
which I'd ripped from DVDs I had.

18:32.080 --> 18:32.640
Oh, yeah.

18:32.640 --> 18:34.480
Oh, that's a labor of love.

18:34.480 --> 18:34.720
Yeah.

18:34.720 --> 18:36.400
And they were all beautifully categorized.

18:36.400 --> 18:36.720
Of course.

18:36.720 --> 18:37.440
And cataloged.

18:37.440 --> 18:40.160
You had a nice naming scheme for each file and everything.

18:40.160 --> 18:43.680
And I woke up one morning, pushed the power button on my desktop.

18:43.680 --> 18:43.920
Sure.

18:44.960 --> 18:46.000
And that drive didn't show up.

18:46.000 --> 18:46.960
And I'm like, what the F?

18:47.920 --> 18:48.800
Where has this gone?

18:48.800 --> 18:49.760
It was fine last night.

18:49.760 --> 18:52.320
Double click on all my computer, no D drive.

18:52.320 --> 18:53.840
And then you go in disk management, nothing.

18:53.840 --> 18:55.600
And you go into the BIOS, nothing.

18:56.400 --> 18:58.480
And when it doesn't show up in the BIOS, you're like, oh, crap.

19:00.080 --> 19:05.760
So I had a USB external hard drive, 3.5 hard drive.

19:06.640 --> 19:08.400
You can close your kind of thing to hook up.

19:08.400 --> 19:09.200
It was like a hot swap.

19:10.080 --> 19:11.600
I had one of those toasters.

19:11.600 --> 19:12.640
It's like a USB toaster.

19:12.640 --> 19:14.960
You put this full size drive in there.

19:14.960 --> 19:16.160
I love those things.

19:16.160 --> 19:16.400
Yeah.

19:17.360 --> 19:19.840
So they fulfill a use case that I wish I had.

19:19.840 --> 19:20.160
Right.

19:20.160 --> 19:21.120
I just don't have it.

19:21.120 --> 19:21.680
Never used.

19:21.680 --> 19:23.200
I bought one at home.

19:23.200 --> 19:24.320
And I bought one here at the studio.

19:24.320 --> 19:26.080
And I thought, I'll synchronize my data that way.

19:26.080 --> 19:28.320
I use it all the time, but nothing.

19:28.320 --> 19:35.120
So this 1.5 terabyte Seagate drive just had a hugely horrific failure rate.

19:35.840 --> 19:40.880
We're talking double digit percentages where the spindle one morning just decided

19:40.880 --> 19:41.920
I'm not going to unlock.

19:41.920 --> 19:46.560
Back when IBM made this, I had a series of, we call them death stars.

19:46.560 --> 19:47.520
Same thing happened to me.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.920
In an array, like several of them started popping.

19:49.920 --> 19:52.560
That name has stuck with the desk star forever.

19:53.440 --> 19:55.760
So I had a similar thing afflict me one time.

19:56.320 --> 19:58.640
And then you start thinking, well, what if that had been the other drive

19:58.640 --> 20:00.080
that had all my photos on it?

20:00.080 --> 20:00.880
Yeah.

20:00.880 --> 20:03.840
And then you think, well, OK, I need some redundancy here.

20:03.840 --> 20:08.480
Because one, the phrase in the backup industry is once is nonce.

20:09.520 --> 20:09.760
Right.

20:09.760 --> 20:11.040
One is none, actually.

20:11.040 --> 20:13.360
One copy is not a backup.

20:13.360 --> 20:14.320
One is none.

20:14.320 --> 20:16.000
Two is something.

20:16.000 --> 20:16.960
And then three is-

20:16.960 --> 20:17.840
A proper backup.

20:17.840 --> 20:18.880
Yeah, that's what you want.

20:18.880 --> 20:25.280
So nowadays I have, for all of my photos, for example, I have a full copy in Google

20:25.280 --> 20:26.960
of everything, like Google Drive.

20:29.120 --> 20:33.040
I have a few drives at my dad's house, which I send everything remotely to him,

20:33.040 --> 20:37.040
encrypted using duplicati across the internet to his house.

20:37.040 --> 20:37.680
How does that work?

20:39.520 --> 20:42.960
It has this wonderful way of doing like snapshots.

20:42.960 --> 20:45.200
So it does incremental backups.

20:45.200 --> 20:46.720
It's a bit like ZFS send, I believe.

20:46.720 --> 20:51.040
It only sends what's changed, but it works at the file level instead of ZFS's

20:51.040 --> 20:52.960
block level stuff.

20:52.960 --> 20:53.920
So in some ways it's better.

20:53.920 --> 20:54.720
In some ways it's worse.

20:55.280 --> 20:58.480
And do you go to the trouble of encrypting the data that you send up to Google Drive?

20:59.200 --> 21:00.000
Google, yes.

21:00.000 --> 21:00.400
Yeah.

21:00.400 --> 21:01.280
My dad's no.

21:01.280 --> 21:01.760
Yeah, right.

21:01.760 --> 21:02.640
Sure, sure.

21:02.640 --> 21:07.120
Because in the event of a failure where I need to get that data, the risk of having

21:07.120 --> 21:10.960
to remember an encryption password on my dad's house might be the one thing that

21:10.960 --> 21:11.840
costs me that data.

21:11.840 --> 21:14.480
And it feels like if it's going to be safe somewhere, it's probably your dad's house.

21:14.480 --> 21:18.960
Does the encryption you use to go to Google Drive, does it support incremental file changes

21:18.960 --> 21:20.720
or is it whole files every time?

21:20.720 --> 21:22.400
I think it must be whole files every time.

21:22.400 --> 21:26.080
Yeah, that's something I think we could explore in the future too is how to leverage the cloud

21:26.080 --> 21:29.920
for your self-hosted solution that is still secure for backups.

21:29.920 --> 21:30.400
Yeah.

21:30.400 --> 21:32.000
Private, I think that'd be a big thing.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.720
There's a whole rabbit hole we could go into on just backups alone.

21:34.720 --> 21:35.760
Oh man, totally.

21:35.760 --> 21:37.920
We could have a total full conversation.

21:37.920 --> 21:38.880
I'd love suggestions too.

21:38.880 --> 21:43.120
We have a new Twitter account at self-hosted show, which you can tweet at Alex and I will

21:43.120 --> 21:44.480
both be monitoring that.

21:44.480 --> 21:46.880
And if you have something you want to get in the show, that's probably the best way

21:46.880 --> 21:53.360
or hit us on Twitter or in the Telegram for Jupiter broadcasting, hashtag ask SSH.

21:53.360 --> 21:54.400
What does the S stand for?

21:54.400 --> 21:55.120
The extra S.

21:55.120 --> 21:56.400
The super self-hosted show.

21:56.400 --> 21:57.920
I think we should make the audience guess.

21:57.920 --> 22:01.920
Oh, they should give us suggestions by doing hashtag ask because we just wanted to use

22:01.920 --> 22:02.400
SSH.

22:02.400 --> 22:04.800
And the winner will get a t-shirt with ask SSH on it.

22:04.800 --> 22:05.600
Oh, great.

22:05.600 --> 22:06.100
Yeah.

22:07.280 --> 22:07.780
Sure.

22:07.780 --> 22:09.200
Let's just do that.

22:09.200 --> 22:13.040
And then if you have something longer form that you want to get over to us, you can

22:13.040 --> 22:16.080
go over to us, self-hosted.show slash contact.

22:16.080 --> 22:20.640
Self-hosted.show is going to be the landing page for this whole show.

22:20.640 --> 22:26.240
Anything like links or contact pages or our RSS feeds, subscribe links, all of that is

22:26.240 --> 22:28.160
at self-hosted.show.

22:28.160 --> 22:32.560
So we're going to be focusing mostly on service stuff, like you've just heard.

22:32.560 --> 22:35.600
Chris and I, we're building out infrastructure.

22:35.600 --> 22:36.560
We're infrastructure guys.

22:36.560 --> 22:39.280
Yeah, like right now I'm working on like a whole security camera system that's going

22:39.280 --> 22:40.080
to be tied into this.

22:40.080 --> 22:40.800
Right, yes.

22:40.800 --> 22:41.600
Got to talk about that soon.

22:41.600 --> 22:42.400
I can't wait to hear about that.

22:42.400 --> 22:44.720
I really like it so far.

22:44.720 --> 22:47.360
But we also have another show on the network called Choose Linux.

22:47.360 --> 22:47.840
Yep.

22:47.840 --> 22:49.520
Which complements this one really well.

22:49.520 --> 22:50.560
Yeah, on the desktop side.

22:50.560 --> 22:50.800
Yes.

22:50.800 --> 22:53.520
And they're trying out desktop applications and distributions.

22:53.520 --> 22:55.600
It's a great introduction to that.

22:55.600 --> 23:00.160
It's just a fun journey of discovering new things in open source and Linux.

23:00.160 --> 23:04.000
Just like we'll be doing on the server side, they do it on the desktop side.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.680
So it's sort of a companion show in a way.

23:05.680 --> 23:07.280
I like how that's worked out.

23:07.280 --> 23:09.360
It's almost like we planned it that way.

23:10.000 --> 23:10.960
Almost?

23:10.960 --> 23:14.240
Hey, before we run, I've been watching something this week I want to tell you about.

23:14.240 --> 23:15.600
I think you might really like this channel.

23:15.600 --> 23:16.240
OK.

23:16.240 --> 23:21.200
I came across it when I was doing research on security cameras.

23:21.200 --> 23:23.840
And have you heard of the EufyCam E's?

23:23.840 --> 23:24.720
No, I have not.

23:24.720 --> 23:27.200
They're like a competitor to the Arlo camera system.

23:27.840 --> 23:31.200
And Eufy is a division of Anchor, the people that make all of the.

23:31.200 --> 23:32.640
My robot is by Eufy.

23:32.640 --> 23:33.040
Yeah.

23:33.040 --> 23:39.280
And so they've made some really nice cameras that are battery, wireless, the local recording,

23:39.280 --> 23:42.480
which is encrypted and you still get remote access to it.

23:42.480 --> 23:44.960
And the channel is just great where I watched the review.

23:44.960 --> 23:46.640
It's undecided with Matt Farrell.

23:46.640 --> 23:49.520
And he has just a great clean take on this stuff.

23:49.520 --> 23:50.800
Nice level headed.

23:50.800 --> 23:51.600
It's a good YouTube channel.

23:51.600 --> 23:53.760
So I just I subscribed and I became a patron today.

23:53.760 --> 23:55.120
I really I was that impressed.

23:55.120 --> 23:56.320
Look at those production values.

23:56.320 --> 23:57.440
This guy has good lighting.

23:57.440 --> 23:58.160
That's what I'm talking about.

23:58.160 --> 24:01.680
You can tell just in the first thumbnail how good a video is going to be.

24:01.680 --> 24:03.440
And he's really he's well spoken.

24:03.440 --> 24:06.320
He posts the script up on his website.

24:06.320 --> 24:08.080
He does a really good evaluation.

24:08.080 --> 24:09.600
And I just want.

24:09.600 --> 24:11.840
So he's put these cameras into a Synology box, has he?

24:12.400 --> 24:14.080
I think it's one of the many systems he has.

24:14.080 --> 24:14.800
Yeah, that's great.

24:15.760 --> 24:16.240
Check it out.

24:16.240 --> 24:17.280
Undecided with Matt Farrell.

24:17.280 --> 24:38.800
We'll have a link in the show notes at self hosted dot show slash one.
