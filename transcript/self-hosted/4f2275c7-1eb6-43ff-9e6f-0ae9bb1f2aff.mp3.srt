1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,680
I'm looking out tonight over a beautiful Norfolk sky.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:06,480
I'm finally, finally back in England.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,720
Oh, that must feel amazing after having to wait with the whole pandemic and everything.

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:15,200
And how ironic is it that now that I'm back in my studio, you're traveling?

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,320
I know, right?

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,600
And I'm talking to you over a 4G LTE connection because the house I'm staying in at my mother-in-law's

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,360
is so rural she can only get two meg down on DSL.

8
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,440
Well, now the shoe's on the other foot.

9
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm with the good connection and you've got cellular.

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:31,840
How was it, though?

11
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,280
I mean, traveling with the baby.

12
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,360
Plus, that's no short flight.

13
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,880
Even from the East Coast to London, that must have been a six-hour flight, something like that?

14
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:47,360
It's seven going to Europe because you're with the wind, what they call the jet stream.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,920
But coming back, it's an hour longer.

16
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,200
I guess it must be uphill or something.

17
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,280
So, right, it's story time.

18
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,200
All right, it's story time.

19
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,040
I was a colossal idiot.

20
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,720
Let's put it that way.

21
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:07,360
No, the night before our flight to England from the States, I was logging onto the American

22
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,240
Airlines website, putting in all my passport information and I put in my wife's passport

23
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,360
information and my daughter's passport information.

24
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,160
It was all fine.

25
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:23,040
Got to mine and I have both, I have the British and the American one and I put in my British

26
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,360
one and then it said, you don't have a visa for this passport, please enter your US one.

27
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,960
I'm like, okay, I was going to enter Britain on my British one, but sure, fine.

28
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,120
Went to get my US passport out the drawer, it expired in July.

29
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:42,400
Oh, no, you can't just get that taken care of like overnight, like that's a process.

30
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,800
No, and bear in mind, so we were due to fly out on Labor Day, which is like a bank holiday

31
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:51,600
in the States, you know, this was Sunday night I found out for a Monday night flight.

32
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:58,480
On Labor Day, so the entire government was closed on the Monday, so I just had to sit

33
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:04,800
there stewing in my own filth and shame for an entire day, explained to my entire family

34
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:09,840
why they weren't going to get to meet their granddaughter on time and yada, yada, yada.

35
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,680
I mean, that does feel like a quintessential dad experience where like you're, you're so

36
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,320
worried about like, how are we going to fly with a baby?

37
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,200
What do we need to do?

38
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,280
Like, do we have devices to entertain ourselves, sync the media, pack everything?

39
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,320
You think of all that stuff except for your own passport.

40
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:31,040
Do you know what makes this absolutely asinine stupid is that we had to apply for my daughter's

41
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,880
first passport in August, so she had her appointment on August 8th.

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,080
We paid for the expedited processing and it was there by August the 22nd.

43
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,800
That was pretty fast, I think, for a first passport.

44
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:50,320
They used my American passport in that application and at no point did anybody say to me,

45
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,200
hey, Mr. Kretschmar, your passport's expired.

46
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,480
Hey man, just so you know.

47
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:54,960
Just so you know.

48
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,640
Looks like you might be preparing to travel.

49
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,560
I mean, look, it's totally my fault and I hold my hands up that I screwed up, but there

50
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,840
were a couple of opportunities where other people could have helped me as well.

51
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,280
Oh boy, no kidding.

52
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,880
Well, you can always help yourself by going to a cloud guru, the leader in learning for

53
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,800
cloud Linux and other modern tech skills.

54
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:18,320
And right now everyone can get into the game with discounts on learning plans, hundreds

55
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:22,560
of certification courses, thousands of labs and hands on learning and free cloud sandboxes

56
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,520
to develop your skills.

57
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,520
A cloud guru dot com.

58
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:30,960
So the Tuesday morning rolls round and I end up calling the State Department and booking

59
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,680
an appointment, an emergency passport appointment.

60
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,200
The only one they have within two weeks is in Chicago.

61
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,720
And of course, you're in North Carolina.

62
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,480
So that's a that's a bit of a trek.

63
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,440
Well, actually, I tell a lie.

64
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,120
They had one in Buffalo as well.

65
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,080
But given the size of O'Hare in Chicago, I figured actually what we'd do is we'd fly

66
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:50,880
out to Chicago.

67
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,760
I'd go and get my emergency passport taken care of.

68
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,800
And then they give it to you within two or three hours.

69
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,640
And then we just fly to London from Chicago.

70
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,280
So in the end, my wife got her birthday in Chicago and she got to go around all the art

71
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,480
museums, all that kind of stuff.

72
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,840
And then we flew out to Heathrow direct from O'Hare.

73
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,400
We went on one of those really nice new Dreamliners, those Boeing Dreamliners.

74
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,360
Oh, really?

75
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,040
Yeah, lives up to the hype, man.

76
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,280
I tell you what, they say they pressurize the cabin at 6000 feet, not eight.

77
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,160
And I was super comfortable on that plane, even with a mask on.

78
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,400
It's hard to explain, but I just didn't feel as fatigued at the other end.

79
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,200
Boy, if you're going to go on a long flight, that seems like the way to go.

80
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,200
How nice is that for the wife lady?

81
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:37,920
She got to spend the anniversary in Denver during our meetup and the birthday in Chicago.

82
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,280
Yeah, I know, right?

83
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,240
After a year and a half of not traveling, it's a bit strange.

84
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,200
So anyway, here I am sat in my mother-in-law's house in England, and it's actually pretty

85
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,400
much three years to the day since I emigrated.

86
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,400
Wow, a lot to catch up on.

87
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:57,840
There's so much that's happened in that three years from, you know, new career, new houses,

88
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,800
new baby.

89
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:06,400
The weird thing is, is that when we emigrated, child, having a child was just not something

90
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,360
we were even thinking about.

91
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,640
And here we are coming back the first time with her in tow.

92
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,640
It's very strange.

93
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,360
Wow.

94
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,360
Well, you're getting that baby adapted to travel early, which I hear is the way to do

95
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:17,600
it.

96
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,000
So hopefully she'll be a travel pro.

97
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,520
Hopefully, you know, right away.

98
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,120
You know, the weirdest thing, though, you'd think after three years, it would feel weird

99
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,560
to come back to a different country that drives on the correct side of the road, that measures

100
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,520
everything correctly.

101
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,920
But, you know, the weirdest thing actually is that it doesn't feel weird at all.

102
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,080
It doesn't even feel like we ever left.

103
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,200
It's just picking right back up where we left off.

104
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:45,760
It's it's bizarre for me, you know, just even after this road trip, we were gone for about

105
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:50,480
40 days for the first two days that I was back in the Seattle area.

106
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:54,320
It felt a little strange, like, oh, this doesn't quite click anymore.

107
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,160
But now that I've been here for a little bit more than a week, it just feels totally normal

108
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,200
back in the swing of things.

109
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,160
Is it kind of like that?

110
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:00,640
Yeah.

111
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:00,880
Yeah.

112
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,400
I mean, I've still got a couple of British bank accounts, so I've got all the correct

113
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,560
credit cards to pay for things with, you know, I can just pay for petrol and it's no problem.

114
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,960
And you're no longer the one with the accent anymore.

115
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,680
It is so nice.

116
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,360
I can't lie to just not have that be a talking.

117
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,360
Oh, my God, I love your accent.

118
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,880
Yeah, yeah.

119
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,120
I bet you get that all the time, especially in the south.

120
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,480
That must be very common.

121
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,520
Oh, my gosh.

122
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:31,360
Of course, my go to line to them is, well, you're the one with the accent and you can

123
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,160
you can just see people stop and look at me like, oh, yeah, I suppose I do have an accent

124
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:36,800
to you, don't I?

125
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:45,200
I imagine much like myself, you must go through a lot tech wise and with your home set up

126
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,640
to get ready for a trip like this.

127
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:50,000
Well, yeah, I mean, I've got three years worth of tech debt that I wanted to try and

128
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,880
address on this trip.

129
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,320
A bunch of stuff to my old UK server.

130
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:59,600
I wanted to try and improve things for my parents as well, who have a bunch of old laptops

131
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:04,720
that are just sat around gathering dust that they'd love to get the data off of and find

132
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:10,880
ways to manage all their photos, all this kind of stuff and try and bring some of the

133
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:17,200
self hosting stuff that I've learned over the last three years since I left back with

134
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,440
me and try and improve their setups.

135
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,880
I imagine it's an opportunity for you to also maybe rethink your offsite backup because

136
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,920
you're at these machines now.

137
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,960
Like if you want to change something when it comes to any of that kind of stuff, this

138
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,000
is kind of your opportunity.

139
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,560
This is it.

140
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,120
Exactly.

141
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,440
Yeah.

142
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,600
I mean, we will be coming back next summer because of my sister's wedding, but it's

143
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,160
not often, you know, who knows?

144
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,520
Maybe there'll be another COVID.

145
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,720
Oh, God, I do hope not.

146
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,920
But you just don't know when you're going to get these opportunities.

147
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:47,760
So I've gone ahead and replaced the motherboard in my UK server.

148
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:51,360
That was it was six or seven years old when I left.

149
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,920
So, you know, now it's knocking on the door of being 10 years old.

150
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,400
Oh, yeah.

151
00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:01,280
It's a really old super micro 1366 LGA socket Xeon, I think.

152
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:01,920
Good box, though.

153
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,880
That's a good board.

154
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,920
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

155
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,920
But it ran IPMI through Java.

156
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,920
So I had to have a special VM around just for that, which was a pain in the ass.

157
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,800
So I've gone ahead and replaced that.

158
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,680
I put a link in the show notes to the ASRock rack motherboard that I've picked out.

159
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,080
And I picked this one out for a few reasons, mostly because I actually

160
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,640
already had an i5 8500 CPU lying around.

161
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,640
And I had that because of all the experimentation I did in January with the

162
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:37,600
GVTG stuff, so that's just been sat on a shelf gathering dust for a little while.

163
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,800
I mean, this looks like a board that should last you a good number of years,

164
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,600
and especially if it's one you already had, that's a major win.

165
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,080
And I'm impressed that you've already got the work done.

166
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,040
You got right to it.

167
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,360
I waited to decompress and dejet lag for a couple of days, and then I got to swapping

168
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,160
out the motherboard, and you know, there's a few nice upgrades.

169
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,680
I put an NVME drive in there.

170
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,080
The i5 that's in there obviously has quick sync as well.

171
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:03,520
So if there's any, you know, I use that server for a lot of TV streaming, so like

172
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:07,760
when the Olympics were on, when the World Cup is going to be on next year, the

173
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,120
Euros, all that kind of stuff.

174
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,040
I watched the BBC coverage, 3Plex, from my UK server.

175
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:13,840
I see.

176
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:17,200
So you don't even have to pop in over WireGuard because you're using Plex.

177
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,720
You can just bring up Plex.

178
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,280
Correct.

179
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,560
Yeah, just, just for the TV.

180
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:25,040
And it works really nicely, but the old Xeon, when it was transcoding, that

181
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,520
content would suck down the juice, which, you know, it's not my electricity bill.

182
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:34,240
So I'm trying to be a good citizen and replaced it with a more power efficient

183
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,400
system with the Intel quick sync stuff.

184
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,440
But this motherboard in particular has a couple of really interesting things, I

185
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,800
think, if you're looking at a media server motherboard, you should be aware of.

186
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,240
First of all, it's a micro ATX board, which may not be for everybody, but it

187
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:57,280
does have three PCI expansion slots on it, plus one NVME drive slot.

188
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:00,240
So there's plenty of expansion options in there should you need it.

189
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:07,840
It also has a really very, very nice HTML5 based IPMI implementation, which is

190
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,240
really nice.

191
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:14,400
So I've got OpenSense running on an APU2 at my dad's, and then I use that as my

192
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,440
WireGuard endpoint.

193
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:22,160
So once I've got the site to site VPN up and running, or just connect through the

194
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,960
client on my laptop to that site, I can then just access it through an IP address

195
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,640
directly in the browser.

196
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,240
There's no Java crap needed.

197
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,680
It's really, really nice.

198
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,840
Oh, that's going to be great, Alex.

199
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:37,200
I mean, does it mean it really sounds like, you know, it's going to be a

200
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,960
great ideal board and setup for what you're doing?

201
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:46,080
My only knock against it would be, it's kind of a bummer it only has one NVME

202
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,360
slot because it would be really nice to have, you know, maybe in a mirror or

203
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,160
something like that, like a couple of drives and have that speed still.

204
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:58,320
Well, it would, but luckily the primary PCIe port supports bifurcation.

205
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:04,960
So what I've been able to do is buy an M.2 NVME PCIe card that has four NVME

206
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:10,800
slots on it and split that up, split that port up essentially into not four,

207
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,600
unfortunately, but three extra NVME slots.

208
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:19,520
So I don't need it for this server in the UK, but for my server back at home

209
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,280
in the US, I'm going to do this.

210
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,640
I'm going to, I've been testing it for the last few weeks and it works pretty

211
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:24,880
well.

212
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,240
The main slot supports eight by four by four.

213
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:36,000
So what that means is it splits that 16X link into three segments.

214
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,240
So I can just have effectively three of the four slots on that NVME card will

215
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,360
work just as if they were plugged directly in through the motherboard.

216
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:45,680
All right.

217
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,160
That's pretty cool.

218
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,440
I'll toss a link to that, although it might be sold out on Amazon right now,

219
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,320
but I'll put a link to it in the show notes if people want to see this ASUS.

220
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,200
Yeah, what isn't?

221
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,000
Yeah, really.

222
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,120
That's part of why it was nice that you could use a board you already had

223
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:57,520
really.

224
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,120
Oh, I didn't, I didn't already have the motherboard.

225
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,080
I had the CPU.

226
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:04,800
Um, I think I bought the boards through Newegg, um, because, you know, in the

227
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,560
US and brought them over with me.

228
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,840
I see much cheaper that way.

229
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,720
Also, I could do all the testing at home where I have all my gear.

230
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,800
So you brought this motherboard through TSA.

231
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,000
Yes.

232
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,040
I also brought a Synology NAS, which I'll come on to later.

233
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:17,680
Oh, okay.

234
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,600
The guys in Raleigh didn't care about the Synology, but the guys in Chicago gave

235
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,440
me the, uh, 20 questions about it.

236
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,000
It's a bomb and an ass.

237
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,200
Well, they were, they were saying, so what is this thing?

238
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,080
What do you need it for?

239
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,520
I'm like, it's a computer.

240
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,800
And they said, what does it do?

241
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,400
And I said, it stores data.

242
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,240
And they went, what data?

243
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,280
And I said, movies, TV shows.

244
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:43,600
And they looked at me, looked at each other and just went, yeah, whatever.

245
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,560
And just let me go.

246
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,200
Thank goodness they didn't ask any more questions.

247
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:47,680
Yeah.

248
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:52,400
Like I was kind of thinking, so where'd you get these movies and TV shows from, sir?

249
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:56,720
I'll be like, hmm, uh, yes, I legally rip all of these things.

250
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,880
Wink, wink, uh, that's all creative commons content.

251
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:05,280
Actually, let me tell you about, yeah, it's all big, but bunny and then go into, yeah,

252
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:05,760
yeah, right.

253
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,280
Just lots of different rips of big bunny.

254
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,840
And then you just go into like a whole explanation of creative commons and hope

255
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,880
they just glaze over.

256
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,380
Yeah.

257
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,360
Uh, so going back to the motherboard briefly, one other thing that was really

258
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,680
difficult to find out before I purchased, that's actually really important is this

259
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,920
motherboard is one of the only, or one of the few that I could find that actually

260
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:28,800
supports IPMI and IGPU at the same time.

261
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,800
So what that means is the graphics card that's built into the CPU, which is where

262
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:39,600
quick sync lives, some IPMI implementations grab that monitor and then don't let you

263
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,960
use it for quick sync.

264
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,640
Basically, you need to go into a secret BIOS menu on this ASRock board and enable

265
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:50,000
IGPU multi-monitor support.

266
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,320
Once you've done that, it just works.

267
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:58,480
You get a BIOS screen through the terminal window in the browser, and you also get

268
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:03,840
quick sync support, hardware transcoding support through Plex and Intel GPU top as

269
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,340
well.

270
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:06,560
Oh, I could really use something like that here in the studio.

271
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:11,040
You know, the server went down, um, the studio server went down about a week and

272
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,040
a half, two weeks, three weeks into the trip.

273
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,840
I can't remember, but I basically used it for quick sync.

274
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:19,760
But I basically, the last two weeks of the trip, I didn't have the server and it

275
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,160
drove me crazy not to be able to see the console.

276
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:22,640
Yeah.

277
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:26,320
I love that it supports IGPU and IPMI at the same time.

278
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,520
I mean, when you're looking at all the stuff this thing does, especially if you

279
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:34,640
add that ASUS PCI MVME expansion card in there, I mean, it's 260 bucks for this

280
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,360
board on Newegg.

281
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:35,840
Yeah.

282
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:40,960
I mean, that's kind of, it's expensive, but a good motherboard right now during

283
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,960
a part shortage, not that bad really.

284
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,080
260 bucks.

285
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:44,560
Exactly.

286
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,280
COVID has me reframing what is expensive.

287
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:53,680
And if it's $50 more than what I'm comfortable spending, I mean, I was

288
00:14:53,680 --> 00:15:01,120
looking for something under 200 ideally, but if it's in stock at this point in

289
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,680
history, that extra $60 is kind of worth it, right?

290
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,480
Well, and it really kind of, it depends on how you frame it too.

291
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,400
If you think of it as a server motherboard, it's a pretty good price.

292
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:16,800
If you think of it as like a gaming PC desktop motherboard, that's just sort of

293
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,840
an average motherboard.

294
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,240
It's expensive, but it doesn't have any LEDs.

295
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,960
So gamers aren't interested.

296
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,400
I mean, it's not like it's, it's not like it's the be all end all server

297
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,520
solution, especially because it's a, you know, it's a micro ATX, but.

298
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,840
Geez, it's pretty great.

299
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:37,920
And the fact that you have IGPU, you get quick sync and you have IPMI.

300
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,000
That's a great choice, Alex.

301
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,480
I mean, that seems like a board that's going to run a box for you for years.

302
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,440
And that if you ever have any troubles, you're going to be able to remotely

303
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,920
figure out what's going on through IPMI.

304
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,080
Yeah.

305
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,760
And the nice thing is I think I'm going to have that board in the UK and the

306
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,800
US, so I'm going to have hardware parity between two systems.

307
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:02,000
32 gigs of RAM in the UK and 64 in the US, just because, you know, at home,

308
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,760
I do a lot more stuff than I will do with a remote backup box.

309
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,160
And then are you doing Proxmox as the host OS?

310
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,520
I am actually in both places.

311
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:09,920
Yes.

312
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:14,720
And the reason being is I've run into a couple of issues and I do only mean a

313
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:21,600
couple where I use ZFS, as you all know, to do my remote backups and Jim Salter's

314
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,400
Syncoid tool to kind of manage the snapshot replication.

315
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:30,880
I've run into a couple of issues where when I had the old server set up, it was

316
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:35,840
running Ubuntu and therefore the version of ZFS that was shipping in there wasn't

317
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:39,760
exactly the same as the version that was running on Proxmox on my US server.

318
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,760
And so I ran into a couple of issues where Syncoid failed because it was

319
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:47,760
trying to send across a dataset with feature flags that didn't exist on the

320
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,560
target system.

321
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:53,280
And so just having Proxmox in both places means that I'm a lot less likely

322
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:57,920
to run into any idiosyncrasies like that between the two systems.

323
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,640
The other thing as well is that I've been trying to get my dad on the home

324
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:09,280
automation train for a long, long, long time. And I think when I arrived, he

325
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,600
gave me a whole rundown of how to turn off all the lamps in his kitchen, which

326
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,280
is where we all hang out in his house.

327
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,240
You mean like for all the switches?

328
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,360
Yeah, there were six individually switched lamps I'd have to walk around

329
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,960
and turn off one by one.

330
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:26,480
You know, having to walk somebody through how to use physical switches makes me

331
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,840
feel a little bit better about walking people through how to use the automated

332
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,040
home assistant system.

333
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:34,160
Yeah, I mean, we're talking, I would have to walk to each different corner of

334
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,120
the room. It's not even like it's six switches on a single panel next to each

335
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:41,600
other. So as you can imagine, I was like, hmm, I can do better than this.

336
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,560
So I went on to our sponsor, My Local Bytes, and hit him up and he gave me a

337
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:51,200
discount code, self-hosted, by the way, it's a discount code on that. And I

338
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,960
ordered some some gear from him. I ordered six smart plugs, a ZigBee

339
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:00,240
transmitter and a couple of ZigBee buttons. And my dad now has all of his

340
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,800
lights in his kitchen, well, the lamps anyway, turn on 45 minutes before

341
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:08,880
sunset automatically, and they turn off at midnight. But I also thought it

342
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:14,000
would be nice to give them a button to control these things. So I'm running

343
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,520
the VM for home assistant on the UK server on Proxmox, much like I do

344
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,720
back in the US.

345
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,520
And running their whole OS stack?

346
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:28,480
Yeah, yeah, I actually really like it. I know conceptually and fundamentally,

347
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,560
I have some issues with people making their own operating systems. But damn,

348
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,760
is it convenient.

349
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,200
Right, the supervisor, the snapshots, all of that is it's really great. And

350
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,040
it makes it super easy to like restore if something goes wrong. I get it. I

351
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,880
think I think running in a VM is the way to go.

352
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,960
And so now he has a couple of ZigBee buttons that are magnetic. I went to

353
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,640
Ikea actually just down the road from where he lives and bought a couple of

354
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,520
the trad free Ikea ZigBee buttons, paired them up with the ZigBee stick

355
00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:01,360
that I got from my local bytes. And it just worked. You kind of pick out

356
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:05,840
this. It's like a Mac address, but it's like an ID that looks like a Mac

357
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:10,400
address on the ZigBee network that's created. And the ZHA plugin that's

358
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,240
built into home assistant picks up the ZigBee device, and then you just

359
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,080
create an automation that is triggered by that button press.

360
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,520
And you went ZigBee, not Z-Wave. I think that's a good call. Was it just

361
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,800
because that's what was available? Or did you actually actively choose

362
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:28,720
ZigBee over Z-Wave or Wi-Fi devices? Well, I guess I did actively choose

363
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:34,320
it, but not through much research. I was just speaking to the guy behind

364
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,360
my local bytes and he said, you know, we sell ZigBee buttons, right?

365
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,400
Yeah, I think ZigBee is the way to go. And I think they're more reliable

366
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,840
than Wi-Fi devices and you can take down your Wi-Fi network and that stuff

367
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,280
all still works. And of course, I'm a fan of ZigBee because it's an open

368
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,840
protocol and it's what they use on Mars to communicate between the rover

369
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:56,000
and the helicopter. It is absolutely, yeah. It's, you know, those

370
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,560
those trad free buttons from IKEA, they're six pounds a pop. I think

371
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:04,320
they're about eight or nine dollars in the US each. Yeah, you know, for

372
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,840
that price, I could have 20 in my house without really much thought.

373
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,960
I think there's two philosophies when it comes to home automation. And I

374
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,040
think one philosophy is design it in such a way that you never have to

375
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:19,040
touch it. Like the whole thing's automated and you should really never

376
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,680
need to interfere with it. If you ever do, there's a dashboard. But then

377
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:26,800
the other, I think, very valid approach to home automation is using

378
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,360
buttons for stuff. And I think that's why there are some brands out

379
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,800
there that specifically sell solutions where there's still switches. And

380
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,280
that's why you and I have looked into devices that we can install on

381
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,120
the wall so we can still use switches. Because when you have physical

382
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,880
controls, it adds a whole nother dimension of what you can do with

383
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,680
these buttons. Like you can set things so that if you three tap that

384
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:50,080
button, it could do a totally different set of functions. And you

385
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,440
have all of this kind of flexibility when you add physical buttons and

386
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,240
people people have written into the show and laugh like you guys who

387
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,040
automate all this stuff. And then you add buttons back in there because

388
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:02,160
I've talked about this in Lady Joob's. And it's like, nah, man, you

389
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,880
add it where it makes sense and you remove it where it doesn't make

390
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:09,200
sense. And, you know, your folks are going to be used to buttons. They've

391
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,040
had buttons their entire life in their home. And so if you left that

392
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:16,800
place and didn't put those things in, they'd probably rip it all out and

393
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,360
just go back to using buttons again and turn stuff off and the

394
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,800
automation be screwed up. And it just wouldn't work because they're

395
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:26,240
used to it. I'm comfortable with pulling a phone out my pocket and

396
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,880
opening an app and swiping and swiping and tapping or shouting to an

397
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,080
assistant in the air, you know, you know, hey, hey, tube, turn on this

398
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,440
light. I mean, you could do that, too. Yeah. And also, you know, I

399
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,320
think about the home assistant cloud subscription. I pay that at home

400
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,520
out of my own pocket. I don't necessarily want to have to do that

401
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:48,080
for my parents as well to get the Google assistant support put in

402
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:52,560
there. And neither do I want to open up their firewall, even port 80

403
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:56,960
or 443, whatever would be required to make that work for for Google

404
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,160
that way. So whilst all those things are possible, I haven't

405
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:03,920
enabled Google support for them. I kind of don't want to either. I

406
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,800
want to keep it super simple. Like you push this button, your lamps

407
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:11,120
turn off. I mean, it's that simple. You know what I appreciate about

408
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:16,080
you, Chris, is that I woke up on British time to a bunch of messages

409
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:20,160
in our private J.B. chat team chat that we have. And I know your

410
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,840
Hollywood server has been offline for a couple of weeks. Yeah. Yeah.

411
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:28,080
You've been home for what, an hour? And you'd fix that bad boy. That's

412
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,720
right. We got we basically got our RV lady joops parked. We got her

413
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,720
hooked up to power. And then I jumped in the car. I ran down to

414
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,120
the studio. I'm like, what's going on? And I think, you know, I

415
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:43,120
don't know, Alex, it's like maybe it's the X server admin in me from

416
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:48,320
years past. But just knowing that my servers down drove me nuts, even

417
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,760
though like I had taken steps to replicate the essential

418
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,840
functionality, just knowing it was down and not knowing what state

419
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,520
it was in and was in some weird state where the fans were blasting

420
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:04,000
or what, you know? And so I very much wanted to solve it. And I

421
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,520
clearly have to get rid of it. And I think I have a plan. I'm still

422
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,000
waiting to put all the pieces together. But I feel like in the

423
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,680
next month or two, I'm probably going to build or buy a new

424
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:17,200
server and go through this whole process. And then I got to ask

425
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,360
myself, like, do I want to put Arch back on there? Do I want to do

426
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:25,680
Proxmox like you're doing? And do I want to put WireGuard on a

427
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,880
separate machine? So that way, when my server goes down, I can

428
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,080
still get into the network. A lot of things to think about. So I'm

429
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,520
just starting that process.

430
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,800
What went wrong with it?

431
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,760
There was a power outage at the studio. So there's two power

432
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:42,080
supplies. And one is plugged into a UPS and one is plugged into

433
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,400
the wall. And there's a funky old tech debt reason why. And I

434
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,120
think when the power went out, it got in some sort of funky

435
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,760
state where one power supply was down, but the other one stayed

436
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,160
on for a while. But then eventually, the UPS ran out of

437
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:58,080
power and it shut off. Or maybe it didn't shut off. I'm not

438
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,760
exactly sure because I wasn't here. But when I got back, it

439
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:06,000
was frozen. The system was locked up. And it was just a

440
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,920
constant beep, an error message, just a solid error message,

441
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,720
like a hardware error. And there was a red light on the front

442
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,000
of the chassis. It's a super micro. And when I turned it off,

443
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,720
the beep persisted. So I actually physically unplugged

444
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,080
the power supplies and then I plugged them back in and then

445
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,360
booted it back up. And it's been fine. And I just think it's

446
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:31,360
dying slow death. And so it has been unreliable for about five

447
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,560
to almost six months now. And so I think this is just part of

448
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:38,480
a old server's slow death. You know, what's funny is we were

449
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,080
talking to Matt last episode about high availability and

450
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,120
redundancy and all that kind of thing. And it's interesting,

451
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,520
you know, you've have dual power supplies in there,

452
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,040
presumably for that exact reason. And yet, you suspect

453
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:54,640
that might be the issue. Who knows? Don't really have like

454
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,920
great like Intel or information from the system logs because

455
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:02,160
everything that's happening was external to the box. But yeah,

456
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,800
that's going to be a project for sure. And so you mentioned

457
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,520
WireGuard. I'm going to walk you through what I've been

458
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,480
doing in a minute with WireGuard and Tailscale. But

459
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,680
before I do, what are you planning on doing? Or suppose I

460
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,320
should ask, what do you do for a firewall at the studio? Now,

461
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,040
we have a Comcast business router, that's the firewall,

462
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:22,320
it's nothing special. I have thought in the past about

463
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,680
replacing it with like a PFSense box or something like that.

464
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:30,080
However, as time has gone on, I've really found it fairly

465
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,800
acceptable. So I haven't replaced it yet.

466
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:37,120
You know, the only thing I would say is, go ahead and do

467
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,960
OpenSense or PFSense for a little bit. There is a community

468
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,400
plugins repository, maintained by the same guy, I think that

469
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,520
writes the WireGuard plugin for OpenSense, that lets you put

470
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,480
AddGuard home directly on the firewall as well. So that's

471
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,840
what I've been doing for the last few weeks. I've been

472
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,680
running AddGuard home on the same box as OpenSense as the

473
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:59,360
primary DNS server. So I've disabled unbound on OpenSense.

474
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,240
And I'm now just using AddGuard home and it, it works fine for

475
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,080
me. But the real advantage, the real advantage is I've got my

476
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:12,240
DNS, my DHCP, and my VPN endpoints, all on the same

477
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:16,160
box. I suppose you could argue it's a very large single point

478
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:19,600
of failure. But it's actually incredibly convenient.

479
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,200
Oh, for sure. And you don't need 100 boxes. I'm a little done

480
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,560
running a separate Raspberry Pi that has PiHole. I love it. I

481
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,640
think PiHole is great. I actually like it a little better

482
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:33,280
than AddGuard myself. However, it's, it's drawing power. And I

483
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:36,960
just don't need, I don't need three Raspberry Pis running 24

484
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,080
seven when I'm running off a battery. And I would much

485
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,280
prefer to consolidate that down here. Now at the studio, power

486
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,920
is not as much of a consideration. It's then just

487
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:49,440
more about functionality and flexibility, stability, surely,

488
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,320
and stability and stability for sure. I have been thinking

489
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:56,240
about moving WireGuard off on its own device. And if I did do

490
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,120
an OpenSense box, and it'd be pretty nice to have AddGuard on

491
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,960
there too, and then also do WireGuard, I'd be checking a

492
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,480
few boxes. So I think I may consider it. I was actually

493
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,320
originally planning to set up a Raspberry Pi. And I was even

494
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,080
thinking of trying to come up with some sort of failover

495
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,120
capability for the Raspberry Pis to do WireGuard, which I

496
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,400
think would be particularly tricky.

497
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,760
All right, well, here's another idea for you to bounce around

498
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,800
your noodle. I've been looking at something called tail scale

499
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,600
for the last few weeks. Now this is born out of a requirement

500
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:29,520
to run on a Synology box, which, as I'm sure you know, are

501
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,320
quite restrictive. And then they're not full Linux, but

502
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,720
they're sort of kind of Linux. And they sort of kind of do

503
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,560
some things. And anyway, it's a bit of a mess, to be honest, as

504
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:41,360
a Linux guy to try and come and make this system do what I

505
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:46,640
want. They run Docker, so I can run, you know, Minio to do

506
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,240
auto-resting backups, all that kind of stuff to Synology

507
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,120
remotely. But that's no good if I can't connect to the damn

508
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,720
thing over some kind of a secure tunnel. So I've been taking a

509
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:01,280
look at something called tail scale. And this project is

510
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:06,720
absolutely awesome. It has clients for Mac, Windows,

511
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:12,320
Android, iOS, Linux, you name it. And this thing, I got

512
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,800
further in about 10 minutes connecting up all of my

513
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:18,800
different devices and servers than I had in, I know, a year

514
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:22,240
plus of trying to futz around with WireGuard configs. This

515
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,640
thing lets you advertise different routes and different

516
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,960
subnets, just with one simple command on the command line. So

517
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,640
for example, I'm sat in Raleigh, and I want to connect to

518
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:37,360
a host that's in my dad's network in England. I don't have

519
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,760
a direct connection from my laptop to that host. But what I

520
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:43,200
can do is I can bounce the traffic through my UK server,

521
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:46,480
which routes through the tail scale network using something

522
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,720
they call Magic DNS. And then it pops out the other side, the

523
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,360
remote server then goes, Oh, yeah, you've allowed access to

524
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:59,360
192.168. whatever the subnet is in that LAN. And it lets the

525
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,480
traffic out from my local laptop to the device on the

526
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:07,920
network. In the remote side, I can also then advertise what's

527
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:11,520
called an exit node. If I want to route my traffic over the

528
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,920
internet to come out in England rather than the US, for

529
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:18,080
example, for iPlayer, I can just with a click of one button

530
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,360
in the tail scale client on my laptop, change between the

531
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:25,520
different endpoints that I'm exiting at. It's really, really

532
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,600
simple and really slick. You should give it a look.

533
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:30,240
So is it essentially then creating a mesh network between

534
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,920
your machines? Yep. Uh huh. And do they have a server

535
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:37,040
component that they're running that is involved? It uses

536
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,680
WireGuard under the hood. This sounds pretty slick. So they

537
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:44,080
must have a component that is doing some of the client

538
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:47,200
negotiation, maybe key exchange, like they must have a server

539
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,760
side to this that's involved to help coordinate all of this.

540
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:54,160
They do. It runs on their servers. And it's, you know, an

541
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:57,360
intermediary that you have to trust, I suppose, as part of

542
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:01,040
the, you know, product that comes out of the box. However,

543
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,200
there is an open source, self hosted implementation of these

544
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,080
third party witness nodes, whatever you want to call them,

545
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,440
called headscale. We'll put a link to that in the show notes.

546
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,400
And you can self host this thing. And this will become

547
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:17,680
something you would, for example, run on Linode. And

548
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:20,400
then all of your different devices would talk back to that

549
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:23,520
central host for discovery. And then from there, they do all

550
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,000
that clever routing between each other. And it looks like the

551
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,640
way the system works is the private keys are generated on

552
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,280
each node. So it's not like they have access to those private

553
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:35,200
keys. And then it's using WireGuard as the back end

554
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,280
implementation. And it looks like on some operating systems,

555
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:40,400
or maybe all they're using the WireGuard go client. I mean,

556
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:43,120
all that's really solid night, I find WireGuard to be extremely

557
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,640
trustworthy and very performant as well. So that's kind of a

558
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,800
win win. So it's tailscale.com. To see more, I would have

559
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,520
accidentally locked myself out of my US network a few days

560
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,960
ago, I was working on the site to site WireGuard VPN. And for

561
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,000
some reason, when I brought up the interface in Raleigh on

562
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,960
open sense, the second WireGuard interface would cause the

563
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,160
primary WireGuard interface to go down, I still haven't

564
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:11,680
figured out why. But without tailscale running on a VM

565
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:16,480
inside my network, I would have been totally locked out. There

566
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,600
would have been nothing I could have done. Luckily, I was able

567
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,960
to read all my traffic through the tailscale system, get shell

568
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,440
access back to open sense and then fix it from there.

569
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,880
Nicely done. That's a good little score, Alex. Tailscale

570
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,880
have a link to that in the show notes. And I think I'm going to

571
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,920
try it out after the show today because they have a ARM

572
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:36,880
version for Linux on the Raspberry Pi. I knew you'd like

573
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,520
it just because it has Raspberry Pi support, you know, you're a

574
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:43,440
you're a cheap date. You do know me well. That's very true.

575
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:50,080
Linode.com slash SSH. Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on

576
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,400
a new account. And of course, you go there to support the

577
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:55,280
show. And we love using the cloud where it makes sense.

578
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:58,400
We're all about self hosting on the show. But there's clearly

579
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:03,040
a role for cloud. And we just practically make use of that

580
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:06,560
whenever it seems like the way to go. And Linode is always the

581
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:09,760
place we deploy. They have super fast infrastructure. In fact,

582
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,920
they've just recently invested more in the infrastructure and

583
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:18,400
in their block storage. They've put in brand new screaming fast

584
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:22,640
MBME drives. They are their own ISP. So they own the links

585
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:26,240
between their 11 data centers around the world on their

586
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,600
dedicated CPU rigs. They have super high end AMD epic

587
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,320
processors that kick the butts of all the other cloud

588
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,760
providers. I mean, they take the infrastructure really

589
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,120
seriously. And I had a server outage here at the studio, our

590
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,240
physical server here in the garage. And I knew things were

591
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,680
looking kind of bad. So I just set up a Linode with the very

592
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:48,800
bare essentials that this box does. I just set it up ready to

593
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:53,440
go powered off. And sure enough, turned out like it's out there.

594
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,840
It's out there for a few weeks. And I thought, oh, maybe I'll

595
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,680
go through this whole road trip and I'll never need to fire it

596
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:00,960
up. But no, the last two weeks of the road trip, I ended up

597
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,600
signing into my Linode dashboard and firing up that backup

598
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,080
machine. And I was so thankful I had it. And when you look at

599
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,680
Linode's pricing, 30 to 50% cheaper than like the big

600
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:14,160
duopoly hyperscalers. That's a great value. And if you want to

601
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,480
deploy Nextcloud, for example, and you want to see if it works

602
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,680
for you, and maybe you don't want to spend several days

603
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:23,200
learning how to set up the entire Nextcloud stack. Well,

604
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,240
if you go to linode.com slash SSH and you create account, you

605
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,520
get that $100 credit, you could deploy Nextcloud in seconds.

606
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:32,000
They have like a one click deployment for Nextcloud. They

607
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,560
have one click deployment for discourse if you want to go

608
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:37,520
build a community. Or maybe you're looking at replacing

609
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:40,080
Zoom with something self-hosted. They have a one

610
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,480
click deployment for Jitsi as well. And I think you'd be

611
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,560
shocked at how great a self-hosted Jitsi instance is

612
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:49,920
and how much better it can be than using Zoom. And it's way

613
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:52,480
cheaper if you want like the pro Zoom stuff and you're in

614
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,760
control. They have a lot, way more than I could ever list,

615
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:59,360
just one click stacks, or you can go the DIY route. It's up to

616
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:02,640
you. Development tools, game servers, Linode makes it easy

617
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,200
to get going. And then they have a bunch of great services

618
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,920
like S3 compatible object storage, which is fantastic for

619
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:11,040
backups, DDoS protection, VLAN support, a powerful DNS

620
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:15,040
manager. I mean, on and on and on, you guys. So I'll just

621
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,000
leave it to you to go figure it out to go try it for yourself

622
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,640
because I know that's how I learned. So go to linode.com

623
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:24,720
slash SSH, get that $100 in 60 day credit on your new account

624
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:31,520
and you support the show. Linode.com slash SSH. So after

625
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,000
road trips, I always like to ask you what your learnings have

626
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,960
been and stuff like that. And I would imagine the primary theme

627
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:41,360
from this trip was managing heat. Oh my goodness. Yes. When

628
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:44,800
you were on your way to Chicago, I was trapped in Tucson

629
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:49,440
where I think every day was at least 105 degrees. It just,

630
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:53,440
you know, maybe we get down to 88 Fahrenheit at night. It was

631
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:57,600
so brutal, Alex, that we would go 5000 feet up. We would drive

632
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,800
up Mount Lemmon and we would stay at the top of Mount Lemmon

633
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,360
where it would be about the temperature of the Pacific

634
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:06,640
Northwest and we would just sit there and wait for the data

635
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:11,040
pass. Um, it was really hot. How tall is that sucker? I think

636
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,680
it goes all the way up to 8,000 feet. Oh, I bet that was

637
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:17,360
really nice in that climate too. Yeah. Oh man. Cause at the

638
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:20,000
bottom it would literally be 105 and at the top it'd be like

639
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,880
66 degrees. Did you do that thing where you got in the car

640
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,600
at the top of the mountain with the AC running? And then when

641
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:28,320
you get out at the bottom of the mountain, you're like, oh my

642
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:32,800
God, what is this? Boom. Hits you in the face too. And they

643
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,640
were also experiencing record humidity as well. So it was

644
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:40,960
just gross. And all of my automations around heating had

645
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:45,600
to be disabled. Everything had to go. And um, I realized this

646
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:49,040
was an opportunity to kind of redo how I automate heat with

647
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:52,080
home assistant. So traditionally I've had a series

648
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:55,680
of automations that would have conditions like sunset and

649
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:59,120
sunrise. And then depending on the state of the sun, they

650
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:03,760
would either kick on or they would kick off. And this also

651
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,680
kind of fell apart because I don't yet actively update home

652
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:11,440
assistance location when I'm going down the road. I need to

653
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,240
do that. I have a couple of different ways I could solve

654
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:18,240
that problem. But right now when I'm, when I'm in Denver,

655
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,360
Home Assistant still thinks I'm in the Pacific Northwest. And

656
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:24,240
when I'm in Tucson, it thinks I'm in the Pacific Northwest.

657
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:27,840
So it is going by the state of the sun in the Pacific

658
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:31,360
Northwest. And so all of my automations were offset around

659
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:34,560
heating for that reason as well. I realized I needed more

660
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,600
control. And over time, my wife has said, sometimes she's like,

661
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,680
you know, the automations work really well, but sometimes I'm

662
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,320
just in a mood where I just want it really toasty in here.

663
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,880
And I find it hard to do that because the system will turn

664
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,600
off the heaters. Once it reaches, I have like a 70

665
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:51,120
degree cutoff where all the heat turns off an automation for

666
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:54,160
that. So I decided to take this opportunity after I disabled

667
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,200
everything while we were on the road and definitely did not

668
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,480
need heat to instead of re-implement the traditional

669
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:04,880
automations I created almost two years ago now, I would instead

670
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:08,320
replace them with the Home Assistant generic thermostat

671
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,120
entity. And this is something the audience has written in and

672
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,760
told me to do for a while. I've been intending to do it and I

673
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:19,920
am so, so glad I did this. It's like I have my own homemade

674
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:24,960
Nest thermostat now. All it requires is you need a sensor to

675
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,840
give it an input. And I have sensors in every room. And so

676
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:31,520
you tell it which sensor to monitor and what numbers you

677
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,720
want, you know, when the sensor returns this number, turn it on

678
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,920
and turn it off. And what smart switch you want it to flip on

679
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,040
and flip off. So you need a sensor and a smart switch.

680
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,440
That's it. And then anything that you plug into that smart

681
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:46,800
switch will get cycled on and off. And so I have oil

682
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:51,200
heaters, these really nice small portable compact oil

683
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:55,600
heaters that give off this wonderful radiant heat. And

684
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:59,600
Home Assistant now monitors the temperature and it gives you an

685
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:02,720
interface that is a thermostat interface and you set what you

686
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:08,080
want the temperature to be and it will cycle the power to the

687
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:11,920
heaters to maintain that. And you can define things like make

688
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,720
sure the minimum cycle length is 90 seconds so they're not just

689
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:18,160
flipping on and flipping off. And then you also have a really

690
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:21,760
nice interface to just turn them off completely. Sometimes in

691
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:25,200
an RV specifically, when you're cooking and you've got a lot of

692
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,840
high voltage appliances going, maybe a toaster oven and a

693
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:32,480
slow, you know, an instant pot and you got a toaster that is,

694
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,720
you know, pulling 1000 watts. You got an instant pot that's

695
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,440
pulling 1000 watts. You don't necessarily want your space

696
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,600
heater kicking on that also pulls 1000 watts because

697
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:43,200
you'll trip a breaker. And so now in Home Assistant, we have

698
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,800
a tab in the dashboard that is just all of the thermostats,

699
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,080
which are there are four of them and you can turn them off

700
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:53,200
so they do not automatically cycle, which was never really

701
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,360
an option that my wife had before because she wasn't

702
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,120
familiar with going into the automations and turning

703
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:00,800
automations on and off manually. So now she can just

704
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,560
hit the little button to make sure the heaters don't

705
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:06,000
automatically cycle on, which is great. She also has a nice UI

706
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,960
to turn up the heat. But then the brilliant thing about Home

707
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:13,360
Assistant is if you connect it with HomeKit, you really take

708
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:16,720
things up to the next level for all of the users in your home.

709
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:20,800
So now Home Assistant automatically publishes these

710
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:25,040
thermostats to HomeKit on all of our devices that are in an

711
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:29,120
iCloud family plan. So my wife, the moment I turned these on

712
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:33,600
had those buttons on her iPhone. She just pulls down the

713
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:36,320
control center. There's the thermostat buttons. I mean, it

714
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:40,560
just made it crazy easy for her. Additionally, now all of

715
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:45,040
those things are verbally addressable with Siri. So she

716
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:50,800
can say, Siri, set the bedroom heater to 75 degrees or Siri,

717
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,560
what is the bedroom heater temperature? And Siri will read

718
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:58,720
back the sensor information to her. It's very simple and it

719
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,680
displays the temperature now in her control center on her

720
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,960
iPhone. When she pulls that down right there, she taps on

721
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,480
it. It gives her this really nice UI because it's a HomeKit

722
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,440
UI. So it's all built in to manage the thermostat

723
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,160
temperature with colors for when it's getting hot and all

724
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,800
that kind of stuff. And she doesn't even have to touch the

725
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,760
Home Assistant dashboard if she doesn't want to. And anyone

726
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:23,840
now in the family can ask the Siri tube to make it warmer

727
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:26,400
for them. I didn't even consider that when I set up this

728
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,680
generic thermostat, but it's great. But then I capped it all

729
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,720
off and I would love the audience's feedback on how they

730
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:37,360
do this with two automations that monitor the sunset and

731
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:42,480
sunrise. And so two hours after the sun rises, the

732
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:47,360
automation sets all of the thermostats to 65 degrees. And

733
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:52,640
then an hour before the sun sets, the automation sets all

734
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:56,560
the thermostats to 71 degrees. So that way during the day,

735
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:59,040
we're not running the heat more than we need to. And I'm

736
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:02,080
thinking about layering on top of that once I get accurate

737
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:04,480
location information. I'm thinking about layering on top

738
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:07,600
of that when we're away, just turn them off, those kinds of

739
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:11,680
conditions. But Alex, there's lots of thermostats. There's

740
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,880
lots, lots of different integration options, lots with

741
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:18,880
thermostats and Home Assistant. But this generic thermostat is

742
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:22,800
so flipping brilliant because all you need is a switch, a

743
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,560
smart switch and a temperature sensor. That's all you need.

744
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:30,080
And you can turn anything into essentially like a nest like

745
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:33,120
here. So my thermostat already has an API that I could call

746
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:39,200
via curl. Can I use the generic thermostat thing paired with

747
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,720
those Xiaomi sensors that I have? Sure. If you, when you

748
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,600
curl it, if you get the temperature and you can parse

749
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:49,280
that and pass that through as sensor data, you absolutely

750
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:52,160
could. Interesting. Well, I will give that a try when I get

751
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:55,120
back home. I'm going to do this in the studio for the smart,

752
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:59,760
I have fans in the windows that are connected to smart plugs

753
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,480
and I just manually turn them on and off with Home Assistant,

754
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,840
but I can manually turn them on and off. This would be great

755
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:08,800
to have a temperature. Just swipe down from your control

756
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,360
center and using the HomeKit, darling, right? Yeah.

757
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,720
Now, if you're looking for a great place to go and get some

758
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:20,720
self-hosting smart gear pre-flashed with Tasmota, check

759
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:24,720
out our sponsors, cloudfree.shop and mylocalbytes.com.

760
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,120
Both of these guys are listeners of the show who have

761
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:30,400
started small businesses and we want to help support them

762
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,200
running these small businesses. They have a whole bunch of

763
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,080
gear pre-flashed with Tasmota. Like I said earlier in the

764
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:38,560
show, I actually this week bought a bunch of stuff from

765
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:44,240
mylocalbytes.com to kickstart my father's home automation

766
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:47,680
desires. Spent less than a hundred pounds and I was able

767
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:52,160
to automate a good chunk of his kitchen lighting experience.

768
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,320
It's well worth taking a look at this stuff and it's running

769
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:58,240
Tasmota. So, you know, there's no setup or configuration

770
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:01,440
required out of the box. It's broadcasting a Wi-Fi access

771
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,560
point. You connect to that, you put in your Wi-Fi information,

772
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:08,240
your MQTT broker information and boom, you're off to the races.

773
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:11,920
So go over to mylocalbytes.com and cloudfree.shop and check

774
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:14,640
out what those guys have to offer. Don't forget to use the

775
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:17,360
coupon code self-hosted so that you get a simple discount off

776
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,280
your order and that they know that we sent you.

777
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:23,360
You mentioned it earlier, but it sounds like you were doing

778
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:25,760
some work on that Synology to get ready for the trip too.

779
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:26,720
What'd you do there?

780
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:29,120
The Synology box is going to my mom's house, which will be

781
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:32,960
yet another offsite backup. But the reason I wanted to do this

782
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:37,680
was I have ZFS doing its thing, you know, snapshots and

783
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:42,160
replicating to the UK. If for some reason that whole ZFS

784
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:45,120
system goes tits up, I thought to myself, it would be nice if

785
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:48,400
I had a completely separate versioned backup that's in a

786
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:52,480
totally separate ecosystem. And so I've been looking at the

787
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:55,760
project AutoRestic. Well, actually, technically AutoRestic

788
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:59,920
is a wrapper around Restic, which is a tool to do remote

789
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:03,680
backups and versioned backups to a whole bunch of different

790
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:07,040
endpoints. But the one that I'm going to be using is called

791
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:12,560
Minio, which is a local S3 API server, effectively. So I'm

792
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:15,920
sure you've all heard of S3 storage on Amazon. It's, you

793
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,720
know, what Linode calls, I forgot the name.

794
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,400
S3 compatible object storage.

795
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,320
Oh, well, that's a good name, isn't it? Yeah. I wonder where

796
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:25,040
they came up with that. DigitalOcean, all the rest of

797
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:28,720
them have that kind of thing as well. So most people offer some

798
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:32,560
kind of S3 compatible API. Essentially what it means is it

799
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:37,920
stores data in objects, small little blocks of data. Now, I

800
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,560
wanted this data to be encrypted on the remote endpoint

801
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:44,000
and Restic handles that totally transparently. But the really

802
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,000
nice thing about AutoRestic is using a simple, probably about

803
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,640
20 line YAML file, I've been able to configure the rotation

804
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:56,400
policies, the pruning policies, all the different data sets that

805
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:00,240
I want backed up and where it's not a data set in Restic land,

806
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:03,680
it's just a directory that I wanted backed up to the remote

807
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:08,560
system. And then I'm running Minio as a container behind

808
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:12,960
traffic on the Synology, which is running DSM 7. And I've

809
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,520
written a blog post, which I'll put in the show notes about how

810
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:18,960
to configure traffic to do a whole bunch of stuff with

811
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:23,600
Synology DSM 7. So I've got Minio running through traffic

812
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:28,080
on the Synology, which I then have a DNS entry on my US

813
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:31,200
server through tail scale, which is then able to route all

814
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:34,320
the traffic and punch holes through NAT, all the way

815
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:38,160
through to the Synology box that's living at my mom's house

816
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:42,640
now. And so I just have two separate totally separate UK

817
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:47,600
backup systems on totally different paradigms. Alex, that

818
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:51,760
might be the ultimate offsite setup with when you consider

819
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:55,680
you have both locations and one location is like an exact

820
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:58,800
hardware match. And so you can do AB testing and another

821
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:02,400
location is a totally different ecosystem that still well

822
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:06,960
managed, gonna run forever. Like, yeah, you are set for

823
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,200
years. I think it's one of those things. I think I'm

824
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:12,640
probably over egging the pudding at the likelihood of

825
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:16,880
Basingstoke and Lancaster and Raleigh all going, you know,

826
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:21,840
south at the same time is probably very unlikely. But if

827
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:25,600
it happens, I'll be okay now. You can go find our friends at

828
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:28,400
Cloud Guru on social media. They're just slash a cloud

829
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:31,600
guru everywhere, like YouTube and Twitter and the Facebook

830
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:33,920
and pretty much anything that's a social network. Go find

831
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:36,480
them. Social network slash a cloud guru. Now I know I've been

832
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:39,280
banging on about it all episode, but I'm back in the UK

833
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:42,320
this week, and it is glorious. So I'm actually gonna be

834
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:45,280
meeting up with a couple of listeners in the Norwich area,

835
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:49,120
a place called Brecklund Lodge on the A11 just outside

836
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:53,440
Attleboro near Norwich. We're gonna be doing that on Tuesday

837
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:57,600
the 28th of September at 6 PM UK time. So if you wanna come

838
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:00,480
say hi to me, Gary, who was on late night Linux a couple of

839
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:03,840
weeks ago and a couple of other people said they were already

840
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:06,240
gonna be there. It's a bit of an impromptu meet up. We hope

841
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,640
it be nice and small just for COVID safety, that kind of

842
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:12,240
thing. But if you wanna come say hi, I'll be there and I'll

843
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:15,200
be wearing my Chris and the Badger T shirt. Nice boy. You

844
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,840
