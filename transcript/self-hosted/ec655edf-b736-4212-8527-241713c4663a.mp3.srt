1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
I knew what happened, Alex, I rolled the Starlink dice and I came up snake eyes.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:10,240
I came back to a location after being on the road for about three weeks, set up the

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:16,880
Starlink and went to update my service address and I got the dreaded no more capacity at your area.

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,200
And this is an area I frequent a lot.

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:24,560
It's like home base territory and Starlink says, sorry, no room for you.

6
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,600
So what happens now?

7
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,160
Are you out of luck until further notice?

8
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:28,960
It's weird.

9
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,240
I'm only like 15 miles from the other location I was at.

10
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,800
It's kind of working and not well.

11
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,880
It's like losing and dropping packets from time to time and connection.

12
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:44,560
But when it works, I'm getting like 30 megabits, which is pretty slow for Starlink.

13
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:50,640
But I did see some YouTubers reporting that Starlink seems to be testing a roaming mode

14
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,320
that lets you move around and maybe use it outside your service address.

15
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,520
So I'm hoping that happens to me soon.

16
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,880
And I'm just going to keep checking the website every few days.

17
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,800
There is a website I just found as you were talking here, satellite map dot space, and

18
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,400
it seems to like divide the entire country up into hexagons.

19
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,320
And then they've got the actual Starlink satellites flying in real time over the top of it.

20
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:22,000
And it looks like the entirety of the Pacific Northwest Redmond's right at the middle of a cell.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,920
So I don't understand, you were on the coast and then you came back to the studio.

22
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,560
That's not far enough to cross a boundary even.

23
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,360
What's going on?

24
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,160
I think it's more nuanced than that website makes it look.

25
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,400
I think the cells are actually more divided.

26
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,120
I've seen another website that gives you a different view.

27
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,880
It's not as fancy as that one.

28
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:45,200
It shows hexagons that are basically 20, 30 mile in sizes that overlay over the Google map.

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,480
Either way, I knew I was rolling the dice because you're not supposed to move the Starlink.

30
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:55,280
When you're in a service area, they provision for capacity because these require downlink stations too.

31
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,240
Come on, they know exactly who's going to use this thing.

32
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:08,080
People in rural places that have no other option, or people, you know, not connected to the real world like you that lives in a bus.

33
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,680
Out there in the virtual world.

34
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:19,280
When I reviewed Starlink on Linux Unplugged, I didn't really mention the fact that the Ethernet cable doesn't disconnect from the dish.

35
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,880
It's built in.

36
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:35,120
So every single time I tear it down in the snow, in the rain, in the mud, I have to like spool this big cable that I can't detach from the dish and I have to like carry them both around soaking wet and dry them off together and load them up.

37
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,560
It is the worst.

38
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,200
At least you got a router with an Ethernet port.

39
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,400
You can stop complaining.

40
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:40,880
That's true.

41
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,680
They're taking that away.

42
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:49,360
But when SpaceX does come out with the Starlink designed for mobile use, which they have patents for, I'm all over it.

43
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:56,480
I mean, I was even tempted by the $500 a month Starlink Pro, but I'm glad I didn't pull the trigger on that.

44
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,480
It would be really SOL.

45
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:04,480
Yeah, it's interesting, you know, like obviously it has the power to completely change the game, but so does 5G.

46
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:16,480
Like you look at what bandwidth that's capable of and you know, the number of subscribers that a single tower can support on 5G versus LTE significantly different proposition.

47
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,680
It's going to be really interesting to see which technology wins out.

48
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:29,680
Obviously, you know, in rural America where, you know, it's a pretty different use case to what I'm used to in England, right, where everything's really dense and connected with cables pretty well.

49
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,880
But like rural America, you're in the middle of the wilderness pretty quickly in America if you're not careful.

50
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:41,680
And those places, those are the ones where Starlink will change the game for people like me that work fully remotely.

51
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:50,880
I think, well, I live near Raleigh right now because, you know, I have access to good schools, one thing for my daughter, but I also have access to a good job market.

52
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:58,080
Well, that kind of thing has gone away because I could move anywhere and get a remote job I wanted in my industry.

53
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:10,480
I'm very lucky. And then you think, well, Internet's another one because you start trying to look at buying 20, 30 acres worth of land in the middle of West Virginia and good luck getting anything above one meg DSL.

54
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:22,080
Yeah, I think it's a mix of all of them at once, at least for the nomadic use case, because you can't, I would imagine, ever really use Starlink mobilely because I don't think the way it works.

55
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:26,080
I don't think you can be, say, going down the road at 60 miles per hour.

56
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:31,280
I've seen Dwayne the Rock Johnson on a sat phone, you know, they could do they could do these things in the movies.

57
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,280
Maybe it could. Maybe that'd be awesome.

58
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:44,280
But I imagine for quite a while it's going to be a mix of different wireless tech, LTE, 5G, and then you park when you're stationary.

59
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:49,580
You go Starlink or if you're out like at a piece of property, you know, a farm, it's all kind of hit and miss.

60
00:04:49,580 --> 00:05:00,680
There's a guy I work with who is working for a government contract and he lives on a boat off the East Coast and he just sails up and down the East Coast, depending on where the weather's nice all year.

61
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,780
And he's on a 4G, works great.

62
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:08,080
I had a buddy that did that, but he gave it up, I think, when the boat just started falling apart.

63
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,480
Well, they do do that. They're a boat.

64
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,380
You know, there are two good days when you own a boat.

65
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:15,080
You know that, Chris? The day you buy it and the day you sell it.

66
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,080
And the day you sell it. Yep.

67
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,680
I think that might be true for an RV too, Alex.

68
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:29,480
And I'm looking at what's coming down the road for Home Assistant, which I have deeply integrated into my RV and I'm not sure what I'm going to do.

69
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:37,580
So I had some time away from Lady Joob's. Not recently, but this is about a month and a half ago. Strictly platonic time away, I hope.

70
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:46,380
Yeah, when our buddy Brent was in town, we were staying at the studio to let Lady Joob's defrost from a stay we had in the winter wilderness.

71
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:51,880
I spent some time here at the studio and I just realized how little I've integrated Home Assistant.

72
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,280
It's just so much the basics.

73
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:59,280
It's like motion sensor stuff, a couple of NFC automation tag stuff, and you know, smart lights.

74
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,780
It's really fine. It's fine.

75
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:10,280
I'm not trying to denigrate that setup, but compared to what I've done in my primary home in Lady Joob's, it's just really night and day.

76
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:18,680
And I came to realize just how much we rely on Home Assistant. It is an integral part of operating our home now.

77
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:25,380
And I don't know how to describe that. I describe it as important as some of the machinery in the engine.

78
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:30,480
You know, it is an absolute critical part of the operation of the vehicle now.

79
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:37,780
So when I see things that are coming down the pipe that are going to break Z-Wave, man, I just don't know what I'm going to do.

80
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:45,180
So this is really for any of us out there who are on the OG Z-Wave support, like I'm talking the old Z-Wave stuff.

81
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:50,280
It seems going by the beta release notes than in a couple of releases in the 22.4.

82
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,380
So not the next one, but the one after.

83
00:06:53,380 --> 00:07:03,180
They are going to deprecate the old Z-Wave support simply because they have to move on in Python versions and no one supports that old Z-Wave stuff.

84
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:07,980
And the dev team is recommending instead that you migrate to Z-Wave JS.

85
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:12,080
And you know, Alex, we've talked about this. I tried it and it went badly.

86
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:22,280
It's one of the few times I had to hit the escape hatch and do a full restore from backup and bail out of what I had done because my migration went so poorly.

87
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:28,380
That just about everything from automations to timers and buttons all broke. Everything broke.

88
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:31,680
How many sensors do you have? How many devices on that network?

89
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,680
I think it's somewhere like a hundred devices.

90
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:40,180
I don't remember how many of them are sensors because it's tricky because each sensor actually shows up as an individual device.

91
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:44,280
And there are like seven in each one of those little Z-Wave sensors.

92
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:49,480
And when you migrate, do you have to repair each device one by one?

93
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,480
Because I had to do that with my Zigbee thing when I changed my channel.

94
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:55,480
I think it's actually stored in my Z-Wave controller.

95
00:07:55,480 --> 00:08:04,480
However, it seems like the new versions of Z-Wave JS, and I haven't done this for about six months, but it's like a bunch of missing devices show up.

96
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,980
Like the names don't line up.

97
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:12,280
And so I don't know exactly what went wrong when I looked at it, but it was, yes, it stored the pairings.

98
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:18,080
But it was almost irrelevant because I'd have to wipe the slate and repair it anyways to fix everything.

99
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:24,080
I'm not ready to go there when matter is probably about a year away.

100
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,880
And I'm going to then just start replacing all of this with matter devices.

101
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:34,480
And I was really hoping to hold out, just kind of hold out until matter arrived and then just switch over.

102
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,980
And it seems like I'm not going to get that opportunity because they want to move on.

103
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:40,980
They got to get a newer version of Python in their stack.

104
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:47,180
I'm playing devil's advocate a little bit here, but I mean, how do you propose that Home Assistant solve this problem?

105
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:49,080
I mean, time moves on.

106
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:53,580
Python 2 has been on the ropes for a long time now.

107
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,580
I mean, it's not like this is a new problem.

108
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,080
What's the alternative there?

109
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:00,080
I'm not really sure there is one looking at it objectively.

110
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:07,280
I think to myself, isn't there some way they could supply this as a container so it is unaffected by the base system.

111
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:10,580
But these integrations are just that they are integrated.

112
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:17,080
They don't run as separately isolated containers, but it's a shame because right now I really wish they could.

113
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,280
This is really going to screw me.

114
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,180
And there is people already online, of course.

115
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:24,680
And of course, the Internet doesn't recommend you do what the developers suggest you do.

116
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:33,680
The Internet wants everyone to go install Z-Wave JS to MQTT and go set up an MQTT broker and go learn all of that.

117
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:38,280
Which perhaps is a great idea, but it's like not what the developers are recommending.

118
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:42,780
And when something like a breaking change like this comes along and the community needs to know what to do,

119
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:45,180
having all this mixed messaging just makes things worse.

120
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:47,080
So I just that stuff drives me crazy.

121
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:50,480
And what you start seeing people say they're going to do is just not upgrade.

122
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:57,580
They're basically going to upgrade to 22.3 and then they're going to hold until something else comes along,

123
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:01,480
which, you know, it sucks because that's probably what I'm going to have to do.

124
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:07,180
I'm grateful that I have a separate Home Assistant instance here in the studio that I'll be able to keep up to date so I can follow along on development.

125
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:15,180
But in my RV where I consider it mission critical, I and I think a lot of people are just going to stop upgrading now.

126
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,780
Yeah, I think a lot of people get burnt out.

127
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:17,780
There was a thread on Reddit.

128
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:24,580
I think it was about a week ago complaining about the state of the Home Assistant documentation.

129
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:29,780
The complaint itself is neither here nor there for purposes of this discussion.

130
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:34,180
What I wanted to talk about was the general consensus in the comments of that thread.

131
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:41,680
The Home Assistant, despite its best efforts for now, at least, is geekware.

132
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:50,780
You know, my dad's a smart guy, but I can't imagine giving him a vanilla Raspberry Pi with nothing except Home Assistant even flashed onto it and say,

133
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,880
here, go automate your house.

134
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,980
I can't imagine that going very well.

135
00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:01,080
And I look at things like the HomeKit integration that Apple are doing.

136
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,980
I look at the Alexa stuff.

137
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,980
I look at the Google Home app.

138
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,180
That's what you need to do.

139
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:12,680
That's the level of integration that you need to get to in order to make it more approachable and more accessible for people.

140
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:21,380
Home Assistant's biggest strength is how modular it is and how customizable it is and how geeky it is.

141
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:28,380
That's the thing I love about it the most is the fact if I want to go and tweak a specific knob three degrees to the left,

142
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:31,480
I can go and do that one specific change.

143
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,380
Probably similar to the reasons why I like Linux as well, you know?

144
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:34,880
Yeah, I do.

145
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,880
I do know what you mean.

146
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:44,180
And, you know, we're trying to compare, I think, Apple's, you know, kind of, you will like this approach that they do on Mac OS to Linux.

147
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:46,680
You know, I'm comparing Alexa to Home Assistant here.

148
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:55,080
And I don't know, like, I just think about where does the Home Assistant project go to address complaints like yours,

149
00:11:55,080 --> 00:12:00,980
like the ones in this Reddit thread and complaints of my own as well, where, you know, I get fatigue.

150
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:05,280
I get fatigue maintaining my own Home Assistant instance.

151
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:08,980
Stuff just breaks for no apparent reason.

152
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:13,780
And, you know, I stay on top of updates and I do try and figure stuff out.

153
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:17,880
And I don't know, like, it's just difficult.

154
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:24,280
I don't know that Home Assistant is quite grasping the problem that faces them quite yet.

155
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:27,680
They're solving the technical problems really, really well.

156
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:34,180
But I do think on the whole, there's still a lot of work to be done on the kind of people side of the problem that they're solving,

157
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:40,880
like the education, the documentation, making things more bite-sized and more accessible to folks.

158
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:47,680
I feel like there is a period of time where it's reasonable for Home Assistant to introduce breaking changes,

159
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,480
to get things built right for the long term.

160
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,480
And when a project's new, you decide to do a few things and you got to make a few changes.

161
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,680
I think to their credit, it's not like Z-Wave JS came out yesterday, right?

162
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,580
And part of the reason is because I saw where this was going.

163
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,380
There was multiple options and I just wanted to hold off.

164
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:10,880
But anybody who's adopted Home Assistant in the last year just started off with Z-Wave JS, right?

165
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,880
They don't have to deal with this.

166
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:19,680
And so I think something we have to keep in mind is even though you and I have been using it for a few years,

167
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:25,780
I think the vast, vast, vast majority of users that Home Assistant will ever have are still yet to come, right?

168
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:28,280
They start arriving when there's hardware devices.

169
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:33,780
So we're still the early adopters that are actually helping kind of bang out some of the rough edges on this thing.

170
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:41,280
And so we are more likely to get exposed to those issues that cause fatigue that both you and I are feeling right now.

171
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:50,280
But what gives me hope is if you zoom out a couple of years and look at the Home Assistant project's trends,

172
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,480
the break-in changes are slowing down.

173
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,080
I think you'd agree there's less.

174
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,380
Absolutely are, yeah.

175
00:13:55,380 --> 00:14:01,780
Also, they're making things more and more automatic as time goes on.

176
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:08,980
Like when you throw Home Assistant on a network for the first time, you know, just like say you're a new user and you take a look at it.

177
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:15,480
It'll often suggest four or five or six integrations automatically just by noticing what's on your network.

178
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,080
They've gotten really good at like saying, hey, you got an Apple TV.

179
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:22,180
Hey, you got an HP printer, you know, like, would you like to set that up?

180
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:33,280
The fundamental appeal that Home Assistant has that will always be a unique value proposition for at least these open source type systems is that it's multi-vendor.

181
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:40,180
It works with all the different third party products and cloud devices that you got on a whim and to your thing.

182
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:43,580
Somebody bought you for Christmas and it works with all of it, right?

183
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,680
Whereas Apple stuff, it only works with the HomeKit stuff.

184
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:51,480
The Echo stuff only works with the devices that, you know, work with the Echo and same with the Googs and all of that.

185
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,180
It's different in that way.

186
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:56,180
It's a finally a way to just bring it all home, bring it all on the land.

187
00:14:56,180 --> 00:15:03,380
And once that starts connecting with people and there's a piece of hardware and some of these transitional things are worked out, I think it's going to be fine.

188
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:09,680
But the reality is when you're living in the in the now and this stuff still getting hashed out, it kind of sucks.

189
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:14,180
And I'm not a big fan of doing the I'm not updating thing.

190
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,980
That's sort of my last worst case scenario.

191
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:19,180
I'm much more of a keep my systems up to date.

192
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:24,280
Like if I'm going to run a box when I decide to deploy something, I'm committing to keep it maintained.

193
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,980
I don't just deploy something and not maintain it.

194
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,780
So that bothers me a lot.

195
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:35,280
Additionally, this is why I'm really glad I'm not running their OS because I will keep the Ubuntu base up to date, right?

196
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:42,380
Where I don't know if that's safe when I'm running their OS if I kept the OS upgrading all the time, but didn't upgrade Home Assistant Core.

197
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,880
I don't know if something breaks.

198
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:51,380
Possibly I could see that being an issue, especially if it's like a year before any matter devices ship or maybe even longer.

199
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:57,880
But because I've installed it myself on an Ubuntu system, I know I can keep that 2004 system up to date.

200
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,980
So at least that'll be secure.

201
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:02,380
Can you believe I got an opportunity to work the OS rant in there?

202
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:03,580
It's been a few episodes.

203
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:06,680
And I was almost worried that you weren't going to come up for air then.

204
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,680
And then I realized you were going on an OS rant.

205
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,580
Somehow you managed to work that angle.

206
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,880
Good job.

207
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,580
It's been a while.

208
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,880
Linode.com slash SSH.

209
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:22,180
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account and you go there to support the show.

210
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:23,280
Yeah, I mean $100.

211
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,780
You can really go kick the tires at Linode.

212
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,280
It's the Geeks Cloud.

213
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:35,280
They're not going to try to lock you into some crazy esoteric hyperscaler proprietary platform where your skill set only applies to that.

214
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,380
Oh, I don't like that business model at all.

215
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,280
No, that's not Linode.

216
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,380
They got 11 data centers worldwide.

217
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:44,780
They've been working at this for 19 years to create a great experience to run applications on the cloud.

218
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,780
You can build it from the ground up yourself.

219
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,780
I mean really all the way down to the image.

220
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:54,280
Or you can pick one of their ready to go application stacks and get it deployed in just one or two clicks.

221
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,080
And the performance is great.

222
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:02,880
Anything that faces the JB audience that we've built in the last, I don't know, two and a half years.

223
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,380
We've built it on Linode.

224
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:10,880
And I would imagine now as being a part of Akamai, they're going to get access to Akamai's CDN.

225
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:16,180
I was quite surprised when I heard the news, but I contacted a couple of our friends that we know that work there at Linode.

226
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,480
And they seem pretty excited.

227
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:23,880
In fact, they're working on a new secret product, a new Linode product offering that'll be coming out soon.

228
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,380
That's still all in the works.

229
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:32,680
And you know another thing that's really cool is the day that announcement dropped, we actually have Linode employees on the self-hosted Discord.

230
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:37,480
And they were there answering our audience's questions about what does this mean for the future of the company?

231
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:40,080
And I think a lot of fears were kind of put to rest that day.

232
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,980
Yeah, they really have been part of the community for a while.

233
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:48,180
I met them the same time I met you at Texas Linux Fest, you know, years ago now.

234
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,880
Feels like a hundred years ago.

235
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,680
That was when I really realized they're actually in it because they wanted to be.

236
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:58,280
Like they were passionate about being at Texas Linux Fest and made a good impression on me.

237
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:03,180
So if you're ready to go spin something up, you want to go experiment or do a little R&D, go try it out on Linode.

238
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:07,780
Go to linode.com slash SSH.

239
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:12,880
So in the news this week, TrueNAS Scale is finally at release.

240
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,780
Can you believe it, Alex?

241
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,880
This was like announced in the summer of 2020.

242
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:22,980
It has been a very methodical development process to get us here.

243
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:27,880
And the big news with Scale is it's based on Debian 11, not FreeBSD.

244
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,380
Right. Yeah.

245
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:35,180
I mean, back in the old days, TrueNAS is the product formerly known as FreeNAS, of course.

246
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:38,380
In fact, there is still a variant based on FreeBSD.

247
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,080
That's TrueNAS Core.

248
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,080
This one, TrueNAS Scale, is based on Linux.

249
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:50,080
And obviously this is made possible by some of the amazing work that's been done by the ZFS on Linux project.

250
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,280
This TrueNAS product is still ZFS first.

251
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:58,580
It's still the primary storage file system that they recommend and kind of push in the OS.

252
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:04,080
And everything else around that is kind of orthogonal to that original premise of ZFS first.

253
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,280
Yeah, ZFS with Gluster.

254
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:17,980
They kind of position TrueNAS Scale as a product that works great if you want to scale out your storage across multiple systems.

255
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:23,380
And they use Helm on the back end to manage all of this with a Kubernetes system.

256
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:28,680
So you could see how when you scale that out, that back end management system scales with it.

257
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:35,780
When you're deploying a Docker container on TrueNAS Scale, it's actually being orchestrated with Helm on the back end.

258
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:36,880
I think that's fascinating.

259
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,980
It must have been a ton of work to get all that working right too.

260
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:44,480
They really are pitching this as a ZFS plus Gluster.

261
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,980
And I'm curious what you think of that.

262
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:46,580
Well, it's interesting.

263
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:50,080
I mean, I've done a lot of work with Gluster through my OpenShift stuff at work.

264
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:57,280
And all I can tell you is that with version 3 of OpenShift, we used to ship Gluster to customers.

265
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:08,880
To end customers using a tool called Hickety to do a lot of the automated volume management of persistent volume claims and stuff like that on top of the underlying Gluster storage.

266
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:17,880
All I'll say about it is we don't ship Gluster with version 4 of OpenShift because it wasn't very reliable.

267
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,780
Gotcha.

268
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,980
Based on customer feedback, you might say.

269
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:21,480
Yeah.

270
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:30,180
I mean, you got to say, like, you look at the scale that Red Hat operates at and, you know, we battle test our stuff in development.

271
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:44,880
But the real test is when you put it into production on customer sites and the reality at least for some of the incredible scale at which the OpenShift clusters that I work on operate at is it just wasn't up to the job.

272
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,380
Now for smaller deployments, sure, it's okay.

273
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,280
I'm thinking it'll be fine.

274
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,380
It'll get the job done for a handful of servers.

275
00:20:51,380 --> 00:21:08,280
I mean, the thing with Kubernetes in particular is it can spin up hundreds of pods within a space of a minute or two, and sometimes each of those pods is making a request to the API underneath to request certain things and just things.

276
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:15,480
They're not really designed to handle that kind of scale, but I don't necessarily think that TrueNAS is kind of going after that particular market.

277
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:27,380
I mean, we look at the marketing materials and you could be forgiven for being given a bingo card and sort of crossing things off, looking at the things they've got, you know, Docker, KVM, Kubernetes, scaling, all this kind of stuff.

278
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:30,580
And I just, I look at it and wonder who it's for.

279
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:45,280
It's a serious storage appliance product, but if I'm looking for a serious storage appliance product, wouldn't I go to NetApp or Dell EMC or insert other major storage vendor here?

280
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,980
I don't know what niche is TrueNAS aimed at.

281
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:52,180
Is it home users like FreeNAS started out being?

282
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:54,780
Is it small, medium businesses?

283
00:21:54,780 --> 00:22:03,180
I'm genuinely curious if you use TrueNAS as part of your daily workflow and you're not just a home user, let me know.

284
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:05,280
selfhosted.show slash contact.

285
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:18,680
I think this is targeted at like your Linus Media Group sized companies that have a lot of storage needs and they also want to do KVM virtualization with GPU pass-through and that kind of stuff.

286
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:34,880
Or JB, you know, we have three physical x86 servers now and you could see using this to turn all three systems into one large storage system and take advantage of running applications across them and VMs.

287
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,580
I mean, I'm almost talking myself into it, just actually, you know, saying it right now.

288
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:43,380
The reality is, I think small to medium business.

289
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:51,980
I think people who were maybe buying a high-end QNAP or Synology or what is that NAS software that Linus Media Group uses?

290
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:52,680
Unraid.

291
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:57,880
Unraid, we've talked about Unraid on the show, like they may be going after a little bit of Unraid's market as well here, I think.

292
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,980
Yeah, Unraid was where I cut my teeth in Linux, darling, you know?

293
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,280
Yes, I remember.

294
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:07,880
In fact, I think we both, you know, we both are actually kind of fond of Unraid, even though neither one of us have used it in quite a while.

295
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:15,480
But it definitely serves a market niche and Freenaz scale feels like it's going after that market.

296
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:19,180
But they also say, we also have a way to go even bigger.

297
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:24,980
And, you know, so maybe if your storage needs ever start really getting big, we've got other solutions here for you as well.

298
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,880
It's an interesting pitch for sure.

299
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,380
And I'll be curious to see how it plays out over the next few years.

300
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:36,980
Now, I thought I'd spin it up in the name of science slash content and see how it performs.

301
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:42,280
So I built a new backup server in January, which somehow I haven't talked about on the show yet.

302
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,480
Oh, criminal!

303
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,480
I've kind of been meaning to.

304
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,080
Anyway, I'll go into more detail in a future episode.

305
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:55,780
But the quick pitch is it's a local box on my LAN that just duplicates the ZFS array from my basement to my attic, right?

306
00:23:55,780 --> 00:24:02,280
So it's opposite ends of the house, if a pipe bursts or something happens at one end of the house, it's okay at the other.

307
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:06,680
Obviously, I've got offsite backups in England for the rest of my backup methodology.

308
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:14,080
But this is to save me having to mail a hard drive from England instead of uploading eight, nine, ten terabytes, whatever it is.

309
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,980
Yeah, pipe bursts.

310
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,480
You don't really want to have to go through all that.

311
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,780
And if you got the hardware, why not?

312
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:18,480
Exactly.

313
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:24,280
So what I thought I'd do for the purposes of this segment was install TrueNow Scale on that backup box.

314
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:30,080
So I fired it up yesterday evening, installed the ISO, pretty painless.

315
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,780
I did it through the IP and my interface of the ASRock board I'm using.

316
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:36,980
Install was six minutes, something like that.

317
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:40,380
Really fast, painless, ZFS on route.

318
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,980
Great, done, booted, got an IP address straight away.

319
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:43,980
Everything was detected.

320
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,980
All my drives could be seen.

321
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:51,780
First thing the operating system tells me when it boots is update available.

322
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:55,180
I'm like, it was released yesterday.

323
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:59,580
I just downloaded the ISO and we're not talking small updates.

324
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:02,880
We're talking, you know, the ISO is two gig or something.

325
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,580
We're talking another 1.3 gigs worth of updates.

326
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:10,180
And I'm like, couldn't you have just rolled that into the ISO that you released yesterday?

327
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:12,180
That's the whole thing.

328
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,680
Yeah, yeah.

329
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,180
Maybe they froze the image a little bit ago or something.

330
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,080
Maybe, right?

331
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,380
I was like, fine, screw it.

332
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,280
Doesn't matter.

333
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,780
I'll do the update, press the button.

334
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:25,680
Then I'm presented with an error message that says cannot downgrade.

335
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:35,380
Release 22.02.0 cannot be downgraded to release 22.0.release.

336
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:39,880
And I think, man, if this is a sign of things to come, they just haven't checked the string,

337
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:44,580
you know, logic that's doing the passing of the logic about which updates the newer one there.

338
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:48,680
I'm thinking, okay, that's a fairly basic mistake to make.

339
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,080
But sure, fine.

340
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,680
We're human.

341
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,280
Okay, cool.

342
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,480
No problem.

343
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:57,880
I go to the storage tab next and I think, right, I need some storage before I can actually

344
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,580
even test out any of the features.

345
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:06,480
I need a ZFS pool in which to put my KVM virtual machines and my containers that I can now

346
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,980
run on top of TrueNAS scale because it's a proper operating system.

347
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,980
Just trying to trigger the BSD nerds there.

348
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,780
Wait, that was a totally factual statement.

349
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:16,280
What's that?

350
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:19,280
Fortunately, my ZFS pool showed up straight away.

351
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,980
You know, the backups pool was there.

352
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,680
Both drives were detected.

353
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,680
I click import.

354
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,780
It looks like it's doing something.

355
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:33,080
And on Proxmox, this process takes 20 seconds at most, 25.

356
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:40,080
That time elapses and I'm sort of, you know, watching the progress bar spin.

357
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:44,780
And then another minute goes by and I'm like, okay, this is taking a bit longer than I thought.

358
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:49,080
Another minute goes by and nothing's happening.

359
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:54,680
So then I drop to the command line, try and figure out what's going on, do a zpool import

360
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:58,080
list and it shows me all the available pools, including my backups pool.

361
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:04,580
And I'm like, okay, I'll reboot the box just in case that failed update did something silly.

362
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:06,780
I didn't do the GUI this time.

363
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:10,680
I just went straight to the command line, did a zpool import backups.

364
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:13,780
It imported the pool and I'm like, okay, cool, no problem.

365
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:15,580
Zpool list bang straight, straight away.

366
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:16,780
There it is.

367
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:19,580
Go to the UI, nothing.

368
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:23,080
So I reboot just in case there's some kind of mismatch there.

369
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,780
Nope, need to import the pool again.

370
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:28,080
And I'm like, oh, is it because you're doing it on the command line?

371
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,180
Is there some GUI command to import a pool that maybe you have to use?

372
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:31,880
Who knows?

373
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:35,580
I mean, good luck Googling anything for this thing right now because it's so brand new

374
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:42,180
and obviously the SEO behind TrueNAS is the last five years of TrueNAS core and FreeNAS before it.

375
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:47,380
And if I'm honest with you, Chris, I love the audience, but I don't love them enough to

376
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:50,480
waste more than three or four hours trying to figure this thing out.

377
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,480
And eventually after that time elapsed, I was like, screw this.

378
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,480
I'm going about the Proxmox.

379
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:58,780
I'm going to run my Ansible script and get things back up and running.

380
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:02,880
So yeah, ultimately TrueNAS scale was a massive fail for me.

381
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:08,180
I have typically struggled with these types of products and I often end up just going

382
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:14,280
back to basics and I think it's kind of unfortunate because in some ways these guys can unlock

383
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,680
stuff for me that I don't even know how to do.

384
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:20,580
I also feel like there's a spectrum of user that probably prefer something like this,

385
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:23,280
you know, and it works better for them as well.

386
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:26,080
And I wish I could kind of get my head in that space.

387
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:30,280
I was tempted for a brief moment to deploy it here at the studio and base our stuff on all

388
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:33,780
that because, well, you know, we were just going to build this YOLO setup.

389
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:38,480
It was like this crazy cross three system storage array.

390
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:43,580
And, you know, maybe even no redundancy, just tons of disks and stupid stuff like that.

391
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:46,380
That just has no sensible use.

392
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,580
And then we started thinking, well, what if we wanted to the opposite?

393
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:51,180
What if we really wanted to build this thing to be reliable?

394
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:54,080
We're like, you know, there's failover and all that kind of stuff.

395
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:58,280
And I got to say it's on my list of things to consider.

396
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:06,580
But what my preferred route would be to just build it really simple, build it basic and

397
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:09,080
probably, you know, manage it with something like Ansible.

398
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:12,880
The simpler you go, the easier it is to recover from a failure too.

399
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:19,380
Like in my pipe burst scenario, all I have to do is a ZFS send from one box to another

400
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:21,180
and I'm back to where I was.

401
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:26,880
I think it's very likely too that if you were to check back in, say, I don't know,

402
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:32,280
in episode 85 and see where TrueNAS scale is at, I bet you'd be in a totally different

403
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,280
state, right?

404
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:37,980
Even though they've been working on this since 2020, this is a massive reworking of the product

405
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:43,980
and it's going to be a little while before it's probably fully, fully cooked.

406
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:47,380
And I think they even consider it that, like, if you look at like their presentations on

407
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:51,480
this, they're kind of positioning it for more early adopters at this point.

408
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:55,180
There's a difference between fully cooked and not importing the basic storage pools

409
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:57,680
there.

410
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:00,580
TailScale.com slash self-hosted.

411
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:03,320
Go there to get a free personal account for up to 20 devices.

412
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,660
And of course you support the show.

413
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:08,620
What I love about TailScale is that it's zero config VPN.

414
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:12,980
I think it's going to blow your mind how fast you can get this thing set up and then it

415
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:15,040
just runs.

416
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:19,320
It connects all your devices directly using WireGuard's noise protocol.

417
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:23,880
So it's as tough as WireGuard, but it's a mesh network.

418
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:29,420
I was using it today to connect back to LadyJuice to check in on the Raspberry Pi because I

419
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:32,620
started getting some errors with the Uptime Kuma.

420
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:36,780
I was getting errors because I have Uptime Kuma running here in the studio and it connects

421
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:40,000
back to LadyJuice over TailScale and checks on stuff for me.

422
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,420
And sure enough, yep, I was having an outage, it turned out to be Starlink though.

423
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:47,380
But it was nice to know that I could go check on everything and I've created like my own

424
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:53,640
LAN that goes wherever I go and it can connect my servers, my workstations, my mobile devices

425
00:30:53,640 --> 00:31:01,220
even when you're separated by firewalls or even double NAT, TailScale just works.

426
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:05,800
I'm using it on my family's computers to help provide remote support now as well.

427
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:10,680
And I just love that every device essentially gets a static IP address, at least in my world.

428
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,680
It's pretty nice.

429
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:15,980
I really like the fact that you can use different nodes as exit nodes as well.

430
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:21,180
So if you want to come out in a different state or a different country for some reason,

431
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,180
you can totally do that.

432
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:27,420
So you use the advertise exit node feature and you know, for me and my iPlayer habit,

433
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:28,420
that's very handy.

434
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,460
Yeah, that's a power move right there.

435
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,780
That really is.

436
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:36,420
And the other thing that's great is that TailScale supports your authentication system, your

437
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:37,420
identity provider.

438
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:41,860
So you can enforce multi-factor authentication, you could deauthorize employees or devices

439
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:46,200
and stuff when people move on, like you get access and control over all that as well.

440
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:52,100
So go try it out for free for up to 20 machines and support the show by going to TailScale.com

441
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:56,440
slash self-hosted.

442
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,820
So David asks about keeping Nextcloud going.

443
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:02,280
Hey, Chris and the Badger, I've been listening for a while now and I've just started my journey

444
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,280
with Nextcloud.

445
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:06,020
It seems to be a perfect fit for my home lab.

446
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:10,740
And as I progress with my journey, I can see myself getting more into the, how do I say

447
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:17,580
it, enterprise-y way of doing things, specifically I'm talking around monitoring and security.

448
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:21,960
So what are some of your must-haves when you're deploying things like Nextcloud for that kind

449
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,940
of stuff, like monitoring and security?

450
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:29,060
I'm sure your first answer will be everything sits behind WireGuard, but outside of that,

451
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:31,740
it can be a bit overwhelming to newcomers.

452
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:36,460
Maybe everything sits outside of TailScale, right?

453
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:37,460
You know, it's funny.

454
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:42,700
I actually would go the other way, you know, I mean, so David asks, what would you install?

455
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:49,620
My top Nextcloud tip is only load the apps you need and then double check if you really

456
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:51,060
are using them and need them.

457
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:53,540
And if you don't, unload them, all right?

458
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:54,540
So that's my top tip.

459
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:59,200
But as far as turning stuff on, if you're going to expose Nextcloud to the internet,

460
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:04,060
turn on two-factor authentication and it integrates with probably any two-factor authentication

461
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:06,660
system that you love and know.

462
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:07,820
It's really easy to do.

463
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:08,880
They've made this simple.

464
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,500
There's an app you can install as well as some settings and I'll put a link in the show

465
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:16,160
notes for how to get that going because I think if you just keep Nextcloud up to date,

466
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:22,700
you keep it super lean, you turn on SSL and you turn on two-factor authentication.

467
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:26,040
I think that just doing those things, you'd probably be all right.

468
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,300
What's your feeling about updates for Nextcloud?

469
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:32,340
I think I'm probably five versions behind at this point.

470
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:34,460
I am a version behind myself.

471
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:38,340
You know, that's tricky here at JB is we run two Nextcloud instances.

472
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:43,260
One that you guys interact with up on the node and then we run another instance here

473
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:48,140
in the studio and it is kind of a pain in the butt to keep it updated if I'm honest

474
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:50,460
because sometimes there is some work that has to be done.

475
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:55,220
So what I do is I just wind to Wes and usually get him to do it, but we do it all through

476
00:33:55,220 --> 00:34:01,460
Docker Compose now and I'll do it on occasion, but I have to tell you, it slips and I don't

477
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:02,500
like that.

478
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:05,620
Not everybody has a Wes at their disposal, you know that, right?

479
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:08,180
Wes, you just do it like that.

480
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:12,820
Thankfully if you run it all through a container or some other system you're comfortable with,

481
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:15,500
I know some of our listeners use the snap.

482
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:18,180
Some of those methodologies are actually pretty easy to keep it up to date.

483
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:22,740
I'm only a version behind, I just checked on version 22, 23 is the latest, came out

484
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:23,740
in December.

485
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:24,740
It's not too bad.

486
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:25,740
Yeah.

487
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:31,500
In my head I'm like three behind, in reality I'm only one behind, but I feel that pressure.

488
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:36,860
Another important thing, David, would be to make sure that you are really cognizant about

489
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:40,020
how you actually deploy Nextcloud in the first place.

490
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:43,820
As Chris mentioned, some people use a snap, other people use a container, other people

491
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:47,140
do it by running it on the host itself.

492
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:51,580
And one of the most common ways I've seen listeners lose data is by not remembering

493
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:57,220
how they set something up six months, a year, two years ago, and then their server goes

494
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,380
down for some reason.

495
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:02,980
They've got a copy of the data from the sync client on their local system, but they don't

496
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:08,180
have a way to reconstruct the database and the users and everything as it was.

497
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:13,940
So use something like Docker compose, it would be my recommendation for a repeatable deployment

498
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:14,940
method.

499
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:19,500
Whatever you do, whether it's compose or whatever, make sure you write it down somewhere.

500
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,500
Well said.

501
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,860
Well said.

502
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:22,860
Plus one on that.

503
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:25,500
John writes in, looking for a simple way to get started.

504
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,860
He says, I hope you guys can help me here.

505
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:31,940
I'm starting to dive further into self hosting and I have a couple of Mac mini servers at

506
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:36,540
home and I was thinking about setting up the M1 box with either Docker, maybe with Portainer

507
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:41,700
or Unraid to start and learn about implementing containers for apps such as Plex Media Server,

508
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:45,020
Home Assistant, TDR, et cetera, et cetera.

509
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:49,380
I want to have a GUI as I'm not a coder apart from following how-to videos from YouTube

510
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,780
and using terminal commands.

511
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:51,780
What would you suggest?

512
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:52,780
Cheers, John.

513
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:57,800
Well, I think Unraid is a bloody brilliant place to start, to be honest with you.

514
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:05,340
It's a really great mix of UI, community, and documentation, and I think those three

515
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:09,580
things together make a perfect mix for newcomers.

516
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:17,100
A lot of people that are running Unraid do so because they are new to serving stuff at

517
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:19,940
home, you know, media servers, what have you.

518
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:24,740
By this point, Unraid has been around for, I want to say like 15 years.

519
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:30,260
So not only do you have that mix of noobs, for want of a better word, but you've also

520
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:35,780
got that mix of really experienced, passionate users that want other people to be as excited

521
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:41,520
about their special little thing that they found 10 years ago and has been working perfectly

522
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,700
for them ever since, you know?

523
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:48,200
And there's very few products on the market that do what Unraid does.

524
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:52,580
One of the things that makes it so great is the fact that you can stick any kind of hard

525
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:55,340
drive in there, you know, like a JBOD style.

526
00:36:55,340 --> 00:37:00,640
There's no real kind of constraints around like there is with ZFS, for example.

527
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:05,620
You've got to do a matched pair for a VDEV, and if you exceed the VDEV, you lose data

528
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:07,660
and yada, yada, yada.

529
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:08,940
Unraid's really simple.

530
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:14,900
If you have a parity disk, it has to be the biggest disk in the array or as big as.

531
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:21,300
If that fails, you've lost your fault tolerance, and if any further drive fails, you lose the

532
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,500
data on that drive.

533
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:26,660
And that's really simple to understand, and I think just that simple thing hooks a lot

534
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:28,460
of people into Unraid.

535
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:30,260
But then you start looking at things like the community.

536
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:33,740
There's lots of videos from a chap called SpaceInvader1 on YouTube.

537
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:38,180
He does really great simple-to-follow tutorials where you click here, you do this, you do

538
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:40,020
that, and off you go.

539
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:45,520
As you grow, you might find the guardrails that Unraid has are a little bit restrictive,

540
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,180
but as a new user, that's a good thing in my opinion.

541
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:54,020
I don't know if I've heard of anybody running Unraid on a Mac Mini, especially not an M1

542
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:55,020
Mac Mini.

543
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:58,220
I also don't know if Portainer works on Mac OS.

544
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:02,100
You'd probably end up using Docker Desktop on Mac OS.

545
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:07,340
He talks about wanting a GUI, and Unraid's definitely an option, maybe FreeNAS Scale

546
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:10,680
is an option, if you want to manage some disks.

547
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:15,020
If you're just going to have like one disk and you just want to run some applications,

548
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:20,560
you know, Alex, I almost wonder if it's worth considering the whole Home Assistant stack,

549
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:25,180
because if ultimately he wants Home Assistant anyways, when you install Managed Home Assistant,

550
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:29,940
you get an app store essentially that lets you install things like Plex, and it just

551
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,820
does it all through Docker containers.

552
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:35,820
The only trick is you have to install it, I mean, generally like they release a Raspberry

553
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:42,660
Pi image or something like that, but it does offer a way to run a lot of these popular

554
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:47,300
open source self-hostable applications with just a few clicks, because Home Assistant

555
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:53,020
itself has a supervisor part that can manage all these containers.

556
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:59,020
Otherwise yeah, probably something like Unraid or FreeNAS, or there's also just the option

557
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:04,940
of doing something like CentOS or Ubuntu and using something like Cockpit on top of that.

558
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:09,260
I know that's getting a little more advanced, but he did say he was comfortable using terminal

559
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,260
commands.

560
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:14,300
So that's another choice, but let us know how the journey goes, John.

561
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:21,020
I'll do a final shameless plug for PerfectMediaServer.com if you want to just do things from the command

562
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:22,020
line.

563
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,020
I think that's probably the way to go.

564
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:32,500
Well, behind the scenes, we are making secret, not so secret plans for a JB East Coast meetup.

565
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:36,300
And of course, in the planning phase, what's come up is like, how the hell are we going

566
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:38,260
to pay for this?

567
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:41,100
And it got us talking, and I don't think we're going to do it for this.

568
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:44,620
But down the road, there may be a project or something like a special edition of a show

569
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:47,420
or maybe some special trip.

570
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:49,340
How would we, if we wanted to, do crowdfunding?

571
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:53,500
And we thought, well, we'd like it to be open source and self-hostable.

572
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:57,500
I went out there and did a little looking around, and it looks like a lot of those projects

573
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,820
have died or become abandoned over the years.

574
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:05,700
So if you know of a self-hosted crowdfunding application that's alive and well, maybe you're

575
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:09,580
using it, let us know about it, self-hosted.show slash contact.

576
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:13,220
Because if it was ever something JB did want to get into, we'd like it to kind of align

577
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:14,220
with our values.

578
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:17,900
I can't believe it's taken us until this point in the show to actually even mention this.

579
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:24,780
But I know April the 9th in Raleigh, we're going to have an East Coast JB meetup.

580
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:32,020
And rumor has it that a certain RV dwelling podcaster might be joining us there.

581
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:33,020
It's true.

582
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:34,020
Although I'm going to fly in.

583
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:40,020
I think, I'm hoping it'll be a life goal if it's like one part mini vacation with the

584
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:46,900
fam because it'll be my son's 13th birthday and spring break.

585
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,940
And he is a Bitcoin nut.

586
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:53,020
So we're hoping we could fly into Miami, go to the Bitcoin conference for a couple of

587
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:58,900
days, and then fly up and hang out with you and the family and then go to a meetup.

588
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:00,860
It's all in the planning phase.

589
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:07,940
But Alex, we have needed to do an East Coast JB meetup for about 15 years.

590
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:11,540
I mean, it's embarrassingly bad.

591
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:14,820
And you and the community just were like, screw it.

592
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:16,420
We're just going to get something started.

593
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:22,980
And I was talking behind the scenes thinking, you know, I'm feeling like I really need to

594
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:23,980
take a little bit of a trip.

595
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:24,980
I am really feeling burned out.

596
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:26,700
Like I need to do something.

597
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:30,100
And this Bitcoin conference came up and this meetup came up and it's like, this is almost

598
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:31,220
too perfect.

599
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:33,020
So behind the scenes, we're trying to figure it out.

600
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:37,740
Well, of course, normally you're busy planning for Linux Fest Northwest, but for obvious

601
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:39,580
reasons that's still on hiatus.

602
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:40,580
Right.

603
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:43,460
And that was actually how the conversation started, because that's usually like a nice

604
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:46,660
little way for us to connect with the community once a year.

605
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:48,720
And we're going on two years now of not having it.

606
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,340
It's like our big event.

607
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:52,520
And you found a great spot, too.

608
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:55,900
So it's like, God, it just all seems like it's coming together, like a nice spot and

609
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:58,400
great weather on the East Coast.

610
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,420
Right on Dylan's birthday spring break.

611
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:02,180
I'm like, oh, let's do it.

612
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:03,180
So we're figuring it out.

613
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:05,540
Let me paint a picture for the audience.

614
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:06,540
Right.

615
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:12,020
So prime barbecue is a Texas style barbecue joint that's just opened out just outside

616
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:13,020
of Raleigh.

617
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:16,920
It's a place called Nightdale and it looks out over this big park.

618
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:21,100
And on the other side of the park is a place called Oak City Brewing.

619
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:25,100
So what I'm thinking is two, three o'clock in the afternoon, something like that.

620
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:29,260
We'll put all the details on meetup.com closer to the time, but something like two or three

621
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:32,700
o'clock in the afternoon on the Saturday, we'll meet at the barbecue place, go get some

622
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:37,580
food, sit on the lawn, go and eat and mingle with people.

623
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:42,060
And then as the evening progresses, we can head across the brewery and go and get some

624
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,060
drinks.

625
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:46,580
And I've been racking my brains for the last few weeks about where we could go in town

626
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:49,660
that was kind of a COVID safe location.

627
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:54,300
And the beauty of this place is we can all congregate in this place together, but we're

628
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:55,300
outside.

629
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:56,300
Right.

630
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:59,780
And the weather in Raleigh in April is going to be lovely, of course, apart from the pollen,

631
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:04,700
maybe that might be a thing, but on the whole, I think it will be a lovely day for everybody.

632
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:07,340
And it's going to be right next to some great stuff.

633
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:08,340
Yeah.

634
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:11,980
So the thing to do would be to join our meetup.

635
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:15,580
We don't have like one set for this, but you could join the group at meetup.com slash Jupiter

636
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:21,060
broadcasting or join the discord, selfhosted.show slash discord if you have questions.

637
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:26,140
But when we get our details solidified, which we're really close to, hopefully, we'll probably

638
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:27,940
make a proper meetup post about it.

639
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:34,660
The provisional plan, like I say, is Saturday, April 9th, 2 or 3 p.m. until we all get bored

640
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:36,620
and want to go home, something like that.

641
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:41,260
If you're anywhere in the area, we don't make it out to the East Coast too often.

642
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:42,260
So come join us.

643
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:43,560
It'll be a lot of fun.

644
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:45,700
And also thank you to our members.

645
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:49,460
You know, you guys really help us keep the show on the road and you also give us the

646
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:53,660
freedom to wait until a great sponsor like Talescale comes along.

647
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:57,820
You know, like you give us leverage there to make wise choices.

648
00:43:57,820 --> 00:44:00,420
You give us runways, they say in the business.

649
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:04,580
Selfhosted.show slash SRE if you'd like to join as a perk, you get more show.

650
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:06,100
You get a post show.

651
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:09,620
You can also support the entire network, just like the cost of two memberships and you support

652
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:14,580
all the shows and you get all the shows ad free plus that post show.

653
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:17,700
That network support is at Jupiter.party.

654
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:21,660
And as you all know by now, the place to go to get in touch with us is selfhosted.show

655
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:22,660
slash contact.

656
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:28,060
You can find me on the Discord at Alex KTZ and you could find me on matrix.

657
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:30,340
Come join us in the self-hosted matrix.

658
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:33,460
Our matrix server is Colony.JupiterBroadcasting.com.

659
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:36,300
I didn't mention it in the show and it's just a very quick addendum.

660
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:40,400
Big thanks to Jake, the real orange one, the orange one, whatever his handle is this week

661
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:45,500
for running our matrix party thing, set up party that we had a couple of weeks ago.

662
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:46,500
It went really well.

663
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:48,060
We had about 30 people show up.

664
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,300
It was a fun time on a Sunday.

665
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:52,900
Big thanks to Jake for setting that up.

666
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:55,140
And as always, thanks for listening everybody.

667
00:44:55,140 --> 00:45:17,260
That was self-hosted.show slash 65.
