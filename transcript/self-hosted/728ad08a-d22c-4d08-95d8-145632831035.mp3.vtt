00:00.000 --> 00:06.720
Coming up on today's show, I give you my thoughts on the new Helios 64 Ultimate Arm Powered NAS.

00:07.280 --> 00:10.640
And Chris has a huge sack full of your feedback.

00:14.560 --> 00:18.000
Okay, I'm Chris and this is Self Hosted 33.

00:21.360 --> 00:25.520
After last week's episode, everyone got the impression that both you and I

00:25.520 --> 00:28.960
were iOS users exclusively, but that's not actually the case.

00:28.960 --> 00:31.840
I am a whore to different OSes, Chris.

00:31.840 --> 00:37.280
I use Linux, Mac OS, Windows, Android, iOS on a daily basis.

00:37.280 --> 00:42.400
So I think I don't think I fall into that camp of being pigeonholed as an iOS user.

00:42.400 --> 00:44.560
I'm trying not to be offended, but it's hard.

00:45.280 --> 00:48.640
Well, you know what it was is because we were talking about audiobooks

00:48.640 --> 00:52.560
and we didn't mention any audio players for Android.

00:52.560 --> 00:54.080
We only mentioned them for iOS.

00:54.080 --> 00:55.760
That was just that was my bad.

00:55.760 --> 00:56.720
I'll tell you why that is.

00:56.720 --> 01:00.800
It's just simply because booksonics been so reliable for my wife that

01:00.800 --> 01:02.400
I didn't feel the need to try anything else.

01:02.400 --> 01:05.360
But there's some really good options that some listeners have sent in.

01:05.360 --> 01:08.960
Yeah, we'll link to those in the show notes for the for the Android

01:08.960 --> 01:12.000
ones that got at least a couple of mentioned via the email.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.800
I also have an Android and iPhone, but I do.

01:14.800 --> 01:18.800
I do mostly mostly use the iPhone, but I do love my pixel three.

01:18.800 --> 01:20.080
It is time for an upgrade.

01:20.080 --> 01:24.080
I'm just not in a particular rush, but I am in a rush to tell you about a cloud guru.

01:24.080 --> 01:26.240
This episode is brought to you by the all new cloud guru.

01:26.240 --> 01:29.600
The leader in learning for cloud Linux and other modern tech skills.

01:29.600 --> 01:32.160
They have hundreds of courses and thousands of hands on labs.

01:32.160 --> 01:34.240
So get certified, get hired and get learning.

01:34.240 --> 01:36.080
Go to a cloud guru dot com.

01:36.640 --> 01:40.000
I feel like our roles have reversed this episode.

01:40.000 --> 01:45.360
This Helio 64 hardware you're about to tell me about seems like something I would have bought.

01:45.360 --> 01:49.600
And it like would have been the natural upgrade from a Raspberry Pi

01:49.600 --> 01:53.280
four days to something a little more hardcore.

01:53.280 --> 01:57.840
So I'm extremely interested to know what your experience has been like with the with the Helio 64.

01:57.840 --> 01:58.480
And is it.

01:59.200 --> 02:00.960
Cobal, is that how you say the company?

02:00.960 --> 02:02.160
Cobal, I guess.

02:02.160 --> 02:03.200
Yeah, like the element.

02:03.200 --> 02:07.200
Yeah, this this thing builds itself as the ultimate arm powered NAS.

02:07.200 --> 02:09.520
And Cobal is the name of the company behind it.

02:10.080 --> 02:14.160
You can find them at cobalt dot IO and they have a couple of products.

02:14.160 --> 02:18.160
But the one that I picked up was the Helios 64.

02:18.160 --> 02:22.880
Now this thing purports to be, as it says, the ultimate arm powered NAS.

02:22.880 --> 02:26.560
It has five hotswap SATA 3 bays.

02:27.360 --> 02:29.600
It has an M2 SATA port.

02:29.600 --> 02:32.320
It supports hot plug for those drives.

02:32.320 --> 02:40.000
It's got two gigabit Ethernet ports, one of which is two point five gigabit USB-C.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.120
It's got a micro SD card slot, a couple of USB ports,

02:43.760 --> 02:47.760
and it's no bigger than, you know, your average Synology type box.

02:47.760 --> 02:49.200
OK, so it's about Synology size.

02:49.200 --> 02:50.160
I was just going to ask you that.

02:50.160 --> 02:53.520
It also has eMMC for storage.

02:53.520 --> 02:55.680
And then I understand it's a hexacore processor,

02:55.680 --> 03:00.720
but I don't really know what that actually means in terms of real world performance.

03:00.720 --> 03:02.880
Yeah, so I'll come on to all that later.

03:02.880 --> 03:05.920
But six core system on a chip arm.

03:05.920 --> 03:06.480
Wow.

03:06.480 --> 03:08.960
System four gigs of RAM.

03:08.960 --> 03:11.680
The eMMC is 16 gigabytes.

03:11.680 --> 03:14.880
You know, Alex, if this thing performs half as good as the specs sound,

03:14.880 --> 03:16.240
I'm going to be pretty impressed.

03:16.240 --> 03:16.800
We'll get there.

03:16.800 --> 03:22.800
One feature I thought was just unbelievably cool and just shows the power efficiency of arm

03:22.800 --> 03:25.760
is this thing has a built in UPS.

03:25.760 --> 03:28.560
It's got a pair of 18650 cell batteries in there.

03:29.200 --> 03:30.400
You don't know how cool this is.

03:30.400 --> 03:32.800
You just you have a NAS on your desk.

03:32.800 --> 03:36.320
You unplug it from the wall and the thing just stays running for 15 minutes.

03:36.320 --> 03:38.080
You pick it up and walk around the house with it.

03:38.080 --> 03:40.160
I mean, that is that is great.

03:40.160 --> 03:43.760
I mean, I'm not going to do that because I need a network cable and stuff.

03:43.760 --> 03:48.160
But in terms of money, I mean, you look at how much you could spend on just a UPS.

03:48.160 --> 03:54.160
That's easily a hundred or two for a decent one, you know, and to have that built into this unit

03:54.720 --> 04:00.080
for the ticket price of $295, which didn't include shipping.

04:00.080 --> 04:03.680
I think I paid about $330 for it to be shipped overall.

04:03.680 --> 04:04.880
The proposition is great.

04:05.360 --> 04:11.200
It also has a direct attached storage mode as well as a USB type C display mode.

04:11.200 --> 04:17.440
So in the promo materials, at least, they show it hooked up to your TV running Kodi,

04:17.440 --> 04:19.920
which I thought was a really interesting use case.

04:19.920 --> 04:23.040
That could be nice if, you know, the budget only allows for one machine.

04:23.040 --> 04:24.000
Yeah, absolutely.

04:24.640 --> 04:28.080
Now, I'll come on to my impressions in a second.

04:28.080 --> 04:34.880
But first of all, I wanted to let the audience know that this thing is it's a little DIY.

04:34.880 --> 04:38.160
So when it when it arrived, it was a kit.

04:38.160 --> 04:42.960
It was a box with baggies full of screws and drive trays and stuff.

04:42.960 --> 04:48.720
It's not fully assembled and the assembly took me about two hours or so.

04:49.440 --> 04:53.920
And that's on top of about a three month lead time for ordering it.

04:53.920 --> 04:59.920
So I'd waited, I think I ordered at the end of August and when I ordered,

04:59.920 --> 05:02.720
it told me it was going to be delivered in September.

05:02.720 --> 05:06.160
September came and went and I looked on the website and it's silently updated.

05:06.160 --> 05:12.400
To October, October came and went and silently updated to shipping soon.

05:12.400 --> 05:14.400
And then it went on the slow boat from China.

05:14.400 --> 05:19.440
So it took literally like felt like forever, you know, left China.

05:19.440 --> 05:20.960
And you don't hear from it again for weeks.

05:20.960 --> 05:26.240
And then suddenly this box shows up at my door and I'm like, oh, yeah, I ordered this thing ages ago.

05:27.040 --> 05:27.520
Yep.

05:27.520 --> 05:27.920
Yep.

05:27.920 --> 05:31.360
And if you go to the website right now, it doesn't say buy, it says preorder.

05:31.360 --> 05:33.440
So it's like another batch is coming.

05:33.440 --> 05:33.920
Yes.

05:33.920 --> 05:38.000
I think they're sold out of the batch that I have here, which is, I think, the first one.

05:38.560 --> 05:45.040
Now, what I will say is that the machined aluminum housing that it comes in is gorgeous.

05:45.040 --> 05:48.320
The outside, the look of it, sat on a shelf.

05:48.320 --> 05:51.280
This thing looks really premium.

05:52.080 --> 05:53.040
I love how it looks.

05:54.000 --> 06:00.640
The downside to it, to them being a, an upstart in the kind of case manufacturing world is there's

06:00.640 --> 06:05.840
a lot of rough edges and I mean, literally it drew blood in the odd place because there

06:05.840 --> 06:08.320
are so many sharp edges to just to catch you.

06:08.320 --> 06:14.400
It's like building a, a computer was 15 years ago before people like Fractal came along and

06:14.400 --> 06:15.520
really stepped up the game.

06:15.520 --> 06:19.120
So absolutely the outside looks great.

06:19.120 --> 06:22.880
And you know, sat on a shelf, which is where it's going to spend 99% of its life.

06:23.920 --> 06:29.040
It's, it's a huge thumbs up, but they have cut some corners in several very important

06:29.040 --> 06:36.640
areas. If you look at the product picture on the website, the front IO panel has what

06:36.640 --> 06:42.800
looks like a laser etched, you know, um, power button and reset button and, you know, HDD

06:42.800 --> 06:46.560
number one through five with little leds for LAN and USB.

06:46.560 --> 06:50.160
That looks like it's a laser etched led kind of front panel, right?

06:50.160 --> 06:51.280
It's a sticker, isn't it?

06:51.280 --> 06:52.080
It's a sticker.

06:52.080 --> 06:52.560
Yep.

06:52.560 --> 06:53.120
Yeah.

06:53.120 --> 06:57.120
And it's on this flimsy little PCB that's held in with a couple of small screws and

06:57.120 --> 07:02.000
if you push too hard, the entire thing, the sticker is stuck to kind of flexes and moves,

07:02.960 --> 07:09.520
which makes this ultra premium, beautiful aluminum chassis feel like it should cost

07:09.520 --> 07:10.880
a fraction of what it does.

07:11.680 --> 07:12.640
So that's disappointing.

07:12.640 --> 07:14.880
The same is also true of the rear IO panel.

07:14.880 --> 07:18.240
There are stickers there that go over the, um, the panel there.

07:18.240 --> 07:24.720
So in future revisions, I would love to see actual laser etching because I know that stuff

07:24.720 --> 07:29.120
doesn't come for free, but I think that is going to make a huge difference to the overall

07:29.120 --> 07:31.680
quality of the product, just the fit and finish.

07:31.680 --> 07:35.760
If it bumped the price to another 50 bucks, would it be worth it too?

07:35.760 --> 07:36.720
I'm not sure.

07:36.720 --> 07:41.520
I mean, I'm going to come onto the price at the end, I think, um, once you've heard the

07:41.520 --> 07:43.760
overall impression, you're just teasing it out.

07:43.760 --> 07:46.160
I got you now.

07:46.160 --> 07:50.960
Another thing, uh, that is a bit tricky is once you finally got it assembled, which as

07:50.960 --> 07:57.200
I say was a bit fiddly and took about two hours, they do have fantastic documentation.

07:57.200 --> 08:03.120
I just want to say that upfront wiki.cobol.io is built around MK docs, one of my favorite

08:03.120 --> 08:08.480
self-hosted wiki solutions and the quality of the documentation and the open schematics

08:08.480 --> 08:12.560
they have on there for all of the, you know, SATA controllers and the way that different

08:12.560 --> 08:14.480
things connect to each other and stuff.

08:14.480 --> 08:18.880
It's great, you know, um, and I'm, there's, there's a lot this company have done, right?

08:18.880 --> 08:24.640
So I want to just preface everything I'm about to say by saying most of it is good, but there's

08:24.640 --> 08:26.960
just a few other problems with it.

08:27.840 --> 08:30.640
So let's go on to installing the operating system.

08:31.680 --> 08:32.720
This isn't simple.

08:33.680 --> 08:40.960
So you have to flash the OS to the eMMC via a USB-C cable, uh, which you do using, you

08:40.960 --> 08:42.800
know, Balena Etcher or something like that.

08:42.800 --> 08:50.800
That's not too difficult, really, but it could be easier.

08:50.800 --> 08:52.720
It could be a USB key that you flash, which we're a lot more used to.

08:53.280 --> 08:56.640
They are making use of the direct USB-C attachment to do that.

08:56.640 --> 09:02.240
So once you've got the drivers installed into windows, which is what I was using, it's not

09:02.240 --> 09:06.480
too bad, but I can just imagine trying to talk my family through it over the phone or

09:06.480 --> 09:08.560
something as that's not going to work.

09:08.560 --> 09:14.960
The next thing is that once you've put the OS onto the eMMC, you think to yourself, right,

09:14.960 --> 09:18.160
I just press go and it's going to also configure and appear on the network.

09:18.160 --> 09:19.120
Well, not quite.

09:19.120 --> 09:24.480
You have to use something like PuTTY to connect to a serial console and do some initial

09:24.480 --> 09:29.040
Ambient configuration before it will boot and get a network IP address.

09:29.040 --> 09:33.120
Can you give me an idea of what kind of Ambient configuration you have to do there?

09:33.120 --> 09:35.360
That's getting in the weeds pretty quick, it sounds like.

09:35.360 --> 09:40.080
Yeah, if you've ever installed a Raspberry Pi one or something, you know, back in the

09:40.080 --> 09:43.280
day, you know, a lot of these things had wizards that you followed.

09:43.280 --> 09:45.440
I mean, it wasn't difficult to do.

09:46.080 --> 09:51.680
It was just stuff like set host name, set a time zone, you know, what do you want your

09:51.680 --> 09:53.280
boot order to be, that kind of stuff.

09:53.280 --> 09:56.160
But it's an in-curses kind of walk you through it wizard style?

09:56.160 --> 09:56.640
Correct.

09:56.640 --> 09:57.120
Yeah.

09:57.120 --> 09:59.920
And it's over a USB-C serial console.

09:59.920 --> 10:04.640
So it looks straight out of the movie hackers or something.

10:04.640 --> 10:11.280
You know, but once it's booted, it's very nice.

10:11.280 --> 10:12.160
It's very quiet.

10:12.160 --> 10:18.240
The fans that are in there are, I think, fairly cheap, Chineseium PWM fans.

10:18.240 --> 10:24.400
So I replaced them with a pair of Noctua fans and noticed a reasonable drop, not a seismic

10:24.400 --> 10:27.440
drop in noise, but definitely noticeable.

10:27.440 --> 10:34.560
Now, the fans are controlled using a fan control program, which is linked to CPU temperature

10:34.560 --> 10:35.040
right now.

10:35.040 --> 10:43.600
So that unfortunately leads to the fans going quite a lot as you, you know, run a particularly

10:43.600 --> 10:49.360
heavy, you know, while you're doing apps update, install, whatever, the fans will go bananas,

10:49.360 --> 10:53.600
even though the CPU temperature is only at about 60 degrees and the hard drives, which

10:53.600 --> 10:55.680
are the important thing in there, in my opinion.

10:55.680 --> 10:57.840
Right.

10:57.840 --> 10:59.760
Have moved not at all.

11:00.320 --> 11:05.680
So one thing I would like to see them address moving forward is have that temperature control

11:06.560 --> 11:11.440
or the speed control more accurately, I suppose, for the fans be linked to kind of overall

11:11.440 --> 11:16.640
chassis ambient temperature or take an average of the hard drives and then divide it by five

11:16.640 --> 11:20.720
or whatever and then do the fan curves based on that.

11:20.720 --> 11:24.400
I think I found a forum thread that said they were going to do that, but I couldn't find

11:24.400 --> 11:26.000
it researching for the episode again.

11:26.000 --> 11:32.800
So the fan noise isn't too bad, but it's just really when they ramp up and down that you're

11:32.800 --> 11:33.440
going to notice it.

11:33.440 --> 11:37.520
Now, it has been on the entire time we're recording right next to us.

11:38.080 --> 11:43.040
So it maybe it's maybe two feet from this microphone, which is a very sensitive one.

11:44.080 --> 11:46.080
So it is quiet when you're not doing anything with it.

11:46.800 --> 11:53.280
But I had a real problem trying to get ZFS working, which is you can imagine is

11:53.280 --> 11:59.520
is a problem for me because my primary use case for this box was going to be a local

12:00.400 --> 12:03.200
ZFS remote replication endpoint.

12:03.680 --> 12:08.160
It's going to just sit in a in a closet quietly getting on with its life.

12:08.160 --> 12:11.440
And it was just going to be a ZFS target.

12:11.920 --> 12:20.240
But because it's running Ambien because it's an ARM CPU and not full on Ubuntu, the ZFS

12:20.240 --> 12:26.880
modules aren't in the kernel, and then that leads you down the road of having to do DKMS

12:26.880 --> 12:28.960
and worry about specific kernels.

12:28.960 --> 12:33.440
And after about two or three hours last night, I just gave up on to throw my laptop at the

12:33.440 --> 12:36.800
wall because, man, I hate DKMS.

12:36.800 --> 12:42.480
Yeah, it's always that, oh, right moment when you're doing your updates and then you

12:42.480 --> 12:44.320
realize, oh, I'm going to have to wait for this.

12:44.320 --> 12:45.760
Oh, I hope it doesn't break.

12:45.760 --> 12:47.280
I just couldn't get it working.

12:47.280 --> 12:52.480
I mean, as well, I say that I had it working and then the kernel upgraded without me

12:52.480 --> 12:53.040
noticing.

12:53.600 --> 12:56.000
And then I just haven't been able to get it to work since.

12:56.000 --> 13:02.240
So there's a pair of drives in there that are ZFS ready, but I just can't get the the

13:02.240 --> 13:03.040
module to load.

13:03.040 --> 13:06.400
So maybe I'll get it working over the next few weeks.

13:06.400 --> 13:09.280
But but right now it's a pain in the ass, to be honest with you.

13:09.280 --> 13:13.040
And that's a real shame because they actually bill and this was a learning for me.

13:13.040 --> 13:17.600
I was speaking with Pope on Twitter over the weekend for those of you that don't know,

13:17.600 --> 13:20.800
Pope works for Canonical, so he knows a thing or two about Ubuntu.

13:20.800 --> 13:27.120
And he was schooling me on the fact that even though on the Kobol website it says it's

13:27.120 --> 13:33.440
a focal fossa image, 2004 image, it's not Ubuntu, even though it says Ubuntu and has

13:33.440 --> 13:37.440
the Ubuntu logo, Ambien is not Ubuntu.

13:37.440 --> 13:38.960
So you live and learn.

13:38.960 --> 13:41.440
You're telling me on their website they claim it's Ubuntu?

13:41.440 --> 13:47.360
So if you go to wiki.kobol.io slash download and take a look at the images there, Chris,

13:47.360 --> 13:48.640
and tell me what you think.

13:48.640 --> 13:50.960
Is that misleading or is it just me being an idiot?

13:50.960 --> 13:51.360
It is.

13:51.360 --> 13:56.320
It's like they have they have Debian 10 Buster and Ubuntu 2004 listed is essentially what

13:56.320 --> 13:57.040
is they have both.

13:57.040 --> 13:58.960
It looks like it's hard to say, though.

13:58.960 --> 14:00.080
It's hard to say when you click it.

14:01.600 --> 14:02.640
I'd have to actually down.

14:02.640 --> 14:03.040
You're right.

14:03.040 --> 14:04.480
It is it is a little vague.

14:04.480 --> 14:07.920
I'd have to download to actually to actually determine.

14:07.920 --> 14:11.040
And so then if you scroll down that page a little further, you get a bunch of known

14:11.040 --> 14:13.760
limitations regarding some of the hardware things.

14:13.760 --> 14:22.400
So one of the issues that I ended up facing was I plugged my gigabit LAN switch into the

14:22.400 --> 14:25.440
two point five gigabit ethernet port that's on the thing.

14:26.320 --> 14:28.240
And I ended up getting horrible.

14:28.240 --> 14:32.480
I'm talking like 10 or 15 megabyte out of a thousand.

14:32.480 --> 14:32.800
Right.

14:32.800 --> 14:35.920
So very, very slow performance.

14:35.920 --> 14:39.520
And it turns out it requires a hardware fix.

14:39.520 --> 14:42.480
I'm going to put a link to this in the show notes.

14:42.480 --> 14:45.840
But if you're interested, go and take a look at what their proposed fixes.

14:45.840 --> 14:49.200
It's to solder a wire on the back of the PCB.

14:50.320 --> 14:51.040
Are you going to do it?

14:52.560 --> 14:53.280
I am.

14:53.280 --> 14:55.280
I mean, that's almost that's almost your kind of thing.

14:55.840 --> 14:59.280
I am because I'm comfortable with it because I've been doing, you know, building racing

14:59.280 --> 15:00.320
drones and stuff for years.

15:00.320 --> 15:02.640
I'm quite comfortable at soldering small stuff.

15:02.640 --> 15:09.840
But this wire would be maybe two centimeters long if that and going on to very, very tiny

15:09.840 --> 15:12.080
surface mount components and a small pin.

15:13.040 --> 15:18.000
So if you screw that up, I don't know what the warranty would say about that.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.760
They don't really mention anything.

15:19.760 --> 15:23.120
And, you know, the final conclusion at the end of this post is we will, of course, fix

15:23.120 --> 15:25.040
this issue in a future revision of the board.

15:25.840 --> 15:29.600
But what they don't say is what they're going to do for everybody that has current boards.

15:29.600 --> 15:30.880
My assumption is nothing.

15:30.880 --> 15:35.280
That's perhaps it shows some wisdom in choosing to do these in batches because they realize

15:35.280 --> 15:37.360
that they're going to have kinks to work out.

15:37.360 --> 15:42.080
Perhaps I would like the option to send mine back for a replacement.

15:42.080 --> 15:45.040
Yeah, I could see that seems seems reasonable.

15:45.040 --> 15:49.200
They may not be too excited about offering that because they don't even have probably

15:49.200 --> 15:51.200
devices to replace yours with.

15:51.200 --> 15:51.840
Sure.

15:51.840 --> 15:57.600
But if you're a company offering a product, I think maybe a refund something, you know,

15:57.600 --> 16:01.840
I don't know, because if I screw this up, which, you know, with a soldering iron on some

16:01.840 --> 16:04.400
some components that are that small, it's very possible.

16:04.400 --> 16:05.040
Sure.

16:05.040 --> 16:05.440
What then?

16:05.440 --> 16:06.960
Am I up the creek without a paddle?

16:07.760 --> 16:10.880
Then you've got a really nice looking piece of equipment.

16:10.880 --> 16:11.440
Yeah.

16:11.440 --> 16:18.560
Now, I think if if these guys had marketed it such that here is a kick ass aluminium

16:19.120 --> 16:25.120
beautiful machined case that you can buy that, by the way, also we sell a kit that fits inside

16:25.120 --> 16:28.000
of, I think it would be a completely different proposition.

16:28.720 --> 16:29.280
But they didn't.

16:29.280 --> 16:33.760
They tried to go full Apple, do the OS, do the hardware, do the software.

16:33.760 --> 16:34.260
Right.

16:35.120 --> 16:40.400
And for me, they've just fallen short in enough key areas that it's really taking the

16:40.400 --> 16:41.600
shine off the product for me.

16:42.240 --> 16:47.680
Another example is and again, this is my fault because I can't read.

16:47.680 --> 16:56.640
Apparently, the M2 SATA slot that's built into the motherboard disables SATA port one.

16:56.640 --> 17:00.400
So you suddenly go from having a five, three and a half inch drive capacity.

17:00.400 --> 17:04.640
You put an M2 drive in there and suddenly one of the bays is useless.

17:06.000 --> 17:12.080
Why not spend the extra few cents on a SATA control that can do six devices?

17:12.720 --> 17:14.800
I just don't understand why they would cut that corner.

17:14.800 --> 17:16.160
It's just really annoying.

17:16.160 --> 17:22.800
And then I suppose the other thing that kind of tripped me up was the USB-C cable that

17:22.800 --> 17:24.080
ships with the product.

17:24.080 --> 17:28.960
I actually had to cut some of the rubber off the outside of it to make it fit in the port

17:28.960 --> 17:29.460
properly.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.840
They have a Wiki article about that.

17:32.480 --> 17:36.000
There's just a lot of rough edges literally with this product.

17:36.800 --> 17:41.920
That said, all of this said, and I'm aware that that all sounds a little bit negative.

17:41.920 --> 17:49.120
The reality is, I bought a product, it shipped, it arrived eventually, it sat on my desk next

17:49.120 --> 17:52.480
to me working and pretty much as advertised.

17:53.200 --> 17:57.280
The hard drive hot swap caddies are a little bit hard to get in and out because the manufacturing

17:57.280 --> 17:58.160
tolerances.

17:58.160 --> 18:05.520
I spoke with Gautier at COBOL about this and he said that it's only during mass production

18:05.520 --> 18:09.440
that we can start to see what really needs to be improved because at the prototyping

18:09.440 --> 18:14.880
stage, different factories will always show us their best in terms of tolerances.

18:14.880 --> 18:16.240
That's an interesting insight.

18:16.240 --> 18:20.160
They do say they're going to rework the backplane for the drives, which is my other major complaint

18:20.160 --> 18:20.880
with this unit.

18:20.880 --> 18:27.440
So the backplane for the five SATA drives are these little plastic things that convert

18:27.440 --> 18:35.120
the ketchup and mustard cables into a SATA power and SATA data connector.

18:35.120 --> 18:40.080
And they've got these really very, very small, thin plastic tabs on either side to mount

18:40.080 --> 18:40.880
them to the chassis.

18:41.920 --> 18:47.360
And I bent a couple of them just by inserting a drive slightly misaligned, which was enough

18:47.360 --> 18:50.160
to make the power pins on the drive have contact.

18:50.160 --> 18:53.120
So when I was putting the drive in, I could hear it spinning up.

18:53.120 --> 18:57.440
So I'm like, okay, cool, the drive seated fine, but it wasn't making contact with the

18:57.440 --> 18:58.320
data pins.

18:58.320 --> 19:02.160
And it took me a couple of hours to figure that out.

19:02.160 --> 19:05.360
Oh, I bet.

19:05.360 --> 19:09.200
So yeah, once I took it, I basically had to take the whole thing apart again, saw that

19:09.200 --> 19:14.720
I'd bent the tabs, I guess, just by having to push so hard to get the drives in because

19:14.720 --> 19:16.080
the tolerances were so tight.

19:16.960 --> 19:20.880
It actually shaved plastic off the drive caddies as I did so.

19:21.760 --> 19:25.200
I guess I just bent the connector at the back.

19:25.200 --> 19:26.160
You're super tough.

19:26.160 --> 19:27.200
Yeah, yeah.

19:27.200 --> 19:28.240
You're strong.

19:28.240 --> 19:35.600
The drive caddies themselves are not tool-less.

19:35.600 --> 19:40.160
You need to use four screws to mount drives into the caddies and then two screws to secure

19:40.160 --> 19:44.160
the caddies into the drive bays themselves as well.

19:44.160 --> 19:47.280
So, you know, it's not perfect.

19:47.280 --> 19:53.760
And I think for the price of 300-ish dollars, I look at what we could get from Synology

19:53.760 --> 19:58.320
or QNAP, and I'm having a hard time with it.

19:58.320 --> 19:59.840
What would be the advantage here?

19:59.840 --> 20:06.320
Because the Synology products and the QNAP products, they offer a lot of features.

20:06.800 --> 20:11.440
So what do you think the Helio 64's biggest advantage over those would be?

20:11.440 --> 20:13.200
Well, we didn't talk about performance yet.

20:13.200 --> 20:13.840
Uh-huh.

20:13.840 --> 20:14.400
I know.

20:14.400 --> 20:15.120
Oh, I know.

20:16.160 --> 20:16.880
I'm waiting.

20:16.880 --> 20:21.040
Basically, if you want to do transcoding, forget about it, of anything.

20:21.040 --> 20:21.600
Oh.

20:21.600 --> 20:24.240
It can handle direct play just fine.

20:24.960 --> 20:32.000
It will just about handle transcoding a true HD audio track, but not much more than that.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.400
And even then, the CPU is going bananas trying to do it.

20:34.400 --> 20:39.360
So I'd like to see some hardware circuitry, a bit like, you know, Apple Silicon is doing

20:39.360 --> 20:41.760
to get some of those crazy numbers with the M1.

20:42.320 --> 20:47.040
Some hardware decoders for H.264, H.265, that kind of thing.

20:47.040 --> 20:51.920
Maybe some kind of quick sync of some sort.

20:51.920 --> 20:54.560
Well, yes, that's the other elephant in the room, isn't it?

20:54.560 --> 20:59.520
I mentioned Synology and QNAP because they are off-the-shelf, ready-to-go products that

20:59.520 --> 21:03.840
you could send to your family and say, right, just shove a couple of hard drives in it,

21:03.840 --> 21:05.840
and I'll do the rest remotely.

21:05.840 --> 21:12.000
You know, you could, and over at serverbuilds.net right now, actually, they've been linking

21:12.000 --> 21:19.120
on eBay this UNAZ chassis, which can take a mini-ITX motherboard and run whatever OS

21:19.120 --> 21:23.440
you want on it, and you have full control over everything, which I think is the primary

21:23.440 --> 21:28.800
advantage of the Helios 64 over a Synology device is that you own it, right?

21:28.800 --> 21:35.280
It's not, you're not beholden to whatever Synology decide to do with DSM moving forward

21:35.280 --> 21:37.040
or who knows.

21:37.040 --> 21:37.520
Right.

21:37.520 --> 21:42.320
And the fact that they offer both Ubuntu and Armbian is rather nice.

21:42.320 --> 21:43.120
You have some choice there.

21:43.120 --> 21:46.000
You could probably put Arch on there if you tried hard enough.

21:46.000 --> 21:50.000
But I think the other thing, the other story with these ARM devices, and for some of us,

21:50.000 --> 21:55.920
it matters more, is power usage, and the Helios 64 may have them licked there.

21:55.920 --> 21:58.160
30 watts at full load.

21:58.160 --> 21:59.280
Whoa, really?

21:59.280 --> 22:00.320
That's pretty impressive.

22:00.320 --> 22:01.440
With all the drives spun up.

22:01.440 --> 22:02.640
Right, right.

22:02.640 --> 22:08.320
Compare that to my dual Xeon system in the basement that's pulling 300 and something

22:08.320 --> 22:10.320
at idle, you know?

22:10.320 --> 22:14.000
So there is a real benefit to having these low power devices.

22:14.000 --> 22:18.240
You know, the fans that I mentioned run at zero RPM most of the time.

22:18.240 --> 22:22.320
Yeah, I'm really glad you checked that because fan noise and power draw, I think, are the

22:22.320 --> 22:25.440
big part of these ARM devices in a review.

22:25.440 --> 22:28.080
You got to look at that because that's where they're going to be most competitive.

22:28.080 --> 22:32.080
So it does seem like as far as noise, because you're podcasting with it right now,

22:32.080 --> 22:36.400
and as far as power draw, it may beat what those other products have to offer, maybe.

22:36.400 --> 22:40.400
It might, as long as you're aware of all of the caveats going in, and the fact that you

22:40.400 --> 22:45.680
are basically a beta tester for this product, as long as you're fine with all those things,

22:45.680 --> 22:47.680
then go for it.

22:47.680 --> 22:53.360
You know, I was hoping for a bit more of a finished product, like, particularly from

22:53.360 --> 23:00.240
the software perspective, there's lots of things in Ambien that on the Helios 64 forums

23:00.240 --> 23:04.880
users are talking about fan control being one of them, and there's a few other things

23:04.880 --> 23:06.000
as well.

23:06.000 --> 23:10.800
If you look at the known issues on the download page in the Wiki, you know, you can see that

23:10.800 --> 23:17.440
some kernels will let you monitor the internal battery, some kernels won't.

23:17.440 --> 23:23.280
Suspender RAM is not supported because of some issue with the USB host controller.

23:23.280 --> 23:27.760
Some kernels have kernel panics on shutdown, and some don't.

23:27.760 --> 23:35.120
So, you are very much a beta tester, and I think for the price it's a bit hard to swallow,

23:35.120 --> 23:37.360
but it is a beautiful physical thing.

23:37.360 --> 23:41.200
That it is, and it needs to start somewhere.

23:41.200 --> 23:42.960
These devices will only get better over time.

23:42.960 --> 23:46.960
They'll be able to add things like accelerated hardware, accelerated decoding.

23:46.960 --> 23:51.600
It may even be possible with the SOC it has, maybe it just hasn't been enabled via software

23:51.600 --> 23:52.600
yet.

23:52.600 --> 23:53.600
Yeah.

23:53.600 --> 23:54.600
So those things will improve.

23:54.600 --> 23:57.920
They'll be able to address things like the wire harness approach I mentioned for the

23:57.920 --> 23:58.920
backplane.

23:58.920 --> 24:04.080
They're going to move to a PCB backplane on the next batch to address issues exactly like

24:04.080 --> 24:05.080
the one that I faced.

24:05.080 --> 24:11.040
So, you know, they are going to improve things over time, and if all my $300 has served to

24:11.040 --> 24:16.440
do is enable them to eventually build the ultimate ARM-powered NAS, then it might be

24:16.440 --> 24:17.440
worth it.

24:17.440 --> 24:22.440
And I think ARM is the future, Apple are showing us that, you know, just the sheer power on

24:22.440 --> 24:24.240
offer with that M1 chip.

24:24.240 --> 24:32.160
I mean, I've been watching the benchmark videos over the weekend, and wow, I mean, it's fast,

24:32.160 --> 24:33.160
that thing.

24:33.160 --> 24:34.160
Yeah.

24:34.160 --> 24:36.560
And I have to tell you that 30 watts is extremely appealing to me.

24:36.560 --> 24:37.560
I'm sure it is.

24:37.560 --> 24:41.400
Yeah, Mr. I run on batteries in the middle of the desert half the time.

24:41.400 --> 24:42.400
Right.

24:42.400 --> 24:45.280
So that to me is something where it's like, okay, I want to see where this goes.

24:45.280 --> 24:49.560
But you know, your review here has made me appreciate something I don't think I've really

24:49.560 --> 24:54.400
thought about when it comes to pre-built NASes, because I think traditionally both you and

24:54.400 --> 24:59.160
myself have done it the more like complicated way where we build an x86 server and it has

24:59.160 --> 25:04.800
a bunch of disks, and like my case, I went to a Unix, or I think it's Unix Surplus, is

25:04.800 --> 25:06.400
that what it's called?

25:06.400 --> 25:10.960
And I got myself, you know, a whole chassis, and I have big disks slided, and then that's

25:10.960 --> 25:12.540
how I do a NAS.

25:12.540 --> 25:20.480
This is it, these smaller NASes, these product NASes, like the Helio 64 and like the Synology,

25:20.480 --> 25:21.940
they're a category of their own.

25:21.940 --> 25:26.960
And the point that you made about how things like the battery detection and the thermal

25:26.960 --> 25:31.800
sensors and those things not quite being worked out, because right now they're not upstream

25:31.800 --> 25:33.000
everywhere yet.

25:33.000 --> 25:38.080
In a couple of years, it'll probably be universal across Linux distros where that stuff is supported.

25:38.080 --> 25:43.280
But with something like DSM, they're building it for that device to support that specific

25:43.280 --> 25:44.480
device and their other ones.

25:44.480 --> 25:50.640
And so they can purpose load hardware and software to make sure everything works together

25:50.640 --> 25:55.840
so you can get something that runs DSM and have a pretty, you know, as long as you've

25:55.840 --> 26:01.280
looked at the specs, it's going to do hardware decoding of your Plex videos because they've

26:01.280 --> 26:04.960
got the chip and they've got the software and they're going to support it because it's

26:04.960 --> 26:05.960
one package.

26:05.960 --> 26:11.520
So if you're going for these one package products that are everything from the chassis disk

26:11.520 --> 26:16.160
to the OS, it seems like that might be the more appliance like strategy where you know

26:16.160 --> 26:17.960
you're going to have better long term luck.

26:17.960 --> 26:25.880
And I mean, I have I think I don't know, Alex, it it actually could be a six year old, seven

26:25.880 --> 26:29.320
year old Synology at Angela's house.

26:29.320 --> 26:30.900
And it's still running today.

26:30.900 --> 26:34.840
And about a month ago, I logged into it and did a bunch of updates.

26:34.840 --> 26:41.400
And it's still running 24 seven out in a garage for I mean, may even be seven years.

26:41.400 --> 26:44.120
Yeah, you buy these things to be an appliance.

26:44.120 --> 26:47.100
You shove the disks in, turn it on and off you go.

26:47.100 --> 26:48.680
And that should that should be the end of it.

26:48.680 --> 26:51.880
That's that's the last thought you should give this type of device, in my opinion.

26:51.880 --> 26:56.880
I did note on their website that they have adapters so you can put two and a half SSDs

26:56.880 --> 27:00.040
in there, which is probably what I do for vibration resistance.

27:00.040 --> 27:01.980
But they're about six bucks a pop.

27:01.980 --> 27:08.000
So I'll in it, I'd probably be close to $400 if I was going to buy this thing.

27:08.000 --> 27:13.040
If I was interested in power savings, if I didn't need hardware accelerated decoding,

27:13.040 --> 27:15.920
or if I felt like maybe it's going to get fixed, would you recommend it to me?

27:15.920 --> 27:18.320
Because I may be the target audience for this thing.

27:18.320 --> 27:20.080
It's a tricky question to answer.

27:20.080 --> 27:25.600
I think, yes, but with the caveats we've discussed, you think the price is right.

27:25.600 --> 27:31.880
As long as you go into it with your eyes open, then definitely maybe it depends on you.

27:31.880 --> 27:33.720
It's not for it's not for everybody.

27:33.720 --> 27:34.920
That I think is my answer.

27:34.920 --> 27:37.560
It's not for everyone.

27:37.560 --> 27:39.120
Linode dot com slash SSH.

27:39.120 --> 27:45.280
Go there to receive a $100 60 day credit towards a new account and support this here podcast.

27:45.280 --> 27:47.080
Linode is our cloud hosting provider.

27:47.080 --> 27:51.240
Any time we're trying something that has a cloud component for the show that we can self

27:51.240 --> 27:52.780
host, we spin it up on Linode.

27:52.780 --> 27:58.660
The back end infrastructure for the JB podcast network, Linode, my personal sites, Linode.

27:58.660 --> 28:03.500
If you need a simple personal server for a blog or a portfolio or maybe a game server

28:03.500 --> 28:07.920
or a VPN server, Linode has you covered.

28:07.920 --> 28:11.080
And if you get $100 credit, you can try out some serious systems, too.

28:11.080 --> 28:15.100
I mean, you'll be cooking with gas because they have rigs that start at $5 a month.

28:15.100 --> 28:17.240
So you've got a lot to play with there.

28:17.240 --> 28:21.000
And if you need to scale your business or maybe something you're doing goes popular,

28:21.000 --> 28:24.000
gets viral, they can help you there, too.

28:24.000 --> 28:28.800
It's a really fantastic cloud hosting service because they've got the network to really

28:28.800 --> 28:32.640
back it all up, 40 gigabit connections coming to the hypervisor.

28:32.640 --> 28:34.960
Plus Linode's been around since 2003.

28:34.960 --> 28:40.600
So they've been able to secure some super great long term relationships in connectivity.

28:40.600 --> 28:44.560
Plus on top of that, they've got native SSD storage for each of the hosts, 11 data centers

28:44.560 --> 28:48.960
around the world, and Linode costs 30 to 50% less than the major cloud providers.

28:48.960 --> 28:53.960
They've been around longer, they're independently owned, and you can support the show.

28:53.960 --> 28:58.080
Linode.com slash SSH.

28:58.080 --> 29:01.200
Turns out our listeners are the target market for audiobooks.

29:01.200 --> 29:04.280
Who'd have thought, Chris, people that like podcasts also like audiobooks.

29:04.280 --> 29:07.480
Yeah, I guess when you put it that way, it does seem kind of obvious.

29:07.480 --> 29:10.720
But man, did we get a lot of feedback about audiobooks.

29:10.720 --> 29:15.320
So I collected, like I mentioned earlier in the show, some of the apps that people sent

29:15.320 --> 29:16.320
in.

29:16.320 --> 29:20.120
But I also thought I would just cover a couple of the more clever ways people are consuming

29:20.120 --> 29:24.640
their audiobooks once they have freed them from their DRM or acquired them in some other

29:24.640 --> 29:25.640
means.

29:25.640 --> 29:30.320
And Phil wrote in and he said, stop thinking about audiobooks as some special thing you

29:30.320 --> 29:33.000
need a specific player for.

29:33.000 --> 29:36.560
Audiobooks are basically identical to podcasts.

29:36.560 --> 29:40.260
Just use a podcast player and publish your audiobooks via an RSS feed.

29:40.260 --> 29:44.880
We got like eight different versions of how people are converting their audiobooks into

29:44.880 --> 29:45.880
podcast feeds.

29:45.880 --> 29:47.720
It seems to be really popular.

29:47.720 --> 29:52.720
Phil here, he's written a Python script that generates an RSS feed given from a folder.

29:52.720 --> 29:56.320
He put that behind some HTTP server with basic authentication.

29:56.320 --> 30:00.960
And then he says, with that, I build a Docker container that hosts my audiobooks in an RSS

30:00.960 --> 30:01.960
feed.

30:01.960 --> 30:04.600
And he just has that and he subscribes to that in his app.

30:04.600 --> 30:08.240
He says, I'd actually be happy to release the script and container to the community,

30:08.240 --> 30:10.440
but they aren't really ready for public consumption yet.

30:10.440 --> 30:13.800
It would be great if I could get a few spare cycles from someone in the community to clean

30:13.800 --> 30:15.520
it up before releasing the code.

30:15.520 --> 30:17.000
Maybe you can help facilitate such things.

30:17.000 --> 30:21.240
And Alex, we got a couple of people that have come up with clever scripts on how they convert

30:21.240 --> 30:22.640
things or do what.

30:22.640 --> 30:26.520
And they often ask, should I share it with the community?

30:26.520 --> 30:29.960
And it got me thinking, maybe we could use our GitHub for that.

30:29.960 --> 30:34.040
Because people won't know how to find individual GitHubs for all of this.

30:34.040 --> 30:38.960
Maybe there's a way for us to use our GitHub as a jumping off point for people's Ansible

30:38.960 --> 30:42.880
scripts and cool Python scripts and other stuff.

30:42.880 --> 30:44.180
Several things came in.

30:44.180 --> 30:48.240
So let's you and I ruminate on that, because that might be a way we could facilitate some

30:48.240 --> 30:49.240
of this.

30:49.240 --> 30:51.800
And then you combine that with the Discord, and it could be cooking with gas again.

30:51.800 --> 30:53.240
I like cooking with gas these days.

30:53.240 --> 30:57.600
We do have that Wiki that's been sort of languishing a little bit lately.

30:57.600 --> 31:04.000
So maybe we could have the best audio book playing Wiki page on the internet, something

31:04.000 --> 31:05.000
like that.

31:05.000 --> 31:06.000
That'd be pretty good.

31:06.000 --> 31:09.440
Turns out, though, that there's not a lot that you can't do with FFmpeg.

31:09.440 --> 31:10.440
I know.

31:10.440 --> 31:13.660
Yeah, including convert your Audible books, turns out, Phil.

31:13.660 --> 31:16.960
And actually a couple of others, and this probably is what OpenAudible is just doing

31:16.960 --> 31:23.000
on the back end, really, has a FFmpeg script to check and convert.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.600
One more podcast trick.

31:25.600 --> 31:27.400
This one comes from James.

31:27.400 --> 31:31.480
He says he uses OpenAudible to download his purchases to his home server.

31:31.480 --> 31:36.460
And then he has a PHP script and a cron job to auto-generate RSS feeds for any book that

31:36.460 --> 31:38.800
appears in the audio books directory.

31:38.800 --> 31:42.280
I have another tiny script that then creates an index of all the RSS feeds.

31:42.280 --> 31:45.520
When I want to listen to a book, I just add the feed to Antennapod.

31:45.520 --> 31:49.680
It's super handy, and it takes care of all of the offline syncing issues and lets me

31:49.680 --> 31:54.460
choose if I want to listen to a whole book on the go or a podcast here and there in between

31:54.460 --> 31:56.240
chapters using Smart Shuffle.

31:56.240 --> 31:59.280
It's basic, but maybe I should publish my scripts.

31:59.280 --> 32:00.680
Would anybody want that?

32:00.680 --> 32:01.680
Where could I do that?

32:01.680 --> 32:04.320
Well, you know what they say, sharing is caring.

32:04.320 --> 32:07.080
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we'll get that going.

32:07.080 --> 32:11.100
So yeah, there's several that came in, but it was interesting to see people using different

32:11.100 --> 32:14.960
tricks to convert them to podcasts.

32:14.960 --> 32:15.960
I don't know, Alex.

32:15.960 --> 32:18.440
It's not my jam, I got to be honest with you.

32:18.440 --> 32:22.400
Something like Booksonic or an audio book dedicated app still kind of seems to be more

32:22.400 --> 32:23.400
my speed.

32:23.400 --> 32:29.160
That's the beauty of this kind of stuff, though, in the self-hosted world is that there's not

32:29.160 --> 32:32.520
really ever a right or a wrong answer to this kind of stuff.

32:32.520 --> 32:33.520
True.

32:33.520 --> 32:37.280
Once you have your data, once you control your data, you can serve it up to yourself

32:37.280 --> 32:39.280
however, wherever you like.

32:39.280 --> 32:41.260
And that's one of the advantages of it.

32:41.260 --> 32:48.640
So Luck wrote in, and this is a tip that goes back to our discussion last episode, where

32:48.640 --> 32:50.760
we were experimenting with a Google Photos replacement.

32:50.760 --> 32:53.520
I don't know, do you still have that going?

32:53.520 --> 32:57.480
I probably do, but I haven't opened it in two weeks.

32:57.480 --> 32:58.480
Yeah.

32:58.480 --> 33:03.200
Well, one of the things we were talking about was what would be the best way to get the

33:03.200 --> 33:09.400
photos off your phone and into a directory where this tool could index and do all of

33:09.400 --> 33:11.480
the object recognition.

33:11.480 --> 33:14.800
And Luck wrote in to say, check out Photosync.

33:14.800 --> 33:17.480
It's photosync-app.com.

33:17.480 --> 33:24.720
It's available for iOS and Android, and it supports tons of ways to transfer from like

33:24.720 --> 33:30.740
all of the typical cloud services, but it also supports S3 uploads, NFS uploads, web

33:30.740 --> 33:33.400
dev uploads, Samba, et cetera.

33:33.400 --> 33:37.360
And we've got a couple of people that are trying to do their uploads to S3 and then

33:37.360 --> 33:41.760
having that app, which I'm drawing a blank on the name of it, analyze the photos.

33:41.760 --> 33:45.720
And so this app supports S3, NFS, web dev, so there's a lot of ways you could get these

33:45.720 --> 33:51.800
up on your home server to then point Photoprism at it, photosync-app.com, if you want to

33:51.800 --> 33:52.800
check that out.

33:52.800 --> 33:59.080
Now our next bit of feedback comes from Draw, D-R-O-R, I'm sorry, I'm going to go with

33:59.080 --> 34:00.080
Draw.

34:00.080 --> 34:03.240
You said that about your podcast a couple of weeks ago, and I'm on a marathon catching

34:03.240 --> 34:05.100
up with the previous episodes.

34:05.100 --> 34:06.440
So far, I'm enjoying it.

34:06.440 --> 34:07.760
Many thanks for all the tips.

34:07.760 --> 34:09.020
Thank you very much.

34:09.020 --> 34:14.640
Now I'm stuck in a wanting mode where I pretty much know my needs, but I'm failing to actually

34:14.640 --> 34:15.640
make purchases.

34:15.640 --> 34:17.460
We've all been there.

34:17.460 --> 34:19.800
You're in the research phase, Draw.

34:19.800 --> 34:22.240
Too much choice is paralyzing you.

34:22.240 --> 34:24.240
Yes, definitely been there.

34:24.240 --> 34:28.960
So storage backups NAS wise, I'd like to start with decent storage for my media, but I'm

34:28.960 --> 34:31.600
far from being a hardware and network guy.

34:31.600 --> 34:36.200
Where would you recommend to start without diving too deep into learning all this stuff?

34:36.200 --> 34:41.300
Would a couple of my book, Western Digital Hard Drives, work and what would I connect

34:41.300 --> 34:42.640
them to?

34:42.640 --> 34:46.040
Regardless, maybe you might discuss it later.

34:46.040 --> 34:50.640
But what about Mycroft as well as a self-hosted Google Home replacement?

34:50.640 --> 34:56.640
So this is a great email because this is maybe the candidate we were just talking about for

34:56.640 --> 34:59.600
the Helio 64 versus something like a Synology or QNAP.

34:59.600 --> 35:01.040
Yeah, I think so.

35:01.040 --> 35:06.680
And you know, to get started, a Raspberry Pi with a couple of USB hard drives connected

35:06.680 --> 35:07.960
will do just fine.

35:07.960 --> 35:10.360
Yeah, you know, don't be shy when you write in.

35:10.360 --> 35:15.640
Let us know what your budget is and let us know what your comfort level is, like your

35:15.640 --> 35:19.360
DIY comfort level, your budget and your DIY comfort level.

35:19.360 --> 35:23.400
Because Alex and I are totally happy making recommendations anywhere on the spectrum.

35:23.400 --> 35:27.560
So you could go with Raspberry Pis, like Alex was saying, and hook up a couple of USB disks

35:27.560 --> 35:32.680
and you'd really be off to the races as long as you're comfortable configuring Samba or

35:32.680 --> 35:36.480
something like that, or maybe even going something with like Cockpit.

35:36.480 --> 35:40.920
And what I would say as well is that over the last several years over at linuxserver.io,

35:40.920 --> 35:44.560
I've been writing the Perfect Media Server series.

35:44.560 --> 35:52.320
Go and take a look at that because in that series, I cover Docker, MergerFS, which is

35:52.320 --> 35:58.200
an awesome bit of software, with SnapRaid as well for drive parity to protect you from

35:58.200 --> 36:01.320
drive failures a little bit, that kind of stuff.

36:01.320 --> 36:05.920
And I talk about the overall kind of decisions you've got to make.

36:05.920 --> 36:10.520
And hopefully, when you start looking against your requirements versus what some of this

36:10.520 --> 36:15.840
software can do, you'll start to narrow down your field of decisions a little bit and it

36:15.840 --> 36:18.040
should make things a bit easier for you.

36:18.040 --> 36:19.320
I don't cover hardware.

36:19.320 --> 36:22.520
There's plenty of other good pieces of journalism about that.

36:22.520 --> 36:30.440
So Brian Moses writes a really good blog every year, I think, on the perfect NAS build.

36:30.440 --> 36:34.840
Of course, there's serverbuilds.net as well, which is always a great resource.

36:34.840 --> 36:39.200
But yeah, I mean, just feel free to let us know what your budget is or drop into the

36:39.200 --> 36:40.200
Discord.

36:40.200 --> 36:41.200
We have a hardware channel.

36:41.200 --> 36:42.200
I'll add to that.

36:42.200 --> 36:43.200
And you were touching on it there, Alex.

36:43.200 --> 36:47.720
I think what he needs to do is figure out what his primary app or use case is and then

36:47.720 --> 36:48.720
build for that.

36:48.720 --> 36:50.440
I think maybe that's what he's lacking.

36:50.440 --> 36:57.000
Because he may also be a good QNAP or Synology candidate and where he wants to, instead of

36:57.000 --> 37:02.540
struggle with the networking and OS aspect of it, he'd rather learn at the application

37:02.540 --> 37:06.840
level where he could deploy the applications using a UI that they provide and learn the

37:06.840 --> 37:07.840
applications.

37:07.840 --> 37:12.580
And then maybe from there, get a passion, get rolling, get enthusiastic about this stuff,

37:12.580 --> 37:14.760
and then go more towards the DIY route.

37:14.760 --> 37:20.360
I think that is really common for people is they have an application or a use they build

37:20.360 --> 37:21.360
for that.

37:21.360 --> 37:24.200
They kind of take the easiest route possible that is sustainable for them.

37:24.200 --> 37:27.160
And then when they go hardcore, they just start going even deeper.

37:27.160 --> 37:28.440
And that may be what happens to you.

37:28.440 --> 37:33.200
So consider maybe one of those Synology or QNAPs, like we were talking about earlier,

37:33.200 --> 37:36.120
that will make it a lot easier to just get going with the applications, but still give

37:36.120 --> 37:38.800
you a good, solid base to run everything from.

37:38.800 --> 37:45.000
A really expensive requirement to ask yourself about is, do I need to transcode?

37:45.000 --> 37:51.160
So with Plex, if you want to watch stuff on your phone or on your TV or anywhere really,

37:51.160 --> 37:54.420
it will go ahead and transcode on the fly.

37:54.420 --> 37:59.360
So it will convert the video that you have to whatever format the device you're watching

37:59.360 --> 38:01.680
it on can play back.

38:01.680 --> 38:03.160
It will also reduce the quality.

38:03.160 --> 38:09.160
So it will take a 1080p quality file, for example, and convert it all the way down to DVD quality

38:09.160 --> 38:12.760
or something like that, if you're on limited bandwidth.

38:12.760 --> 38:17.760
But that requires some very specific hardware choices around CPUs or GPUs and that kind

38:17.760 --> 38:18.760
of stuff.

38:18.760 --> 38:23.360
So I mentioned API earlier, but that wouldn't be the best choice if you want to transcode,

38:23.360 --> 38:24.360
for example.

38:24.360 --> 38:28.360
So lots of options, but it depends, like Chris says, on what you want to do.

38:28.360 --> 38:32.760
And our last one today, although we did get some other emails in, so we will cue those,

38:32.760 --> 38:36.640
but also do please keep sending those in at selfhosted.show slash contact.

38:36.640 --> 38:37.640
We have a form there.

38:37.640 --> 38:40.220
You fill it in, and it lands in our inbox.

38:40.220 --> 38:44.760
And Russell writes in with our last one, and it's a bit of a workaround for you OpenHAB

38:44.760 --> 38:45.760
users out there.

38:45.760 --> 38:50.560
Alex and I are obviously deep into Home Assistant, so we don't have a lot of OpenHAB experience,

38:50.560 --> 38:52.240
but we do like getting tips.

38:52.240 --> 38:56.600
And Russell writes in and says, to my knowledge, OpenHAB doesn't have anything built into it

38:56.600 --> 38:59.500
that detects dawn, dusk, sunrise, sunset, et cetera.

38:59.500 --> 39:03.200
So I wanted to set something up myself, and I turned to Python.

39:03.200 --> 39:08.280
But every library I found that used calculation-based time had an issue where, after a year or so,

39:08.280 --> 39:13.320
the sunrise and sunset times would be wildly incorrect.

39:13.320 --> 39:16.720
He goes on to say there's a couple other libraries that were just very out of date.

39:16.720 --> 39:23.680
So to make it work, I got myself a free API subscription to ipgeolocation.io.

39:23.680 --> 39:30.360
The free developer subscription allows for 30,000 requests per month with 1,000 per day,

39:30.360 --> 39:35.440
which is way more than the two calls I use, one to get the sunrise, sunset times, and

39:35.440 --> 39:37.800
another to get UTC offset.

39:37.800 --> 39:42.320
That's how you can also handle daylight savings, which, nice catch, Russell.

39:42.320 --> 39:46.400
He goes on to say I use a cron job to call the Python script, which retrieves the times

39:46.400 --> 39:51.200
every day and then runs an at command to schedule the sunrise, sunset triggers.

39:51.200 --> 39:52.400
It works really well.

39:52.400 --> 39:54.280
And the documentation is easy to understand.

39:54.280 --> 39:58.360
I highly recommend it for anyone looking for sunrise or sunset solutions.

39:58.360 --> 40:01.160
He needs a good way to share that script, though, because I think people could take

40:01.160 --> 40:02.160
advantage of that.

40:02.160 --> 40:03.840
Cheers, he says.

40:03.840 --> 40:06.240
Well, good work around there.

40:06.240 --> 40:09.120
OpenHAB might not have it built in, but he came up with a way to make it work.

40:09.120 --> 40:13.600
And that's all it really takes.

40:13.600 --> 40:15.240
My tip of the hat to you there, Russell.

40:15.240 --> 40:16.240
All right.

40:16.240 --> 40:20.640
So coming up on December 13 is the Home Assistant Conference.

40:20.640 --> 40:26.160
It's to attend will be $1, which they're going to use to cover the cost of the platform.

40:26.160 --> 40:30.000
Obviously it's a virtual conference for obvious reasons.

40:30.000 --> 40:36.000
So it's Sunday, December the 13th, and that is at 10 p.m. Pacific Standard Time, which

40:36.000 --> 40:38.400
I think is 7 p.m. Central European Time.

40:38.400 --> 40:43.280
So hopefully with it being on a Sunday, that should fit most people's schedules.

40:43.280 --> 40:44.280
Interesting.

40:44.280 --> 40:46.320
I, of course, signed up.

40:46.320 --> 40:47.520
I got my ticket.

40:47.520 --> 40:48.520
I'm all in.

40:48.520 --> 40:49.520
I'm going to go.

40:49.520 --> 40:52.600
And they will have it just on YouTube as well, I think, from reading their website.

40:52.600 --> 40:55.280
You don't have to sign up.

40:55.280 --> 40:57.140
And I'm going to keep my eye on the conference.

40:57.140 --> 41:00.000
And if there's some really great audio, I may grab some clips.

41:00.000 --> 41:01.000
You know, I may.

41:01.000 --> 41:02.000
It could happen.

41:02.000 --> 41:06.000
I'm particularly looking forward to just seeing how different people work with Home Assistant.

41:06.000 --> 41:11.480
You know, there's a couple of sessions around improving YAML workflows.

41:11.480 --> 41:14.340
There's one here which might be interesting for you.

41:14.340 --> 41:18.300
On the main stage, managing an off-grid vehicle with Home Assistant.

41:18.300 --> 41:19.300
Stop it.

41:19.300 --> 41:20.300
Are you serious?

41:20.300 --> 41:21.300
Uh-huh.

41:21.300 --> 41:22.300
Somebody's doing my bit?

41:22.300 --> 41:23.300
No.

41:23.300 --> 41:24.300
That's great.

41:24.300 --> 41:26.760
I should like pick them for all the knowledge they have.

41:26.760 --> 41:27.960
I did not see that.

41:27.960 --> 41:33.120
As well as reverse engineering a 433 hertz megahertz RF protocol.

41:33.120 --> 41:34.560
I did see that one.

41:34.560 --> 41:38.000
That could be useful for, you know, hacking some of the little remote controls you have

41:38.000 --> 41:40.640
for like garage door openers and that kind of thing.

41:40.640 --> 41:44.920
Well, I want to thank a Cloud Guru for sponsoring this episode of Self-Hosted.

41:44.920 --> 41:46.920
And they do have their Black Friday sale going.

41:46.920 --> 41:48.640
We'll have a link in the show notes.

41:48.640 --> 41:52.640
We know the cloud is growing, and so is the demand for skilled cloud professionals.

41:52.640 --> 41:57.240
82% of hiring managers say cloud certifications make a candidate more attractive.

41:57.240 --> 42:02.540
Well, ACG's Black Friday sale is your last chance for low prices this year.

42:02.540 --> 42:07.060
Keep up with change and develop the skills you need with a Cloud Guru.

42:07.060 --> 42:10.600
Developing cloud fluency can be hard, and it's even harder to keep up.

42:10.600 --> 42:16.000
So they make it easy by providing an engaging way to learn, retain, and stay competitive.

42:16.000 --> 42:20.360
Get the best price possible by using our Black Friday link in the show notes.

42:20.360 --> 42:23.860
You can get that at selfhosted.show slash 33.

42:23.860 --> 42:27.640
And thanks to a Cloud Guru for sponsoring this episode of Self-Hosted.

42:27.640 --> 42:31.320
You know, speaking of Black Fridays, Alex, I'm going to do a Black Friday sale for the

42:31.320 --> 42:35.620
Self-Hosted SREs for probably a couple of weeks.

42:35.620 --> 42:39.960
So if you want to support the show and get a limited ad feed and get the extra content,

42:39.960 --> 42:46.520
the post-show, go to self-hosted.show slash SRE and then use the coupon code blackfriday.

42:46.520 --> 42:53.840
And it'll work for as long as I leave it active, and that'll take $2 off, which is like basically

42:53.840 --> 42:59.240
nothing for this show because since it's only twice a month, we have a lower membership

42:59.240 --> 43:00.280
fee already.

43:00.280 --> 43:02.680
So that's a ridiculously good deal.

43:02.680 --> 43:08.360
Crazy Chris is blowing off the doors with these crazy prices, but you know, I never

43:08.360 --> 43:12.080
really have had an opportunity in the past to do a Black Friday sale because I never

43:12.080 --> 43:17.160
really had anything to Black Friday sale, so I thought it'd be fun.

43:17.160 --> 43:20.680
So yeah, if you want to support the show and get a great deal, go to self-hosted.show slash

43:20.680 --> 43:25.160
SRE and then use that coupon code blackfriday and you'll get that deal.

43:25.160 --> 43:27.720
Maybe by next Black Friday, we'll be able to have a merch sale.

43:27.720 --> 43:28.720
Wink, wink.

43:28.720 --> 43:29.720
I know, right?

43:29.720 --> 43:30.720
You know what?

43:30.720 --> 43:33.640
I just was looking at badges this morning.

43:33.640 --> 43:36.320
Self-Hosted badge would be pretty cool.

43:36.320 --> 43:40.140
So as usual, you can go to self-hosted.show slash contact to find more ways to get in

43:40.140 --> 43:41.380
touch with us.

43:41.380 --> 43:43.720
And you can find me on Twitter at ironic badger.

43:43.720 --> 43:48.880
Yeah, I'm there too at Chris LAS and the show is at self-hosted show.

43:48.880 --> 43:51.280
Don't forget the network is at Jupiter signal.

43:51.280 --> 43:52.280
Thanks for listening.

43:52.280 --> 44:07.560
And that was self-hosted.show slash 33.
