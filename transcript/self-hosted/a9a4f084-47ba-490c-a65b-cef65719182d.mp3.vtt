WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.040
you probably didn't see the uh teaser for the stream today it's actually a lady badger

00:05.040 --> 00:11.840
it's hard to tell but it's a lady badger it's a lady badger it looks like a medieval lady badger

00:11.840 --> 00:16.880
yeah i think so but she's she's still a big self-hosted fan or is she renaissance it's hard

00:16.880 --> 00:20.800
to tell maybe we should ask her she could be larping i don't know that could be a thing where

00:20.800 --> 00:26.800
did that come from i made it i just decided i was looking for badger people and that's what came up

00:26.800 --> 00:36.000
so you made it nms paint did you yeah basically paint.net well here we are it's episode 75 there's

00:36.000 --> 00:42.080
a lot to get to today alex is about to jump on an airplane and our buddy brent is inbound we're

00:42.080 --> 00:48.400
sitting down in the middle of a thunderstorm over at alex's house real life update brent is supposed

00:48.400 --> 00:55.840
to be departing toronto literally right now as i'm talking to you as we're recording and his flight

00:55.840 --> 01:01.760
inbound from calgary landed about 10 minutes ago so i don't think that's happening i think

01:01.760 --> 01:07.440
i think brent will be here tomorrow morning and more most likely okay and when do you fly out

01:07.440 --> 01:11.840
tomorrow night yeah you have you might be two ships passing each other in the night on the

01:11.840 --> 01:18.080
yeah it's unfortunate uh it is unfortunate well we'll get into it but i wanted to start today

01:18.080 --> 01:23.840
by discussing something that i don't know if we have it on record but i know at least off record

01:23.840 --> 01:29.280
you you called this one alex this week nebuchadza announced the works with home assistant program

01:29.280 --> 01:34.400
they write today we're introducing the works with home assistant program to allow manufacturers to

01:34.400 --> 01:39.760
show their support and commitment to home assistant and its community and like you would expect with

01:39.760 --> 01:44.800
a program like this alex they got like little badges that says works locally with home assistant

01:44.800 --> 01:49.200
works via the cloud with home assistant works with z wave you know the kind of the kind of

01:49.200 --> 01:54.560
works with it's an interesting program i don't want to foreshadow anything about my other

01:54.560 --> 02:01.760
predictions this year but uh nailed it i called that one yeah he did it's nice it's nice to finally

02:01.760 --> 02:07.760
get the w bro yeah it is nice to see this in fact it's kind of perfect because i just recently had

02:07.760 --> 02:15.200
a good reminder of how how crappy the experience is right now and i have to say i'm a bit disappointed

02:15.200 --> 02:21.200
that they didn't announce a hardware partner at launch but they did say uh they're gonna have

02:22.000 --> 02:26.320
their first hardware partner announced soon but you know just recently i was kind of doing like

02:26.320 --> 02:32.080
a virtual rebuild of my home assistant setup like let's say in theory my home assistant yellow or

02:32.080 --> 02:39.440
whatever it's called now shows up and i rebuild my home setup and i thought maybe that'd be a good

02:39.440 --> 02:45.520
time to just move over to zigbee i know i could just stick with z wave but it seems like zigbee

02:45.520 --> 02:50.320
and matter will eventually be the future so i started researching one-to-one replacements

02:50.320 --> 02:57.120
for my z wave devices like my outdoor switches sprinkler controllers uh motion sensors power

02:57.120 --> 03:02.800
smart plugs that also have real-time power data monitoring i tried to find solid zigbee alternatives

03:02.800 --> 03:10.800
to those and getting any kind of signal out of the noise if one device over another is compatible

03:10.800 --> 03:17.280
with home assistant is a really bad experience and at best you're kind of just taking a stab

03:17.280 --> 03:23.040
like you really can't order anything with absolute confidence that it'll work in home assistant and i

03:23.040 --> 03:26.640
do i will say over the last couple years it's gotten better like more and more stuff i just

03:26.640 --> 03:33.600
buy works with home assistant locally but it's still almost impossible and i i would i would argue

03:33.600 --> 03:40.560
in navigatable for a brand new user to this space presently so if this takes off this would make it

03:40.560 --> 03:45.440
massively easier because i would just filter by this on amazon or wherever i'm shopping it is a

03:45.440 --> 03:51.680
crapshoot absolutely and you know the the only way to know for sure something's going to work is to

03:51.680 --> 03:57.040
buy it and try it and even then that's not a guarantee it's going to continue working for

03:57.040 --> 04:02.560
the longest time i refer you to my comments about the govi led strips i bought in the last episode

04:02.560 --> 04:08.320
you know even though that was relying on a third-party api provided by govi it worked one

04:08.320 --> 04:15.040
day via a custom integration and then govi decided to rate limit the api so even then it's not a

04:15.040 --> 04:21.840
perfect guarantee so i'm delighted to see this program come into existence i think it's a signal

04:21.840 --> 04:27.840
that the project has ambition in a certain direction you know if you think about all the

04:27.840 --> 04:33.280
other made for programs i think made for iphone was probably one of if not the first kind of

04:33.280 --> 04:41.120
certification sort of like this in our industry it guarantees companies some kind of interface

04:41.120 --> 04:46.560
to develop against so you look at the iphone as the perfect example right they had that 30 pin

04:46.560 --> 04:51.760
dot connector for a decade now we've had the lightning connector for i think a decade and

04:51.760 --> 04:59.600
we're probably due usbc on the iphone any day now uh we can hope anyway and so when i look at this

04:59.600 --> 05:07.680
announcement i think wow geez okay cool so if i'm you know making the cheapest possible thing i can

05:07.680 --> 05:14.080
and i don't want to pay any license fees or minimal license fees to get a little cute label

05:14.080 --> 05:19.920
on the box to put it on the shelf in home depot or wherever it is uh around the world that little

05:19.920 --> 05:24.240
blue home assistant logo looks pretty good right i mean if you can put the alexa one on there and

05:24.240 --> 05:28.960
the google one on there why not slap home assistant on there yeah and here's a couple of things about

05:28.960 --> 05:33.920
the program that i like uh the program requires manufacturers to maintain the integration of their

05:33.920 --> 05:39.440
products in home assistant they have to provide product samples and give engineering contacts for

05:39.440 --> 05:44.880
the home assistant team to escalate to huge manufacturers will be able to use the works

05:44.880 --> 05:49.920
with home assistant badge in return on their products and documentation and the terms of the

05:49.920 --> 05:55.440
works with home assistant program are enforced in agreement signed by both nebu casa and the

05:55.440 --> 06:00.320
manufacturer so it's not just like they're handing these labels out and so i think when i see one of

06:00.320 --> 06:04.880
these labels as a consumer i'm going to be able to trust that it actually does work and i'm not

06:04.880 --> 06:13.920
joking like i would just filter on this and only buy these products it really lives and dies in the

06:13.920 --> 06:19.520
manufacturer adoption but what happens in a situation like we had and i'm not saying it will

06:19.520 --> 06:25.920
happen soon but like just happened with the z wave stuff your migration that you've been moaning about

06:25.920 --> 06:34.160
on air for ages and ages what happens in 10 years time when home assistant needs to deprecate a

06:34.160 --> 06:39.600
certain interface right and i i don't know what it is i'm not even going to speculate let's say the

06:39.600 --> 06:45.120
replacement for matter has come along and it it deprecates support for all previous matter devices

06:45.120 --> 06:51.200
for whatever reason i'm just making this up but it had that made for home assistant logo on the

06:51.200 --> 07:00.160
box what are the terms of this relationship is it a made for a specific year of home assistant

07:00.160 --> 07:06.800
releases is it made for 10 years like what's the contract here i would like to know and if if the

07:06.800 --> 07:11.840
home assistant team are listening please tweet at me or let me know something like that because

07:11.840 --> 07:17.120
it's important for us to know these details as as nerds i'm excited to hear who their first

07:17.120 --> 07:21.520
partner is and i would love to hear more details i think you're asking some good questions there

07:21.520 --> 07:26.160
and maybe time will tell when you said when you called this i want to say it was like back in

07:26.160 --> 07:30.800
december when you said something like this should come this year it immediately clicked like yes

07:30.800 --> 07:35.360
this is exactly what they need and this makes the experience so much better and then you combine

07:35.360 --> 07:41.200
a program like this with something like the home assistant yellow or or you know a future iteration

07:41.200 --> 07:46.720
when the supply chain isn't all screwed up a out of the box ready to go you drop it on your land

07:46.720 --> 07:52.240
and then you just go buy the works with home assistant labeled devices and everything's just

07:52.240 --> 07:58.400
out of the box good to go from home assistant from nebu casa you know it's a huge potential

07:58.400 --> 08:03.200
revenue stream that i don't know if they're interested in i think they should be if they

08:03.200 --> 08:08.320
want to help keep the business growing and you know make it a better overall product

08:08.880 --> 08:13.840
i think we've seen over the years in this technological space that the only real way

08:13.840 --> 08:21.120
to have a cohesive user experience and i'm talking like apple level of integration here

08:22.080 --> 08:28.080
is not convergence and we saw that with the ubuntu phone years ago and you know everything

08:28.080 --> 08:34.800
they did with the unity desktop back in that era the only way to have a cohesive user experience

08:34.800 --> 08:41.840
is to control everything unfortunately it's it's true i think and that means from all the way up

08:41.840 --> 08:46.560
from the home assistant yellow all the way up to the light bulb i screw into my light fixture

08:47.360 --> 08:54.080
and everything in between if they can offer a cohesive suite of hardware and software and have

08:54.080 --> 08:59.680
it all guaranteed to work together no matter what you know air quotes whatever that means

09:00.720 --> 09:08.560
then home assistant starts to become a viable recommend for people like me to slightly less

09:08.560 --> 09:14.240
slightly less technical members of my family like yeah yeah because right now you know it's

09:14.880 --> 09:21.440
it's the bastion of people that like to tinker as much as home assistant has improved extra ui

09:21.440 --> 09:26.880
elements and wizards and blah blah blah i mean i rarely drop to the yaml these days like i used to

09:27.840 --> 09:33.280
but it's not perfect and if something goes wrong within 10 minutes it's still in the domain where

09:33.280 --> 09:37.760
you need to set it up for your non-technical friends and family you could bring them a box

09:37.760 --> 09:40.960
and give it to them and show them the web ui but you've already set up the dashboard you've

09:40.960 --> 09:44.160
already integrated all the devices you've already done all the network provisioning

09:44.160 --> 09:49.920
you've managed all of that and this helps transition it into a different phase and

09:49.920 --> 09:55.760
just my last thoughts on this and i hope this is a benefit that we continue to see just as

09:55.760 --> 10:02.400
home assistant as a community grows but it means we have someone out there advocating

10:02.400 --> 10:09.120
for local api and local controls but to that point and this is raised in the discord as we record

10:10.080 --> 10:17.280
it's a bit of a slippery slope and i am worried that works with home assistant

10:19.040 --> 10:27.440
if you give it enough time becomes doesn't work with other open standard maybe i guess it depends

10:27.440 --> 10:32.240
on how the standard works because everything about home assistant would probably be open source in

10:32.240 --> 10:37.840
this regard right i mean we'll see i'm not saying they're going to pull an mb but who knows you know

10:37.840 --> 10:43.920
and the other thing is what about the testing that's done are they as an open source project

10:43.920 --> 10:49.200
going to publish all the testing of their hardware vendors i can't imagine many hardware vendors

10:49.200 --> 10:54.720
wanting to sign up to that but as an open source project do they not have a duty to do that i don't

10:54.720 --> 10:58.720
to do that i don't know i'm just asking the question questions that we will probably get

10:58.720 --> 11:04.240
answers to over time but may not like them all we got a message into the show via the jupiter

11:04.240 --> 11:08.960
broadcasting telegram group and it was just a simple question hey do you guys use a self-hosted

11:08.960 --> 11:14.480
to-do app and it's funny because this is exactly something i've been looking to host in my rv right

11:14.480 --> 11:20.880
now something i could really focus just on road trips and stuff like that and i came across i'm

11:20.880 --> 11:30.560
going to attempt to say it's the kunja v i k u n j a it's a self-hostable really good looking to-do

11:30.560 --> 11:38.480
app and it has a little bit of everything that i like from inboxes for different tasks it has

11:39.040 --> 11:44.080
namespace and user sharing so you can collect different projects together and then share them

11:44.080 --> 11:50.080
with somebody like you know a spouse or a family member or a friend it has team support and of

11:50.080 --> 11:55.840
course it also offers a hosted version which you could just pay for if you'd like they include a

11:55.840 --> 12:00.800
how to use it in docker guide so that's probably the route i would take if i were to deploy this

12:00.800 --> 12:05.680
i haven't yet but i'd love to get any feedback from anyone out there in the audience that's

12:05.680 --> 12:11.040
either use this or another self-hosted to-do app this to me seems like the one to beat you can find

12:11.040 --> 12:19.200
it at v i k u n j a dot cloud and yep it's got kanban boards alex i know how you like your kanban

12:19.200 --> 12:27.760
me oh it just gives me the heebie-jeebies of like trello and jira yep yep yep did you ever really

12:27.760 --> 12:32.160
stop and think about self-hosting your to-do stuff i gotta be honest with you i think i

12:32.160 --> 12:37.200
just fell into using apps on my phone which are connected to proprietary services i thought about

12:37.200 --> 12:43.120
it quite a lot actually when i was deep into my sort of emacs kick which lasted about three or

12:43.120 --> 12:49.440
four months and i was doing all the org rome stuff which came out of rome research line of thinking

12:49.440 --> 12:55.200
the what's it called second brain linking your thinking type stuff i was sort of going down this

12:55.200 --> 13:00.480
whole productivity rabbit hole and realized i was spending way longer trying to be productive than

13:00.480 --> 13:07.600
actually being productive so i looked at a few things built into emacs org mode primarily being

13:07.600 --> 13:13.680
the one i looked at but mobile experience the mobile experience matters a lot because that's

13:13.680 --> 13:19.280
where you know 90 of my random thoughts occur to me is oh i need to remember to change the filters

13:19.280 --> 13:24.960
on the ac unit or i don't know remember to pick up this from the shop on the way home or something

13:24.960 --> 13:31.600
like that and i ended up falling into the camp of just using todoist which is not a self-hosted

13:31.600 --> 13:36.720
app unfortunately but for me it's worked very very well it's got some integrations with gmail

13:36.720 --> 13:40.800
which i use all the time at work so there's a bunch of stuff i have to do in my day job

13:40.800 --> 13:45.040
where i need to remember certain case numbers and add comments and all that kind of stuff

13:45.760 --> 13:50.000
and i can just click a button in gmail and it adds it straight into todoist and i can

13:50.000 --> 13:53.280
you know keyboard shortcuts and natural text input and all that kind of stuff

13:54.000 --> 13:59.760
that's not really what you wanted to hear but i really like todoist i understand todoist and

13:59.760 --> 14:04.400
its many integrations and its api are really really handy and i think that's the hosted

14:04.400 --> 14:11.200
service to beat vikinja or however you say it what i was really impressed by is they maintain a

14:11.200 --> 14:16.400
really clean user interface where you could just bang out tasks super quick but they also let you

14:16.400 --> 14:21.920
really dig in and set all kinds of different bits of detail you can add relation you can add

14:21.920 --> 14:27.440
attachments you can do progress tasks you can just do percentage updates you can have repeating

14:27.440 --> 14:33.760
intervals priorities labels you can subscribe to certain tasks even if you're not the user if you

14:33.760 --> 14:40.080
just want to get updates on it i mean it's got it's got like all the power features i love i think

14:40.080 --> 14:44.320
it's going to come down to what it's like to maintain and run it so i'm tempted to give it a

14:44.320 --> 14:48.240
go but i'll wait a week or two and get like input from the audience to hear what they're using for

14:48.240 --> 14:53.120
self-hosted to do apps or maybe i should just not give it a go maybe you've got experience

14:53.120 --> 15:00.560
out there that says otherwise and i should just give in like alex and use todoist leno.com slash

15:00.560 --> 15:06.000
ssh go there to get one hundred dollars and 60 day credit on a new account and you go there to

15:06.000 --> 15:12.480
support the show linode is the best way to run an application on linux in the cloud it's how

15:12.480 --> 15:17.680
we run everything we've built for the last two and a half years or so it's really really fast

15:17.680 --> 15:22.400
they have great performance they have 11 data centers around the world mvme pcie storage they've

15:22.400 --> 15:28.320
got amd epic processors and their cpu rigs 40 gigabit connections coming into the hypervisors

15:28.320 --> 15:35.120
and they are their own isp so that's like all the things you need to just have fantastic performance

15:35.680 --> 15:40.160
and on top of that they have the best support that's where they really try to differentiate

15:40.160 --> 15:43.760
from the hyperscalers they're going to lock into their crazy platforms they really try to

15:43.760 --> 15:50.080
differentiate with the customer service and the community support i'll say that they've been a

15:50.080 --> 15:54.560
big supporter of jupiter broadcasting and they're making it possible for us to go down and get a

15:54.560 --> 16:01.200
tour of jpl and do a bunch of west coast meetups they invest in the community because they know

16:01.200 --> 16:07.440
it returns a net benefit to them because linux is what they run on everything go build something go

16:07.440 --> 16:12.640
learn something try linode out go get that hundred dollars and try out their s3 compatible object

16:12.640 --> 16:18.160
storage maybe you want to play around with their vlan configurator their powerful dns manager

16:18.160 --> 16:23.440
or perhaps you just want to try something maybe you want to performance test your network maybe

16:23.440 --> 16:27.520
you want to deploy their new kali linux support and do a little penetration testing to make sure

16:27.520 --> 16:32.640
everything's buttoned up you can do it 30 to 50 percent cheaper than you can at the hyperscalers

16:32.640 --> 16:37.600
and you can support the show so go try out the best in virtualized cloud computing if it runs

16:37.600 --> 16:44.960
on linux it runs on linode sign up today and support the show linode.com slash ssh that's

16:44.960 --> 16:54.880
linode.com slash ssh to get that 100 and support the show linode.com slash ssh we've got a live

16:54.880 --> 17:01.920
brent update for you his departure flight from toronto is delayed by 10 minutes so i don't know

17:01.920 --> 17:07.680
i don't know if he's off his original plane yet or through customs or or anything but it's seat

17:07.680 --> 17:12.560
of the pants stuff i think it's going to be a full-on run running down the airport kind of

17:12.560 --> 17:18.080
movie style moment for brent i think yeah yeah poor guy hopefully things go smoother for you

17:18.080 --> 17:22.960
and the family hopefully so yes uh it's just a direct flight for us tomorrow rally to london

17:22.960 --> 17:28.480
heathrow hopefully the baggage handlers are on point tomorrow i did buy a couple of extra air

17:28.480 --> 17:33.920
tags to throw into my suitcases attaboy that's so fun the last time i traveled i did that and

17:33.920 --> 17:37.920
we checked baggage and then you just watch and then as soon as it starts to get close and it

17:37.920 --> 17:41.760
detects it again you know your bag's almost there and then you know you can tell when it comes down

17:41.760 --> 17:48.160
the chute it was luxury checking i am actually i hadn't thought about the baggage reclaim part

17:48.160 --> 17:54.880
i'm actually genuinely excited for that now yeah it's great you know i was going through the uh

17:54.880 --> 17:58.480
inbox and a lot of people have caught that you're going to london obviously because we have the

17:58.480 --> 18:03.920
meetup coming up and all of that and we clearly got people to want updates on your remote backup

18:03.920 --> 18:10.880
setup you have across the pond well it's uh it's all change fairly soon anyway i think largely

18:10.880 --> 18:16.320
speaking the fundamental stuff is going to stay the same but when i emigrated three or four years ago

18:16.320 --> 18:22.080
i left my old server in england along with all the data that was on it and i just left it there

18:22.800 --> 18:27.360
because i arrived in this country you know as a prospector with nothing but a suitcase and a

18:27.360 --> 18:34.560
rucksack don't you know oh my god alex it's true though it literally is true and the container

18:34.560 --> 18:39.440
that had all of my actual stuff in it took like three or four months to come across the ocean so

18:39.440 --> 18:46.320
and now you here you are in a american house in the suburbs with big thunderstorms full of crap

18:49.200 --> 18:54.080
lots of toys yeah you're doing it right you know the general idea was to use that server in england

18:54.080 --> 18:59.840
as my primary endpoint for when i needed to come out at a residential ip address for i player

18:59.840 --> 19:03.600
but also there was about 20 or 30 terabytes worth of hard drives in that system

19:03.600 --> 19:11.760
which i pulled together using zfs i used to do zfs mirrors but i ran out of space and so i ended

19:11.760 --> 19:17.600
up turning it into like a z2 array i think i can't remember the specifics a z2 array of like

19:17.600 --> 19:23.120
five or six different three or four terabyte hard drives maybe they're eights but it doesn't really

19:23.120 --> 19:29.920
matter the idea there is that over wire garden bear in mind this predates tail scale by what

19:29.920 --> 19:37.440
three or four years i had to rely on open vpn originally to get an ssh to get into the the box

19:37.440 --> 19:42.560
in england via open sense i had a site to site vpn between the two so that all the traffic was

19:42.560 --> 19:48.720
encrypted and then encrypted within that tunnel as well over ssh and zfs send i used jim salter's

19:48.720 --> 19:54.640
syncoid and sanoid to do all my snapshots on zfs and then syncoid is what's used to manage those

19:54.640 --> 20:00.320
snapshots and sync them to the remote endpoint but last year when i went back to england i did a

20:00.320 --> 20:04.240
motherboard upgrade on that server and there's a blog post which i'll link to in the show notes

20:04.240 --> 20:09.680
about the motherboard i'm using however shortly after i left england my father informed me that

20:09.680 --> 20:14.960
they were selling the childhood home and moving and where they were moving to which if you've

20:14.960 --> 20:20.560
listened to the show you'll know didn't really have the best of internet connections it's up in

20:20.560 --> 20:28.560
uh it's up in the northeast and of england and the internet there was i think i'm generous in

20:28.560 --> 20:36.880
saying two megabytes down and 0.5 megabytes up oh it's miserable yeah so they have got starlink

20:36.880 --> 20:42.320
and it's a lot better now for stuff like tablets and phones and i player and whatever else they do

20:42.320 --> 20:46.640
for normal people yeah it's way better for that kind of stuff but in terms of running a server

20:46.640 --> 20:51.760
um it's not you know i'm i'm not throwing terabytes through that link anymore because

20:51.760 --> 20:58.160
the you know the the main data set's already over there but if ever i needed to restore that data

20:58.160 --> 21:07.600
you know starlink's probably just not the right way to go then somehow the gods smiled on me and

21:07.600 --> 21:16.240
my mother-in-law who lives in rural norfolk she has had internet that has been awful for us to

21:16.240 --> 21:21.200
for as long as i can possibly remember again it was in that sort of four or five megabyte down

21:21.200 --> 21:28.240
one or two megabyte up region just dsl adsl uh if it got a bit windy the speed dropped you know

21:28.240 --> 21:33.680
because the lines were suspended over such a distance she messaged me a month ago and said

21:33.680 --> 21:39.920
hey good news i'm getting fiber to the property fiber out there i was like fiber to the property

21:39.920 --> 21:46.480
i can't even get that you said yes right you said yes i said yes and so she now has i'm led

21:46.480 --> 21:54.560
to believe a 500 symmetrical megabyte connection so my primary old british server is now going to

21:54.560 --> 21:59.920
move from my father's to my mother-in-law's who i will bribe with something i haven't figured out

21:59.920 --> 22:05.040
what yet a gadget maybe yeah she's already said yes but okay the fiber comes in at the wrong end

22:05.040 --> 22:10.480
of the house from where we had a 4g connection for her before an lte modem on the roof because the

22:10.480 --> 22:16.320
dsl connection was so bad uh and this is a lady that works fully remotely over the internet and

22:16.320 --> 22:22.000
has done for years now uh so the internet's very important to her livelihood this is going to be

22:22.000 --> 22:26.560
huge for her then and so for me i'm going to be drilling holes in walls and running ethernet

22:26.560 --> 22:33.040
through brick walls not just uh american cardboard walls proper walls 18th century cottage walls no

22:33.040 --> 22:39.280
less which are you know three three feet thick type deals honestly that sounds like a pain in the ass

22:39.280 --> 22:44.720
to work on i don't think i'd want that yeah it's gonna be it's gonna be fun so i'll be doing a bit

22:44.720 --> 22:49.280
of work whilst i'm over there running ethernet for her and i think my reward will be to host the

22:49.280 --> 22:56.240
server at her house now since tail scale is now a thing i will be running all of my backups over

22:56.240 --> 23:02.480
tail scale to that particular server and dispensing with open sense on the remote site i don't see the

23:02.480 --> 23:09.680
need anymore tail scale works on my nvidia shield so i can run i player through android tv it also

23:09.680 --> 23:16.160
works on my phone my ipad my laptop so i can come out with a british residential ip address with 500

23:16.160 --> 23:22.400
meg up no problem i just don't really need wire guard anymore it's uh naked wire guard anyway i

23:22.400 --> 23:26.400
mean nano tail scale uses it under the hood yeah when you were talking about how you had a point

23:26.400 --> 23:32.480
to point vpn and your sshing over that and you know it's like that that's funny that's how i did

23:32.480 --> 23:37.520
things for like 20 years but now that sounds like a really old way of doing things it's so nice and

23:37.520 --> 23:41.520
i know tail scale sponsored the show so i don't mean to sound like a shill but they're not currently

23:41.520 --> 23:45.600
sponsored this week so this is this is unpaid this is all true it's just you know it's your opinion

23:45.600 --> 23:50.080
ah they well there you go that's how you know it's true i mean the reason that they sponsored

23:50.080 --> 23:55.680
the show in the past is simply because we found them and we thought this is the way it should have

23:55.680 --> 24:03.440
always been this is the way and the other prong of my backup setup is i have a sinology box living

24:03.440 --> 24:08.240
at my mother's house she only has i think it's fiber to the cabinet is what they call it in

24:08.240 --> 24:12.560
england so they run fiber to a cabinet a few hundred feet away from the house and then it's

24:12.560 --> 24:20.480
copper for the last few hundred feet so she gets about 60 or 70 meg down and maybe 10 or 20 up which

24:20.480 --> 24:24.400
is sufficient for a backup server it's not sufficient for an awful lot of other things but

24:24.400 --> 24:31.520
it'll do and i run that using auto restic which is a wrapper around restic i think i've talked

24:31.520 --> 24:39.520
about this previously but that's the summary auto restic runs over tail scale and it just works i

24:39.520 --> 24:44.640
actually went to check up on it the other day and was pleasantly surprised that it's still working

24:44.640 --> 24:49.360
six months later that's what you want to see man that's what you want to see so that's going to be

24:49.360 --> 24:53.200
quite a bit of work because you're going to have to shut that thing down move it set it back up

24:53.200 --> 24:58.320
you're gonna probably have some networking stuff to configure out over at mom's and i mean you might

24:58.320 --> 25:02.560
want to spin up a home assistant instance for her i don't know i mean i could see you doing that too

25:02.560 --> 25:08.000
i could see this kind of rabbit hole i might take one of these spare raspberry pies i've got in the

25:08.000 --> 25:13.520
drawer behind me as a backup for the mother-in-law's house so that i have another tail scale endpoint

25:13.520 --> 25:19.920
that isn't the server itself inside the LAN so that i can kind of island hop within the LAN

25:19.920 --> 25:26.080
look at you traveling with a raspberry pie mr baller over there that's a good idea though

25:26.080 --> 25:29.520
i'll get to customs and they'll be like anything to declare and i'll be like yeah and a million

25:29.520 --> 25:35.920
dollars worth of raspberry pies in my bag that's kind of funny but it's getting to that but really

25:35.920 --> 25:39.520
uh i think what we should talk about is the fact that you're going to have a meetup while you're

25:39.520 --> 25:45.600
over there that is very exciting and it's really coming together absolutely yes so in order to

25:45.600 --> 25:50.240
accommodate a certain mr joe ressington there were certain requirements that had to be met

25:50.240 --> 25:56.080
and one of them that was non-negotiable was being outdoors i kind of feel the same way as well so i

25:56.080 --> 26:01.200
mean i know i shovel that on joe's shoulders but also it's it's my requirement too everybody can

26:01.200 --> 26:04.480
just feel a little more comfortable this way so we're going to meet underneath the london eye

26:04.480 --> 26:10.320
there's a big square green space between the shell center the london eye and the hungerford bridge

26:10.320 --> 26:16.880
and we're going to meet there on the 5th of august around about six o'clock british summer time

26:17.440 --> 26:21.680
we've got to be very specific about that yeah you got to watch out because the meetup page

26:21.680 --> 26:29.280
is in jb's local time so the meetup page can send you a ride yeah so when it says 11 a.m

26:30.000 --> 26:37.040
ignore that it's 11 a.m chris's time we will be there at six o'clock in the evening british

26:37.040 --> 26:42.880
summer time and uh we'll be there until late i mean officially it says nine o'clock i think you

26:42.880 --> 26:49.200
know three hours or so i do have a flight back here the next morning about eight or nine in the

26:49.200 --> 26:55.680
morning so i probably won't be out getting completely uh completely plastered but i will be

26:55.680 --> 27:01.200
there and i have stickers if that's the final thing that gets you to come to come to the meetup

27:01.200 --> 27:07.360
we have limited edition self-hosted diamond cut stickers that's so cool alex you're going to get

27:07.360 --> 27:12.800
over 100 people i hope so i can tell you right now if you've got 99 people on the meetup and you

27:12.800 --> 27:16.240
can tell the way this meetup page has been trending i've done this enough times to tell you

27:16.240 --> 27:20.240
you're going to get over 100 people well they have to beat the rally lot how many did we get there i

27:20.240 --> 27:23.840
think it was about 100 oh it was a little bit more it might have been closer to 200 in raleigh

27:23.840 --> 27:29.200
i mean it's like the raleigh meetup is a good crew oh i like the way you i like the way you work sir

27:29.200 --> 27:32.320
i think it was a little bit more so they're gonna have to put they're gonna have to try harder i

27:32.320 --> 27:37.920
mean they don't want the americans to beat them right meetup.com slash jupiter broadcasting for

27:37.920 --> 27:44.160
the meetup details i of course am looking forward to hearing how it goes we have created a jb meetup

27:44.160 --> 27:49.280
matrix space as well of course this meetup is also being organized in the self-hosted discord

27:49.280 --> 27:55.040
but in general we have created a jb meetups matrix space on our self-hosted matrix instance

27:55.040 --> 28:00.240
there is a london colony meetup in there and there's now a brand new chat room for a west

28:00.240 --> 28:06.560
coast road trip that we're going on in september jupiter broadcasting has been invited to get a

28:06.560 --> 28:12.800
personal tour of the jet propulsion lab in pasadena by a friend of the show tim canham who

28:12.800 --> 28:18.320
is the operational lead for the mars helicopter that runs linux so it's an amazing opportunity

28:18.320 --> 28:22.880
and linode is helping us get down there they're going to help just like they did last year so

28:22.880 --> 28:27.600
we're going to do a whole series of meetups so that meetup page is going to be more useful than

28:27.600 --> 28:32.560
ever as the summer comes up and of course in that matrix space which will have linked in the show

28:32.560 --> 28:37.440
notes if you want to find out where we're going to be at or if you are a local in the area and you

28:37.440 --> 28:42.400
want to give us a shout out so we know there's someone in that area to meet up with or maybe you

28:42.400 --> 28:49.120
know a great place we could stop in the washington oregon california region join that matrix space

28:49.120 --> 28:53.840
linked in the notes and say hi it's going to be it's going to be a massive road trip i mean we got

28:53.840 --> 29:00.400
a lot august we got the london meetup and then in september we're going to have oregon california

29:00.400 --> 29:08.480
jpl it's it's going to be great alex jpl's down in la right yeah yep just uh pasadena area so

29:08.480 --> 29:13.280
the outskirts wonderful yeah i'll have to figure out how i'm going to do that in the rv but we'll

29:13.280 --> 29:18.800
get it dialed in i i hear that the uh the best way to do it is grand theft auto style you just drive

29:18.800 --> 29:25.200
through the desert real fast and then you steal a jet plane and then you fly right in i think that'll

29:25.200 --> 29:34.160
work alex i think that's gonna work visit humio.com hce to ingest and view all of your logs in one

29:34.160 --> 29:40.320
place humio is a centralized log management and observability platform the company was founded by

29:40.320 --> 29:44.800
developers in denmark in 2016 as an alternative to legacy logging solutions that make it cost

29:44.800 --> 29:50.400
prohibitive to ingest and search data volumes seen today's it infrastructures i have been there these

29:50.400 --> 29:55.440
used to be problems that we spent a lot of effort and money trying to solve but the real beauty of

29:55.440 --> 30:00.960
humio is that it can take logs from any source and make them usable you don't need to constantly

30:00.960 --> 30:06.400
massage the format it doesn't need a schema you just pump them all in there and then you have them

30:06.400 --> 30:11.840
when you need them and of course the dashboard is great the platform is really pretty crazy

30:11.840 --> 30:19.040
humio's index free architecture means you can ingest over a petabyte of data per day and search

30:19.040 --> 30:25.280
that data with sub-second latency and humio is up to 80 cheaper than the competing platforms like

30:25.280 --> 30:30.160
splunk or elastic thanks to its reduced hardware and computational footprint but you know the best

30:30.160 --> 30:35.120
way to get going with humio is the community edition humio community edition so you can

30:35.120 --> 30:40.960
humio community edition is the largest no cost data ingestion offering on the market today

30:40.960 --> 30:47.280
allowing you to ingest up to 16 gigabytes per day with seven day retention not a trial period

30:47.280 --> 30:52.000
you've got it for the long haul this is perfect for self-hosters who just want to ingest their

30:52.000 --> 30:56.880
home logs and get a single view of everything happening in your environment rather than having

30:56.880 --> 31:01.040
to go to all the separate places to look from your logs from every system every app every

31:01.040 --> 31:06.160
component in your home humio gives you the ability to bring it all together and correlate it in one

31:06.160 --> 31:10.320
place for easier troubleshooting i mean just to give you an example you can monitor your power

31:10.320 --> 31:14.720
consumption your download speeds water consumption your router information i mean just basically

31:14.720 --> 31:19.120
anything that you can get stats and home assistant well you could visualize it in humio you can also

31:19.120 --> 31:23.520
help monitor power consumption but you know power consumption that's huge in australia

31:23.520 --> 31:27.680
humio community edition gives one listener full visibility of a solar and power grid

31:27.680 --> 31:32.560
home assistant and no dread all that data into humio he really likes to impress his

31:32.560 --> 31:37.520
neighbors with that his voltage recently dropped from 240 volts to 160 volts so like you know

31:37.520 --> 31:42.320
things like the display on your microwave work but the actual microwave function that doesn't

31:42.320 --> 31:47.600
work he was able to dig through the logs in humio see it on the dashboard and take action to protect

31:47.600 --> 31:51.600
his home computing infrastructure when it's your hobby you want it easy you want it quick and you

31:51.600 --> 31:56.240
want it usable and you don't want it to have to be a job so get started with humio community edition

31:56.240 --> 32:10.240
for free at humio.com slash h c e that's humio.com slash h c e what an opportunity jpl is going to

32:10.240 --> 32:15.760
be so so cool i really hope you can find a way to meet up with chris on the way down if you're on

32:15.760 --> 32:21.520
the west coast i'm going to start looking at flights i think that could be i think could be

32:21.520 --> 32:25.760
worth the flight hey oh yeah that's a special opportunity totally all right you and i can

32:25.760 --> 32:28.640
talk more i just didn't want to bring it up when you're in the middle of traveling but we could

32:28.640 --> 32:35.760
talk more when you get back do i bring the family though oh that's a tricky one you know it's a work

32:35.760 --> 32:39.440
trip quote-unquote so it's a jb work thing i mean i don't know it's up to you though i'd tell you

32:39.440 --> 32:45.360
the mother-in-law who we just referenced is a physicist by trade so i think she'd be down i

32:45.360 --> 32:50.800
think she's in raleigh for september so i think you might have to grease those wheels with the

32:50.800 --> 32:58.480
mother-in-law as well it's already happening oh man so uh laurence writes in hey chris and alex

32:58.480 --> 33:02.800
i love the show and i'm really looking forward to the uk meet up next month this is a broader

33:02.800 --> 33:06.320
self-hosting question but with your combined experience i'm hoping you may be able to point

33:06.320 --> 33:11.440
me in the right direction i'm a solicitor or attorney for those in the u.s looking to change

33:11.440 --> 33:17.280
careers to the cloud and i'm unsure where to begin hey we should have fuzzy mistborn answer this

33:17.280 --> 33:24.080
question eh given that he was on just recently and he's in that trade uh so as is the way a

33:24.080 --> 33:29.520
pie was my gateway drug and it sent me down the rabbit hole on what has become quite the adventure

33:29.520 --> 33:34.400
learning linux i've had offers from a few very expensive training providers purveying various

33:34.400 --> 33:41.680
grades of snake oil and supposedly guaranteed jobs but in keeping with the self-hosting spirit i'd

33:41.680 --> 33:47.840
like to try and do it myself i'm currently following a couple of udemy courses and self-studying to get

33:47.840 --> 33:54.560
the aws cloud practitioner certification along with a couple of others uh and i imagine landing

33:54.560 --> 33:59.760
any entry level role will be quite difficult without any prior experience any sage advice

33:59.760 --> 34:04.560
would be greatly appreciated keep up the good work guys and get well soon chris thanks laurence

34:04.560 --> 34:08.320
well thank you laurence i am feeling much much better now i'd say i'm like 95

34:08.320 --> 34:13.920
percent better this is a great question and it's something that you are not alone in struggling

34:13.920 --> 34:19.600
with because you get to this point where you've got a lot of hands-on um lab time where you've

34:19.600 --> 34:23.760
built things and tried things or maybe you've deployed something in the cloud but you don't

34:23.760 --> 34:29.120
necessarily have work experience and you want to take it to that next step that can be situational

34:29.120 --> 34:35.040
but i will say one area that i looked at when i was hiring is i would ask people if they have

34:35.040 --> 34:41.200
participated in any projects on github because it's just all your commits all your work everything's

34:41.200 --> 34:47.120
documented right there and it can be an example of a work ethic it can be an example of you

34:47.120 --> 34:51.760
participating in community even if it's not necessarily specific to the job you're applying

34:51.760 --> 34:57.920
for i mean my own personal story i was working in retail at the apple store for a while and i

34:57.920 --> 35:03.360
just ended up getting interested in linux in my spare time and then i was lucky enough to be able

35:03.360 --> 35:07.920
to go and do a computer science master's degree for a year and that was kind of a deep dive into

35:07.920 --> 35:14.480
programming and you know databases and all sorts of other really difficult stuff that was honestly

35:14.480 --> 35:20.640
way beyond me and it's way beyond what i do in my day job now my advice would be such as it is

35:20.640 --> 35:27.280
anyway find an area that you find interesting enough to self-study on whether that's infrastructure

35:27.280 --> 35:34.640
whether that's development whether that's testing whatever it might be and just do it you know find

35:34.640 --> 35:38.960
a project that you know solve a real problem and find a project around your house that needs

35:38.960 --> 35:45.840
automating if it's infrastructure for example or you know if it's development find a problem that

35:45.840 --> 35:50.080
nobody else has solved or find a problem that's been solved you think you could solve better and

35:50.080 --> 35:58.480
just just nibble away at it yourself and i'm not a huge believer in certifications per se i i get

35:58.480 --> 36:02.800
free certifications through redhat which is a lucky perk of the job but i've i've only done a

36:02.800 --> 36:08.480
handful and it's because i just don't necessarily think that simply by having those letters next to

36:08.480 --> 36:16.400
my name it means that i actually know an awful lot more than the next person yeah it means that i

36:16.400 --> 36:22.480
learned the answers to that specific test on that day in history five years ago maybe i don't know

36:22.480 --> 36:28.160
it's it's it's useful in some ways because it gets your foot in the door with employers to say yes

36:28.160 --> 36:35.600
i've done xyz but in other ways i'm much more interested in hiring somebody who is able to speak

36:36.480 --> 36:42.000
passionately about a specific area and can demonstrate some open source work so you almost

36:42.000 --> 36:47.040
just i think you almost just hit it there too like i wonder if it isn't a passion thing like he isn't

36:47.040 --> 36:53.440
he isn't tearing into a problem and becoming the most knowledgeable person about that problem in

36:53.440 --> 36:59.200
the world thus discovering a community their problems and providing a solution and then

36:59.200 --> 37:02.960
getting employment through those networking connections instead it almost feels like

37:02.960 --> 37:08.000
lawrence you're the biggest problem you're trying to solve is employment and i get that but getting

37:08.000 --> 37:16.400
a job is not an ends of means itself it it's like just part of it like it the job should be reflective

37:16.400 --> 37:20.960
of what you're really passionate about um and it's a tricky thing because i think i realize you gotta

37:20.960 --> 37:24.720
get a job you gotta get money you gotta get paid but it feels like you kind of put the cart before

37:24.720 --> 37:28.160
the horse like you're kind of trying different stuff you're excited about a lot of it you know

37:28.160 --> 37:32.560
you want to work in this area i see this all the time but you don't have a specialty you don't have

37:32.560 --> 37:37.040
a focus you don't necessarily have a passion and if you do well then that's your obvious answer

37:37.040 --> 37:41.200
and that's what you should probably be going after recommend that you give coder radio a listen as

37:41.200 --> 37:45.840
well mike and chris talk about this kind of stuff all the time i mean it's a bit more small business

37:45.840 --> 37:49.520
focused but sometimes they talk about you know how to get into the industry and that kind of thing

37:49.520 --> 37:54.320
yeah thank you that is it's probably a good tip all right so brad writes in who wants to know about

37:54.320 --> 37:59.360
our thoughts on tap business cards so you know some are tied to websites some are tied to apps

37:59.360 --> 38:04.240
i was curious if this is something you guys have used or consider i want to be more environmentally

38:04.240 --> 38:09.680
conscious and most business cards they just get thrown away i wonder though how much telemetry is

38:09.680 --> 38:15.040
gathered by these card companies and what they'll do with it regards brad have you seen these

38:15.040 --> 38:20.880
digital credit cards there's app versions there's physical versions some of them are nfc based some

38:20.880 --> 38:27.520
of them are something else seems open to abuse yeah but saying that i've had a contactless debit

38:27.520 --> 38:33.440
card in my pocket for five or six years and it's it's only been cloned once theoretically i like

38:33.440 --> 38:40.720
this idea right i prefer not having another piece of paper and if i get if i get a business card

38:40.720 --> 38:45.040
that i actually care about i almost inevitably end up like scanning it with my phone or you know

38:45.040 --> 38:50.800
some contact application but i did do some digging around there is there are projects out there in

38:50.800 --> 38:56.240
fact one that's been going around this week that lets you build your own business card out of your

38:56.240 --> 39:03.440
own parts and then you run linux on the thing and um i guess you could be a little more secure in

39:03.440 --> 39:09.920
that i honestly i don't think this is ever going to take off i really don't and the reason why

39:10.720 --> 39:18.480
and i'm just maybe it's old man chris here but back in my day our palm pilots had little

39:18.480 --> 39:24.240
infrared blasters built into them so you could exchange contact information did you just play

39:24.240 --> 39:30.320
the palm pilot card we have been trying to solve this problem literally since the late 90s

39:30.880 --> 39:36.240
since fax machines were popular to have in the home we have been trying to solve this problem

39:36.240 --> 39:41.920
and we have tried different technologies and nothing has stuck even even as palm pilot friends

39:41.920 --> 39:46.000
you know we were kind of like all right let's let's try this and you'd line it up and it just

39:46.000 --> 39:49.680
never really took off you know what's going to happen in the real world is you're going to make

39:49.680 --> 39:53.600
a connection with someone and then you're going to unlock your phone pass it to them and they're

39:53.600 --> 39:58.160
going to type in their number or send you a text or a telegram or hey what's your discord or your

39:58.160 --> 40:02.640
twitter or whatever that's the reality it feels like that's going to be the reality as long as

40:02.640 --> 40:06.560
we have multiple vendors making multiple operating systems that want to implement their own standards

40:06.560 --> 40:12.480
and don't necessarily have incentive to interoperate with maybe each other right as long as that's

40:12.480 --> 40:16.720
as long as we've got a coke and pepsi of phone manufacturers and coke and pepsi don't want to

40:16.720 --> 40:21.040
share their secret recipe i don't think we're very likely to have universal electronic cards

40:21.040 --> 40:26.640
that actually be adopted it needs to be as easy as like you know you bump watches you tap phones

40:26.640 --> 40:31.040
and it's completely seamless and unless it's that it's never going to take off i thought i saw the

40:31.040 --> 40:36.640
answer at conference a few years ago which was scanning a qr code on a conference's badge but

40:36.640 --> 40:42.080
all that turned into was another way to track me and that's the last thing i want real-time brent

40:42.080 --> 40:46.720
update for the show and he's missed his flight unfortunately by about 10 minutes so let's hope

40:46.720 --> 40:52.640
that air canada take care take good care of him tonight uh anyway matt writes in hey self-hosted

40:52.640 --> 40:58.000
crew i wanted to start out by saying thank you to the entire jb team for consistently putting out

40:58.000 --> 41:07.280
top tier linux content stop i've been listening for a few years now and y'all how did i do with

41:07.280 --> 41:13.440
that not bad have really helped me in my journey to becoming a linux sys admin i've been building

41:13.440 --> 41:17.840
up my home lab and since i got the promotion a few months ago i was curious if you have talked

41:17.840 --> 41:22.720
about smoke detectors water and flood detectors or that kind of thing on the show previously

41:23.600 --> 41:27.280
i've been able to replace all the pipes in my house and i haven't had any leaks

41:27.280 --> 41:32.240
but i'm concerned that something might happen in the future thanks again for all that you do

41:32.240 --> 41:35.920
he loved the word y'all there's three y'alls in there and he's trying to make the british man say

41:38.320 --> 41:42.000
you're doing great alex you're doing great i do like the word what have you done for smoke

41:42.000 --> 41:46.400
detectors and the lot now do you have those integrated have you kept them separate they're

41:46.400 --> 41:52.320
bog standard five dollar smoke detectors from amazon and i've got one above my 3d printer

41:52.320 --> 41:57.680
i have a z wave smoke detector like i said i got a lot of z wave devices this i purchased november

41:57.680 --> 42:04.640
20th 2020 so i've had it for a couple of years now and i've never had a fire so i don't really

42:04.640 --> 42:10.080
have a lot to say but i bought it on a recommendation from the home assistant community

42:10.080 --> 42:15.120
it's the first alert z wave smoke detector carbon monoxide alarm you just join it to your z wave

42:15.120 --> 42:18.960
network like you would all your other devices and it shows up in home assistant with the alarm

42:18.960 --> 42:25.520
component and i like it a lot it's really easy to replace the battery too it's just got a little

42:25.520 --> 42:30.240
side tray that pops out so when you do have to replace the battery you can and because it's z

42:30.240 --> 42:35.360
wave you could it's not a big battery hog it's just two double a batteries so i'll put a link to

42:35.360 --> 42:41.520
this in the show notes for at least smoke detector now what about leak detectors previous friends of

42:41.520 --> 42:47.200
the show shelly actually make some flood detectors which uh i'm reliably informed by one of my

42:47.200 --> 42:52.000
neighbors who has a rental property out at the coast work extremely well and i'm fairly sure

42:52.000 --> 42:59.120
that akara aqara make a leak detector as well and then of course sticking with the z wave theme over

42:59.120 --> 43:06.720
here the aotech water leak sensor these aotechs they work great with home assistant they uh also

43:06.720 --> 43:11.040
make some great sensors they're just a little expensive although their leak detector is only 36

43:11.040 --> 43:17.600
bucks and 36 dollars it's money well spent to prevent a leak and then of course another actual

43:17.600 --> 43:24.400
z wave device although i i don't use it but we've had people write in is the ring leak detectors

43:24.400 --> 43:30.240
which i'm told are pretty decent and actually talk z wave never used them myself but if you

43:30.240 --> 43:34.720
already have a ring camera or you want to experiment with it you could try the ring leak

43:34.720 --> 43:39.920
detectors as well can't vouch for it personally but we've gotten pretty good email on it all

43:39.920 --> 43:44.480
right we got some boost with some new podcast apps cos peeling was in first this week with

43:44.480 --> 43:52.160
3690 sats and he was writing in about his pi os setup from our chat in pi for every problem

43:52.160 --> 43:58.560
he says that i use tumbleweed on my quote desktop pies and then i use raspian on the headless cody

43:58.560 --> 44:06.560
pies and he uses nfs to avoid using the sd card all together he says thanks for the show that's

44:06.560 --> 44:10.560
all well and good but what happens when the nfs server's down well then you're probably not

44:10.560 --> 44:18.000
watching your movies anyways or the network switches down or yeah yeah no i i agree you know

44:18.000 --> 44:24.240
but i stream all of my television over the network now and it's been okay but yeah yeah nfs to run

44:24.240 --> 44:33.360
the system that that could lead to a bad day sir lurks a lot boosted in with 1337 sats because i'm

44:33.360 --> 44:39.680
also a big believer and a fan of the of your support of the matrix ecosystem i do run my own

44:39.680 --> 44:44.080
home server i've done it for a couple of years now and i've given you lots of feedback and moral

44:44.080 --> 44:49.680
support for running matrix but i wanted to chime in and say that i fully support your use of discord

44:49.680 --> 44:55.680
as well it's not a zero-sum game self-hosting is a journey and shows like this are to help

44:55.680 --> 45:01.280
light the way but if neophytes are on discord you got to meet them there to bring them into the

45:01.280 --> 45:07.280
tent hallelujah well put lurks a lot he goes on to say with a double boost coming in with another

45:07.280 --> 45:12.400
elite set of sats he says also once they're on the path you know the show could help nudge them

45:12.400 --> 45:16.880
to matrix one day i'm glad you have a couple of matrix room for the self-hosted show maybe

45:16.880 --> 45:20.720
encourage people to engage and pay attention over there hey i'm paying attention over there

45:20.720 --> 45:24.160
he says too bad there isn't a bridge good enough to bring them together it's a shame

45:24.880 --> 45:31.520
but that is the way thanks lurks a lot yeah thank you and i think it's uh it's important

45:31.520 --> 45:37.760
you know that we talk about this stuff because there's always a there's always prevailing wind

45:37.760 --> 45:42.960
in in tech that for one company to win or one standard to win all the others have to lose and

45:42.960 --> 45:48.640
i think it goes back to a steve jobs quote originally i think that i'm referencing here that

45:49.200 --> 45:56.480
there's this idea that for apple to win microsoft has to lose and it's just not true and i think

45:56.480 --> 46:02.000
the same is true of discord and matrix yes and i think this type of debate should i host it myself

46:02.000 --> 46:06.720
should i just use the dang service uh what are the pros and cons i think that's something the

46:06.720 --> 46:12.080
audience probably struggles with quite a bit i'd say it's probably the biggest part of self-hosting

46:12.080 --> 46:18.880
is deciding is it worth my time or not fun deck hermit boosted him with 2000 sats he says there

46:18.880 --> 46:25.120
is a podcast called the amp hour that's located in raleigh with a host named chris and he says

46:25.120 --> 46:30.080
maybe there'd be some event organization that could happen sometime and who knows man there

46:30.080 --> 46:35.600
is a good community in raleigh that could be a thing that happens i like the name too rally iot

46:35.600 --> 46:41.040
riot that's a fun one he came in with an another double boost fun deck hermit did another elite

46:41.040 --> 46:46.480
set of sats he says not only does the authentic proxy application adhere to the specific protocol

46:47.120 --> 46:51.440
it can also form a protective layer around dumb applications like pup cloud or jacket

46:52.160 --> 46:57.280
hmm it has an internal build and built-in proxy but that is optional we had that feedback from

46:57.280 --> 47:03.920
a few folks actually that uh not only can authentic be the authentication provider but

47:03.920 --> 47:08.480
it can also do the same job as orthalia is only able to do as well so you end up with the best

47:08.480 --> 47:16.320
of both worlds so uh i suspect that's just bumped up my list of should try soon agreed sucd boosted

47:16.320 --> 47:22.800
in with a baby row of ducks 222 sats because i use the software called flight aware on the raspberry

47:22.800 --> 47:32.480
pie uh and you can order it as a complete hit ready to go so it's 120 bucks basically but it

47:32.480 --> 47:37.360
comes with the transponder it comes with the pi zero the power supply the indoor antenna with

47:37.360 --> 47:42.800
a magnetic base all the cables you need the sd card everything to just have your own flight

47:42.800 --> 47:48.720
aware setup that could be genuinely a cost-effective way to get hold of a raspberry pi in 2022

47:49.200 --> 47:57.280
i was gonna say that all right bronze wing boosted in with elite set of sats 1337

47:57.280 --> 48:02.720
feeling my pain alex says my home pods and siri also seem to be way worse recently i used to be

48:02.720 --> 48:09.440
able to say hey you know who it's movie time or open the middle garage door now she usually takes

48:09.440 --> 48:15.840
at least a moment it's very frustrating get slower please keep us up to date if a fix shows up so an

48:15.840 --> 48:21.040
old update on that alex you know one handy thing that i have is i kind of have an ab environment

48:21.040 --> 48:26.880
i noticed that the siri tubes in the studio are all still working perfectly fine they still control

48:26.880 --> 48:31.760
all the devices they recognize everything i say it's only the siri tubes in the rv

48:33.360 --> 48:37.920
and i kind of almost wonder if it's something to do with the home assistant home kit integration

48:37.920 --> 48:44.160
like something's gone awry in that setup but i'm not sure yet i had a theory that it was to do with

48:44.160 --> 48:48.320
the profiles that these assistants build up on you over time so you know how they do the voice

48:48.320 --> 48:54.160
matching at right at the beginning uh where your voice is just a generic voice amongst the herd but

48:54.160 --> 48:59.360
over the years right they'll hear you speak more and they'll learn more and more and more and that

48:59.920 --> 49:06.480
as those profiles are supposed to get better they actually get to a point of diminishing returns and

49:06.480 --> 49:11.440
then they just fall off a cliff the other way that's a theory because what i was reading is

49:11.440 --> 49:18.400
that if you go into your google account or whatever and delete the profiles they have on you

49:18.400 --> 49:23.600
that people's experiences have improved dramatically and i just thought perhaps we could crowdsource

49:24.160 --> 49:28.880
some folks willing to test that out for us you know this is a great example of the knobs that

49:28.880 --> 49:33.600
we don't get access to anymore with all of these new services and devices they're just completely

49:33.600 --> 49:40.080
hidden from us and it's just they they seem to get worse and worse and worse and there's no way to

49:40.080 --> 49:44.640
do this and worse and worse and there's nothing we can do uh and bronzewing says so you know he

49:44.640 --> 49:49.280
goes on to say i'm looking at mycroft it seems like maybe the right way to go but 300 is a

49:49.280 --> 49:54.160
steep hardware entry i reserved one but i just couldn't pull the trigger when it actually came

49:54.160 --> 49:59.520
time to buy it so i got two homepod minis instead but the voice recognition space just seems really

49:59.520 --> 50:04.720
rough right now i feel like i completely agree with bronze and wig and there is clearly a solution

50:04.720 --> 50:11.680
home assistant based local based but the bar is high in terms of performance let's just remember

50:12.880 --> 50:19.440
christmas 1998 when alex got his first family computer and we were all sat around this thing

50:19.440 --> 50:26.960
i think we got it from pc world and it was a time computers pc and we had via voice on this

50:26.960 --> 50:32.240
thing i don't know if you remember that program of course i do you had to train this thing you

50:32.240 --> 50:38.640
had to speak sentences into this thing to train the algorithm and it would input text to you on

50:38.640 --> 50:44.800
on the screen and let's just pump the brakes and saying how bad they are before we actually

50:44.800 --> 50:49.760
realize how good they are first of all please yeah the fact that they can even pick us up now

50:49.760 --> 50:54.720
when we're holding these mobile devices in like any environment pretty much is incredible because

50:54.720 --> 51:00.160
back then you needed a really close microphone maybe even a headset microphone for good dictation

51:00.160 --> 51:03.360
and getting that microphone to work with that computer was not a given

51:05.200 --> 51:11.120
oh old computers oh man optimus gray boosted in just a day ago with a full row of ducks

51:11.120 --> 51:16.640
2222 sats he says i was just listening to the podcast and i was syncing everything up

51:16.640 --> 51:21.440
but you know what this episode 71 might just be one of my favorites it's got cooking proxmox

51:21.440 --> 51:27.360
bit warden with ansible what else could you want also i agree brent needs some gas money

51:27.360 --> 51:31.920
and don't tell alex that we'll all be touching his chair when we have a house party over there

51:32.720 --> 51:37.840
i still have the sign up here no touchy the chair and you see this on the stream but that

51:37.840 --> 51:42.800
just makes people want to touch it that just makes them want to touch it it's still up there

51:42.800 --> 51:46.640
it's like uh it's like a sign that says don't kick me then people want to kick you true it's

51:46.640 --> 51:51.600
true yeah i do have a punchable face i've been told i like the idea too that brent's

51:51.600 --> 51:55.040
gonna have a party while you're gone like you know a teenager having a party while their parents are

51:55.040 --> 52:01.600
out do it i mean there is a million cameras around here he won't get away with it no no

52:01.600 --> 52:04.640
but there's not much you'll be able to do i mean you know it's probably gonna be archie's fault

52:04.640 --> 52:10.080
archie's gonna be a bad influence i imagine yeah yeah that dog does like to drink we got a double

52:10.080 --> 52:15.120
boost some double boost this week that's great guys 500 sats from optimus gray again uh he says

52:15.120 --> 52:22.640
i live in a three-story townhouse about 650 to 700 square feet per level one unify ap on top

52:22.640 --> 52:30.160
and the lower floor but i get poor speeds on that second middle floor do i really need a third

52:30.160 --> 52:36.000
unify ap i tried the unified tools but all my neighbors with their isp modems and routers set

52:36.000 --> 52:41.360
to blast just seem to be configured poorly uh just run ethernet everywhere just plug your phone in

52:41.360 --> 52:46.240
via ethernet that will solve that problem yeah right yeah what about wi-fi 6 i don't know if

52:46.240 --> 52:50.960
you have modern enough devices to support wi-fi 6 that uses a bit of extra spectrum that some of

52:50.960 --> 52:56.720
the other neighbors might not have uh obviously every device doesn't support it but generally

52:56.720 --> 53:02.800
speaking the unified tools do an okay job of defining you know the the spectrum that's

53:02.800 --> 53:06.640
available if you scan the channels it will automatically move things around for you

53:07.360 --> 53:12.240
i do have a firmware on my robo vac which might be of interest i don't know if you have a robo vac

53:12.240 --> 53:18.560
or anything like that but i can actually send my valetudo based robo vac around the house

53:18.560 --> 53:24.320
and it will generate me a wi-fi heat map of the wi-fi access points wow so you get an idea of

53:24.320 --> 53:27.760
where the signal is the strongest from the neighbors and stuff like that that's pretty fun

53:27.760 --> 53:33.200
now you don't necessarily need a fancy pants vacuum to do that there are apps on your phone

53:33.200 --> 53:37.680
which will let you do the same thing that might be a good place to start i wonder too optimist

53:37.680 --> 53:45.680
like a price aside why not get the third ap it sounds like you've got a ton of channel crossover

53:45.680 --> 53:50.720
from your neighbors similar situation where i'm at here at the studio it's i open up my wi-fi

53:50.720 --> 53:55.200
network screen and i would be i mean i've never really counted because i just have to scroll and

53:55.200 --> 54:00.800
scroll but it's probably like 35 40 ap's i can pick up it's disgusting and i have to imagine

54:00.800 --> 54:05.120
there's just a ton of channel overlap you could be faced the same thing especially in a townhouse

54:05.120 --> 54:11.040
like i am could totally see that the other thing is you could be just on the point between those

54:11.040 --> 54:18.320
two access points where the signal is about dropping off from both of them and your devices

54:18.320 --> 54:22.480
don't know which one to pick so they might be flip-flopping between the two all the time trying

54:22.480 --> 54:28.000
to do that handoff thing and depending on how they're mounted the generally the wi-fi signal

54:28.000 --> 54:34.960
is a bubble right it's like a it's like a mushroom top it goes out up and around it doesn't necessarily

54:34.960 --> 54:40.480
go down below the ap it doesn't like go behind the ap so you may have a mushroom dome of wi-fi

54:40.480 --> 54:44.160
on the bottom floor and then you have a mushroom dome of wi-fi on the top and they're both just

54:44.160 --> 54:48.560
not intersecting the middle floor as much plus you maybe got something in the walls too that

54:48.560 --> 54:52.320
could also be an issue i've seen places that have metal in the walls and that blocks the signal

54:52.960 --> 55:01.040
we got a baller boost from dean dean i'm gonna say 70 10 70 maybe dean 10 70 sent us a boost

55:01.040 --> 55:07.120
just a day ago 10 000 sats he's boosting the dip he says i just wanted to show my appreciation for

55:07.120 --> 55:11.840
the self-hosted show i thoroughly enjoy the topics you discuss especially naz storage and home server

55:11.840 --> 55:17.200
options keep up the great work well thank you dean for boosting the dip sats are on sale right now

55:17.200 --> 55:22.400
we got 100 sats from user 65 94 that said thanks and also 100 sats from josh the chest

55:22.400 --> 55:27.280
said it's a great time to boost the show sats are cheap if you want to send us a boost you can do

55:27.280 --> 55:32.320
so by getting a podcasting 2.0 app at newpodcastapps.com or just go grab breeze if you

55:32.320 --> 55:37.760
don't want to switch your app breez.technology or if you want to nerd it up but i don't think

55:37.760 --> 55:44.720
anybody did this week you can use boost cli which is a command line tool pretty cool i guess you

55:44.720 --> 55:49.280
gotta be pretty elite for that now the chat room we're asking for some real-time feedback on the

55:49.280 --> 55:56.160
wi-fi based robo vac heat map i've just put a link to that in the chat it's called valoroni i think

55:56.800 --> 56:01.760
and uh take a look in the show notes it'll be in there as well that looks really cool alex

56:01.760 --> 56:06.400
i figured it'd be a neat visualization but i didn't realize it would be that neat so yeah

56:07.200 --> 56:13.760
what's such a neat and wild use case for a robot vacuum well the thing is i have a dedicated iot

56:13.760 --> 56:19.520
network which is 2.4 gig for all of my you know robo vacs and cam smart cameras and all the other

56:19.520 --> 56:25.920
wi-fi crap shellies that are in is in this house and so i used that to figure out where to put

56:25.920 --> 56:30.880
you know different access points and it turned out in my kitchen there was a spot that was

56:30.880 --> 56:36.320
underneath the stairs and just behind the washing machines and the fridge that was of course just

56:36.320 --> 56:42.160
which is where my dining room table is you can picture it that had no wi-fi signal and obviously

56:42.160 --> 56:48.080
the dining room table is where i spend some hours a week you know with laptop whilst you know cooking

56:48.080 --> 56:53.680
is happening and what have you so i just got one of those unify in wall ap's and slapped it into an

56:53.680 --> 56:58.240
old phone socket and and pulled the wires through the wall into the crawl space it was good to go

56:58.240 --> 57:03.360
it was you know probably only an hour or two's worth of work very nice and that's a great idea

57:03.360 --> 57:08.800
for an iot network talk about getting a real on the ground view of your network i want to say

57:08.800 --> 57:14.960
thank you to our members our sre subscribers make the show possible they let us be really picky

57:14.960 --> 57:20.320
about the sponsors we work with they give us the runway to keep the show going if we have to say

57:20.320 --> 57:27.440
no to some sponsors and as a thank you we create an ad free feed of the show and also we tack on

57:27.440 --> 57:32.400
a post show that is exclusive to them if you'd like to sign up support the show become a member

57:32.400 --> 57:38.000
at self-hosted dot show slash sre and then i imagine shortly after the new although i probably

57:38.000 --> 57:43.840
shouldn't commit to anything but after we get the new website out the door like the next thing on my

57:43.840 --> 57:49.440
list is upgrading the member feed so we have live versions so you can do your boosts for the member

57:49.440 --> 57:52.800
feeds and all that kind of stuff so that'll be probably later in the year after we get the

57:52.800 --> 57:57.600
website out at the end of summer but all that stuff is being worked on for our sre members because you

57:57.600 --> 58:03.200
guys matter a heck of a lot to us i think it is really important just to hammer home how important

58:03.200 --> 58:10.560
independent media is these days you see stuff in all sorts of spaces about how there are sponsored

58:10.560 --> 58:18.640
videos here and non-disclosed sponsorships and all that kind of stuff and having a audience funded

58:18.640 --> 58:25.360
show really allows chris and myself and the rest of the jb team to be authentic to you guys yes we

58:25.360 --> 58:31.200
have a couple of commercial sponsors but primarily the show is funded by you the listeners and i think

58:31.760 --> 58:38.000
keeping independent media independent is hugely valuable to our society i couldn't have said it

58:38.000 --> 58:43.440
better myself so self-hosted dot show slash sre if you'd like to sign up you can find our discord

58:43.440 --> 58:48.800
community over there as well at self-hosted dot show slash discord and don't forget we have the

58:48.800 --> 58:53.440
matrix space linked to the show notes if you'd like to join our matrix community as well lots

58:53.440 --> 58:59.280
of stuff coming up in the next few weeks obviously we've got the london meetup on august 5th meetup.com

58:59.280 --> 59:06.640
slash jupyter broadcasting for all the details there chris has his jpl jb super road trip in

59:06.640 --> 59:12.320
september on the west coast yeah you can find different ways to get in touch with us at self

59:12.320 --> 59:18.880
hosted dot show slash contact i'm on twitter at ironic badger i'm over there too at chris las

59:18.880 --> 59:23.440
and of course the network is at jupyter signal thanks for listening everybody that was self
