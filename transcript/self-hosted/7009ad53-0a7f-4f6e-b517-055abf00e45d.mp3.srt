1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,640
Well, it was road trip time yesterday, Chris.

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:03,360
Sure, that was a heck of a road trip.

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,400
Yeah, we drove up from Raleigh, North Carolina,

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,160
and here we are in Lexington this morning, Kentucky.

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,240
Yeah, and we discovered something called the Snake.

6
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,080
The Snake.

7
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,500
It was the very, very windy, twisty,

8
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:16,880
was it Tennessee Mountain Road?

9
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,120
I think it was Tennessee.

10
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,900
It was the perfect road for us

11
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:21,680
that we just accidentally stumbled across.

12
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:22,520
Yeah.

13
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:25,560
Alex's tires are designed to stick to the road.

14
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:26,400
Let's just say that.

15
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,660
I mean, you just described all tires ever, but.

16
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:32,040
I know, I'm not a tire guy.

17
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,440
Anyway, the reason that we took this road trip,

18
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,080
a nine, 10 hour drive from Raleigh,

19
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,600
was to spend a bit of time with Wendell, who joins us today.

20
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,520
Hello, Wendell.

21
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,600
How's it going?

22
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,800
Pretty good, how are you doing?

23
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,620
Oh, not too bad.

24
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:43,960
Although it is a little weird, I mean, like,

25
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,880
podcast technology, I would think with, you know,

26
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,120
since Alexander Graham Bell,

27
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,440
you guys would not have to come here, but I'm glad you did.

28
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,680
That's true.

29
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,440
I had that realization on about hour three of the flight.

30
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,420
I said, well, you know, we could have done Skype,

31
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:57,700
but this is a lot more fun.

32
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,280
I mean, then we got to see the Grand Tour.

33
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,120
Yeah, you get to see,

34
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,640
we're going to do an office tour at some point

35
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,080
on the Level One channel very soon,

36
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,600
because the renovation is basically done.

37
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,560
Like, there's a few rough things we got to work on,

38
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,280
but basically the renovation's done.

39
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,480
That's pretty presentable.

40
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,800
There is something special about

41
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,680
actually connecting in meat space.

42
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,640
Yeah.

43
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,800
Which you just don't get over.

44
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,300
I mean, I've watched Chris,

45
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,560
I've watched your channel for a while,

46
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,980
and Wendell, I've watched yours probably for just as long,

47
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,040
going way, way back.

48
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,640
And I know you cover all sorts of technology

49
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,560
and stuff like that,

50
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,840
but you generally tend to focus on

51
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,000
the nerdier side of things.

52
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,600
I think it's fair to say.

53
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,440
So-

54
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,600
Look at this thing that I gave a large part of my life

55
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,720
into figuring out.

56
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,560
This was a terrible, terrible experience.

57
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,080
Suffer along with me.

58
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,520
I think that's an accurate statement

59
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,480
for a lot of what we're trying to do with this show, right?

60
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,320
Right, yeah.

61
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,000
Is, yeah, I've put some blood, sweat,

62
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,840
and a lot of alcohol into this project.

63
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,960
And I want you to come along for that ride with me.

64
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,440
So, yeah.

65
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,040
We thought it would be a good topic for our,

66
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,880
this is our second episode as we record.

67
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,560
We thought just the discussion of why self-host

68
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,680
is sort of a meta conversation.

69
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,520
And that's why the tour of your space here

70
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,360
was pretty perfect,

71
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,120
because there is clearly some stuff you've chosen

72
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,500
to spend the extra time to build local infrastructure,

73
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:13,040
put high-speed networking in, lots of disk.

74
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,000
And then there's some things,

75
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,140
which we don't know about yet,

76
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:18,980
that you alluded to that you've chosen to host in the cloud.

77
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,260
So I'm kind of curious what the Wendell take is

78
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,080
on why self-hosting is important.

79
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:27,920
I think that for the individual, self-hosting is

80
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,540
never more accessible than it's ever been.

81
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:33,400
And I think that going forward,

82
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,000
self-hosting makes a lot of sense,

83
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,980
because the reason that you don't want to self-host,

84
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:41,000
I think, is one of convenience.

85
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,120
So you look at Google and Gmail,

86
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,520
it's like Gmail is super convenient.

87
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,880
You just load a browser and there it is.

88
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,480
But the technology has moved on to the point

89
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,080
that that's basically become a commodity.

90
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,120
And we could talk,

91
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,760
I don't want to get super into the weeds here,

92
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,080
but things like containerization technologies mean

93
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:01,520
that individuals are better able to access Google levels

94
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,480
of technology running on a Raspberry Pi.

95
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,880
And so, well, running on a Raspberry Pi

96
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,120
might not be the best user experience,

97
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,100
but it's possible to have an even better user experience

98
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,920
than, quote unquote, the cloud,

99
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,120
even if you're rolling your own cloud

100
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,440
or doing a private cloud.

101
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,760
And because you're giving somebody money for the service,

102
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,300
they're not having to mine your data

103
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,480
in order to earn money.

104
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,320
Right.

105
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,900
Now, I did notice a lot of disk,

106
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,120
but you said some of that disk

107
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,840
was to actually backup the stuff

108
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,100
that you do keep in the cloud.

109
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,600
Yeah, so I'm always paranoid

110
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,160
that something's going to go wrong in the cloud.

111
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,080
Like, Microsoft had that major DNS outage in Azure.

112
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,080
And so it's like, is that going to happen?

113
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,360
There's a backup provider for dental,

114
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,680
like their specialization is like dental offices.

115
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,000
So you've got HIPAA and things like that.

116
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,440
And this was just last week.

117
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49,240
And the organization that provides the backups in the cloud

118
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,680
was hit by ransomware.

119
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,760
It's like, oh, we all laugh.

120
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,960
It's like, oh, this is, you know, blah, blah, blah.

121
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,760
That's incompetence.

122
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,900
But- Happens though.

123
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:00,000
Yeah, well, I mean, when you have things like the OPM hack,

124
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,500
like the hardware was defective from the beginning.

125
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,900
So you know how you make sure it's safe

126
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:09,380
is you have an offline backup that's inaccessible.

127
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,440
Yeah, and there's something to being a smaller target.

128
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,400
If it's, you know, on your LAN,

129
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,580
you are one person amongst millions of nodes

130
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:17,420
on the internet.

131
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,920
But if you're Azure in this case,

132
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,280
or another large provider,

133
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,840
you've got a pretty big target on your back too.

134
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,540
So there's a different risk profile.

135
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,800
There's like a different set of risks.

136
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,920
Like you still have to keep your system secure

137
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,160
and make sure your firewall's, you know, set up right.

138
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,600
And you're not just letting anybody in,

139
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,000
but in a way you're also kind of just one of many.

140
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,320
You're sort of lost in the noise.

141
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,200
That's one of the things I like about containerization

142
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,760
is because it offers the possibility of somebody

143
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,100
to set up an automation system,

144
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:46,240
like just a very basic Docker, you know,

145
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,960
scrape and rebuild on a timer

146
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,280
would let you keep the patches and security

147
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,680
and still do local hosting

148
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,940
and probably be pretty safe

149
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:57,120
as long as the container that you're using

150
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,320
is maintained by people that know what they're doing.

151
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,680
Of course, like depending if the container

152
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,640
is not well-maintained

153
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,200
or there's like an open source supply chain attack,

154
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,800
then that's a whole other risk profile as well.

155
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,380
So what containers do you use like for backup?

156
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:14,200
Well, like we would have a replication

157
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,680
of like whatever the thing is.

158
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,560
So like if there was a very important website

159
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,160
that we were hosting,

160
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,600
we've actually been doing a lot of work lately

161
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,960
in taking traditional CMSs and making them headless.

162
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,000
So like with Drupal, for example,

163
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,120
it is very easy, not very easy,

164
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,120
but we can fairly easily add an interface to the JSON API.

165
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,000
So that Drupal, a traditional CMS,

166
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,080
which is actually kind of slow and kind of clunky,

167
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,440
especially version eight,

168
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,500
but we can take the content from that,

169
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,420
export it as flat files,

170
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:46,120
and then everything is perfectly fine to run

171
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,000
on like Amazon S3 and CloudFront.

172
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,480
And then when somebody has a content update,

173
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,320
it just regenerates the flat files.

174
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,960
And I think this kind of thing

175
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,120
with a service layer on top of it

176
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,120
is probably the future of websites.

177
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,440
So if you have a very large website

178
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,560
that needs to be very, very resilient,

179
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,140
you can have your traditional hosting thing,

180
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:05,160
but like your backup plan can be the series of flat files

181
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,160
or the main hosting can be a series of flat files.

182
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,360
And then it's like, oh, something went horribly wrong.

183
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,160
It's like, okay, well, let's just make the change in DNS.

184
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,800
And like Amazon could be on fire.

185
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,040
We don't care.

186
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,160
We could roll it out at Akamai.

187
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,040
We could roll it out at Linode.

188
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,520
We could roll it out, you know,

189
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,760
CloudFlare could provide services.

190
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,860
It's really, when you're dealing with it at that level,

191
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:26,520
the service provider no longer matters.

192
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,400
Are you not tempted to do like this new,

193
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,160
cause you just have a video come out about DevOps,

194
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,480
a DevOps workstation.

195
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,760
Are you not tempted to do stuff in Lambda?

196
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,120
You know, have these functions

197
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,840
that are just very single purpose or?

198
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,080
Yeah, no, you totally could.

199
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:41,900
It's funny.

200
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,440
We actually do have some things

201
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,000
that are running in Lambda.

202
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,800
So like a customer comes along and wants to do a job

203
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,600
and it'll just spin up in Lambda, do its thing.

204
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,000
And then the output is added to the collective.

205
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,640
And that's totally fine.

206
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:58,400
Like that's a perfectly reasonable way to design things

207
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,880
that functionally, I mean,

208
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,640
it's way different under the hood,

209
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,680
but functionally that's where a lot of DevOps is going

210
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,880
because like our local DevOps server,

211
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,240
Kubernetes is doing a lot of stuff.

212
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,560
So like a developer checks in a bunch of stuff,

213
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,400
a VM has stood up and a whole bunch of things happen

214
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:17,440
in Kubernetes and then all of that goes away

215
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,280
when they're done.

216
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,360
Well, actually it sticks around for like a week,

217
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,520
just in case we need it.

218
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,360
But then after a week,

219
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,880
like whatever that temporal thing was gone.

220
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,320
And this actually has worked out really well.

221
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,600
There's a particular project in mind

222
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:31,520
where the client is very hard to work with

223
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,480
and they've got their own like chef automation.

224
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,200
And so like, even if we just add an SSH key

225
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:43,200
to the very, like the two vCPU instances on Amazon,

226
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,040
which is not really enough for what they wanna do,

227
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,800
chef comes along and just clobbers that periodically.

228
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,800
And so we've set up continuous integration

229
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,160
and a Kubernetes thing so that it actually will spin up

230
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:59,400
something that works kind of like the Amazon EC2 instance,

231
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,200
but it has a way more CPU and memory horsepower.

232
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,840
It does all of the work that it needs to

233
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,240
in that temporal VM.

234
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,720
And really it's just a container in Kubernetes.

235
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,320
And then it pushes from that Kubernetes container

236
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,520
to that really just awful, terrible EC2 instance.

237
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,800
And so it doesn't matter if they come along

238
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,640
and clobber it later.

239
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,400
It doesn't matter if they come and delete the SSH keys.

240
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,880
It just doesn't matter.

241
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:25,640
So how do you decide which services get that treatment

242
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,800
and which services end up in your closet downstairs?

243
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,160
Well, a lot of, see,

244
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,240
I would say that that exists in both places.

245
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,680
Like it would not work without the closet

246
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,760
and it would not work without the cloud services.

247
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,720
You get sort of the best of both worlds.

248
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,680
If the cloud service goes away,

249
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,520
it's really easy for us to redeploy somewhere else.

250
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,160
And if the closet goes away,

251
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,440
we've got time to restore from offsite backups

252
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,560
and do whatever we need to do

253
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,120
without anybody that's in production

254
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,600
really realizing what's happened.

255
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,160
I think we need to rename the show, Chris, Closet Hosting.

256
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:00,320
It is, you know what, there's something to it there

257
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,760
because it's a nice, perfect sweet spot.

258
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,600
I really like that.

259
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,040
Cause you're not dependent on any one cloud provider.

260
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,640
And you're not absolutely dependent on your office space

261
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,880
being online 24 seven,

262
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,880
if you have to take something down

263
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,800
to install something new in the rack or move it.

264
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,480
Cause let's face it,

265
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,480
as experienced as you clearly are,

266
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,600
you're not a data center.

267
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,880
You don't have techs here 24 seven.

268
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,920
You don't have all the monitoring that they do,

269
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,640
the security protocols that they do to even get on the floor.

270
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,800
Although when you deal with people

271
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,800
actually in the data center, it's less than impressive.

272
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,640
True.

273
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,520
I've got a failed hard drive.

274
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,360
I need that replaced.

275
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,320
Do what now?

276
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:38,440
I can hammer the front of the server with a hammer.

277
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:42,360
Yeah, it's very frustrating experience.

278
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,960
So we're here at your space.

279
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,040
What about like your home set up?

280
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,280
You have storage systems at home.

281
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,920
Do you have a big like home server set up

282
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,960
or do you keep it lean at home tech wise?

283
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,360
Our home is very lean.

284
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,600
It's a similar philosophy,

285
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,600
but I have an ITX system that is in the fractal node 304.

286
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,400
And it's a four processor eight thread system right now,

287
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,600
but it's very soon going to be the,

288
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,560
as soon as I get a 3950X from AMD,

289
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,960
it's going to be a 16 core AM4 system.

290
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,320
Thought about replacing it with Threadripper,

291
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,120
but it's really overkill for what I do at home.

292
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,600
But the home system runs a number of VMs.

293
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,280
There's an IOT gateway because all the IOT devices

294
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,560
are on a completely separate network.

295
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:28,480
And the IOT devices, I run more homegrown IOT devices

296
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,960
than real like third party IOT devices.

297
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,680
What's an example of that?

298
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,920
The system for opening the garage door

299
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,760
is hooked into the lights.

300
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,200
So like where my house is,

301
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,360
there's a light that's like right at the road

302
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,960
cause there's a little bit of a driveway.

303
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,000
And then there are lights on the garage

304
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,520
and there are lights on the house.

305
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:51,360
And so there's a receiver at the light post

306
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,080
when you first entered the driveway

307
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:56,760
that picks up the Bluetooth Mac address of my phone.

308
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,040
And so when I drive by the light post,

309
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,720
it will turn the lights on if it's after dark

310
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,680
at the garage and a house.

311
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:10,280
So the IOT gateway for that cannot get on the internet.

312
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:13,160
Chris just for the listeners looked at me and winked

313
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:16,000
cause that's a phenomenal piece of engineering.

314
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,840
Yeah, it's great.

315
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,040
It's just an idea I wouldn't have thought of.

316
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,840
And are you battery powering that thing out there

317
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,760
or did you run power out to the remote?

318
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,720
It's a Raspberry Pi Zero in epoxy.

319
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,720
And so it literally is just doing its thing out there

320
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,760
with Bluetooth and the wifi from the house

321
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,040
is strong enough to make it out there.

322
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:32,880
That's great.

323
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,720
I mean, it's only like one megabit

324
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,960
but that's enough to send the packet

325
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,880
to be like, turn the lights on, it's dark.

326
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,880
It's all you need really.

327
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,840
That's a great solution.

328
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,040
And so you do have some level of presence awareness.

329
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,640
So the system knows specifically it's you.

330
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,480
Yeah.

331
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,320
That's really nice.

332
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,120
Did I hear you mention home assistant?

333
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:49,800
Yeah, I've been, so the home assistant conversation

334
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,640
is complicated.

335
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:54,680
It's broken right now, but historically I've had

336
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,480
the home assistant doing fun things

337
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,600
like scouring the internet for certain things

338
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,360
that I might be interested in that are temporal.

339
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,320
There's a Plex server that's a part of that.

340
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,640
So, you know, like Plex and historically,

341
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:11,080
although not currently, I've had an impact to capture box

342
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:15,320
that was hooked into the listings for cable TV.

343
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,160
And so like historically it's like, okay,

344
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,280
probably interested in Star Trek,

345
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,640
probably interested in all these things.

346
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,360
And I could get to that from my phone

347
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,520
and just tag shows that I might be interested in.

348
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:28,160
So like for Game of Thrones, it would DVR it for me.

349
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,760
But then that goes into Plex.

350
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,320
And so that's another like kind of cloud,

351
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,400
kind of not really thing.

352
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,920
Like Plex's model has changed over the years.

353
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,120
I'm not really super happy with their subscription model.

354
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,640
It's still probably worth it,

355
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,840
but it's super easy to run all of your media center at home

356
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,840
and actually stream it yourself

357
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,920
over your internet connection.

358
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,400
A lot of the internet connections here in America

359
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,480
are gimped in really weird ways,

360
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:52,080
but like upload is one of them.

361
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:55,400
And so it can be problematic to stream from,

362
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,320
like if you're traveling,

363
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,320
like stream your home media collection.

364
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,240
But Plex actually makes that really easy.

365
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,200
And I think that like movie studios and rights holders

366
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,920
are really nervous about that kind of functionality.

367
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,840
And I hope that it doesn't go away,

368
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,800
but being able to record those kinds of things

369
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,400
from traditional mediums,

370
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,560
like time and format shift it basically

371
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,160
has been really awesome.

372
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,560
But I don't really have a lot of time

373
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,560
to enjoy that kind of stuff anymore.

374
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,360
And Netflix is good enough that it has broken.

375
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,200
And it's like, okay,

376
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,560
I need to probably figure out why it's broken

377
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,680
or updated or whatever.

378
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,880
And I just haven't bothered.

379
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,600
But the thing about all of these streaming services

380
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,600
is, you know, Disney's coming out with a new one this year,

381
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,400
Apple, what's the one for Star Trek, CBS.

382
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,240
Yep, and Warner's got one coming out.

383
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,200
Yeah, I'm getting a bit fatigued by all this stuff.

384
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,240
I don't really like the idea

385
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,880
of not being able to get back to that either,

386
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,320
because like I have archived copies of Next Gen,

387
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,680
but I also have like the resampled whatever thing

388
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,960
of Star Trek Next Gen.

389
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,960
And I really like the idea of format shifting

390
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,280
from the newer formats

391
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,040
onto something that I can watch on Plex all the time.

392
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,000
Because like, what's on Netflix is not,

393
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,960
I don't think it's the resampled version.

394
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,000
It doesn't seem like it's the resampled version.

395
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,640
And, you know, things could disappear off of Netflix

396
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,480
at any given moment, like,

397
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,000
oh, House is here today, now it's gone.

398
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,920
Yeah, there was talk of them removing Friends

399
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,000
and people went crazy about that.

400
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
It's really all about the rights.

401
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
You know, each different one of these streaming services

402
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,680
wants to have that exclusive content.

403
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,200
And so if, for some reason, CBS did the calculation

404
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,640
and said, you know, we make more money,

405
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,960
if we take Star Trek off of Netflix, they could do it.

406
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,840
I don't know why culturally this has become okay.

407
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:33,240
It's like, oh, Catcher in the Rye is no longer available.

408
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,680
What?

409
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,880
Yeah, it's a weird, like it makes the product inconsistent.

410
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,120
And it seems like it's going to drive piracy.

411
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:39,960
Yeah.

412
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,200
It's a worse situation

413
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,600
than we were in with discs 10 years ago.

414
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,440
Yeah.

415
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,400
You know, because if I have a disc on my shelf,

416
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,040
I know that I'm gonna have that disc on my shelf.

417
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:48,880
Well, I now don't,

418
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,440
because I've ripped them all and put them in Plex.

419
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,040
Well, that's the person who does that

420
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,960
is the person who is the most advantaged now.

421
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,160
People who have pirated and created a huge content

422
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,160
or like me, I bought like all of the Star Trek stuff

423
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,640
on Blu-ray when it came out on Blu-ray,

424
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,520
bought it all on DVD and each time I've ripped it

425
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,600
and I'm just sort of done doing that too.

426
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,720
And just getting exhausted by it.

427
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,560
Yeah.

428
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,400
So you got a plague server.

429
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,880
How much storage is that on?

430
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,560
I think it's only about 20 terabytes, give or take.

431
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,880
So it's not, you know, exorbitant,

432
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:17,600
but there's also like production VM backups

433
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,000
and some other things there.

434
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
We need a leaderboard of different guests, Plex storage.

435
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,400
You know, like the top gear lap board.

436
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,240
Yeah.

437
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,080
We should have that with that.

438
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:27,920
That would be.

439
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,400
Well, if you don't mind software defined storage,

440
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,560
I could allocate a pool here.

441
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,640
I mean, we could probably go like up into the petabyte range.

442
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,480
Ooh.

443
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,720
That'd be pretty high quality board.

444
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,560
Okay.

445
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,360
Windows just shut straight to the top.

446
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,200
I love it.

447
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,600
It's gonna be hard to beat that for a while.

448
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,000
Just coming back to your Home Assistant,

449
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,120
when I say Home Assistant,

450
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,840
I mean the Python project that's all about home automation.

451
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,680
Oh yeah.

452
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,440
But you clearly mean something different.

453
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,280
Yeah, no.

454
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:54,920
Well, I wanna tie all of that in

455
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,360
because the Python Personal Assistant

456
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,920
is also about things like, you know,

457
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,080
for a while I had a scanner by the door.

458
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,560
And so like I could, like I got mail

459
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,440
and I could just feed it through the scanner

460
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,560
and it looks at the image.

461
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,960
Like I don't have to tell it what it is.

462
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,320
It knows, like it knows the time of day

463
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,520
and it knows this looks like an electric bill

464
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,000
and OCR is good enough

465
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,160
that it'll just categorize that online.

466
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,680
So like if you've ever used OneNote or Evernote

467
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,120
or something like that online

468
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,320
and you organize everything temporally,

469
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,280
you can just put that there,

470
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,160
tag it electric bill, whatever.

471
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,800
And then I don't have to think about organizing it.

472
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,080
It just does it for me.

473
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:29,960
Those kinds of things,

474
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,720
like a lot of people put a lot of work

475
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,480
into organizing those aspects of their lives.

476
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,520
Technology can do it,

477
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,480
but nobody's really doing it in terms of like a product.

478
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,760
I can see that being super valuable for you as an RVer

479
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:45,920
to have a PO box or something with an AI system

480
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,760
or machine learning system sorting this mail.

481
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,680
That's something I've thought about.

482
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,480
Cause there's some services where humans will do it,

483
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,000
but it's quite a bit.

484
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,840
It's quite a bit.

485
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,320
Yeah, my mother-in-law in England sorts my British mail.

486
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,560
See, I need one of those.

487
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,400
Yeah.

488
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,840
Just scan it, get it in the computer.

489
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,880
And that kind of stuff is really easy to automate

490
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,720
at the command line.

491
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,040
I mean, just a little bit of Python

492
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,760
and a little bit of image recognition

493
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,520
and even like the barcode recognition,

494
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,760
there's some really good optical barcode recognition

495
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,920
libraries out there.

496
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,400
You'd be surprised what you can bang out in a weekend.

497
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,480
Really?

498
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,640
And some of that though,

499
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,760
does sound like it relies on some service.

500
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,560
Like at some point you have to have something

501
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,160
that's intelligent enough to sort and store this stuff.

502
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,000
Well, you can still do all of that locally

503
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,200
because you can sort of tag it yourself.

504
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,880
I mean, it's one of the reasons why I have the Tesla V100s

505
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,280
is I wanna do that also with like the video component.

506
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,840
And I think that they're like OpenCV

507
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,520
and some of the open source libraries now are good enough

508
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,680
that you can train your own neural network

509
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,640
to do these things.

510
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,480
And I've got the old data set

511
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,680
so that I can just be like,

512
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,640
here is the last three years of electric bills.

513
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,680
This is what an electric bill looks like, just do it.

514
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,520
That is like that.

515
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,040
So there's compelling reasons in that argument.

516
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,760
There's compelling reasons to start capturing now

517
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,320
even if you don't have the recognition system in place yet.

518
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:02,240
Yeah, and Python is also really easy to automate.

519
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,360
And so like some of the same web technologies

520
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:07,120
we use for QA and QC, things like,

521
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,360
it's not Phantom JS anymore

522
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,040
because Phantom JS is on its way out,

523
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:13,040
but you can do browser automation and look for things.

524
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,840
And so you can like automate the login thing

525
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,920
for the electric company

526
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,040
because like you can get an electronic version

527
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,160
of your bill now, but it changes a little bit.

528
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,840
And sometimes the system is inaccessible

529
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,120
and sometimes you can't get more than six months of bills

530
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,480
and blah, blah, blah.

531
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,840
You can just automate that and have it log in and do stuff.

532
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:29,760
And then if it can't log in

533
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,000
cause they changed the website or whatever,

534
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,400
then you can have it notify you to be like,

535
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,080
hey, I couldn't download the bill or whatever.

536
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,560
Or I couldn't find the amount that was due

537
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:39,600
cause they changed the name of the div or whatever it is.

538
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,640
And that's not even AI.

539
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,560
That's just your good old fashioned

540
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,520
web dev quality control workflow.

541
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,520
Sure.

542
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,800
So you said, when I started asking you

543
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,640
about your home setup, you said you do keep it kind of lean.

544
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,720
Is that almost a philosophical thing?

545
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,040
Yeah, I don't really like data storage.

546
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,440
Like the data storage that I have,

547
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,080
I have files that go back to like the nineties,

548
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,920
but other than storage and replicas,

549
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:09,120
I used to have one full rack at home,

550
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,000
but by and large between virtual machine consolidation

551
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,720
and just not wanting to do the maintenance for it,

552
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,840
it's really become super, super consolidated.

553
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,240
Like all these little experiments

554
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,640
and all these other little things, they run in containers.

555
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,640
And right now my home setup is using Docker,

556
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,720
but everything at work pretty much is,

557
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,120
almost everything has moved to Kubernetes

558
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,280
cause Kubernetes on bare metal has also gotten a lot better

559
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,160
in the last six months or so.

560
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,880
And so because everything is containerized,

561
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,200
I have much better separation of the stuff that's mine

562
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,840
that I want to hang on to and stuff

563
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,200
that's just a transient thing that I put together

564
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,120
to try to deal with whatever it is.

565
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,000
Are you the sort of guy,

566
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,760
cause you mentioned a few of your servers

567
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:52,480
have Proxmox on them and a few of them have ESXi at home.

568
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,320
What do you do?

569
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,440
Are you bare metal at home with just containers on there

570
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,360
or VMs or?

571
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,520
At home, it's actually Beehive.

572
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,560
So yeah, I mean.

573
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,600
Okay, tell us why.

574
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,720
Cause Chris just did a double take on that one.

575
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,480
I wanted to experiment with it,

576
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,360
but I didn't trust it with production workloads yet.

577
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,280
Fair enough.

578
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,720
So.

579
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,560
Good way to do that.

580
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:14,100
Yeah, I mean, it's like, okay, will this actually run?

581
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,720
And I think that's part of why some of the things

582
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:19,000
are broken I think is cause it was like,

583
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,440
oh, I probably, I don't know if this was ready for that.

584
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,720
I don't know if maybe.

585
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,200
So Beehive is what the KVM equivalent for BSD?

586
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,040
Yep.

587
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:27,860
From, yeah, okay.

588
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,600
So that answers the OS you're running then.

589
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,800
Yeah, that was an actually that started out

590
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,240
as a free BSD installation that,

591
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,360
or I mean a free NAS installation that became free BSD.

592
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,560
And so that one became free BSD unwillingly.

593
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:42,760
Like it was free BSD or it was free NAS.

594
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,960
And then they did that upgrade that had like the web GUI.

595
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,640
That actually like, I feel really bad for that developer

596
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,880
because that was actually a brilliant interface

597
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,720
and it was great.

598
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,560
And it was exactly the right idea.

599
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,320
It was necessary too, but boy.

600
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,560
But the inertia of everything else, it was just impossible.

601
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,400
Yeah.

602
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,240
And I hope they bring that back

603
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,440
cause that was actually a good idea, but.

604
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,680
I do believe actually they are working on a new one.

605
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,240
That went wrong for me.

606
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,640
And then so then it became free BSD.

607
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,480
It's funny.

608
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,920
My free NAS systems are no longer free NAS systems either.

609
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,120
I went a little more extreme.

610
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,360
I moved them to Fedora, which was much more of a process.

611
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,040
The level one server, that's what we did.

612
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:17,880
Really?

613
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,700
Yeah.

614
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,800
I mean, once it's ZFS, the data is safe

615
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,240
and then you just got to get it working on Fedora.

616
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,620
I thought that's what you were going to say, by the way.

617
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:26,480
I thought you were going to say you had Fedora at home.

618
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,400
In some cases, ZFS on Linux is now ahead of the BSD fork.

619
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,240
Yeah.

620
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,480
Hasn't that been something to watch?

621
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,440
It has, yeah.

622
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,360
It's been a lot of fun.

623
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,600
Have we got memory compression yet?

624
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,160
That's the thing I'm waiting for.

625
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:40,000
If they do, it's not in any of my systems.

626
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,640
Well, Chris has a direct line to Alan Jude.

627
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,280
We can find that.

628
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,360
Alan, add that.

629
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,280
No, he's, yeah.

630
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,520
He is actually really involved with it these days.

631
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,160
I think that is a feature that he added.

632
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,800
I just don't know where it's available yet.

633
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:56,760
But the memory arc compression, data set compression thing,

634
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,880
that is going to be a game changer.

635
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,400
So you're all ZFS at home as well?

636
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,280
Yeah.

637
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,600
It's the only file system I trust.

638
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,160
Really?

639
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:03,640
Yeah.

640
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,320
So how do you square off?

641
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,600
Because at home, a lot of people, I mean,

642
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,360
I'm looking around this room full of hard drives.

643
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,120
And to paint a picture for people,

644
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,920
we're in Wendell's office today.

645
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:18,800
And it's just, it's Willy Wonka for nerds, this place.

646
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,960
It's like, it's amazing.

647
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,280
But for a lot of people, they want

648
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,840
to add one or two hard drives a year to their system

649
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,080
and stuff like that.

650
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,200
One of the biggest issues I face at home,

651
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,480
certainly with using ZFS, is that expansion,

652
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,120
the lack of flexibility.

653
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,600
What do you think about that?

654
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:38,040
So I ran up against that myself.

655
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,880
I mean, you remember, my home server

656
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,240
is an ITX system that's only got six three and a half inch

657
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:42,920
hard drive bays.

658
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,880
It's the Fractal Node 304.

659
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:50,120
And so I started out with, I think, three terabyte drives.

660
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,780
And then I bought three eight terabyte drives.

661
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:56,920
So it was two VDEVs of RAID Z1.

662
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,740
So one drive could die.

663
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:05,400
But I realized that when I was putting the eight terabyte

664
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,620
drives in, and that was when eight terabyte drives were

665
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:08,780
new and kind of expensive.

666
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:11,200
And it's like, I don't want to buy just one drive,

667
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,360
because losing eight terabytes of information

668
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,000
would be a huge pain.

669
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,680
And RAID 1 is not economical enough,

670
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:21,980
because I have to buy twice as much to have the redundancy.

671
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:24,480
But if I get three drives, it literally

672
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,860
splits the middle of cost and risk.

673
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:28,920
And so it's like, all right, I'll

674
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,360
get three eight terabyte drives.

675
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,000
So I got three eight terabyte drives.

676
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,680
And I was just going to add it as a VDEV

677
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,800
so that I could have six plus 16.

678
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,080
And that would be pretty good.

679
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,240
But then as I was doing that, I was like, well, wait.

680
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,720
I could probably just set up another zpool

681
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,880
and move everything off of the old one

682
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,760
and then have the free slots and just keep doing this three

683
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,640
drive square dance.

684
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,840
Because at home, at most, I would

685
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,880
have like four or five hard drives.

686
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,360
And so is it unreasonable economically for me

687
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,280
to buy four or five hard drives at a time

688
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,960
for doubling my storage every time?

689
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,200
And it's like, as long as the march of technology

690
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,080
continues, probably not.

691
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,800
I think that is the exact calculation I make with CFS.

692
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,480
If I'm willing to buy two or three drives at a time,

693
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,120
then it's a perfect fit for me for expansion.

694
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,720
And I think you've just got to make that math calculation.

695
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,000
And you've decided because of the rate

696
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,240
you want to add drives, it might be just too much.

697
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,120
And you also want to do mismatched drives,

698
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,500
don't you, like ones you take out of production

699
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,160
and put in there?

700
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,700
Well, that's an important consideration.

701
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,960
With the VDEV calculations and things like that,

702
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,760
you have to pretty much run the same size,

703
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,680
same make, same brand, ideally, performance-wise,

704
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,480
of drives in each VDEV.

705
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,520
So I use a merger FS.

706
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:41,920
And basically, it's JBOD plus SnapRaid for parity.

707
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,720
Because a lot of my data sets are just

708
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:48,160
very large static files that you write once, read a few times.

709
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,320
But I can imagine if you're doing bursty workloads,

710
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:54,800
like VM storage or any kind of database work,

711
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,200
you might run up against some limits.

712
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,240
Because you mentioned something about Optane today

713
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,680
whilst we were talking.

714
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,900
I mean, I've heard Linus Tech Tips talk about this.

715
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:07,240
And I just don't really know what it does.

716
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,120
Eventually, it should be cheaper than Flash.

717
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,640
It's one of those technologies that is really good.

718
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,600
It seems like it's less complicated than Flash.

719
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,220
But we're entering an era where you've

720
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:17,520
got like five or six bits per cell with Flash.

721
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,060
And so the density is going to be hard to compete with there.

722
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:24,640
But as I understand the manufacturing for Optane,

723
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,880
it's basically a 3D phase change thing.

724
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,120
It's just a couple of sheets of silicon

725
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,000
with a phase change layer between them.

726
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,920
I'm grossly oversimplifying.

727
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:37,440
But that type of manufacturing seems

728
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,000
like it would be orders of magnitude simpler

729
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,400
than NAND Flash manufacturing.

730
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,860
And then you add in the fact that the throughput is not

731
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:45,400
there yet.

732
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,560
Well, you can fix that by adding more devices.

733
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:51,520
But the latency is about halfway between NAND Flash and DRAM.

734
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,120
And so that's one of the reasons I

735
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:57,080
think Intel is pushing Optane as a DRAM alternative.

736
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,800
But the fly in the ointment for them

737
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:02,700
there is that AMD has shown up and said, we don't really care.

738
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,680
You want to run non-volatile memory?

739
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,200
No problem.

740
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,760
You want to run 8 terabytes of memory on a two-socket system?

741
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,280
No problem.

742
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:08,680
We don't care.

743
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,720
Whatever you want to do.

744
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,320
And so Intel's like, oh, man, we've

745
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,960
got these separate SKUs for more memory.

746
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,920
Darn, I mean, oh, we were going to try

747
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,560
to do some market segmentation there or something like that.

748
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,160
Because some of those large databases,

749
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,840
these companies will pay any amount of money

750
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,640
to make their database run faster,

751
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,520
because it literally translates into more money for them.

752
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,660
And so having the database run from Optane,

753
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,680
whether implemented as memory as DRAM

754
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:35,120
or implemented as a storage device,

755
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:40,120
enables those kinds of workloads in a way that the DRAM can't.

756
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,820
But Samsung and other companies have

757
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:45,400
done a lot of work on their NAND devices

758
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,880
to hide a lot of the latency, very efficient caching

759
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:51,420
algorithms, mixing flash types on a particular device,

760
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:56,000
and those kinds of things really solve

761
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,120
the problem for a lot of workloads,

762
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:01,320
but not the workloads where the companies are willing to pay

763
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,080
just obscene amounts of money.

764
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,760
And so I think that is one place where ZFS could improve

765
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:09,900
a whole lot is much more intelligent caching

766
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,080
for some of those workloads.

767
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:14,280
I mean, you get the ZIL and the L2 arc,

768
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,600
but it's still the case that just adding

769
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,760
a whole bunch more memory is generally

770
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:23,280
better than more L2 arc.

771
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:27,600
And so we're in a situation now where you can get Optane

772
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,740
or as a DIMM.

773
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:32,520
So you're literally, quote unquote, adding more RAM.

774
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,920
Or you can get Optane as a storage device,

775
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:38,160
and then you're adding RAM on disk.

776
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:41,880
I'm seeing videos where people are building entirely

777
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,000
flash-based servers now.

778
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,440
So the actual storage array is as fast now

779
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,040
as the caches used to be.

780
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,040
Yeah.

781
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,160
Which is insane.

782
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,160
Yeah, some of that, especially for video editing,

783
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,640
the random scrub ability is really good.

784
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:59,320
Although my little setup with its scrappy NAND flash

785
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:02,440
and 128 gigs of memory and spinning rust

786
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:05,720
with an intelligent and tiering cache policy,

787
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:08,440
I would put up against a lot of those flash servers.

788
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,960
A lot of the flash servers, especially the DIY servers,

789
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,160
like the jellyfish all flash server, for example,

790
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:17,280
I think that the software is just too dumb.

791
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:20,120
Because my old school NetApp disk

792
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:23,280
shelves with an intelligent tiering system for video

793
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:26,960
editing will match the performance of an all flash

794
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,040
storage while being orders of magnitude less expensive

795
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,120
for bulk storage.

796
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,800
Is that custom software they designed to figure that out?

797
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:37,080
No, I think a lot of the enterprise software

798
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,880
for tiered storage has already solved this problem

799
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,520
a long time ago.

800
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,680
We just haven't seen anybody apply it in this space.

801
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:45,360
I'm working with the Inmodus guys

802
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,880
to try to figure out a way we can demonstrate it.

803
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,840
Because the Inmodus product on Linux is actually quite good.

804
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,920
You can go in and tag files and be like,

805
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,960
this is part of the fast tier, this is part of the fast tier,

806
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,560
this is part of the fast tier.

807
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,680
And it'll do it.

808
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,640
So if you combine, like for a video editor,

809
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,960
if you combine your video ingest workload

810
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:06,040
with a little bit shell scripting, basically.

811
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,920
So I'm going to ingest videos from the camera.

812
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,360
It's like, oh, we probably need those

813
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,840
to be part of the fast tier.

814
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,200
And then you look at A time, and it's like, oh,

815
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,800
those probably should definitely be part of the fast tier.

816
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,200
Or you just give an editor control.

817
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,560
Like an editor can go create an empty text file in a folder

818
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:23,000
to be like, make this project hot.

819
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,760
And then you do that on a Friday, and you come in Monday,

820
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,480
and the system will have automatically,

821
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,680
it's like, oh, I need to make everything in this folder part

822
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,280
of the fast tier, and just do it.

823
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,560
That's like five lines of shell scripting.

824
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:36,800
But I'm 100% sure that that is going

825
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:40,080
to be as fast as a quote unquote all flash storage solution.

826
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,200
Interesting.

827
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,160
That makes a huge difference, it sounds like.

828
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,560
That is really cool.

829
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,440
So I've seen stuff like that.

830
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:49,800
My day job is working with OpenShift, a Kubernetes

831
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,160
enterprise distro.

832
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,680
And I see a lot of stuff in there around storage classes,

833
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:58,440
about how you can specify a flash array for this workload

834
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,720
and a spinning.

835
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:02,760
So this sounds like a really poor man's version.

836
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,720
Well, not necessarily poor man's, but yeah,

837
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,760
if it works, great.

838
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,360
Yeah, you can do it at the individual folder level, too,

839
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,280
which is really cool.

840
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,240
I want to implement some of this stuff for my Proxmox setup

841
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:17,760
now, so we'll have to share a Git repo or something.

842
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,320
It would be a lot of fun, yeah.

843
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,960
So I wanted to shift gears a little bit

844
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,000
and talk maybe a bit more about younger Wendell,

845
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,840
if that's OK.

846
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:27,680
I'm interested to know a little bit about what

847
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:30,640
got you interested in technology in the first place.

848
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,440
What was your first, can you remember,

849
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:35,200
what was your first computer?

850
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:41,120
It was probably a LaserPow 8086, or possibly

851
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,280
a Tandy 286.

852
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,960
So the LaserPow was like a Luggable,

853
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:51,000
and the Tandy was like a business machine,

854
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,600
but it had problems.

855
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,920
It needed to be repaired.

856
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,760
And so the thing that you have to understand

857
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:02,280
is where I grew up was super poor and 10 years in the past.

858
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:05,800
So a lot of the technology, I have fond memories

859
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:12,240
of the IBM XT, and the PC6300, and the AT&T PC6300,

860
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:16,840
which is really amazing, and the Tandy TL2, and even the TRS-80.

861
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,440
But a lot of these computers were not

862
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:22,920
current when I was using them, because a lot of businesses

863
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,760
would donate the, there were still tax loopholes.

864
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,560
And so it's like their garbage computers

865
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:30,480
would end up in poor schools and in the poorer

866
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,760
parts of the country.

867
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,520
And so I got to play with a lot of that stuff,

868
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,600
but also because it was garbage, I

869
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:40,160
wasn't afraid to tinker with it and break it worse.

870
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,880
But more often than not, I could actually fix it.

871
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,560
So there was a guy that ran a junk store,

872
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:49,000
and he knew that I had a knack for fixing things.

873
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Not just computers, but other stuff.

874
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,880
And so he had somebody come and pick me up every weekend

875
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,520
and in summers and would bring me to the junk store.

876
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:00,080
And so I would work on fixing stuff at the junk store.

877
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,760
So he would buy the return truck from Sears.

878
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,640
You know the thing on Amazon now that's really popular?

879
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,920
It's like, oh, I bought $1,000.

880
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,640
They're just random returns from Amazon.

881
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:13,240
So you used to do that in the late 80s, early 90s.

882
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:16,560
You would do that tractor trailer at a time with Sears,

883
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,800
and you'd bid on it.

884
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,560
And so he would do that, and then there

885
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,800
would invariably be random technology on there.

886
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,800
And it's like, oh, look, I fixed this fax machine.

887
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,800
And he's like, great, let's sell it at the junk store.

888
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,200
He's like, oh, look, I fixed this other thing.

889
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,500
And it's like, oh, yeah, let's sell it at the junk store.

890
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:34,320
So between that and the school stuff, it was a lot of fun,

891
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,240
learning how to fix the stuff and put it together

892
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,560
and that kind of thing.

893
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,680
I got that there was a Tandy that

894
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,520
had bad sectors on the hard drive.

895
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,840
And so if you just did a regular DOS install,

896
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,920
the DOS install would fail because it

897
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,360
was near the beginning of the disk,

898
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,920
but it wasn't at the very beginning of the disk.

899
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,720
And so I had to figure out how to low level format the thing,

900
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,440
and there was no manual for it.

901
00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:00,160
And it was just completely our local library had a book

902
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,600
called The Wyn Roche Hardware Bible, which had like,

903
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,080
I mean, I get a feel for the photographers.

904
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,280
It's like, you get the photographer for the book,

905
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,800
and this guy shows up.

906
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,840
And it's like, we need a super technical book

907
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:16,180
about component level repair, like the IBM PC XT.

908
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:19,120
And it's just like some old balding guy.

909
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,760
And it's like, OK, well, let's just

910
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,400
put a keyboard in their lap and take a picture of it.

911
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,520
And so that is the Wyn Roche Hardware Bible.

912
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:28,000
And so I carted that thing around for years.

913
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,960
Well, you'd love to get your hands on a copy of that again.

914
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:30,840
Still have it here somewhere.

915
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:31,360
Do you?

916
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:31,860
Yeah.

917
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:32,360
Good.

918
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,160
Good for you.

919
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,920
That's great, holding on to that kind of stuff.

920
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,920
That guy was clever to snatch you up.

921
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,160
Sounds like he made a good chunk of change off of you.

922
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,160
Yeah.

923
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:41,720
Yeah.

924
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,400
That was a lot of fun.

925
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,680
Later, I went to work for the company that fixed computers

926
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,840
for the school system.

927
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,120
So that was fun.

928
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,200
The thing that got their attention,

929
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,360
so IBM Model M keyboards, if you're really hard on them,

930
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,240
will develop a short in the cable.

931
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,200
So it's like foil wrapped.

932
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,200
I mean, typical IBM engineering, it's

933
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:07,760
like the rubberized plastic and then a hard plastic,

934
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,960
almost like a plastic bag plastic,

935
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,960
but the hard cellophane, and then foil,

936
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,680
and then individual wires.

937
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:19,160
And if you yank the cord, it will break the insulation

938
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:21,120
on the wires inside the foil.

939
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,280
And then they'll touch the foil and short out.

940
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,720
There's a green through-hole fuse

941
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:30,000
on the motherboard that will blow whenever

942
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,320
you have a keyboard that has that type of a short.

943
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,740
And so at a school, it's like, we

944
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:34,680
don't want to replace the keyboard.

945
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:35,880
This keyboard almost works.

946
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,040
And the keyboard will work as long

947
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,720
as the keyboard is in the right spot.

948
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,000
And then it mysteriously stops working.

949
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
And it's like, that's weird.

950
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,840
Let me try this keyboard on another computer.

951
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,920
It's like, oh, it's not working on this one either.

952
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,880
Now, both of those have a blown fuse.

953
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:50,920
So the replacement cost for a school that could not afford it

954
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,200
was like $900 for the motherboard.

955
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:53,840
Oh, my goodness.

956
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,080
And it was like, dude, we can just replace the fuse.

957
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:59,880
And they're like, one, if you're a student, what are you doing?

958
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:03,800
Two, OMG, WTF, BBQ.

959
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,600
And I was like, all right, well, just hire me.

960
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,680
Why can't I work for you?

961
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:09,640
And it was like lots of angry adults yelling at one another

962
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,600
and then like, all right, we're going to hire you.

963
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:14,000
Had a very similar experience in my school years.

964
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Very similar to that.

965
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,680
That's great.

966
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,800
The adults were very uncomfortable with it at first.

967
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,300
They didn't know what to do about this kid that

968
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:21,560
was coming around fixing stuff.

969
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,680
Very, very uncomfortable.

970
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,360
There were two of us at the school, so I had a cohort.

971
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:29,000
And he's doing really well and all the stuff that he's doing.

972
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:34,000
But the really amazing thing with that is we deployed Linux.

973
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,440
By the time I was a senior in high school, Linux was just bare.

974
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,680
It was like 0.92.

975
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,920
What was the job it was doing?

976
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,200
Network address translation.

977
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,280
That's what I had my Linux blacks do, and also a proxy server.

978
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,160
So the school had a token ring.

979
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:51,560
And the new computers that were coming in were Ethernet.

980
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:56,600
And so there was just no internet access on the school with Ethernet.

981
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:59,380
Yeah, I mean, Ethernet was, well, it was kind of dumb

982
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:01,680
because they were like, well, 16 meg is faster on paper.

983
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,640
So that's got to be better than 10 meg Ethernet.

984
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,760
And I was just like, what?

985
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,400
What?

986
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,560
No.

987
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,720
Me and the other student, between the two of us,

988
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:13,840
we sort of figured out how we could do IP translation between a network.

989
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,960
It was called IP masquerading at the time.

990
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:21,440
And so the Ethernet computers could get on the token ring network

991
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,840
through NAT, basically.

992
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:26,800
And that was a lot of fun.

993
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,440
That was a crazy amount of fun.

994
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:32,560
And the guy that was in charge of all of the technology for the entire state

995
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,800
came, and he's like, this is good.

996
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,200
What you've done, it's fine, but without annoyance.

997
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:42,720
But we can't have an unsupportable solution in schools.

998
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,760
It'll cost too much money.

999
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:47,520
No one here has any idea how this works except for you.

1000
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,360
And we can't do this.

1001
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,080
We have to buy the proper equipment.

1002
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,240
And it's like, all right, well, we can have a bake sale or something.

1003
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,000
What is the proper equipment to do this?

1004
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:55,960
And he explained what it was.

1005
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,080
And I was like, all right, how much is that?

1006
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:00,400
And he's like, well, I think the state has a contract for that for like $10,000.

1007
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,960
And I was like, $10,000?

1008
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:05,320
And I was like, if a couple of kids can do this with junk computers,

1009
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,860
don't you think it's worth your time to learn how to do this?

1010
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:12,280
Because you'd save $10,000 to school, and you've got a lot of schools.

1011
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,520
His ears turned red.

1012
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,440
Yeah, it's so funny.

1013
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:18,520
And so we had a situation where the schools were very, very excited

1014
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:21,560
to implement 802.11b, I think it was.

1015
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,680
It was two megabits.

1016
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:25,000
And that's how they did all of the interlinks between the schools.

1017
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,600
Because otherwise, they have to pay for lines from the telcos,

1018
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,960
which were just ridiculous.

1019
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,520
And when they put the whole wireless network in,

1020
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:33,080
nobody thought to segment up the different schools.

1021
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:35,280
So it was one flat network.

1022
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:35,780
Oh my god.

1023
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:36,720
What could go wrong?

1024
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,080
So like print jobs were routing through the central district building

1025
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:41,160
and back out to the schools over a two meg link.

1026
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:46,320
And so we built a series of Debian-based servers

1027
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,960
to essentially solve the problem.

1028
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,760
And Microsoft found out.

1029
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:53,680
This is back in the days of Monopoly.

1030
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,120
So they were rough players.

1031
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:58,620
And they assembled a meeting with the adults.

1032
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:00,520
And they came in playing hardball and said,

1033
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,560
we want you to use this thing.

1034
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:02,520
It's called NT5.

1035
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,920
It's in development right now.

1036
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,840
And it can do exactly what that Linux box is doing.

1037
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:10,320
You want us to put a beta in when this is working just fine?

1038
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,240
Yeah.

1039
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,840
It was a really interesting time.

1040
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:13,600
It was so early.

1041
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,560
It was the same story.

1042
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,640
It's an unsupportable product.

1043
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,200
And now it would be just totally normal.

1044
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,820
What's really funny is that all of those computers are IBM computers.

1045
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:26,680
And IBM has literally become the poster child of Linux support.

1046
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:29,960
Yeah, oh boy, there's some irony there too, huh?

1047
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:32,600
Something, something, red hat.

1048
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:36,800
Alex will say nothing for this segment of the show.

1049
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,560
Jeez.

1050
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,920
Yeah, really, when you look back at it like that,

1051
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,920
you did have to kind of fight some misconception.

1052
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,400
I don't know misconceptions is the right word.

1053
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,800
But you had to push through some of that.

1054
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,080
Yeah, they did eventually replace that system

1055
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:51,960
with a solution based on Microsoft proxy server.

1056
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,880
Was that on NT4 at the time?

1057
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,400
Probably.

1058
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,480
And it was garbage.

1059
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,800
It was unadulterated garbage.

1060
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,320
That's what they wanted us to use at first.

1061
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,980
And we said, no, it's too much garbage.

1062
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:01,700
We tried NT4 first.

1063
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:03,760
And then they're, OK, we'll use the beta, use NT5,

1064
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,080
which ended up being Windows 2000.

1065
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,200
They never even called it NT5.

1066
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,960
But back then, that's what they were calling it.

1067
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,880
The people, like the state level people,

1068
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:12,200
even came in to test it and oversee it

1069
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,560
and make sure everything went smooth with the replacement.

1070
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,080
And they had test systems set up side by side.

1071
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,680
And it was like, here's the old system.

1072
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,880
Look how much faster and better the new system is.

1073
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,120
And just loading web pages was dramatically slower.

1074
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,960
It was astonishingly slower.

1075
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,120
Yeah.

1076
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:29,320
Could you picture doing what you do now

1077
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,120
in that era of the internet?

1078
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,240
No.

1079
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,880
I would have probably gone to like,

1080
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,400
they would have had to put me away for homicide

1081
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,480
because it was just like, this is like the dumbest

1082
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,400
thing I've ever seen.

1083
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,080
Yeah.

1084
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:39,640
Yeah.

1085
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,600
We've lost our ability to think clearly.

1086
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,080
Yeah.

1087
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:45,800
It's pretty incredible that the internet enables you

1088
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,800
in quote unquote rural Kentucky to operate

1089
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,040
an internet-based business that you have,

1090
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,160
was it quarter of a million subscribers or something

1091
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:56,160
on YouTube these days?

1092
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,480
The technology really has changed the world.

1093
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,400
And I think humanity is only really just beginning

1094
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:05,520
to grasp what the internet's capable of with remote work.

1095
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:08,880
Well, Arthur C. Clarke said that, and not in this generation,

1096
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,720
but next generation, referring to us, I think,

1097
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:14,120
that probably in our lifetime, we

1098
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:18,120
will see a sea change reversal in the value of property.

1099
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:21,040
City property will become worth less than rural property

1100
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,440
because you could work anywhere.

1101
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,760
As long as you have a good link.

1102
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,320
Yeah.

1103
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:29,040
And I feel like that is also, that meta story

1104
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,560
is what is driving us to do this show now,

1105
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,600
is the home solutions, like you touched on,

1106
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,200
are as good as what Google can run in their data centers now.

1107
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:36,840
Yeah.

1108
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,120
That's mind blowing.

1109
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,280
Well, I mean, it's a question of resources.

1110
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:43,840
Like Google wants you to have the tiniest slice ever.

1111
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,520
I mean, like even a serverless slice.

1112
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,440
Like Amazon wants you to come up with a way

1113
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,880
to do everything serverlessly because their margin

1114
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,640
on the serverless thing is better even than EC2.

1115
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,120
And their margins are 100% on EC2.

1116
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,560
I mean, I've worked on some very large projects.

1117
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:03,120
And trying to figure out the Amazon cost to the business,

1118
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:05,480
when you've always got a background hum of customers,

1119
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,080
and then you have like the burstiness,

1120
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:09,640
and you're going to rely on Amazon for the burstiness,

1121
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:13,040
your costs on Amazon is 100% of what you would

1122
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,360
pay for bare metal hardware.

1123
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,480
The question is just optimizing the curve

1124
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:21,120
so that you're going to have a little bit overbuilt

1125
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,760
in for your local infrastructure.

1126
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:29,320
But for those things that are like two standard deviations

1127
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:32,160
away from average, then you can rely on Amazon.

1128
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,760
And it makes economic sense.

1129
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:37,240
And yeah, you're paying Amazon money hand over fist.

1130
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:39,880
But you didn't have to do the capital investment

1131
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:40,680
for the other part.

1132
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,280
So it probably makes sense.

1133
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,840
And I think that's Amazon's, or I think

1134
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,240
that's even Netflix's model.

1135
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,000
That is the thing.

1136
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:46,880
It's a CapEx.

1137
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,840
It's not CapEx.

1138
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:48,800
It's OpEx.

1139
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,760
So people can write it off every quarter instead

1140
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:53,280
of one big chunk up front.

1141
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,780
And I've actually managed to get quite a lot of traction

1142
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:58,840
with C-level people with that kind of math

1143
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:01,080
and say to them, look, it's going to save you money.

1144
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,960
You can write this off every quarter instead.

1145
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:06,080
So just before we sat down, Wendell,

1146
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:08,520
you mentioned something about Eric S. Raymond having

1147
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:12,440
an invitation-only basement that he can do hacker projects in.

1148
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:15,680
Yeah, this is always something that's really fascinating.

1149
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:18,800
And something I've been on the lookout for real estate-wise

1150
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,600
is I'm not in a position to do it now.

1151
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:25,160
But he always tells us stories about people

1152
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:28,640
that have come to stay with him and not really exactly

1153
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:31,240
mentors, but people that would be

1154
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:34,760
able to work on their projects in his basement.

1155
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,560
So his basement is basically a separate apartment.

1156
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:40,200
But you have access to Eric Raymond upstairs.

1157
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,240
So it's like, I want to work on this thing,

1158
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:45,160
or I want to learn about this thing, or I want to do whatever.

1159
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:48,680
So it's a really sort of fascinating situation.

1160
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:50,360
It's like a little mini maker's lab

1161
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,080
with Eric Raymond upstairs.

1162
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,080
Yeah, yeah.

1163
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:56,680
I mean, that kind of thing is just fascinating.

1164
00:42:56,680 --> 00:43:01,480
So that kind of thing might work really well in terms

1165
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:03,760
of doing some other stuff.

1166
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,340
Well, before we go, Wendell, we should

1167
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:06,640
do the obligatory pluggy plugs.

1168
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,000
I bet everybody knows where to find you,

1169
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,360
but where should we send people?

1170
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:12,520
Level in the number one text.com.

1171
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:14,680
And then you can get to Twitter or the YouTube channel

1172
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:15,720
or wherever from there.

1173
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:16,880
I mean, it doesn't really matter.

1174
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:19,440
You can just Google level one Wendell, and it's fine.

1175
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,240
It works.

1176
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,800
I've tested that.

1177
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,520
That's Tech Wendell on Twitter, I believe.

1178
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:24,280
Yes, yes.

1179
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:25,920
We'll put a link to that in the show notes as well.

1180
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:26,560
Yeah.

1181
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,360
Wendell, thanks not only for joining us,

1182
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:29,440
but thanks for hosting us, too.

1183
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,480
It's been a great tour.

1184
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:30,880
Oh, no worries.

1185
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:31,520
It's been interesting.

1186
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,160
I hope it was worth the eight-hour drive.

1187
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:34,080
I mean, ehh.

1188
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:35,760
Well, thanks to the snake, it was.

1189
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:36,440
The snake was.

1190
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:37,400
The snake made it all.

1191
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:37,960
Yeah.

1192
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,520
Oh, you haven't seen Rule.

1193
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,560
We could go about three hours off the beaten path,

1194
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:43,200
and then you'll be like, holy smokes.

1195
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:43,720
Really?

1196
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:44,000
Yeah.

1197
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:44,640
Could that be something?

1198
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:45,360
It's scary.

1199
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:49,680
Well, you can find us on Twitter at self-hostedshow.

1200
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,520
Chris is at chrislas.

1201
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:52,120
Thank you, sir.

1202
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:52,760
What about you?

1203
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:55,780
And I'm there on Twitter with at ironicbadger.

1204
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:57,680
And don't forget to send us your show questions.

1205
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:00,080
We'll get those into the show soon when we're done traveling.

1206
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:02,560
Hashtag ask SSH.

1207
