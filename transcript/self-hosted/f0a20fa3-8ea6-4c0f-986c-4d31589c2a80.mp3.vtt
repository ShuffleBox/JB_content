00:00.000 --> 00:04.400
One of the cornerstones of our collective worlds as self-hosters is storage.

00:04.400 --> 00:07.120
Hard drives, let's face it, are evil.

00:07.120 --> 00:11.280
So today, we have the CTO of UnRAID, John Panazzo, joining us.

00:11.280 --> 00:16.880
UnRAID was my gateway to Linux back in 2012, and it's got an absolutely incredible community behind it,

00:16.880 --> 00:21.360
whilst also being one of the easiest ways to store and own your data.

00:21.360 --> 00:24.320
John takes us through the excitement of discovering Docker,

00:24.320 --> 00:29.760
what it was like to be featured online as Tech Tips, and the future of UnRAID itself.

00:29.760 --> 00:32.320
First, though, a quick bit of housekeeping.

00:32.320 --> 00:39.200
Last episode, we mentioned a group buy for a DIY open-source open hardware energy monitor for about $20.

00:39.200 --> 00:42.400
You know, the one based around the Raspberry Pi.

00:42.400 --> 00:47.840
We'll be doing a larger roundup of energy monitoring options in the next episode, that'll be number 26,

00:47.840 --> 00:52.160
but I wanted to let you know that the group buy looks like it's going to be going ahead.

00:52.160 --> 00:57.040
We've definitely got enough orders for the US and the EU, that includes the UK,

00:57.040 --> 01:00.640
and for our friends down under, unfortunately, we're not quite there yet.

01:00.640 --> 01:06.480
So, if you are interested, please register using the Google Form link in the show notes.

01:06.480 --> 01:10.400
This also applies if you emailed us or posted on Twitter.

01:10.400 --> 01:15.760
The form is what we'll be using now, as the response was so much larger than anticipated,

01:15.760 --> 01:19.360
and it was spread across, I don't know, like five or six different places.

01:19.360 --> 01:26.240
So please, if you are in doubt, put your name in the form and we'll record you as being interested.

01:26.240 --> 01:32.000
We'll leave the form open until the end of August and then be in touch for the next steps in September.

01:32.000 --> 01:37.120
Let's get you to our interview with Unraid's Jon Panotso.

01:37.120 --> 01:39.760
Jon, welcome to Self Hosted. It's good to have you here.

01:39.760 --> 01:41.040
Thanks. It's good to be here.

01:41.040 --> 01:45.440
So, I know we have tons of questions for you and just full disclosure,

01:45.440 --> 01:48.000
Alex is quite familiar with Unraid and I'm the noob.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.640
So, I'll be playing the noob, as always, it seems, these days on this episode.

01:52.640 --> 01:55.440
So, let's just start with people who aren't familiar with what is Unraid

01:55.440 --> 01:56.800
and who would you say it's for?

01:56.800 --> 02:01.680
So, Unraid is a server operating system that was built by Lime Tech back in 2005

02:01.680 --> 02:05.920
and it's predominantly for personal home media enthusiasts,

02:05.920 --> 02:08.160
people that want to build their own home media server

02:08.160 --> 02:12.160
to store all their personal digital media along most other content.

02:12.160 --> 02:16.320
And we've been basically building it out over the last several years.

02:16.320 --> 02:20.160
So, originally, it started off as just a NAS platform, pure storage play.

02:20.160 --> 02:25.280
And then with Unraid 6, we kind of completely modernized the OS and expanded its capabilities.

02:25.280 --> 02:29.120
So, what used to be known as a NAS OS is now a full blown server platform.

02:29.120 --> 02:33.760
And to us, the server platform really makes sense because storage is one aspect.

02:33.760 --> 02:36.160
The next aspect is running applications on that server

02:36.160 --> 02:37.600
and the third is running virtual machines.

02:37.600 --> 02:41.760
So, we pretty much have expanded it to be the full gamut of what a traditional server can do.

02:41.760 --> 02:44.720
I noticed your pricing structure is essentially

02:44.720 --> 02:47.760
tiered around the amount of attached storage.

02:47.760 --> 02:51.040
Do your customers tend to be either on the lower end or on the very extreme high end

02:51.040 --> 02:52.880
or is there a good in between?

02:52.880 --> 02:56.720
You'd be surprised. You know, obviously, there's a lot more people out there

02:56.720 --> 03:00.640
with six or less devices than there are with people that have 25.

03:01.200 --> 03:02.560
That's just logical.

03:02.560 --> 03:05.120
But we actually have a pretty good spread.

03:05.840 --> 03:09.520
And there are plenty of folks out there that just buy the top tier

03:09.520 --> 03:12.640
knowing that eventually I'm going to have that many storage devices.

03:12.640 --> 03:17.440
So, yeah, you'd be surprised how many people opt for Plus and Pro over Basic.

03:17.440 --> 03:22.480
I'm kind of curious how the forest fire that has been 2020 has affected Unraid.

03:22.480 --> 03:24.480
Has there been a notable change in business?

03:24.480 --> 03:30.000
And are you guys eyeballing maybe long term something like a subscription model?

03:30.000 --> 03:34.000
So, I can definitely tell you that with everything going on with coronavirus and whatnot,

03:34.000 --> 03:36.080
believe it or not, that's not hurt us at all.

03:36.880 --> 03:40.640
I think if anything, not that I'm happy that this has happened,

03:40.640 --> 03:45.440
but it has definitely helped business growth only because there's more people at home now.

03:45.440 --> 03:47.760
And what do you do as an IT person that's at home

03:47.760 --> 03:49.200
or somebody who's a tech enthusiast at home?

03:49.200 --> 03:50.160
You tinker.

03:50.160 --> 03:54.000
And very likely those people are going to somehow or another come across Unraid.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.400
So, we've not been negatively impacted.

03:56.400 --> 03:58.400
And we don't have brick and mortar offices.

03:58.400 --> 04:01.600
We're completely remote team with people all over the world.

04:01.600 --> 04:05.840
So, if anything, it's kind of helped out because we've been able to hire some more people this

04:05.840 --> 04:08.960
year and help some people out in some bad situations.

04:08.960 --> 04:11.280
So, it's been great.

04:11.280 --> 04:13.520
I think 2020 is going to be a banner year for us.

04:13.520 --> 04:14.880
That's really great news.

04:14.880 --> 04:19.920
I'm not sure I fully appreciate the implications of being a nerd stuck at home

04:19.920 --> 04:20.800
means I tinker more.

04:21.360 --> 04:22.400
I mean, it's definitely true.

04:23.280 --> 04:24.240
Definitely true.

04:24.240 --> 04:25.280
Hey, I know I do.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.520
Yeah, no, it's totally true.

04:27.520 --> 04:28.400
It's a thing.

04:28.400 --> 04:30.960
So, yeah, I mean, it's always a tricky balance, isn't it?

04:30.960 --> 04:37.120
Building a sustainable business model on one-time license purchases versus say the

04:37.120 --> 04:44.080
Netflix model of, or more accurately, I suppose, the Adobe model of purchasing software over time.

04:44.880 --> 04:49.520
And particularly with Unraid, given that the lifespan of a license purchase could be

04:49.520 --> 04:54.400
a decade or two, you know, I pay my 60 bucks once and then that's it for,

04:54.960 --> 04:57.280
you know, Limetech season doesn't see another dime of that.

04:57.280 --> 05:02.000
And just to reiterate Chris's question, I was wondering if there were any plans for

05:02.000 --> 05:03.280
subscriptions moving forward.

05:03.920 --> 05:08.400
Yes, I can't get into all the details on how that's going to work, but we have very

05:08.400 --> 05:13.840
much been looking into building other options that you can use with Unraid.

05:13.840 --> 05:15.840
So, there's two ways to look at that question.

05:15.840 --> 05:19.600
The one is, are we going to launch some kind of subscription service?

05:19.600 --> 05:23.200
And the second is, how does that affect the current licensing model?

05:24.000 --> 05:27.600
And so, we are working on options for both of those.

05:28.240 --> 05:34.320
So, one model would be something that you can pay to extend the value of Unraid.

05:34.320 --> 05:38.640
So, you still have your registration key or some type of license that validates your ownership

05:38.640 --> 05:42.960
of the product, but then we offer services that complement the product that are optional

05:42.960 --> 05:43.520
to purchase.

05:43.520 --> 05:45.440
The other is an online license key.

05:45.440 --> 05:48.320
And this is something that we've wanted to do for some time.

05:48.320 --> 05:52.160
When Unraid was started, when this whole business was started back in 05, you know,

05:52.160 --> 05:58.080
Tom Mortensen, our CEO, he built this as kind of a pet project and it was nothing more than

05:58.080 --> 05:58.560
beer money.

05:58.560 --> 06:02.080
It was, hey, there's a problem, I can solve that problem.

06:02.080 --> 06:05.760
There's not a lot of people other than me that are looking or interested to solve that

06:05.760 --> 06:08.080
problem, so I'll do it and I'll release it.

06:08.080 --> 06:14.320
And literally, he just went to avsforum.com, created a post in there, said, hey, I'm a

06:14.320 --> 06:16.400
guy, I made something, check it out.

06:16.400 --> 06:19.440
And just from that, the whole business kind of exploded.

06:19.440 --> 06:23.680
Now, for a very long time, it was still just a beer money business and Tom was the only

06:24.400 --> 06:26.160
main employee, the only employee at all.

06:27.040 --> 06:31.040
But then it started to grow and it got to the point where he wanted to do something

06:31.040 --> 06:33.440
major and it happened to coincide with timing for me.

06:33.440 --> 06:38.320
That's how I joined the company and I reached out to Tom and we started having conversations

06:38.320 --> 06:40.720
about what could we do to really blow this thing up.

06:41.360 --> 06:45.760
And years later, here we are and we're looking at sales, we're looking at how licensing works

06:45.760 --> 06:47.680
and you hit the nail on the head.

06:48.400 --> 06:55.760
From a business model standpoint, it's untenable to not have any customer rebuys or repurchase

06:55.760 --> 06:58.400
or anything like that, but we've made it work.

06:58.400 --> 07:01.040
We've made it work and we've grown doing it.

07:01.040 --> 07:04.400
Our monthly sales revenue is over 10X what it was several years ago.

07:04.400 --> 07:10.640
So we're doing great, but we know that there's a shelf life out there for how long that kind

07:10.640 --> 07:11.520
of model will last.

07:12.240 --> 07:17.120
So we are working on both of those options to give people another way to contribute back

07:17.120 --> 07:19.520
to Unraid and also get some more value out of it.

07:19.520 --> 07:20.960
That's a great story.

07:20.960 --> 07:22.000
I love that origin.

07:22.720 --> 07:27.840
I'm kind of curious right now, do you see one of the big drivers of new business people

07:27.840 --> 07:33.440
discovering Unraid applications that they want to run on their LAN or is it storage?

07:34.000 --> 07:39.360
The reason that I'm asking that is I wonder how cloud storage plays in this, say somebody

07:39.360 --> 07:44.080
like Backblaze who can come along and offer reasonable rates for storage and Wasabi and

07:44.080 --> 07:50.160
others, does that apply a certain kind of market pressure to you or is there an offset

07:50.160 --> 07:52.880
by people hosting applications like Plex?

07:52.880 --> 07:55.920
I don't think that any cloud storage has any pressure on us at all.

07:55.920 --> 08:00.000
I mean, people were saying, oh, Netflix is going to kill Unraid and it's not.

08:00.000 --> 08:05.200
Like there's the people out there that want an Unraid server, they don't care about any

08:05.200 --> 08:06.320
of those outside factors.

08:06.320 --> 08:09.200
And there's a lot of folks out there that, you know, cloud's great.

08:09.200 --> 08:10.960
I have nothing against cloud.

08:10.960 --> 08:13.520
I think it's a great technology for the right use cases.

08:13.520 --> 08:17.040
But there are plenty of use cases that cloud is not the right technology.

08:17.040 --> 08:20.640
And I'll tell you right now, when your power goes out or your internet goes out for any

08:20.640 --> 08:23.440
extended period of time, especially if your internet goes out for any extended period

08:23.440 --> 08:29.280
of time, you'll learn how quickly you miss DVDs or Blu-rays or any method of playing

08:29.280 --> 08:31.680
media content that doesn't require an internet connection.

08:31.680 --> 08:32.560
That's true.

08:32.560 --> 08:33.040
Very true.

08:33.600 --> 08:36.000
I've gone to a lot of lengths to solve that problem.

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
And also you can't beat, honestly, you just can't beat the cost difference between a lot

08:40.000 --> 08:42.480
of local storage versus the same amount in the cloud.

08:42.480 --> 08:43.120
Of course not.

08:43.120 --> 08:45.520
I mean, we just went through a pricing model recently.

08:45.520 --> 08:49.520
We were kind of just looking at options for what we could do with cloud tech.

08:49.520 --> 08:52.560
And I'm like, well, what would it take to run an Unraid server in the cloud?

08:52.560 --> 08:56.400
And when I just did, I mean, granted, this is still a research project undergoing, but

08:56.400 --> 09:01.520
like with Amazon, oh my God, I almost choked at how much money it would have cost to just

09:01.520 --> 09:02.560
run an instance in the cloud.

09:02.560 --> 09:05.920
Because it's not like, oh, well, my compute use is just low and I'm only going to have

09:05.920 --> 09:08.800
to spin that VM up when I need to access an application.

09:08.800 --> 09:11.360
No, if you're going to run it in the cloud, you've got to run it in the cloud.

09:11.360 --> 09:14.640
It has to be always on, always available, ready at the fingertip.

09:14.640 --> 09:18.480
And so that's a minimum amount of compute resource that you have to dedicate budget

09:18.480 --> 09:19.040
towards.

09:19.040 --> 09:23.120
And then when you look at storage costs in Amazon, I mean, don't get me wrong, if you're

09:23.120 --> 09:26.720
running a website or a business off the cloud, Amazon's great.

09:26.720 --> 09:30.800
But when you're as a consumer and you're thinking about, well, I need a media server or I need

09:30.800 --> 09:34.240
a home server, personal server, and I could run that in the cloud or I could run it on

09:34.240 --> 09:36.240
prem, what's the difference in cost?

09:36.240 --> 09:39.520
You look at the hosting model and you're like, in less than a year, I can pay for this and

09:39.520 --> 09:40.480
build it in my house.

09:40.480 --> 09:41.680
It's those transit costs.

09:41.680 --> 09:42.720
That's how they get you.

09:42.720 --> 09:45.760
Yeah, it's bandwidth and storage.

09:45.760 --> 09:46.800
That's the real killer.

09:46.800 --> 09:51.360
The CPU, the compute resources and all that stuff, that does add up, but it's fixed.

09:52.080 --> 09:53.040
You know it's predictable.

09:53.040 --> 09:53.520
It's fixed.

09:53.520 --> 09:54.320
It's not going to grow.

09:54.320 --> 09:55.040
It's not going to change.

09:55.040 --> 09:56.640
It's pretty much going to remain the same.

09:56.640 --> 09:59.840
Your storage is always going to go up and your bandwidth is always going to go up.

09:59.840 --> 10:03.360
So it's a matter of time before the price model just doesn't make sense.

10:04.080 --> 10:04.960
I agree totally.

10:05.520 --> 10:11.840
I made that same calculation myself a couple of years ago when I emigrated and built a

10:11.840 --> 10:13.440
$2,500 server.

10:13.440 --> 10:18.240
You think, okay, well, that's a lot of Netflix, but at the same time, I've got full control

10:18.240 --> 10:22.240
over what's on this box in my basement and I always will.

10:22.240 --> 10:24.800
So that's the rationale I go through.

10:24.800 --> 10:26.080
There's more to it than just that too.

10:26.880 --> 10:28.720
Alright, let's talk Google for a minute.

10:28.720 --> 10:29.840
So I'm a big Android guy.

10:30.400 --> 10:33.760
My wife's an Apple person and I'm an Android person, so you can imagine the fun technology

10:33.760 --> 10:34.880
conversations we have at home.

10:36.480 --> 10:38.960
The best part about that is whenever she asks me for help, I'd be like, well, I don't know.

10:38.960 --> 10:40.160
I don't use Apple.

10:40.160 --> 10:43.360
So that's the one time I can play dumb as a tech person and be like, I think you might

10:43.360 --> 10:44.560
have to call Apple.

10:44.560 --> 10:48.240
But one of the things that I have noticed, and this applies to both of those platforms,

10:48.880 --> 10:50.480
definitely with my Android phone.

10:50.480 --> 10:55.440
I guess maybe I have to verify with Apple, but with Android for sure, when you take pictures

10:55.440 --> 10:59.040
on an Android device and they go to Google's cloud, you think, oh, that's great, right?

10:59.040 --> 11:01.440
And I bought this really nice phone that's got this really nice camera.

11:01.440 --> 11:03.760
It's taking these really nice high fidelity pictures.

11:03.760 --> 11:08.080
Yet after a while, once it's no longer cached on your phone and you go back to look at that

11:08.080 --> 11:10.240
picture again, it's not quite as crisp, not quite as clear.

11:10.240 --> 11:14.240
And it's because they apply compression and they lower the image quality.

11:14.240 --> 11:17.520
That really, honestly, the first time I noticed that, it really pissed me off.

11:17.520 --> 11:19.200
Because as a customer, I feel cheated.

11:19.200 --> 11:23.120
I feel like I bought a device that was capable of taking really high quality pictures.

11:23.760 --> 11:27.520
And you gave me a service that complements that device to store those pictures online,

11:27.520 --> 11:28.320
which I think is great.

11:29.120 --> 11:33.680
But then without notifying me and without, and whether you notice me or not, it doesn't

11:33.680 --> 11:34.400
really matter.

11:34.400 --> 11:37.600
You degraded the quality of those pictures and I don't like that.

11:37.600 --> 11:42.240
So having the local storage where you can protect the original quality and fidelity

11:42.240 --> 11:47.760
of the content that you're capturing and creating, it's one thing if it's a movie or a TV show

11:47.760 --> 11:50.720
or whatever, something that I download from the internet, that's one thing.

11:50.720 --> 11:54.720
But when it's my kids' pictures and I go look at it years later and it's all pixelated

11:54.720 --> 11:59.280
because Google applied some compression to it, and that's even worse when it's years

11:59.280 --> 12:03.200
down the road and the camera that I originally used was already low quality and now you're

12:03.200 --> 12:04.560
compressing it even further.

12:04.560 --> 12:06.720
It just makes for not a good experience.

12:06.720 --> 12:11.840
So having local storage to protect your stuff, I think that's actually going to become more

12:11.840 --> 12:12.640
and more important.

12:12.640 --> 12:14.640
You only get one chance at those photographs.

12:14.640 --> 12:16.400
Yes, very, very important stuff.

12:16.400 --> 12:20.480
So all right, let's talk a little bit about the future.

12:20.480 --> 12:24.800
We're high up in the version six release cycle of Unraid now.

12:25.440 --> 12:27.440
It's your 15th birthday soon.

12:27.440 --> 12:29.600
Is version seven on the horizon?

12:30.800 --> 12:33.360
Can't get into any details about what seven might look like.

12:33.360 --> 12:38.880
I'll tell you right now that we've had maybe a handful of conversations speculating on,

12:38.880 --> 12:40.000
well, what could seven be?

12:41.040 --> 12:42.320
What could go in there?

12:42.880 --> 12:45.440
We're not yet actively developing version seven.

12:47.040 --> 12:49.120
There's still plenty of life left in the six tree.

12:49.840 --> 12:51.680
Six nine's about to go stable.

12:51.680 --> 12:54.160
It's currently available for public testing.

12:54.160 --> 12:54.800
It's in beta.

12:55.920 --> 12:59.920
And we already have a 6.10 roadmap that's being worked on.

12:59.920 --> 13:04.080
But beyond the six series, I can't really comment on what seven would be.

13:04.080 --> 13:08.320
But I can tell you that I definitely have things in my mind that I want.

13:09.200 --> 13:11.520
And eventually, I think we're going to get there.

13:11.520 --> 13:12.640
I think we're going to get there.

13:12.640 --> 13:13.200
I wish I could.

13:13.200 --> 13:15.040
I really wish you could hear it in my voice.

13:15.040 --> 13:16.080
That's a pretty good tease.

13:17.200 --> 13:20.960
I really want to talk about what I'd love to have happen.

13:20.960 --> 13:24.640
But it's just too early to get into those details.

13:24.640 --> 13:26.800
And I don't want to get beat up over it.

13:27.760 --> 13:28.400
That's cool, man.

13:28.400 --> 13:29.120
That's no problem.

13:29.120 --> 13:33.920
So what are you excited about in 6.8 or 6.9 next?

13:33.920 --> 13:36.320
6.9 is the next main release.

13:36.320 --> 13:38.000
And then after that, we have 6.10.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.440
So 6.9 is going to be awesome.

13:40.000 --> 13:43.920
Multi-pool support has been something that we've been working on for a while now.

13:43.920 --> 13:45.840
And 6.9 is going to bring it to bear.

13:46.320 --> 13:50.400
And I just actually, so this was perfect timing because Tom's like, hey,

13:50.400 --> 13:51.920
we're going to add this new feature.

13:51.920 --> 13:53.280
It's going to be multiple cache pools.

13:53.840 --> 13:57.040
And we're going to roll it out in 6.9.

13:57.040 --> 13:59.920
And right around the time that he started talking about doing that,

13:59.920 --> 14:04.160
my cache pool was actually filling up my personal system at home.

14:04.160 --> 14:07.760
And I'm like, you know, this is a great time to test out this new feature.

14:07.760 --> 14:11.840
So this last week, actually, I went through and created a new cache pool,

14:11.840 --> 14:14.960
put brand new SSDs in, got it formatted.

14:14.960 --> 14:18.560
And then I stopped all my services, stopped Docker, stopped VM Manager,

14:18.560 --> 14:23.840
and copied the bulk of my cache, my original cache, onto the new pool.

14:23.840 --> 14:27.200
And then I did a new config operation so that I could make the new pool,

14:27.200 --> 14:29.920
my default cache pool, and just replace my old pool.

14:29.920 --> 14:33.600
John, as an UnRAID newbie, can I ask you, what is a cache pool?

14:33.600 --> 14:37.360
So UnRAID operates with two main storage pools in mind.

14:37.360 --> 14:39.840
The first is the array and the second is the cache.

14:39.840 --> 14:42.160
So the array, the idea is that's where you put your hard drives.

14:42.160 --> 14:45.520
So you have at least one, but you can have up to two parity disks.

14:45.520 --> 14:48.720
And then the remainder can be just standard data disks.

14:48.720 --> 14:51.360
And they can be of different sizes, speeds, brands, protocols.

14:51.360 --> 14:54.320
Brands, protocols, that's one of the big hallmarks of UnRAID.

14:55.200 --> 14:57.840
And then that's where you put all of your long-term storage data, right?

14:57.840 --> 15:00.160
And that's where all your media content goes.

15:00.160 --> 15:02.560
Everything that you want to store long-term goes there.

15:02.560 --> 15:05.600
But the downside is that hard drives can be slow.

15:06.720 --> 15:09.520
You might not be able to fully saturate network performance

15:09.520 --> 15:11.680
using right operations to the array.

15:11.680 --> 15:13.440
So we created something called the cache.

15:13.440 --> 15:17.440
And the cache is nothing more than another grouping of devices

15:17.440 --> 15:20.000
that manages storage a little bit differently than the array.

15:20.000 --> 15:24.640
So the array, we have up to two dedicated parity disks and the rest are data.

15:25.200 --> 15:27.040
And because of those dedicated parity disks,

15:27.040 --> 15:30.320
that means there's no striping happening across the data disks in the array

15:30.320 --> 15:31.600
that has a performance impact.

15:31.600 --> 15:34.720
Whereas the cache pool, we actually currently use ButterFS.

15:34.720 --> 15:37.200
We can talk about a new file system option there in a minute.

15:38.000 --> 15:41.120
And ButterFS allows you to group many different devices,

15:41.120 --> 15:43.920
also of different size, species, speeds, brands, protocols.

15:44.720 --> 15:46.400
But it does it in a RAID 1 formation.

15:46.400 --> 15:51.120
Now, for anybody that hears RAID 1, they usually have a very fixed image

15:51.120 --> 15:52.240
in their head of what that means.

15:52.240 --> 15:55.840
But in ButterFS world, you can have more than two devices in a RAID 1.

15:55.840 --> 16:00.000
All it means is that every time a bit gets written to that disk pool,

16:00.000 --> 16:01.440
it's going to make sure that bit gets written

16:01.440 --> 16:02.960
to two different devices that are in the pool.

16:02.960 --> 16:03.760
That's all.

16:03.760 --> 16:04.880
Did you hear that, Chris?

16:04.880 --> 16:05.680
ButterFS?

16:05.680 --> 16:07.040
The ButterFS part?

16:07.040 --> 16:09.280
Yeah, Chris is all in on ButterFS these days.

16:09.280 --> 16:11.200
I do like me some butter these days.

16:11.200 --> 16:12.160
ButterFS is great.

16:12.160 --> 16:17.040
There's still some outlying issues with ButterFS that are sometimes a struggle.

16:17.040 --> 16:19.280
And it just feels like the project that never ends.

16:20.080 --> 16:22.560
But I still like it a lot.

16:22.560 --> 16:25.040
I just don't trust RAID 5 and 6 totally yet.

16:25.840 --> 16:28.240
But RAID 1 and 10 are great.

16:28.240 --> 16:32.320
And so for operating a cache pool, which, again, the purpose of the cache pool

16:32.320 --> 16:36.560
is to act as a cache, which for those that I would imagine most people that are listening

16:36.560 --> 16:37.280
know what that is.

16:37.280 --> 16:40.000
But if they don't, it's just a temporary repository for data.

16:40.000 --> 16:43.200
And that's faster than your long-term storage repository.

16:43.200 --> 16:47.520
So when you write data to a share in unRAID, if the share is cache enabled,

16:47.520 --> 16:50.160
then the data actually gets written to the cache pool first,

16:50.160 --> 16:53.440
and then it gets moved to the array on a schedule that you define.

16:53.440 --> 16:55.680
So right now, it's by default at 3.40 AM.

16:56.320 --> 17:00.000
So the cache is great because it can make real-time write operations

17:00.000 --> 17:03.440
appear to be a lot faster than what the array is capable of.

17:03.440 --> 17:06.880
Use the fast storage to receive the data and then write it in the background

17:06.880 --> 17:08.160
as time permits.

17:08.160 --> 17:08.660
Exactly.

17:08.660 --> 17:13.160
Yeah, I think that that new pooling or multiple pools opens up some interesting

17:13.960 --> 17:16.280
possibilities for different tiers of storage.

17:16.280 --> 17:22.680
So the next logical question from here is, what about multiple arrays and stuff like that?

17:22.680 --> 17:27.160
Because I mean, you want an SSD array, for example, backed by an SSD cache,

17:27.160 --> 17:31.000
and then you want a spinning array backed by an SSD cache.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.880
Like, you could have different, do you see where I'm going?

17:33.880 --> 17:35.720
You could do different things with that, I mean.

17:35.720 --> 17:36.200
Absolutely.

17:36.200 --> 17:39.640
I will say that SSDs in the array are possible,

17:39.640 --> 17:45.160
but they add additional challenges based on how the devices do discard or trim operations.

17:45.160 --> 17:48.840
So it's a more complicated problem to solve.

17:48.840 --> 17:51.880
Now, one thing that I do want to test at some point in the future,

17:51.880 --> 17:54.840
I just, you know, there's so many ideas of what you can do with onRate.

17:54.840 --> 17:58.760
But one really cool one that I want to mess around with at some point is building an array

17:58.760 --> 18:03.960
where the parity disks are NVMe, but the data disks are all SATA-based SSD.

18:03.960 --> 18:08.200
And the reason for this is that what happens when a write hits onRate is that the system

18:08.200 --> 18:12.200
has to first decide which disk it's going to go to, right, where that write's going to go.

18:12.200 --> 18:15.240
Because again, unlike traditional RAID, we don't stripe data.

18:15.240 --> 18:17.400
Every disk is formatted with its own file system.

18:17.400 --> 18:20.040
It operates independently of the other disks in the system.

18:20.040 --> 18:26.040
The only time they work in concert is when you are rebuilding a disk using parity.

18:26.040 --> 18:29.160
However, every time a disk gets a write, so does parity, right?

18:29.160 --> 18:30.760
So parity becomes a bottleneck.

18:30.760 --> 18:35.160
So let's say I'm writing three different files at the same time, and they're each going to a different disk.

18:35.160 --> 18:38.680
Well, disk one, two, and three are each independently receiving a write.

18:38.680 --> 18:43.880
But then at the same time, those three writes are also hitting the parity disk all at the same time.

18:43.880 --> 18:50.840
But if you have a parity disk that has far more IO, far more IOPS available to it than your data disks,

18:50.840 --> 18:55.160
then maybe you can kind of overcome that bottleneck limitation and get some really

18:55.160 --> 18:57.160
fast write speeds direct to the array.

18:57.160 --> 18:58.920
That is fascinating.

18:58.920 --> 19:00.920
I want to play around with that idea.

19:00.920 --> 19:05.320
It's one of those things where it's going to cost some money and take some time to really go through the testing on it.

19:05.320 --> 19:07.320
But I think that could be a really cool way to do it.

19:07.320 --> 19:08.520
Absolutely fascinating.

19:08.520 --> 19:09.320
Thank you, John.

19:09.320 --> 19:15.720
I was wondering if that was possible, because for the longest time, that inherent, you know, having to make two writes at once,

19:15.720 --> 19:22.520
performance imitation has been something that, you know, we've talked about in the NRAID community for years as being a bottleneck.

19:22.520 --> 19:24.520
So it'd be interesting to solve that.

19:24.520 --> 19:30.520
So that leads me on to another, I guess it's an elephant in the room whenever you're talking about storage.

19:30.520 --> 19:32.520
It's kind of the juggernaut hiding in the corner.

19:32.520 --> 19:34.520
What about ZFS?

19:34.520 --> 19:38.520
So I love the European way, the Z.

19:38.520 --> 19:40.520
I'm going to start using that.

19:40.520 --> 19:42.520
Oh, I'm sorry, darling.

19:42.520 --> 19:44.520
Would you like ZFS?

19:44.520 --> 19:46.520
Is that better?

19:46.520 --> 19:48.520
No, no, no.

19:48.520 --> 19:50.520
ZFS is it.

19:50.520 --> 19:52.520
ZFS it is.

19:52.520 --> 19:54.520
ZFS it up.

19:54.520 --> 19:58.520
So ZFS, I like ZFS.

19:58.520 --> 20:00.520
So let's just go right through it.

20:00.520 --> 20:06.520
So have you seen the recent article that was this year from Linus Torvalds about ZFS on Linux?

20:06.520 --> 20:08.520
I'm assuming you had to have.

20:08.520 --> 20:10.520
Yeah.

20:10.520 --> 20:12.520
Okay.

20:12.520 --> 20:16.520
So Linus has got some pretty out there opinions on ZFS and why.

20:16.520 --> 20:18.520
No, that's not like Linus.

20:18.520 --> 20:20.520
Yeah.

20:20.520 --> 20:28.520
It's like, no, he's got legitimate concerns as to what would happen if they just straight up merged ZFS into Linux.

20:28.520 --> 20:34.520
And all it would take is an email from Larry Ellison or any of the legal team at Oracle to make it happen.

20:34.520 --> 20:36.520
But they don't, and there's a reason they don't.

20:36.520 --> 20:38.520
So it's a licensing issue.

20:38.520 --> 20:42.520
At the end of the day, the reason ZFS is not a part of Linux has nothing to do with technology.

20:42.520 --> 20:44.520
It has everything to do with licensing.

20:44.520 --> 20:48.520
And we think we might have a way to work around that issue.

20:48.520 --> 20:54.520
We know that there are other Linux distros that have already adopted it, and they're doing so at a risk.

20:54.520 --> 20:58.520
And because they have and nothing's happened yet, that gives us confidence.

20:58.520 --> 21:04.520
But all I can say is that ZFS has been something that we've been eyeing for a while.

21:04.520 --> 21:10.520
And the reason part of the reason that multiple pools were put in is that it seemed like a pretty good feature to put in maybe before that.

21:10.520 --> 21:12.520
Yeah, absolutely.

21:12.520 --> 21:16.520
I can just imagine Unraid as the hypervisor using Zvols underneath.

21:16.520 --> 21:18.520
That would be so great.

21:18.520 --> 21:22.520
The other thing you have to remember with ZFS, and this goes back to why we originally chose ButterFS,

21:22.520 --> 21:26.520
ButterFS was the perfect complement to Unraid.

21:26.520 --> 21:32.520
Perfect, because from a user experience standpoint in terms of how somebody goes about building an array,

21:32.520 --> 21:36.520
building their server, and then assigning all those storage devices,

21:36.520 --> 21:40.520
the rules about what you can do there, they work the same.

21:40.520 --> 21:45.520
That's the best part about ButterFS and Unraid is they both let you use any kind of device you want.

21:45.520 --> 21:49.520
You can mix and match. You can use different sizes. It doesn't matter.

21:49.520 --> 21:53.520
And the best part is when you want to expand, you can just add another device, just like Unraid.

21:53.520 --> 21:57.520
All of that goes away with ZFS. I almost said Z.

21:57.520 --> 22:01.520
All of that goes away with ZFS because now you have to play by the ZFS rules.

22:01.520 --> 22:04.520
And I understand those rules, and they make sense.

22:04.520 --> 22:08.520
But to an average Unraid user, that might be frustrating.

22:08.520 --> 22:10.520
Let's say we did it as default.

22:10.520 --> 22:12.520
Let's just say, for example, that our cache pool was based on ZFS as default.

22:12.520 --> 22:17.520
You created a two-device RAID 1 ZFS setup, and now you want to expand it.

22:17.520 --> 22:20.520
How easy is that compared to ButterFS?

22:20.520 --> 22:22.520
It's not terrible. With a two-device pool, it's not terrible.

22:22.520 --> 22:28.520
But imagine it's four or six, and now you have to add another four or six devices into a new Z pool

22:28.520 --> 22:31.520
in order to expand the existing. That's a huge cost.

22:31.520 --> 22:35.520
And sometimes it's not even realistic because the user doesn't have enough SATA ports available

22:35.520 --> 22:38.520
to add that much storage to the server they're dealing with.

22:38.520 --> 22:42.520
Let's face facts. ZFS was not built for home users. It was built for the enterprise.

22:42.520 --> 22:47.520
We're trying to kind of bend that enterprise tool to be valuable to consumers.

22:47.520 --> 22:52.520
And I'm totally on board with it because I think there are some very cool things that you can do with ZFS.

22:52.520 --> 22:58.520
And I know there's plenty of people out there that use FreeNAS, for example, which is entirely based on using ZFS.

22:58.520 --> 23:02.520
So I'm on board with bringing it in-house and using it.

23:02.520 --> 23:06.520
It's going to take a little time for us to get it fully implemented.

23:06.520 --> 23:09.520
But it's something that we are actively working on.

23:09.520 --> 23:12.520
I actually think that's a pretty fair answer. I think Alex and I both really agree with you.

23:12.520 --> 23:17.520
It is truly an enterprise file system, and if you have an enterprise budget, it's very manageable.

23:17.520 --> 23:22.520
If you're a high-end home user, and you can make it work, I'm doing it right now,

23:22.520 --> 23:26.520
but I went out and got a super microchassis to make it happen.

23:26.520 --> 23:30.520
And that's the reality. I mean, the majority of our customers, they're not doing that.

23:30.520 --> 23:34.520
They're taking an old PC and they're repurposing it for the use as a server.

23:34.520 --> 23:38.520
Honestly, that's what I used to do when I was building PCs as a young'un.

23:38.520 --> 23:44.520
When I was first getting into technology, what was my first PC? It's a gaming PC, like most tech people, right?

23:44.520 --> 23:48.520
But then that gaming PC gets a little old, and you realize, well, I can't really upgrade it anymore.

23:48.520 --> 23:52.520
Time to build a new one. So you take the old one, and you make it your server.

23:52.520 --> 23:57.520
It's a good value. So John, along those lines, I guess my question is, you must see a lot of different builds,

23:57.520 --> 24:00.520
just being inside the company and seeing different stuff online.

24:00.520 --> 24:04.520
Does one really stand out to you as a pretty amazing Unraid build?

24:04.520 --> 24:08.520
Oh, come on. If you've not seen any of the Linus videos from Linus Tech Tips, come on.

24:08.520 --> 24:10.520
I thought that might be your answer.

24:10.520 --> 24:14.520
If I don't point my finger at at least nine of those builds, then yeah.

24:14.520 --> 24:21.520
I mean, those are the crazy – I remember that the craziest one had to be the seven gamers one.

24:21.520 --> 24:23.520
Not the nine, not the eight, but the seven.

24:23.520 --> 24:28.520
And the reason the seven was so crazy was because Linus calls me up.

24:28.520 --> 24:34.520
He calls me, and he says, hey, I've got seven of these AMD Nano GPUs coming.

24:34.520 --> 24:41.520
As soon as he says AMD, my hairs on the back of my neck rise because I cannot stand AMD GPUs for one reason,

24:41.520 --> 24:44.520
and that's because VM pass-through with those is a royal pain.

24:44.520 --> 24:50.520
I know that there's a lot of Linux people that hate Nvidia for how they handle open source, and I understand that.

24:50.520 --> 24:54.520
I totally get it. But when it comes down to what works and what doesn't,

24:54.520 --> 25:00.520
I've rarely had problems getting Nvidia GPUs to pass through. I always have problems with AMD.

25:00.520 --> 25:06.520
So he's like, I got these brand new, never before seen AMD GPUs.

25:06.520 --> 25:10.520
Oh, and by the way, I'm going to rip all of the coolers off these GPUs,

25:10.520 --> 25:16.520
and I'm going to have a cooler manufacturer make me a custom block, custom water cooling block,

25:16.520 --> 25:22.520
that's going to be one block that's going to slide into this system and cool all seven of those cards at the same time.

25:22.520 --> 25:24.520
Can I go under the hood for a second?

25:24.520 --> 25:29.520
Because I know that this is something that you don't touch on a lot, but it's based on Slackware, right?

25:29.520 --> 25:32.520
That's our distribution. Yeah.

25:32.520 --> 25:34.520
Do you have any measurements on this?

25:34.520 --> 25:40.520
But as far as you know, are you perhaps the most widely spread Slackware Linux distribution in existence?

25:40.520 --> 25:43.520
It probably wouldn't surprise me. I don't know.

25:43.520 --> 25:46.520
I don't know for a fact, but I mean, let's face facts.

25:46.520 --> 25:48.520
When you think about Linux distributions,

25:48.520 --> 25:55.520
the top names that come to mind are probably, you know, Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch, you know, that group.

25:55.520 --> 26:02.520
Slackware is like the very last one that I think people think about because it's not really built for everyday Linux users.

26:02.520 --> 26:05.520
It's built for guys that are building platforms.

26:05.520 --> 26:10.520
It's built for people that want to really tinker or really want to rip the whole thing apart.

26:10.520 --> 26:15.520
Like what you can do with a Slackware distribution in terms of from a developer's perspective

26:15.520 --> 26:19.520
is so much more fine tuned than what you do with traditional distros.

26:19.520 --> 26:22.520
Like, think about how small unrate is as a release.

26:22.520 --> 26:24.520
I couldn't do that with Ubuntu.

26:24.520 --> 26:28.520
I mean, if I could, by the time I'd get there, I'd say,

26:28.520 --> 26:31.520
well, I could have done it a lot quicker using a different platform.

26:31.520 --> 26:36.520
So, yeah, we're probably the largest, I would think we're probably the largest Slackware distribution out there.

26:36.520 --> 26:41.520
I thought that might be the case, which is just something I don't think a lot of people have given a nod to or consideration

26:41.520 --> 26:46.520
because it's one of the originals, so it's pretty great to see it in widespread use out there.

26:46.520 --> 26:51.520
Absolutely. I mean, we love Patrick, but I can never pronounce his last name.

26:51.520 --> 26:53.520
So, Patrick V. We're just going to say Patrick V.

26:53.520 --> 26:54.520
Yes.

26:54.520 --> 26:59.520
You know, we have great respect for the work that he's done and, you know, it's been a great platform.

26:59.520 --> 27:03.520
And the funny thing about Slackware is that like, because this conversation comes up about Slackware once in a blue moon,

27:03.520 --> 27:05.520
came up a lot years ago.

27:05.520 --> 27:07.520
We really haven't heard anything about it since.

27:07.520 --> 27:12.520
But the reality is that Slackware, Arch, it really does not, for us as a company, it does not matter.

27:12.520 --> 27:16.520
Like, Linux is not about the distribution, it's about the kernel.

27:16.520 --> 27:18.520
It's about what can the kernel do?

27:18.520 --> 27:24.520
And all a distribution is, is a way to wrap up what the kernel can do into a more manageable way.

27:24.520 --> 27:29.520
And when it comes to us, you know, we've always gone through discussions where we talk about,

27:29.520 --> 27:30.520
well, should we switch?

27:30.520 --> 27:31.520
Should we move to a different platform?

27:31.520 --> 27:33.520
And we might at some point, we might.

27:33.520 --> 27:38.520
But the reality is, is that one of the big value props that we have is the fact that Unraid runs as an appliance.

27:39.520 --> 27:44.520
It really is an appliance built OS.

27:41.520 --> 27:46.520
It's not Windows, right?

27:43.520 --> 27:48.520
Windows is a platform, right?

27:45.520 --> 27:50.520
Windows is, hey, you load Windows, and then you load a bunch of other things into Windows, and now it's an operating system.

27:50.520 --> 27:55.520
Now it has everything that it needs.

27:52.520 --> 27:57.520
We're an appliance.

27:53.520 --> 27:58.520
Everything that you need is in the stick, all in the stick.

27:56.520 --> 28:01.520
Your capabilities as a hypervisor, there.

28:01.520 --> 28:06.520
It's built in.

28:02.520 --> 28:07.520
And what's great about Slackware is that we were able to kind of pull out all the nonsense that we didn't need in the kernel,

28:07.520 --> 28:12.520
everything we didn't need in the OS, and really get it down to a very minimalistic build.

28:12.520 --> 28:17.520
And I think that honestly is one of my favorite things about Unraid is how minimalistic the OS really is.

28:18.520 --> 28:23.520
You hit the nail on the head.

28:19.520 --> 28:24.520
It was a few years ago, I think sort of 2013, 14 sort of period that I think you and I first crossed paths.

28:24.520 --> 28:29.520
This was when Docker was being added for the very first time to Unraid.

28:30.520 --> 28:35.520
And around about that sort of time, we were running custom VMs to run media apps.

28:36.520 --> 28:41.520
And it was just this whole layer of abstraction and complexity, which now with containers is just not a problem.

28:45.520 --> 28:50.520
So the base OS just doesn't matter anymore.

28:47.520 --> 28:52.520
And I'm a strong believer of that as long as you can run a container, you can run whatever OS you want.

28:52.520 --> 28:57.520
That's exactly right.

28:53.520 --> 28:58.520
And I mean, the funny thing is, is that so when we were working on six,

28:58.520 --> 29:03.520
the reason that VMs were initially looked at was not because of something that Tom wanted originally.

29:04.520 --> 29:09.520
It was because of what people wanted, what our customers wanted, what our users were using.

29:08.520 --> 29:13.520
And so what we found was that the big calling card to Unraid in the five days were plugins.

29:14.520 --> 29:19.520
That was the cat's pajamas right there.

29:19.520 --> 29:24.520
We had a plugin and that guy Faze in our community,

29:23.520 --> 29:28.520
he created all these different plugins and it just extended the value of Unraid.

29:27.520 --> 29:32.520
You didn't have a feature that you wanted, you'd add a plugin.

29:30.520 --> 29:35.520
That's where Slackware's weakness was exposed, though, because in order to run these plugins,

29:34.520 --> 29:39.520
you'd have to be able to download these packages and install them that were built for Slackware.

29:40.520 --> 29:45.520
And you'd find that there were plenty of packages out there that just weren't built.

29:45.520 --> 29:50.520
It's funny that Plex actually had a build that they made that somebody didn't have to hack through.

29:51.520 --> 29:56.520
They made and they supported for Unraid, which tells you how big we must have been for their community.

29:56.520 --> 30:01.520
And so, yeah, we saw all these people using plugins and Tom's like, you know, this is just not manageable.

30:00.520 --> 30:05.520
So our choices are move to a platform where it is or find a way to make it work on what we have.

30:05.520 --> 30:10.520
And VMs were the first foray into that.

30:07.520 --> 30:12.520
And I think you were involved in that a little bit, Alex, where Tom reached out to you and you were creating some VM templates and things like that.

30:12.520 --> 30:17.520
But then as we were going down that road, there was a couple different things that we discovered.

30:15.520 --> 30:20.520
The first was that we were originally using Xen as our hypervisor.

30:18.520 --> 30:23.520
And the reason that I like Xen so much is I actually come from the Citrix world prior to Limetech.

30:24.520 --> 30:29.520
And that was Citrix's big thing was Xen and Xen Server.

30:27.520 --> 30:32.520
And I thought, wow, this is great.

30:29.520 --> 30:34.520
It's a similar platform.

30:30.520 --> 30:35.520
Let's try it.

30:31.520 --> 30:36.520
You know, I like the way that the whole project was structured.

30:34.520 --> 30:39.520
But we had a lot of problems with Xen.

30:36.520 --> 30:41.520
And specifically with GPU pass through, we had a lot of problems with Xen.

30:41.520 --> 30:46.520
And we're like, wow, this is going to solve all of our GPU pass through problems.

30:43.520 --> 30:48.520
But then the question became, well, wait a minute.

30:46.520 --> 30:51.520
Do I really need a 10 gig or even a one gig size V disk to run Plex?

30:52.520 --> 30:57.520
Like, does that seem like a good trade off?

30:54.520 --> 30:59.520
And then the user has to manage that.

30:56.520 --> 31:01.520
Like they can't just automate like Plex isn't going to just auto update like you have to manage that VM.

31:01.520 --> 31:06.520
You have to manage the OS in that VM.

31:03.520 --> 31:08.520
And it just there was so much additional stuff that came with VMs that didn't come with containers.

31:08.520 --> 31:13.520
And I remember a guy in our community by the name of Naz, that's his handle in our forum,

31:13.520 --> 31:18.520
had once posted a feature question.

31:15.520 --> 31:20.520
He just real short or just, hey, there's this new thing, Docker.

31:19.520 --> 31:24.520
I think it looks pretty cool.

31:21.520 --> 31:26.520
You guys should check it out.

31:22.520 --> 31:27.520
And so Eric, our CTO and myself, we started looking at it.

31:25.520 --> 31:30.520
I'm like, the first week I'm looking at Docker, I'm just I'm so confused.

31:31.520 --> 31:36.520
I'm looking at it.

31:32.520 --> 31:37.520
I'm like, this thing sounds great, but it also is so confusing.

31:37.520 --> 31:42.520
And then we just built it.

31:38.520 --> 31:43.520
So Eric and Eric went into the dungeon and built a release of Unray that supported Docker.

31:42.520 --> 31:47.520
And Eric's like, I'm about to show you how great this is.

31:44.520 --> 31:49.520
Here's what I want you to type.

31:45.520 --> 31:50.520
Docker run space, blah, blah, blah, blah.

31:47.520 --> 31:52.520
I gave me a command to run and I hit enter.

31:49.520 --> 31:54.520
And I'm like, OK, now what?

31:50.520 --> 31:55.520
And he goes, that's it.

31:51.520 --> 31:56.520
You're running Plex.

31:52.520 --> 31:57.520
Yep.

31:53.520 --> 31:58.520
I'm like, what?

31:54.520 --> 31:59.520
And I type in the IP and sure shit Plex is loading.

31:56.520 --> 32:01.520
It's running.

31:56.520 --> 32:01.520
It's doing its thing.

31:57.520 --> 32:02.520
And I'm like, wow, that's crazy.

31:59.520 --> 32:04.520
How did you do that?

32:00.520 --> 32:05.520
And then that's where everything fell into like this is just this big.

32:05.520 --> 32:10.520
Ion cat or whatever.

32:06.520 --> 32:11.520
When the thing goes like it's like the movie Limitless or whatever.

32:10.520 --> 32:15.520
All of a sudden you understand everything.

32:12.520 --> 32:17.520
Everything falls into place.

32:13.520 --> 32:18.520
It's like the moment Doc Brown hits his head on the toilet and thinks of the flux capacity.

32:17.520 --> 32:22.520
Exactly.

32:18.520 --> 32:23.520
And so I remember calling Tom and I think I honestly think it might have been in the middle of the night.

32:23.520 --> 32:28.520
It might have been like really late at night.

32:24.520 --> 32:29.520
I'm like, Tom.

32:25.520 --> 32:30.520
And he's like, John, what's up?

32:27.520 --> 32:32.520
And I'm like, this thing, you got to see it.

32:29.520 --> 32:34.520
So we got him the bill and he's like, OK, now what?

32:34.520 --> 32:39.520
Command run and he's he gets it up and running and he's like, OK, now that was pretty cool.

32:38.520 --> 32:43.520
Yeah.

32:38.520 --> 32:43.520
And we all had this eye opening moment of we got to do this.

32:41.520 --> 32:46.520
And so the funny thing about it, too, is that we the first iteration of building a Docker management interface was nothing compared to what it is today.

32:49.520 --> 32:54.520
It was it was honestly it was pretty piss poor, but it did the job.

32:53.520 --> 32:58.520
It worked, but it required users to add these template repos and people would have to build their apps on GitHub and then link these repos and all.

32:58.520 --> 33:03.520
And just putting out like the first I think the first beta releases that we had with this in there, the community just took it and ran with it.

33:07.520 --> 33:12.520
And that's how we have the community app store.

33:09.520 --> 33:14.520
That's how we have the new Docker manager that that's way more polished than what the old one was.

33:14.520 --> 33:19.520
It's just crazy how fast everything clicked into place after we put it out there.

33:20.520 --> 33:25.520
So I mean, Docker is a Docker is awesome.

33:25.520 --> 33:30.520
I think my Doc Brown moment was when I set everything up and I really, you know, I had a good configuration.

33:32.520 --> 33:37.520
I tore the container down and then stood up a new version of the container and it just resumed and the data was completely separate from the application.

33:42.520 --> 33:47.520
And that was the moment I went, aha, I get it.

33:45.520 --> 33:50.520
This solves a problem I fought forever in I.T.

33:48.520 --> 33:53.520
So I love that story.

33:49.520 --> 33:54.520
It's sort of like the Docker origin story in Unraid.

33:54.520 --> 33:59.520
I kind of want to tease out of you anything you can give us about this soon dot unraid dot net, which says the team has been working hard on something.

34:02.520 --> 34:07.520
We're calling my servers to be released soon.

34:05.520 --> 34:10.520
What are you talking about?

34:07.520 --> 34:12.520
I have no idea what you're talking about.

34:10.520 --> 34:15.520
Are you talking about the little did you know?

34:12.520 --> 34:17.520
Now, hold on.

34:13.520 --> 34:18.520
Did you actually find the Easter egg or did somebody just tell you?

34:17.520 --> 34:22.520
Let's let's start with that.

34:18.520 --> 34:23.520
I may have informants.

34:23.520 --> 34:28.520
Would you be legit?

34:24.520 --> 34:29.520
The color scheme looks on point.

34:25.520 --> 34:30.520
It's SSL signed.

34:27.520 --> 34:32.520
It's legit.

34:29.520 --> 34:34.520
So if you're interested in getting involved in being able to test some new things that you want to get ahead of the rest of the community on, that's where to sign up for it.

34:38.520 --> 34:43.520
All I can say is that we have some pretty big plans to roll out some pretty nice services to complement the OS.

34:43.520 --> 34:52.520
We talked about this a little earlier, and we are looking to get people in line that want to start testing that for us a little bit more rigorously.

34:52.520 --> 34:57.520
We've been personally testing it for over a year now, and we're pretty confident with what we've built.

34:57.520 --> 35:02.520
Obviously, as soon as you expand it beyond, you know, the size of a room, it's the people are going to find chinks in the armor.

35:03.520 --> 35:08.520
So it's it's a it's a beta testing program sign up.

35:06.520 --> 35:11.520
That's that's the core of it.

35:07.520 --> 35:12.520
That sounds like a good thing.

35:12.520 --> 35:17.520
But John, where else should we send people?

35:14.520 --> 35:19.520
You mentioned there's a community area, it sounds like our forums are where everybody goes, both new users, existing users and people that are thinking about becoming users.

35:22.520 --> 35:27.520
And the biggest thing that I can guide people about on rate is, OK, first go on YouTube and watch Space Invader One's videos.

35:29.520 --> 35:34.520
If you haven't, Ed is just an amazing guy.

35:34.520 --> 35:44.520
He's going around on rate and going so much deeper than we ever would as a company to explain all the nuances to how to configure all the most advanced things.

35:42.520 --> 35:51.520
So if you have any questions about on rate OS, if you want someone that's going to walk you through it, give you a nice presentation on it, I highly recommend checking that out.

35:51.520 --> 35:56.520
The other thing I obviously recommend checking out is Linus Tech Tips.

35:54.520 --> 36:03.520
Linus Sebastian is a big friend of the show or a big friend of the company, and we lean on him pretty heavily to help kind of push the limits of what we can do with the software.

36:03.520 --> 36:08.520
Or I should say, he pushes us.

36:05.520 --> 36:12.520
And the other thing that I would recommend is that if people are wondering, well, I want to build an on rate server, I'm not sure what hardware to use, the forums.

36:12.520 --> 36:17.520
Our forums are like, we get emails pretty often about, well, which hardware should I use?

36:17.520 --> 36:22.520
And the reality is that we're not a hardware company, we're a software company.

36:20.520 --> 36:25.520
So our hardware requirements are pretty basic.

36:22.520 --> 36:27.520
You've got to have a 64-bit processor.

36:24.520 --> 36:29.520
I'd recommend at least four gigs of RAM and a decent USB flash stick.

36:29.520 --> 36:34.520
But then if you want to do VMs, your processor's got to support virtualization, it's got to support passthrough.

36:34.520 --> 36:39.520
And there's ways to look that up easier with Intel than with AMD.

36:37.520 --> 36:42.520
But, you know, if you're wondering, well, am I going to run into problems?

36:40.520 --> 36:45.520
Or if I use this hardware, are there any limitations?

36:42.520 --> 36:47.520
Just post in our forum, there's a good chance somebody's already used it.

36:45.520 --> 36:50.520
That's a good resource because it is such a varied thing.

36:47.520 --> 36:52.520
You need a community to lean on.

36:50.520 --> 36:55.520
Well, John, thanks for coming on.

36:51.520 --> 36:56.520
Do keep us in the loop on future developments and stuff so we can keep our audience informed and send us little nudges here and there as things develop.

36:56.520 --> 37:01.520
Because I think what we'll be following, I'm kind of scratching my head.

37:01.520 --> 37:06.520
I think I have a couple of excuses to try out Unraid.

37:04.520 --> 37:09.520
I might give it a go here soon and report back on the show.

37:07.520 --> 37:12.520
If you get tired of rolling your own and you want to just have a packaged OS that you don't have to tinker and you don't have to manage,

37:13.520 --> 37:18.520
you can just mess with the apps and the VMs and the storage and that's it, we're for you.

37:18.520 --> 37:23.520
We're 100% for you.

37:19.520 --> 37:24.520
That's the elevator pitch right there.

37:24.520 --> 37:29.520
Just kidding.

37:29.520 --> 37:34.520
Well, I hope you enjoyed that chat with John as much as I did.

37:32.520 --> 37:37.520
