00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Hello.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Is this thing on?

4
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hey, Alex.

5
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
What's going on?

6
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hey.

7
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Good to hear from you, Chris.

8
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Hey, Alex.

9
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Hi.

10
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hi.

11
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Good to hear from you.

12
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Right.

13
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So I've been meaning to bother you about this for a while.

14
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Uh-oh.

15
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I have an idea.

16
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Okay.

17
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Do you want to hear it?

18
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Of course.

19
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Well, you do podcasts.

20
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,520
Yeah, that's what I've been told.

21
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:27,040
That's allegedly what happens.

22
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:30,120
We've both been doing a lot of self-hosting lately.

23
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,120
I love it.

24
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,120
I'm all about it these days.

25
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,120
Self-host all the things.

26
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,120
Mm-hmm.

27
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,120
Yeah?

28
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,120
Well, that's the show.

29
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,120
Right there.

30
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,120
That's the idea.

31
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,120
What do you think?

32
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,120
Well, I'm not anti-cloud.

33
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,120
That's my only problem.

34
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,120
I'm not like an anti-cloud guy.

35
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,120
Well, nor am I.

36
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,120
Oh.

37
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,120
Okay.

38
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,840
So I don't want to buy a piece of hardware, a thermostat maybe, a security camera, smart

39
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:55,840
plug in my case, that two, three years later, maybe even six months, the manufacturer goes,

40
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,400
that's not the business model here.

41
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,400
Right.

42
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,400
And then it's just a shiny paperweight.

43
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,400
No.

44
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,320
I mean, that's literally just happened to me.

45
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,320
Yes.

46
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,320
There's no...

47
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,680
Never again, I say, Alex.

48
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,680
Never again.

49
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,560
And I want to give people a way to find out how to do a lot of this stuff, like a discovery

50
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,080
portal, if you like.

51
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,400
You know, say, I want to build a home server.

52
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,400
Where do you start?

53
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,400
There is so much information.

54
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,400
It's a lot to consider.

55
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,240
Google is overrun with keywords and SEO optimizations.

56
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,240
No kidding.

57
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,240
No kidding.

58
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,480
And so you and I, between us, I think can cut through a lot of the chaff and...

59
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,160
A few hard learned lessons over the years.

60
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,160
A few.

61
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,160
Yes.

62
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,160
Yes.

63
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,160
Yeah.

64
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,160
Yeah, we could definitely cut.

65
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,160
I like this idea.

66
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,160
I like it a lot.

67
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,440
In fact, it's an area that I also want to kind of continue to push and explore myself.

68
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:48,120
So I could use a little help, a little guidance.

69
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,680
And what about if we included some guests along the way?

70
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,680
Maybe people who...

71
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,680
Working on stuff?

72
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,680
Yeah.

73
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,680
All right.

74
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,680
Now you're getting me excited.

75
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,680
On the crew.

76
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,680
Crew too?

77
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,680
Yeah.

78
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,680
JB crew, listeners.

79
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,680
That's true.

80
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,680
They're always building stuff.

81
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,680
Get viewer audience questions.

82
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,040
I think we should get a few developers on the horn to talk to them about what they're

83
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,040
doing.

84
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,040
Yeah.

85
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,040
That's a good idea.

86
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,040
All right.

87
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,040
I'm all in on this idea now.

88
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,040
Okay.

89
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:23,160
Thank you guys so much for watching, and I'll see you guys next time.

90
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,160
Bye.

91
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,160
Bye.
