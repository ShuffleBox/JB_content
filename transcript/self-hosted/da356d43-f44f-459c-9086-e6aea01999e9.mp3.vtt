WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.600
I'm not sure what it is about you today, Alex.

00:01.600 --> 00:03.040
You just kind of have a glow about you.

00:03.120 --> 00:07.440
This episode of self-hosted is brought to you by the sun.

00:08.080 --> 00:10.160
Solar powered podcasting.

00:10.200 --> 00:11.280
That is awesome.

00:11.280 --> 00:11.780
Yeah, man.

00:12.040 --> 00:12.540
Wow.

00:12.780 --> 00:13.040
Yeah.

00:13.040 --> 00:14.300
And you got quite the solar stuff.

00:14.300 --> 00:18.420
I mean, compared to the one that I have on my RV roof, which is, um, a lot smaller,

00:19.160 --> 00:20.360
you got a lot more roof to work with.

00:20.360 --> 00:22.280
I don't have a need to drive it down the road.

00:22.280 --> 00:22.640
Do I?

00:22.640 --> 00:25.560
So yeah, I've gone for an eight kilowatt solar system on my roof.

00:25.980 --> 00:26.480
That's great.

00:26.480 --> 00:29.880
And so it actually means like legitimately it's running everything.

00:29.880 --> 00:35.360
On a day like today, in the middle of June, when the sun is beating down real

00:35.360 --> 00:40.700
hard all day, I can actually run both my AC units, all my servers, fridges,

00:40.700 --> 00:44.680
the TVs, everything, 100% on solar for about two hours.

00:45.640 --> 00:49.100
And I know something that's on your mind is like eventually putting some

00:49.100 --> 00:50.960
sort of battery solution in there.

00:51.340 --> 00:56.120
There's of course, reasonable solutions, but if you could just Star Trek Q style,

00:56.120 --> 01:00.280
snap your fingers and have a battery solution materialized out of thin air,

01:00.280 --> 01:01.520
what would be your ideal setup?

01:01.560 --> 01:03.720
Uh, you know how I like to make stuff.

01:03.800 --> 01:08.680
I've, I've been watching videos of this guy called, I think, uh, is it Jerry Garcia

01:08.680 --> 01:13.620
or something like that on YouTube for years and he builds his own batteries,

01:13.620 --> 01:17.920
power walls out of old electric car batteries.

01:18.520 --> 01:18.720
Yeah.

01:18.720 --> 01:19.520
That's what I want to do.

01:19.960 --> 01:23.840
I just think that'd be the coolest thing in the world because cars need a very high

01:23.840 --> 01:29.000
peak voltage to accelerate the mass of the vehicle, whereas a house is a much

01:29.000 --> 01:31.640
more constant, much less peaky load than that.

01:31.640 --> 01:36.080
So you can get away with old air quotes, dead car batteries that are

01:36.080 --> 01:38.600
actually suitable for, for houses.

01:39.200 --> 01:41.800
I, you know what I didn't even appreciate earlier is that you had your air

01:41.800 --> 01:42.520
conditioning going.

01:42.720 --> 01:47.520
Two units as well, because, uh, I live in one of these crazy big American houses

01:47.520 --> 01:49.560
that has a unit per, per story.

01:51.040 --> 01:52.120
That's so cool though.

01:52.120 --> 01:56.080
I mean, you're like not even hitting like the power grid

01:56.080 --> 01:57.240
to run air conditioning.

01:57.280 --> 01:58.520
That's that's awesome.

01:58.520 --> 01:58.880
Yeah.

01:59.320 --> 02:04.960
At one point today, the solar was reporting 6.4 kilowatts of power.

02:04.960 --> 02:07.360
So 6,400 Watts, I suppose.

02:07.960 --> 02:12.280
I dream one day of, of building a big, big array, just something, even something

02:12.280 --> 02:16.000
around that size, I think it'd be perfect for what I have envisioned for the future.

02:16.000 --> 02:16.880
24 panels.

02:16.880 --> 02:20.080
I think, um, solar edge is the company that I went with.

02:20.080 --> 02:24.920
Um, yeah, and they've got an online monitoring platform, which home assistant

02:24.920 --> 02:29.200
of course talks to, and my there's a local Zigbee gateway that talks to the

02:29.200 --> 02:32.360
inverter, uh, as well to provide that information.

02:32.640 --> 02:34.560
In fact, when they were installing it, it was kind of funny.

02:34.560 --> 02:37.280
The, uh, the installer knocked on my door and said, Hey, where's your,

02:37.320 --> 02:38.440
where's your router?

02:38.680 --> 02:39.560
And I'm like, hmm.

02:41.880 --> 02:44.680
Is that your yank router?

02:45.280 --> 02:47.920
Why do you want access to my, to my router?

02:47.920 --> 02:51.200
And, uh, he was like, Oh, I've got this Zigbee box.

02:51.200 --> 02:53.240
I want to plug in and I'm like, why?

02:53.480 --> 02:56.920
And he told me about everything it does and I thought, Oh, that's so cool.

02:57.480 --> 02:58.360
And I was like, what do you need?

02:58.360 --> 02:59.720
He goes, I just need an ethernet port.

02:59.720 --> 03:01.600
I'm like, Oh, Oh, okay.

03:01.720 --> 03:02.520
I got you covered.

03:03.560 --> 03:04.520
That's pretty great.

03:05.040 --> 03:08.960
So, uh, now it's connected up and, uh, it all talks back to the equipment over Zigbee.

03:08.960 --> 03:09.160
Wow.

03:09.160 --> 03:09.920
That's wild.

03:10.080 --> 03:16.000
That is, you know, we also learned recently that Zigbee is used on the Mars helicopter

03:16.000 --> 03:18.120
opportunity, or no, I'm sorry, Ingenuity.

03:18.360 --> 03:20.920
And that's how it talks back to the Mars rover is over Zigbee.

03:20.920 --> 03:21.120
Really?

03:21.160 --> 03:21.720
That's cool.

03:22.200 --> 03:22.520
Yeah.

03:23.400 --> 03:26.640
So Zigbee is getting, it's getting used on Mars to communicate with the

03:26.640 --> 03:27.800
little drone helicopter.

03:28.360 --> 03:29.000
Well, that's pretty cool.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.520
I'll be interested to follow your journey to see how that setup evolves.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.720
And then eventually I can't wait to hear stories of you up there on the roof, trying

03:35.720 --> 03:38.000
to clean those panels after some storm or something.

03:38.000 --> 03:38.200
Yeah.

03:38.200 --> 03:39.000
You know, it's coming.

03:40.640 --> 03:41.000
Yeah.

03:41.440 --> 03:44.960
Well, I have a confession to make before we get too far into the show.

03:44.960 --> 03:47.560
So first I want to tell you about our friends at a cloud guru.

03:47.880 --> 03:49.280
This episode is brought to you by them.

03:49.280 --> 03:52.360
They are the leader in learning for the cloud for Linux and other modern tech

03:52.360 --> 03:56.200
skills, hundreds of courses, thousands of hands-on labs, get certified, get hired,

03:56.200 --> 03:58.160
get learning at a cloud guru.com.

03:59.560 --> 04:07.680
So while I was in Montana, I decided to be just, I guess, like extra challenging

04:07.680 --> 04:09.640
and give myself more stress during my trip.

04:09.640 --> 04:14.160
I decided to just to kind of throw a wrench at everything and do a episode of Coder

04:14.160 --> 04:16.560
radio live on the road.

04:17.520 --> 04:21.240
Not that this is impossible, but when you know, I've pre-recorded everything and

04:21.240 --> 04:23.200
I'm only doing one live show on the road.

04:23.600 --> 04:25.440
Like I'm not really in the right head space.

04:25.440 --> 04:27.080
I haven't really checked everything out.

04:27.080 --> 04:28.760
I didn't really think through it methodically.

04:28.760 --> 04:31.560
Like I would, if it was a whole series of shows I'm going to produce.

04:33.080 --> 04:37.040
And one of the things I didn't really have dialed in before I left for Montana.

04:38.080 --> 04:42.320
Was remote desktop control and it has to be remote desktop.

04:42.320 --> 04:43.480
It can't be SSH.

04:43.480 --> 04:47.400
I actually have to see the console because of the audio tools we use in our mixer.

04:48.160 --> 04:52.520
I have to see the console and I, I thought, well, you know what I'll do.

04:52.840 --> 04:54.960
I know I shouldn't do this, but I don't have time.

04:56.280 --> 04:59.360
I'm I'm going to throw team viewer on these machines.

04:59.440 --> 05:03.040
And when I'm in Montana, I'll pull up team viewer and I'll get everything working.

05:03.040 --> 05:04.320
I'll get the stream up over team viewer.

05:04.320 --> 05:04.840
It'll be fine.

05:06.640 --> 05:10.360
And for about five minutes, it was, um, I got re I got remoted in.

05:10.360 --> 05:13.120
I realized, oh, this machine, you know, it's not running quite right.

05:13.120 --> 05:14.400
It needs to be rebooted.

05:14.800 --> 05:17.800
So I restarted the machine I was remoted into, which is fine.

05:17.840 --> 05:18.340
Right.

05:18.560 --> 05:19.060
That's fine.

05:19.320 --> 05:26.680
It comes back up and team viewer, it has like some detective code in there that

05:26.680 --> 05:31.880
detected that I was doing admin like functions, remoting into machine rebooting

05:31.880 --> 05:34.080
and then trying to reconnect to it after a few minutes.

05:34.480 --> 05:39.520
And it detected that I was doing these admin like functions and then disabled

05:39.520 --> 05:41.760
my ability to connect for like 15 minutes.

05:43.120 --> 05:46.760
Now that sucks because I'm an hour out from going live and I want to get the

05:46.760 --> 05:49.600
stream up, I like to get the stream up about an hour before we start.

05:49.600 --> 05:53.000
So people can start, you know, assembly 15 minute time.

05:53.000 --> 05:53.500
Okay.

05:53.500 --> 05:54.760
So I go about and I do my other things.

05:54.760 --> 05:56.080
I set up stuff, other stuff up.

05:56.440 --> 05:59.160
15 minutes goes by and I may be getting the time window wrong.

05:59.160 --> 06:02.760
This was a few weeks ago, but that 15 minutes goes by I reconnect.

06:03.000 --> 06:03.500
Nope.

06:03.500 --> 06:04.000
Sorry.

06:04.600 --> 06:06.000
Admin activity detected.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.280
You have to wait 15 minutes.

06:07.280 --> 06:09.280
Oh man.

06:09.280 --> 06:13.640
So I keep going, setting up now I'm like a half hour, actually I let extra time

06:13.640 --> 06:14.520
go by just in case.

06:14.520 --> 06:19.800
And now I'm like, I'm at the 40 minute mark show starts at the top of the next hour.

06:20.680 --> 06:22.280
So I'm like trying to get connected.

06:22.520 --> 06:23.600
I gave it extra time.

06:23.600 --> 06:25.480
I gave an extra like five, 10 minutes.

06:25.720 --> 06:26.560
I connect again.

06:27.200 --> 06:27.700
Nope.

06:27.760 --> 06:28.720
Admin detected.

06:29.000 --> 06:29.760
Can't connect.

06:30.160 --> 06:31.280
Now I'm starting to get panic.

06:31.680 --> 06:32.800
Now I can't get on.

06:32.840 --> 06:34.000
Now I can't get on the internet.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.360
I can't get on this live stream.

06:35.360 --> 06:36.200
I can't get that going.

06:36.200 --> 06:39.560
You know, Mike doesn't know he's going to be connecting, expecting me to be there.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.960
The audience is starting to show up in the chat room, asking where the stream's at.

06:42.960 --> 06:43.920
It's starting to get stressful.

06:45.360 --> 06:50.520
So, you know, I go into business mode and I think to myself, look, you jackass.

06:51.280 --> 06:56.720
It's like $670 to just buy the commercial license and then you can get access to

06:56.720 --> 06:58.960
your machines and you can do your show.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.440
You're going to be traveling more this year.

07:01.960 --> 07:03.760
Just, just pay the price.

07:03.760 --> 07:05.200
Just pay the damn price.

07:06.600 --> 07:07.800
So I, I think about it.

07:08.120 --> 07:09.560
I know I could self host this.

07:09.560 --> 07:13.680
I know I shouldn't do this, but I want to get on the air.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.280
The show starts in just a few minutes.

07:16.880 --> 07:18.280
So I head over to TeamViewer's site.

07:18.640 --> 07:21.920
I get all logged in, make sure it's all my account stuff is correct.

07:23.520 --> 07:27.240
And I subscribe to the annual like $670 plan.

07:27.360 --> 07:28.680
That's a lot of greenbacks.

07:29.360 --> 07:31.760
Oh, it hurts so bad.

07:31.760 --> 07:35.680
I mean, I've, I've, I've paid more for other subscriptions, but this one in

07:35.680 --> 07:40.040
particular, because of how they got me into it and because I needed, I needed

07:40.040 --> 07:43.040
to just do this once, you know, like the way they got me into this, but I knew,

07:43.040 --> 07:46.640
okay, if I might need to do it more, all right, I'll pay, I'll pay their license.

07:47.240 --> 07:47.600
Fine.

07:47.880 --> 07:50.040
It says instant activation right at the top of the website.

07:50.040 --> 07:51.240
So I think I'm going to be golden.

07:53.360 --> 07:59.040
Well, it was labor day and the TeamViewer staff was off that day, Alex, and nobody

07:59.040 --> 08:01.160
was there to issue me my license.

08:01.160 --> 08:02.720
Wait, that's not automated.

08:03.520 --> 08:04.640
That's not instant either.

08:05.040 --> 08:08.880
And so the time comes, we're like five minutes.

08:08.960 --> 08:10.160
I still haven't gotten activated.

08:10.160 --> 08:12.360
In fact, it took till the next day until I got activated.

08:12.600 --> 08:18.680
I was so angry, but I figured out that if I did a new install on a new Linux

08:18.680 --> 08:22.360
box and connected from the first time from that machine to the other machine

08:22.360 --> 08:25.400
that I was getting blocked on, I could do it from that machine with the free

08:25.400 --> 08:29.720
account and I got the stream up and running with like two minutes to spare.

08:29.720 --> 08:33.840
And I had to then like, just let all of that fade and just focus on the show and,

08:33.920 --> 08:38.560
and sit with the fact that I spent that nearly $700 and still didn't have the

08:38.560 --> 08:40.640
license and I just had to sit with that while I did the show.

08:42.040 --> 08:48.160
And so I, in that moment, to resign myself to find a free self-hostable

08:48.160 --> 08:51.800
replacement for TeamViewer, I would not let this happen to me again.

08:52.800 --> 08:56.760
And I did some shopping, I found a couple of different options.

08:57.000 --> 08:57.280
I don't know.

08:57.280 --> 09:00.240
Have you looked in this area yourself before a TeamViewer replacement?

09:00.240 --> 09:04.680
No, they've never actually got me with that, uh, admin stuff detected.

09:04.680 --> 09:08.320
I used to use it quite a bit to help family members back in the day.

09:08.320 --> 09:13.200
But, uh, lately, I don't know, technology's matured to the point where I don't often

09:13.240 --> 09:15.240
need to remote into their systems anymore.

09:15.240 --> 09:20.360
So, well, and in a lot of cases, something like WireGuard with VNC

09:20.440 --> 09:25.720
would do mostly what you need in, in a lot of cases, but in my case, I sometimes

09:25.720 --> 09:27.920
am behind a double NAT, I need to be able to traverse that.

09:27.920 --> 09:29.520
I need to do it from a mobile device.

09:29.520 --> 09:32.960
I need to be able to do it from a Linux box, a Mac box, you know, anything like that.

09:32.960 --> 09:34.640
Yeah, that's where TeamViewer is really nice.

09:34.640 --> 09:36.560
It just, it just punches through everything.

09:37.280 --> 09:39.760
So if you've never used it before, it's pretty slick actually.

09:39.760 --> 09:44.640
You type in a, like a nine digit code, which identifies the other person's server.

09:44.960 --> 09:48.160
And then they give you a five or six character password that you type in.

09:48.760 --> 09:50.800
And, uh, yeah, that's how you do it.

09:50.800 --> 09:54.400
You just connect like that and punches through every firewall inbound, outbound,

09:54.400 --> 09:57.520
whatever bounces off their servers and just works.

09:58.320 --> 10:01.400
And it makes those remote support situations so much more streamlined with

10:01.400 --> 10:03.720
that code and, uh, it's simple.

10:04.360 --> 10:10.520
I tried a few things and RustDesk came across my, I don't know, maybe it was an

10:10.520 --> 10:12.040
email, but it came across my path.

10:12.080 --> 10:14.200
And, uh, if you did send it to the show, thank you.

10:14.200 --> 10:30.280
Cause I eventually did get a chance to try it out and I really, really like RustDesk.

10:30.280 --> 10:33.280
As the name implies, it is built, it is built in Rust.

10:33.920 --> 10:36.720
The client, the front end is open source.

10:36.720 --> 10:40.920
They have one for basically every major OS, including your Linux is out there.

10:41.320 --> 10:43.280
The front end client is really clean and simple.

10:43.280 --> 10:47.040
It's a lot like a simplified front end for team viewer.

10:47.280 --> 10:49.720
It runs as a backend service on Linux.

10:49.720 --> 10:53.200
So you don't even necessarily have to have, have it up and running on your screen.

10:53.200 --> 10:54.680
It'll install itself as a service.

10:55.320 --> 10:56.560
There is a server component.

10:56.800 --> 10:59.480
Now, by default, you can use their server.

11:00.120 --> 11:02.040
You can use their, their server.

11:02.080 --> 11:03.680
I think there's really no restrictions on it.

11:03.680 --> 11:07.560
I was able to connect to three machines simultaneously using their free server.

11:08.600 --> 11:12.320
They do say though, right on their front page, our server resources are limited.

11:12.320 --> 11:14.480
So please set up your own server.

11:14.760 --> 11:17.480
And that's where this gets a little tricky.

11:17.760 --> 11:26.040
You can pay $200 a year, which is a lot less than 700 for their server, which is

11:26.040 --> 11:29.920
all set up and nice and lets you do all kinds of connections and you can run it

11:29.920 --> 11:34.720
on your own box for a year, but you know, $200 is a lot for some people.

11:34.720 --> 11:38.720
So they've also made a demo server available is what they call it.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.720
Now this demo server is significantly limited.

11:41.720 --> 11:45.520
Only one relay connection allowed, no NAT traversal.

11:46.120 --> 11:49.880
You really kind of have to be prepared for like a very limited experience, but

11:49.880 --> 11:51.960
it's a demo server that's quote unquote free.

11:51.960 --> 11:52.760
It's open source.

11:53.560 --> 11:54.920
You could run it on your machine right now.

11:54.920 --> 12:00.120
They make a Docker container available for it, but because it's open source, the

12:00.120 --> 12:05.120
community could in theory, take their spec implementation and build a more

12:05.120 --> 12:09.080
feature complete self-hostable Rust desk server.

12:09.080 --> 12:12.440
And I think if Rust desk continues to take off and really makes itself an

12:12.440 --> 12:16.120
appealing alternative to team viewer, I could really see the community stepping

12:16.120 --> 12:19.360
up and taking the spec implementation that they make available for free and

12:19.360 --> 12:20.440
building it into something else.

12:20.680 --> 12:21.720
So I'm kind of going all in.

12:21.720 --> 12:23.880
I loaded it on all the machines that I would need to build a

12:23.880 --> 12:24.880
remote support in the studio.

12:25.160 --> 12:26.120
How's the performance?

12:26.120 --> 12:28.880
A lot of these things you mentioned VNC a few minutes ago.

12:29.280 --> 12:33.960
I just have memories of that thing leave just not working very well or not updating

12:33.960 --> 12:36.720
the cursor unless something's moving elsewhere on the screen.

12:36.800 --> 12:37.520
How's this work?

12:37.800 --> 12:38.120
Oh yeah.

12:38.120 --> 12:42.960
Oh yeah, so many old cursor problems with VNC and are watching like the, the, the

12:42.960 --> 12:46.000
screen paint as it, as you wait.

12:46.040 --> 12:46.240
Yeah.

12:47.000 --> 12:47.960
No, it's good.

12:47.960 --> 12:48.480
It's great.

12:48.480 --> 12:51.760
In fact, I'd say it is absolutely comparable with team viewers performance.

12:52.480 --> 12:55.440
I didn't get a chance to dig in under the hood to see what they're using.

12:55.440 --> 13:01.040
If they're using VNC, it is absolutely by far the fastest, bestest, most

13:01.040 --> 13:03.320
incredible implementation of VNC I've ever seen.

13:03.600 --> 13:06.440
I'd suspect it must be something else though, because the performance is great.

13:06.440 --> 13:11.920
There's no mouse ghosting and I was absolutely happy even while having three

13:11.920 --> 13:13.440
connections going simultaneously.

13:13.880 --> 13:16.720
Well, that's the beauty of it being open source, right?

13:17.480 --> 13:18.560
We can go and have a look if we want.

13:18.920 --> 13:20.480
You can, we could go dig around it.

13:20.480 --> 13:23.840
In fact, if the community has another one that they like, I know there's a few out

13:23.840 --> 13:25.800
there that kind of are trying to solve this problem.

13:25.800 --> 13:26.320
Let us know.

13:26.800 --> 13:29.200
Self-hosted.show slash contact.

13:29.280 --> 13:30.960
Now just looking through the source code.

13:30.960 --> 13:35.360
I mean, there there's a file in the source called windows.cc and it mentions

13:35.360 --> 13:38.360
ultra VNC has RDP support.

13:38.440 --> 13:41.360
Do you need to use a normal VNC client for this?

13:41.360 --> 13:42.880
Or do they provide everything that you need?

13:43.080 --> 13:43.240
Yep.

13:43.240 --> 13:48.280
They bring, you install the client on your OS and you can set up a session

13:48.280 --> 13:49.880
ID, you plug it in there and it connects.

13:49.880 --> 13:53.040
Once you connect once it saves it in a recent sessions area.

13:53.040 --> 13:55.640
So you can just double click to reconnect to the machine again.

13:56.040 --> 13:59.520
Then once you're in there, you get a viewer that lets you scale the screen

13:59.520 --> 14:02.280
image or set it to the actual resolution.

14:02.280 --> 14:05.240
And it has a little bar along the top that lets you switch between multiple

14:05.240 --> 14:05.720
monitors.

14:05.720 --> 14:09.360
If you're remoting into a system that has multiple screens, and it also gives

14:09.360 --> 14:12.960
you a few other quick options that you might want, like send a few keystrokes

14:12.960 --> 14:14.280
and, and stuff like that.

14:14.920 --> 14:18.680
And the UI, when you launch it, the remote either to connect to someone, or if you

14:18.680 --> 14:22.160
want to allow an inbound connection, it's just that one UI and it gives you your

14:22.160 --> 14:24.160
ID and you set a password right there.

14:24.320 --> 14:24.920
Very cool.

14:24.920 --> 14:25.160
Yeah.

14:25.200 --> 14:26.360
That looks like a great project.

14:26.640 --> 14:27.880
One caveat though.

14:27.880 --> 14:33.080
Unfortunately, at this time does not support Wayland on Linux.

14:33.560 --> 14:36.400
So why is that always a gotcha like this?

14:36.880 --> 14:39.320
Well, it's the nature of the Linux desktop right now.

14:39.600 --> 14:43.160
Uh, but thankfully all of our studio systems, TeamViewer works on Wayland.

14:43.200 --> 14:43.920
Yes, it does.

14:43.960 --> 14:44.600
It does.

14:44.600 --> 14:47.680
And I'm actually, that is one thing I have to give TeamViewer credit for.

14:47.680 --> 14:52.520
And why I went with it is even though it gets a lot of hate, uh, in the technical

14:52.520 --> 14:56.880
community, legitimately, they have been supporting a Linux release now for

14:56.880 --> 15:01.680
a very long time and they are, they support Wayland, they support Gnome Shell,

15:01.680 --> 15:05.320
Plasma, their integration is top-notch and I got to give them credit for it.

15:05.320 --> 15:06.360
Like they've built a good product.

15:06.360 --> 15:07.720
That's why I was willing to pay for it.

15:08.200 --> 15:11.880
It's just the way that went about the delay and then the fact that I have to

15:11.880 --> 15:16.240
pay that every single year, it's just not my bag and I always prefer to self host

15:16.240 --> 15:20.440
if I can, and now I just have to decide, do I want the spec server or do I want

15:20.440 --> 15:22.840
to pay for the Rust desk server?

15:23.240 --> 15:25.640
I got to make that decision, but I'll play with it some more.

15:25.640 --> 15:26.880
And decide in the future.

15:27.240 --> 15:27.880
All right, very good.

15:28.080 --> 15:31.720
Now, moving on, have you seen this website, shucks.top?

15:31.880 --> 15:33.440
No, I've never heard of this.

15:33.480 --> 15:34.480
Uh, what is this?

15:34.640 --> 15:40.640
Somebody put it in the Discord, of course, and this website lists you all the

15:40.640 --> 15:42.960
different drives that are suitable to be shucked.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.400
You know how I like shucking drives.

15:44.440 --> 15:44.960
I do.

15:45.200 --> 15:50.040
And, uh, normally it's a dashboard of which retailer has which shuckable drive

15:50.040 --> 15:55.400
on sale, but right now, thanks to crypto and this annoying, annoying, annoying

15:55.400 --> 16:02.480
new Chia coin thing that, uh, you can mine coins on hard drives, apparently, uh,

16:02.720 --> 16:06.000
hard drives, just like everything else now are in short supply.

16:06.640 --> 16:07.520
You got to be kidding me.

16:07.520 --> 16:07.960
Really?

16:08.160 --> 16:12.360
Yeah, no, I want storage prices to be going down right now because I have a, I

16:12.360 --> 16:15.040
have a big plan to buy a lot of disc around November.

16:15.800 --> 16:16.440
Dang it.

16:16.640 --> 16:19.400
So, uh, you know, yeah, you're a big shucker.

16:19.400 --> 16:23.960
For those of you who don't know the term, you get a USB enclosure, hard drive,

16:23.960 --> 16:27.640
and you shuck that enclosure and you get the disc out of it.

16:27.680 --> 16:28.680
You know, it's like a coconut.

16:29.000 --> 16:33.280
You get, you get the husk off and you pull out the coconut and, um, sometimes

16:33.280 --> 16:36.880
it's delicious and sometimes it's, uh, not so good.

16:37.280 --> 16:38.840
Well, sometimes it isn't so good.

16:38.840 --> 16:43.160
Actually this week, I, uh, I've had two hard drives sale on me this week,

16:43.200 --> 16:45.040
both shucked Seagates.

16:45.080 --> 16:46.080
Oh no, man.

16:46.560 --> 16:50.600
I've got a bunch of, uh, older Western digital drives, uh,

16:50.640 --> 16:52.120
approaching three years old.

16:52.120 --> 16:56.720
And so what I wanted to start doing was buying a disc every quarter, give or take

16:56.720 --> 17:00.880
to start kind of staggering their dates so that the bathtub curve, um, that I

17:00.880 --> 17:04.760
don't fall victim to that, which is, you know, if every, if everything's the same

17:04.760 --> 17:08.920
age with the same environmental life conditions, the chances that they're going

17:08.920 --> 17:12.000
to fail all at the same time is reasonably high.

17:12.000 --> 17:15.360
So I wanted to try and protect myself from that a little bit.

17:15.400 --> 17:18.640
Um, and so I bought a couple of these Seagate drives earlier in the year.

17:18.640 --> 17:24.280
I think I talked about it on the show and both of these Seagate, 10 terabyte, uh,

17:24.400 --> 17:30.000
what are they Barracuda pros have both just decided this week at exactly the

17:30.000 --> 17:34.760
same time, despite my burn in tests and everything else that, uh, this week was

17:34.760 --> 17:36.080
the week they were going to give up the ghost.

17:36.600 --> 17:37.240
Oh man.

17:37.240 --> 17:38.360
I'm so sorry to hear that.

17:38.400 --> 17:40.720
Uh, nobody ever wants to deal with that.

17:40.720 --> 17:41.880
Any data loss happen?

17:41.960 --> 17:43.080
No, no data loss.

17:43.120 --> 17:46.360
One of the drives was being used in ZFS and the other one was on merger FS.

17:46.360 --> 17:50.480
So snap rate did its thing perfectly and so did ZFS.

17:50.520 --> 17:51.760
So we're all good, baby.

17:53.840 --> 17:55.960
Linode.com slash SSH.

17:55.960 --> 17:58.720
Go there to get $100 in credit and support the show.

17:59.040 --> 18:02.280
No matter what skill level you're at or what technology stack you use Linode can

18:02.280 --> 18:04.200
help your ideas come to life on the web.

18:04.520 --> 18:05.600
You're going to be impressed.

18:05.800 --> 18:08.800
And when you get that $100, you can really try it out.

18:08.840 --> 18:11.680
Alex, I don't think I told you yet, but I set up file run.

18:11.920 --> 18:14.000
You know, you recommended it to us on Linux unplugged.

18:14.040 --> 18:14.880
Oh, good.

18:14.960 --> 18:15.480
Yeah.

18:15.480 --> 18:19.880
Yeah, I set up a Linode, a couple of, well, it's been about a week now for the

18:19.880 --> 18:24.560
elementary development summit and they're using file run to upload all of their

18:24.560 --> 18:26.480
videos and stuff for the summit.

18:27.160 --> 18:30.080
We were going to do a next cloud instance, but just file run seemed to make so much

18:30.080 --> 18:34.640
more sense, a lot more straightforward for the, for the presenters to way simpler.

18:35.280 --> 18:36.600
And it was really easy.

18:36.600 --> 18:39.880
I I've told the story before, but it actually got, I got it all set up using

18:39.880 --> 18:43.440
Linode's one click Docker deployment, which is in my case, I chose Debian, but

18:43.440 --> 18:44.400
you've got a couple options there.

18:44.400 --> 18:48.480
Debian Docker basic set up with Docker compose pre-installed and all of the

18:48.480 --> 18:49.440
right repos set up.

18:49.800 --> 18:54.120
And so I deploy that and then I just grab the Docker compose from the project for

18:54.120 --> 18:59.080
file run and had it up and running before the DNS had switched over for the website.

18:59.440 --> 19:01.640
And it was just like a no brainer.

19:01.640 --> 19:04.840
And then later on, you know, of course, West West is always like, you know, we

19:04.840 --> 19:10.920
could do, we could mount the S3 object storage and then use that for the storage

19:10.920 --> 19:14.440
for file run, so we don't have to worry about them filling up the disk.

19:14.480 --> 19:16.560
And I'm like, of course I'm on board with that.

19:16.600 --> 19:19.280
I love stacking those Linode services together.

19:19.600 --> 19:21.920
Their dashboard makes us really simple and straightforward.

19:21.920 --> 19:24.160
You can use their cloud firewall to protect your system.

19:24.480 --> 19:27.640
Then you can deploy a Linode to run your application, and then you can use object

19:27.640 --> 19:32.040
storage on the backend to essentially have addressable storage that expands as

19:32.080 --> 19:32.840
you need it.

19:33.160 --> 19:35.120
Yeah, there's a lot of ways to crack that.

19:35.120 --> 19:37.040
And if any of that sounds complicated, don't worry.

19:37.040 --> 19:40.080
It's also really simple to just get started with a standard box.

19:40.080 --> 19:42.280
Really easy with just a couple of clicks.

19:42.440 --> 19:45.680
It's a great opportunity to learn with that one hundred dollar credit as well.

19:45.920 --> 19:49.080
They have this powerful system with this simple interface.

19:49.480 --> 19:53.480
So many people make that claim, but it's actually extremely hard to get that

19:53.480 --> 19:54.200
balance right.

19:54.360 --> 19:57.840
And the reason why Linode gets it right is because they've been attempting this

19:57.880 --> 20:02.920
since 2003 and through just working at this and listening to their customers and

20:02.920 --> 20:07.920
building it just focused on delivering the best virtualized cloud computing and

20:07.920 --> 20:12.240
having that focus since 2003, they've gotten to this point where they have this

20:12.240 --> 20:13.560
marvelous system now.

20:13.680 --> 20:18.120
So go use our one hundred dollar credit at linode.com slash SSH to try it out.

20:18.360 --> 20:20.440
And yeah, the performance is fantastic, too.

20:20.680 --> 20:21.880
We love getting your stories.

20:21.880 --> 20:23.680
So let us know how your switch to Linode is going.

20:23.960 --> 20:26.160
Linode.com slash SSH.

20:28.160 --> 20:32.080
Now, I'm reluctant to even bring this up, to be honest with you, because the open

20:32.080 --> 20:36.840
source community is well known for over egging the pudding when it comes to

20:36.840 --> 20:42.040
drama, but the more I dug into this story, the more I felt like it was worth

20:42.040 --> 20:43.280
the discussion on the show.

20:43.320 --> 20:49.080
So this week, Home Assistant developer Frank, you've probably seen his name

20:49.280 --> 20:50.880
everywhere over Home Assistant.

20:50.880 --> 20:56.720
He is a prolific contributor to the project, spelled F-R-E-N-C-K.

20:57.480 --> 21:03.760
He jumped into a NixOS GitHub pull request and made what seems on the face

21:03.760 --> 21:10.000
of it, like a really simple request. He says, as the author of the package, I'm

21:10.000 --> 21:12.760
asking it to not be repackaged here.

21:13.720 --> 21:15.000
Sounds straightforward enough, right?

21:15.480 --> 21:16.160
I suppose.

21:16.160 --> 21:20.680
I mean, it's MIT licensed, so he doesn't really have the authority to make that

21:20.680 --> 21:21.200
request.

21:21.360 --> 21:22.320
Well, that's just it, isn't it?

21:22.520 --> 21:22.800
Yeah.

21:22.800 --> 21:25.280
I mean, there's the spirit of the developer's intention.

21:25.840 --> 21:30.280
And then there's the letter of the law, which says that NixOS, which is a Linux

21:30.280 --> 21:35.320
distribution that's very technical, very niche, and very awesome if you're into

21:35.320 --> 21:41.880
declared systems that are kind of just super, super niche, NixOS is great, but it

21:41.880 --> 21:46.200
is a Linux distribution just like Ubuntu or Debian, they package these things up

21:46.200 --> 21:47.000
into their own repos.

21:47.280 --> 21:48.600
Well, here's the thing as well, right?

21:48.600 --> 21:55.360
Is that NixOS is all about reproducible builds, but for some reason Fedora felt

21:55.360 --> 22:01.600
the need to package this Amby Python library as well. And as the thread

22:01.600 --> 22:07.520
transpired on GitHub, Frank started to get a little more petulant, dare I say, as

22:07.520 --> 22:12.000
time went by, you know, he started off by saying, I have no emotional investment,

22:12.040 --> 22:18.120
no emotional attachment to this issue. And then a few posts later, this by the

22:18.120 --> 22:23.360
way has moved out of GitHub onto the Home Assistant forum by this point. He goes

22:23.360 --> 22:27.440
from saying, I've got no emotional attachment to saying, sorry to hear you

22:27.440 --> 22:31.880
don't respect requests from authors who wrote the source you rely on, the author

22:31.880 --> 22:35.840
that has put in the effort to create it in the first place. Always good to know a

22:35.840 --> 22:39.280
project doesn't care. I mean, come on.

22:39.520 --> 22:43.760
In my opinion, I would characterize a lot of his responses as short and somewhat

22:43.760 --> 22:49.240
hostile and snippy. People ask him like, they come back with very reasonable

22:49.240 --> 22:52.960
counter suggestions and proposals that have been that are well thought out. And

22:52.960 --> 22:58.720
he responds with trite one sentence responses that are sort of demeaning.

22:58.840 --> 23:05.920
Yeah, one example of that is that Nick's OS offered, we will set a config flag in

23:05.920 --> 23:10.720
the OS that reads, except that this package is not supported by upstream

23:10.720 --> 23:14.920
developers, and I will go to Nick's packages to report any issues equals

23:14.920 --> 23:19.240
true. And Frank was still unhappy with that. So

23:19.480 --> 23:24.160
here's what I think here, Alex, because the core argument that Frank had was, he

23:24.160 --> 23:30.040
was concerned this would lead to user support requests on him. He was concerned

23:30.040 --> 23:32.920
that people would install Home Assistant and all of these packages and

23:32.920 --> 23:38.320
dependencies on Nick's OS, run into some problem with their setup at some point

23:38.320 --> 23:42.160
that led them to the Ambly library. And then from there, they would dissect the

23:42.160 --> 23:46.240
source code and the original author, suss out his contact information or his

23:46.240 --> 23:52.400
GitHub, and then file a issue support request or email with Frank. After that

23:52.400 --> 23:58.600
process. Now, I've been in this for quite a while. And I could tell you, I bet you

23:58.600 --> 24:02.600
a good steak dinner that the totality of people that would do that over say, like

24:02.600 --> 24:07.840
a five to 10 year period would probably be a handful, you know, under a dozen

24:07.840 --> 24:13.640
because let's be honest, Nick Nick's OS is an extremely niche Linux distribution.

24:13.960 --> 24:18.560
Then the ability to entertain who the developer is. Well, actually, the ability

24:18.560 --> 24:23.240
to entertain what particular library is even causing you a problem is a niche

24:23.240 --> 24:27.280
skill set. The ability to entertain which developer created that one library

24:27.280 --> 24:31.280
that's creating you a problem is also a niche skill set. So you get my point like

24:31.280 --> 24:35.680
it's his main concern was that he'd be getting support requests when in reality

24:35.680 --> 24:38.440
that just doesn't seem likely. That's not going to that's not going to result

24:38.440 --> 24:39.840
from this inclusion in Nick's OS,

24:39.880 --> 24:45.880
which raises the question, you know, if you don't want your stuff to be used and

24:45.880 --> 24:49.960
packaged by other people, like this, I mean, the whole point of open source

24:49.960 --> 24:54.880
licensing is that you're giving your code away, you still retain intellectual

24:54.880 --> 25:00.160
property over it, you still, air quotes, own it, but you don't own what people can

25:00.160 --> 25:05.440
do with it. And for me, that raises the question why he's even publishing it as

25:05.440 --> 25:09.640
open source code in the first place, if he doesn't want people to do this?

25:09.680 --> 25:11.360
Yeah, that's, that's a good question.

25:11.400 --> 25:14.200
It's a tricky one, because if you think about the way in which Home Assistant

25:14.200 --> 25:19.720
itself is licensed, that uses the permissive Apache two license. And that

25:19.720 --> 25:23.680
doesn't really impose very many strict restrictions at all on derivative works.

25:24.000 --> 25:29.440
If Home Assistant then includes any GPL licensed stuff, at that point, you're

25:29.440 --> 25:36.160
going to, at that point, you then have a whole other can of worms about what

25:36.160 --> 25:41.160
would, what would happen next. And I think, for me, I get a little concerned

25:41.160 --> 25:46.080
when I see how Paulus, who was on the show a couple of episodes ago, jumped

25:46.080 --> 25:49.680
into that Home Assistant thread, all of these links will be in the show notes, by

25:49.680 --> 25:55.960
the way, and basically just locked the thread, closed it, and then delisted it,

25:55.960 --> 25:57.640
like sweeping the whole thing under the rug.

25:57.640 --> 26:01.480
All of this is that behavior of shutting down the forms and not really wanting to

26:01.480 --> 26:06.280
engage in a conversation about it, trying to reduce the amount of heat that Frank

26:06.280 --> 26:12.640
is taking, and Frank's response and being so concerned about additional support

26:12.640 --> 26:15.640
requests that he would go to those, you know, he would essentially get in that

26:15.640 --> 26:19.920
argument in that thread. I think all of these are symptomatic of what you and I

26:19.920 --> 26:23.000
have worried about the project for a long time. And that is that the core

26:23.000 --> 26:27.240
developers who are some of, as you mentioned, the most important developers

26:27.240 --> 26:32.360
to the project are beyond what we would consider burned out and that they are on

26:32.360 --> 26:37.280
their very last nerve. And every time we see a public interaction, we witness what

26:37.280 --> 26:42.320
appears to be an individual who is so far at his end of his rope, he has no time to

26:42.320 --> 26:46.320
deal with people talking back to him. He has no time for the possibility that he

26:46.320 --> 26:51.560
might get additional emails. The idea that he might get more emails is upsetting to

26:51.560 --> 26:55.960
him. And then you see Paulus going around and cleaning up the conversation in the

26:55.960 --> 27:00.640
form. So that way it doesn't inundate Frank with all of this, you know, peanut

27:00.640 --> 27:04.440
gallery chatter about it and just to try to get away from the issue as quickly as

27:04.440 --> 27:06.960
possible because he doesn't have time to deal with it and he wants to stay

27:06.960 --> 27:11.360
focused. And I don't really know what the solution here is because that just seems

27:11.360 --> 27:15.280
to be, even if it's not the case, even if this is just Chris's wild opinion, it's

27:15.280 --> 27:20.080
what the public sees every time. And the issue here is this made it out beyond

27:20.080 --> 27:23.360
just the Home Assistant community this time. It made it onto Hacker News and it

27:23.360 --> 27:26.720
had a very robust conversation over there. It was fired up on the forums like

27:26.720 --> 27:30.400
Alex did. It made it to Reddit. It was in our team Slack where we were discussing

27:30.400 --> 27:35.600
this back and forth. Like it made its rounds around the internet and it's not

27:35.600 --> 27:38.920
a good look. It looks like everybody's hot take is, well, they don't know what

27:38.920 --> 27:42.000
open source is. They don't understand how Linux distributions work. Don't they

27:42.000 --> 27:46.640
know it's MIT licensed? And it's clear they're smart guys. They know all of

27:46.640 --> 27:50.880
those things. There's something else going on here and we're just getting

27:50.880 --> 27:54.640
little glimpses of it. See, I think you have a different take. You worry that

27:54.640 --> 27:57.680
maybe one day these guys, because they don't appreciate and understand open

27:57.680 --> 28:00.560
source, are going to take their cake and their ball and they're going to go home

28:00.560 --> 28:02.400
and eat it. Does that make sense? And they're going to convert it to a

28:02.400 --> 28:04.840
commercial product and we're going to be sitting here going, well, wait, now what

28:04.840 --> 28:08.200
do we do? My concern is more the development team just totally burns out

28:08.200 --> 28:11.680
and leaves the project and abandons it and says, well, it's open source. You take

28:11.680 --> 28:12.080
care of it.

28:12.280 --> 28:16.440
I think both scenarios are probably equally likely at this point, although

28:16.440 --> 28:21.760
perhaps going closed source, I mean, we've got precedent for that with MB. We've

28:21.760 --> 28:26.760
seen other projects do that before. I do think Home Assistant is slightly less

28:26.760 --> 28:31.800
likely to do that because just because of the sheer volume of open source

28:31.840 --> 28:35.360
contributions over the years. I think if there was any talk of Home Assistant

28:35.360 --> 28:40.360
itself going closed source, that would get forked in a heartbeat and, you know,

28:41.160 --> 28:45.560
home lover would come out of it instead or whatever you want to call it. And then

28:45.560 --> 28:49.480
Home Assistant just wouldn't be able to keep up with changes without that open

28:49.480 --> 28:55.880
source support. So I don't think it's hugely likely, but I feel like, you know,

28:55.880 --> 29:01.160
all the moves and it's a difficult one because we talked to Paulus recently and

29:01.160 --> 29:04.680
he paints a very rosy picture about the feature of the product and it's a

29:04.680 --> 29:08.640
sustainable one as well. You know, Frank and Paulus and these guys are getting

29:08.640 --> 29:14.640
paid through Nebuchadnezzar, which oftentimes is a reason that these

29:14.640 --> 29:18.880
developers burn out is because it's a side hustle or a side project. For these

29:18.880 --> 29:25.200
guys, it is their job, you know. So I do think we've come to expect a certain

29:25.200 --> 29:29.200
level of access to open source developers like this because of the way

29:29.200 --> 29:33.600
we conduct all of our business in public. I'm sure if we went and looked in some

29:33.600 --> 29:40.280
internal, you know, company email thread named Big Corp here, we'd see similar

29:40.280 --> 29:45.480
levels of emotional attachment and petulance at times. But the difference

29:45.480 --> 29:48.240
here is that it's out for the world to see.

29:48.240 --> 29:51.320
And there is a bit of a spirit of cooperation in the open source

29:51.320 --> 29:54.680
community. A lot of Home Assistant is built on top of a lot of other great

29:54.680 --> 29:58.080
code. And so when somebody comes along and says, yeah, but don't use our open

29:58.080 --> 30:03.440
source code in your project, it doesn't really sit well and it gets noticed. And

30:03.440 --> 30:06.480
I think to your point that, you know, there are full time employees of

30:06.480 --> 30:12.680
Nebuchadnezzar, money is only part of the solution. It is likely that Frank is

30:12.680 --> 30:17.200
such a talented developer and what he works on is so crucial to Home

30:17.200 --> 30:23.400
Assistant. I bet you there is just an unrelenting, never ending amount of work

30:23.680 --> 30:27.200
for him to take on. And, you know, he did some work with the new ESP Home

30:27.200 --> 30:30.480
release that we'll talk about. And he did. Yeah. Yeah, he's done. He's

30:30.480 --> 30:35.280
involved in more things than ever now. And I think there is only so much that

30:35.280 --> 30:39.120
maybe one developer can take on. And when you're talented like he is, you're

30:39.120 --> 30:43.240
going to get you're going to get worked. And I don't know if you've ever read

30:43.240 --> 30:47.120
The Phoenix Project, which is a book about DevOps. It talks about this

30:47.120 --> 30:53.840
concept of a halo engineer who people are afraid of upsetting or touching

30:53.840 --> 30:59.640
systems because this this one guy knows all of the different incantations you

30:59.640 --> 31:04.440
have to say to make something work. I feel like Frank's maneuvering into that

31:04.440 --> 31:08.080
position. And the Home Assistant project is very dependent on him because of his

31:08.080 --> 31:12.080
skills. It's a difficult problem to solve. And it is not unique to Home

31:12.080 --> 31:17.480
Assistant that you end up with this reliance on one talented guy. But I

31:17.480 --> 31:20.720
don't know what the solution is either. Do we all stop collectively emailing

31:20.720 --> 31:22.680
Frank all at once? Maybe?

31:23.840 --> 31:29.440
That might help. Well, why don't we just really quickly talk about ESP Home?

31:29.520 --> 31:34.240
It's now part of Home Assistant. So they're kind of related. And for those

31:34.240 --> 31:40.120
of you who don't recall those those little ESP, what is it 8266? And the ESP

31:40.120 --> 31:43.480
32? Yeah, there's a couple of them. They're made out of China. There's a

31:43.480 --> 31:50.240
company they're called Espressif. And they make ESP 8266 and ESP 32 devices,

31:50.600 --> 31:56.160
little Arduino compatible single board systems that have a Wi Fi chip in them.

31:56.240 --> 31:59.640
You can use them for for all kinds of things like sensors or controllers,

31:59.640 --> 32:05.000
little MQTT devices. And now it's sort of a perfect fit, as you can imagine,

32:05.000 --> 32:08.280
with Home Assistant, because that's a lot of that's a lot of things you'd

32:08.280 --> 32:11.160
want to do with a Home Assistant installation. And so they've rolled out

32:11.160 --> 32:15.680
version 1.19.0. And I think the biggest thing in here is they've added a

32:15.680 --> 32:20.400
feature that's very similar to commercial smart plugs, where you can give

32:20.400 --> 32:23.960
it your Wi Fi information over Bluetooth le and give it the Wi Fi credentials.

32:23.960 --> 32:26.440
That's a huge feature. That's slick. Yeah, I remember Paula's telling us

32:26.440 --> 32:29.800
about that a couple of weeks ago. It's nice to see it actually land in a

32:29.800 --> 32:34.600
release. Now another improvement they've made is that they've been working hard

32:34.600 --> 32:38.320
on some new tooling to make it easier for everyone to install ESP home and

32:38.360 --> 32:42.280
other firmwares on their devices. And to do that, they've created something

32:42.280 --> 32:49.240
called ESP web tools linked in the show notes. Yeah, that's nice to see. And

32:49.240 --> 32:52.640
gonna make it even simpler for people to approach. But don't worry. They're

32:52.640 --> 32:56.960
also improving the command line experience. So both got some love, which

32:56.960 --> 33:01.600
is great to see. And then the other thing that I think puts this into now

33:01.600 --> 33:05.280
I'm very much going to consider devices based on this is, and this is

33:05.280 --> 33:08.240
something I've been waiting for desperately. They're going to add

33:08.360 --> 33:11.240
attributes from Home Assistant now that you're going to be able to save them

33:11.720 --> 33:15.680
into the local sensor on ESP home. So for example, the brightness of a light

33:15.680 --> 33:19.520
so when the light turns on, it resumes the original brightness, or the

33:19.520 --> 33:22.640
current temperature for a climate device. So that way doesn't have to keep

33:22.640 --> 33:26.000
checking in with Home Assistant all the time. To be able to read attributes from

33:26.000 --> 33:28.880
Home Assistant entities, right into the local sensor, I feel like is a

33:28.880 --> 33:31.920
game changing feature. For them. It's just a bullet point in the new release.

33:32.800 --> 33:38.120
And I'm like, Yes, I'm so happy. I've got this like Jonah Hill kind of I'm so

33:38.120 --> 33:42.760
happy GIF playing right now. Yes. Right. Exactly. I think that's pretty great.

33:42.760 --> 33:49.160
So a new ESP home makes me happy. Now in the spirit of embedded devices,

33:49.160 --> 33:54.360
Tasmota has a new release this week, they've just released 9.5.0. Now there

33:54.360 --> 33:58.840
is a breaking change in this release, and lights using the MQTT discovery

33:58.840 --> 34:03.480
protocol will not work correctly in recent versions of Home Assistant. So

34:03.560 --> 34:08.760
upgrade to 9.5 and use the Tasmota integration to work around that problem.

34:10.440 --> 34:13.480
We want to thank our friends over at a cloud guru for sponsoring this your

34:13.480 --> 34:17.480
program and let you know about their hands on with podman containers on

34:17.480 --> 34:21.000
Linux course, which is free for the month of June. And of course, it'll

34:21.000 --> 34:24.040
still be available for members when you go over there. This course, you're

34:24.040 --> 34:26.840
going to learn what containers are. So you're going to get some basics there,

34:27.080 --> 34:30.440
but also then how to manage them and specifically how to manage them using

34:30.440 --> 34:35.560
podman, how podman interoperates with Kubernetes and system D. And, of course,

34:35.720 --> 34:40.200
because it's the new way now, how to manage podman using cockpit, which is

34:40.200 --> 34:44.040
the web graphical interface that I actually think is pretty great. But

34:44.040 --> 34:46.600
don't mention it to Alex, it upsets him. But you can go over there, we'll have

34:46.600 --> 34:51.320
a link in the show notes. And you can check out hands on with podman

34:51.320 --> 34:54.200
containers on Linux for a cloud guru, which is free in June. But then, of

34:54.200 --> 34:57.000
course, will be available on the platform link in the show notes.

34:59.400 --> 35:03.560
Probably time we need some feedback, eh? Yeah, I think so. I feel like it.

35:03.800 --> 35:07.720
Corey wrote in he wants to get social, but he wants to do without social

35:07.720 --> 35:12.040
media. He says, Hey, longtime listener and even long timer self-hosted. I

35:12.040 --> 35:15.960
love the show. And he says with more and more things going online only in

35:15.960 --> 35:20.680
person interactions are getting to be more sparse. I found lately I need to

35:20.680 --> 35:24.600
put conscious effort into keeping up with friends and family checking in

35:24.600 --> 35:28.440
from time to time and or even taking notes about something they've mentioned

35:28.440 --> 35:33.800
to follow up on. Wow. You know what, Corey? I'm just realizing I should be

35:33.800 --> 35:39.080
doing that. He says Corey goes on to say I was curious if anyone had a tech

35:39.080 --> 35:42.760
solution for this. Some sort of like contact management thing where you

35:42.760 --> 35:46.360
could make notes about a project or vacation they mentioned. So you could

35:46.360 --> 35:50.680
ask them about it later on or or even set reminders like. Hey, self, you

35:50.680 --> 35:55.320
haven't talked to X in four weeks, maybe check in on them or maybe some

35:55.320 --> 35:59.480
sort of reminder about their vacation and asking them how it went. Perhaps

35:59.480 --> 36:02.280
it sounds a bit dumb, but I think I could put it to use, especially after

36:02.280 --> 36:06.520
college or school when friends kind of go their own way. So is there

36:06.520 --> 36:09.560
something out there? What would you guys do? Thanks. Well, at first I

36:09.560 --> 36:12.920
thought the question was about social media, and I kind of had a sinking

36:12.920 --> 36:16.600
feeling that self hosting your own social media kind of defeats the point

36:16.600 --> 36:20.840
of social media. And then as the question carried on, I sort of was

36:20.840 --> 36:24.360
listening and realized that actually what he's looking for is a basically

36:24.360 --> 36:28.840
a customer relationship management system. And there is a really good one

36:28.840 --> 36:35.240
in this space in the self hosted space called Monica at Monica HQ.com. And

36:35.240 --> 36:39.240
this essentially lets you set reminders for all sorts of things like the

36:39.240 --> 36:43.480
names of the children of all of your friends, wedding anniversaries, the

36:43.480 --> 36:47.480
last time you called them and talked to talk to them about the weather or

36:47.480 --> 36:51.800
whatever it might be. Monica lets you quickly and easily log all that

36:51.800 --> 36:57.000
information so you can be a better friend, family member or spouse. I kind

36:57.000 --> 37:00.600
of think this is a great idea, actually. Or I could see it, you know, for

37:00.600 --> 37:04.040
like keeping track of what you guys have going on, you know, for the

37:04.040 --> 37:07.320
JB team members. So that way I'm not like rude and just forgetting the

37:07.320 --> 37:11.000
important things that you guys have going on, you know, like this could

37:11.000 --> 37:14.600
make me a better team member. Well, good news. They have an official

37:14.600 --> 37:17.720
Docker image over at Docker Hub. I might give it a look. If I remember

37:17.720 --> 37:21.320
after the show, I might give it a try. Yeah, essentially it's a digital

37:21.320 --> 37:25.720
Rolodex. Yeah, I think that actually be pretty useful. OK, so the Hom writes

37:25.720 --> 37:31.160
in and this is about cooling Raspberry Pi's in your famous RV server seat

37:31.160 --> 37:34.920
without cutting big holes in it. He's got a couple of suggestions about

37:34.920 --> 37:39.320
using water cooling, actually, to cool the air inside the box rather than

37:39.320 --> 37:44.440
the pies themselves. I had not even considered water cooling a Raspberry

37:44.440 --> 37:49.400
Pi before. That actually be a pretty cool project, wouldn't it? So how

37:49.400 --> 37:52.520
would that work? If you think about it, you'd put a radiator inside the

37:52.520 --> 37:57.000
seat that would act as a heat sink, I suppose, because the thing about

37:57.000 --> 37:59.880
water cooling rigs that I always I've never done water cooling in my

37:59.880 --> 38:03.080
life. I've always wanted to, but it's always just been that notch more

38:03.080 --> 38:07.880
expensive than I'm willing to go. Yeah, whenever I see that Linus Tech Tips

38:07.880 --> 38:11.320
or whoever mucking about with water cooling, they've got these big shiny

38:11.320 --> 38:15.720
copper heat sinks directly attached to the motherboard or whatever to the

38:15.720 --> 38:21.880
CPU. I just how would you transfer the heat from the seat to the radiator?

38:21.880 --> 38:25.000
I guess is the question. That is a good question. I think the way you'd have

38:25.000 --> 38:27.720
to do it is you'd have to get something that sits on the pie. So I'd have to

38:27.720 --> 38:30.920
get rid of my flirt cases that I like and get something that affixes to

38:30.920 --> 38:35.320
the hot components on the pie. Affix it to the flirt cases because

38:35.320 --> 38:39.880
they are a heat sink themselves, right? Maybe, maybe, maybe. I'd also

38:39.880 --> 38:42.840
want like a plate that I could attach to a router. You'd want a couple

38:42.840 --> 38:46.520
of different or maybe something for the switch and you'd run water

38:46.520 --> 38:50.680
cooling through those plates into a radiator that I guess you could maybe

38:50.680 --> 38:53.480
put it in the booth, but I think for better cooling you'd need the radiator

38:53.480 --> 38:58.040
outside the booth. Clearly this needs better planning, but I like where

38:58.040 --> 39:01.720
the home's going with this. It's an idea I actually had not considered and

39:01.720 --> 39:06.840
anything would be better than cutting a hole in the side of my RV. However,

39:06.840 --> 39:10.920
the pies are only part of the problem because the other situation I have

39:10.920 --> 39:14.760
is the electrical system with the Victron equipment and the batteries.

39:14.760 --> 39:19.000
When I'm running solar and so I'm taking in a whole bunch of solar which

39:19.000 --> 39:23.560
generates heat surprisingly and then also running air conditioning so I'm

39:23.560 --> 39:28.920
inverting solar power into air conditioning when it's really hot out.

39:28.920 --> 39:34.040
So like say above 95 degrees or 90 ish even that just generates a lot of

39:34.040 --> 39:37.640
heat in itself. Then you combine that with when I've been driving the

39:37.640 --> 39:43.000
drivetrain is very hot which is behind the power bay. So it's a lot of

39:43.000 --> 39:46.440
ambient heat and what I have to do to keep it running is I have to get

39:46.440 --> 39:49.640
airflow going through there. So I don't think I could water cool the

39:49.640 --> 39:53.800
Victron equipment. So it would only solve the Raspberry Pi problem but definitely

39:53.800 --> 39:56.280
worth considering. I'm going to actually go do a little googling tonight and

39:56.280 --> 39:57.240
see what I can find.

39:57.240 --> 40:02.280
Yeah I mean like maybe with hard drives you don't need a huge amount of

40:02.280 --> 40:07.480
airflow over them you just need some and maybe you could make that fan pull

40:07.480 --> 40:11.720
double duty of doing the water cooling and also blowing air over the

40:11.720 --> 40:13.720
drivetrain and battery bay.

40:13.720 --> 40:16.920
Well Alex I think you better come out here and set a few weeks aside so we

40:16.920 --> 40:18.440
can start getting to work on this project.

40:18.440 --> 40:21.000
Maybe yeah it's episode 50 before we know it.

40:21.640 --> 40:25.160
Yeah maybe that would be fun wouldn't it? I don't know though I'm pretty

40:25.160 --> 40:29.560
nervous about it. Pretty nervous about cutting holes. I'll come to some

40:29.560 --> 40:33.240
solution and when I do I'll share it but in the meantime let's talk about

40:33.240 --> 40:36.520
something that'd be simple. Something maybe I won't have to mess too much

40:36.520 --> 40:36.840
with.

40:36.840 --> 40:40.280
Yeah we've got an app pick for you all this week called Tiny Home. This is a

40:40.280 --> 40:45.400
simple static homepage generator. There's a link to it in the show notes and if

40:45.400 --> 40:49.000
you head on over there you'll see there's a link to an example demo site.

40:49.560 --> 40:53.960
And the demo site is just it's so simple it's just headings with a couple of

40:53.960 --> 40:57.240
buttons on it you know so if you want to put all of your different self-hosted

40:57.720 --> 41:01.480
web apps it's basically a collection of links you know like Heimdall, like

41:01.480 --> 41:05.880
Homer, like Organizer all those kind of things except this is a statically

41:06.520 --> 41:09.720
generated super simple little website.

41:09.720 --> 41:12.360
Yeah and I think it just generates it from bash scripts or some kind of

41:12.360 --> 41:16.120
script so it's really easy for you to manage it and just spit out a static

41:16.120 --> 41:19.080
website. That's pretty nice. That's pretty nice.

41:19.080 --> 41:22.920
Yeah just generate a little CSV file and the static generator will do the

41:22.920 --> 41:23.400
rest.

41:24.360 --> 41:28.840
Gosh that is easy. If you're still mulling over Google photo alternatives

41:28.840 --> 41:33.080
check out Alex on Linux Unplugged 409. He joined us to talk about some of his

41:33.080 --> 41:36.440
favorites and some of the ones we've covered on this show before but with a

41:36.440 --> 41:40.680
few updates that's at linuxunplugged.com 409.
