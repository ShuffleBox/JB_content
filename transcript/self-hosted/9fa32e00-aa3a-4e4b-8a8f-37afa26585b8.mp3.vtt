WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.820
Coming up on self-hosted 12. I'm back from the forest and Oregon was solar on board

00:05.160 --> 00:11.760
Alex has gone nuts and installed wikis for two weeks and then he'll tell us about his robot vacuum

00:12.160 --> 00:17.120
That runs a bantu. I'm Chris and I'm Alex and this is self-hosted

00:18.360 --> 00:23.680
So you're back from Oregon now. How was the the epic road trip? It was a bit epic. It was pretty great

00:23.680 --> 00:28.920
it was it was a lot of everything including some dad kid time and

00:28.920 --> 00:32.160
Some husband-wife time because it was two different trips

00:32.160 --> 00:35.840
And of course getting the solar system and the electrical system installed in the RV

00:36.240 --> 00:41.400
Went pretty good. Actually, I'd say best-case scenario. The audience was right. They were riding in they said Chris

00:41.400 --> 00:42.160
That's not enough solar

00:42.160 --> 00:42.940
If you're gonna do it

00:42.940 --> 00:47.360
You got to do it right and go for more solar and I got down there and I was looking at the draw of my

00:47.440 --> 00:49.640
Refrigerator and all that kind of stuff and they were right

00:50.120 --> 00:54.680
So we went with a total of six panels on lady jubes because you've got this big-ass

00:54.680 --> 00:58.160
Normal house refrigerator in your car on wheels

00:59.840 --> 01:04.720
It does pull a lot it's I didn't really appreciate that when I bought it, but yet it's so much space

01:05.040 --> 01:08.760
So we have we have somewhere in the range of one point two kilowatts of solar

01:08.960 --> 01:13.720
Potential power now on the roof that goes into six six hundred amp hours of lithium-ion

01:14.480 --> 01:20.880
Battery storage from battle born and then we got a victor on 3000 watt inverter all installed rocking

01:20.880 --> 01:22.760
We spent the night there at in their parking lot

01:22.760 --> 01:26.400
They let us stay in their lot, which I thought was pretty great because if anything were to blow up

01:26.400 --> 01:28.400
I wanted to be right there. Yeah

01:29.040 --> 01:34.060
Because it's a big job, but I went pretty good. It's thrilled really with the results thrilled

01:34.440 --> 01:39.200
So has it been everything that you dreamed of I assume from your thrilled word that it is

01:39.320 --> 01:43.800
It was a little bit more. I mean honestly all said and done. I didn't quite

01:44.520 --> 01:45.800
fully

01:45.800 --> 01:52.080
Realize all of the changes it was gonna mean for us. I'm really kind of still in the fate than the testing and learning stages

01:52.080 --> 01:54.920
It's a really complicated system, but I am documenting it

01:54.920 --> 02:02.520
I launched a podcast that just sort of dedicate all that stuff around the RV at work life and RV podcast work life and RV

02:02.520 --> 02:04.440
comm and I'm

02:04.440 --> 02:07.960
right now in the learning phase then I'm gonna go into the testing phase and

02:09.000 --> 02:11.960
Try to just get my head wrapped around it because it's pretty complex

02:12.640 --> 02:14.080
but it's also

02:14.080 --> 02:19.520
Super great for future work like projects where we go somewhere to a lot and we're working at a place like we did at

02:19.520 --> 02:24.880
Dell or like we've done at Intel or like we do at Linux fest every year Linux Academy

02:24.880 --> 02:28.920
We can go in the parking lot and we'll be able to hook up and or just run off solar or it's good

02:28.920 --> 02:31.080
It's gonna extend our project time immensely

02:31.080 --> 02:35.520
It's really I'm really excited from how much it's gonna kind of give us flexibility in that regard to

02:35.840 --> 02:42.360
Say you originally spec'd out. What was it 500 watts of solar? Yeah. Yeah, you've gone to every doubled that

02:42.560 --> 02:46.280
Yeah, yeah, we did and what's pretty nice about that is

02:46.280 --> 02:51.600
When you have I mean, this is so obvious, but when you add more solar panels, even on a darker day

02:51.600 --> 02:57.600
You're you're collectively drawing in a little bit more power. And so even on kind of a overcast Pacific Northwest

02:58.460 --> 02:59.560
raining

02:59.560 --> 03:04.320
Snowy kind of day. Seattle's not known for being gray. Is it? No, never never never

03:04.560 --> 03:09.280
I'm still pulling in enough power to cover all of my home automation system

03:09.280 --> 03:12.720
all of my home servers like the all the Raspberry Pi's my storage and

03:12.720 --> 03:20.360
All of the smart lights are all running off the solar because a kilowatt doesn't really sound like an awful lot

03:20.360 --> 03:22.920
You know, how much is a microwave a thousand watts, right?

03:23.320 --> 03:26.200
When you're running a microwave, it's drawing a thousand watts. I guess so

03:26.200 --> 03:29.880
Yeah, or a hairdryer is around 900 watts a heaters around a thousand watts

03:29.880 --> 03:32.760
So that kind of gives you an idea of it's not like it's um

03:33.360 --> 03:39.560
Unlimited you're gonna leave something in the efficiency though, right? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Absolutely. Yeah, you lose like 40%

03:39.560 --> 03:45.080
I think it's in some cases. It's it's pretty abysmal. Okay, so if I have a kilowatt array on my roof

03:45.080 --> 03:48.080
I want to budget I'm gonna get no more than five or six hundred

03:48.920 --> 03:53.520
Actual usable watts out of that then do I depending I mean, it's pretty great

03:53.520 --> 03:55.080
If what you're drawing from it is DC

03:55.080 --> 03:59.440
So if you can move some of your load over to DC and there's a lot of things that are DC

03:59.800 --> 04:03.200
In fact almost everything we have that's electronic is DC

04:03.200 --> 04:07.440
We just convert it to AC either in a wall wart or in a box inside the computer

04:07.440 --> 04:13.840
Speaking of AC the other kind the the one that keeps you cool in the summer that must draw a lot of power, right?

04:13.840 --> 04:19.120
Yeah, and one of the things this is an area where you asked if it was what I expect and I said it exceeded it

04:19.400 --> 04:25.000
This is an area just because so much was going on including the trip down there that I forgot to properly

04:25.720 --> 04:30.160
investigate how to run the air conditioners and the big issue with an air conditioner is

04:30.600 --> 04:34.560
And this is true for a home air conditioner or a mobile one or a one that goes in your window

04:34.560 --> 04:39.760
Its biggest draw is when it's first powering up and that compressor is going and that fans spinning up

04:39.760 --> 04:42.800
it really spikes to its maximum load and

04:43.240 --> 04:47.120
Then it kind of drops down and it settles and it just has a running load

04:47.280 --> 04:55.000
which is still a lot but it's not an unbelievable amount a bit like a jet engine where they have the maximum like takeoff thrust and

04:55.080 --> 04:59.680
Then just just cruising is is easy almost. Yeah, once it's in its groove

04:59.680 --> 05:06.400
So they have these things called easy starts or soft starts that help. I don't know shave that load down

05:06.680 --> 05:11.720
So it it will start the fan up and then it'll wait a bit and we'll start the compressor up and it'll do it in

05:11.720 --> 05:17.400
A stage start process and so with those installed which they caught even though I neglected to catch it

05:17.400 --> 05:22.800
The installers caught it. We can indeed run the air conditioners off the battery bank quite quite. Well, it works quite well

05:22.880 --> 05:27.120
Do you have any idea what sort of runtime you'll get from that on battery?

05:27.120 --> 05:32.480
I'm not yet. My my first pass at it is somewhere around six to fourteen hours

05:32.920 --> 05:36.880
Depending on how hard they're working. That's not bad though. That's pretty good

05:37.080 --> 05:42.320
it's not bad and really probably running for 15 20 minutes just to get the temperature down when you just get home and then

05:42.560 --> 05:47.940
Switch to fans and whatnot pretty exciting pretty exciting, especially if you consider in Seattle

05:47.940 --> 05:52.440
You're only gonna need it for two or three hours a day. Anyway, realistically guy confess something to you

05:52.440 --> 06:00.200
Mm-hmm, something I did not expect to be as hard as it was for me was shutting down the whole home system all my

06:00.200 --> 06:06.360
Servers my remote login. Okay. I have I have one SSH tunnel that I have set up that I can bounce into something goes down

06:06.360 --> 06:10.720
It's my only remote connectivity that goes down. Of course. I can't get to home assistant

06:10.720 --> 06:17.660
I can't check the camera and everything's offline and it was like that for a week and I have built up just habits

06:17.880 --> 06:21.880
During my day if I get a minute, I'll just go check on how the hell are the temperatures doing?

06:21.880 --> 06:24.800
How's this or that doing it? What's the draws, you know?

06:24.800 --> 06:28.640
I'll just check on that kind of stuff throughout the day and it was like it was missing

06:29.120 --> 06:32.880
It's hard having my servers down home automation addiction calm

06:34.320 --> 06:36.560
No kidding. No, it's for sure

06:36.560 --> 06:40.960
It's the thing that was I was surprised by by Friday when we were going down there

06:41.280 --> 06:43.800
Hadeah had to step out to take care of some business work

06:43.800 --> 06:50.280
And so while she was out of the RV job one was I got all the raspberry pies booted back up got the Wi-Fi network going

06:50.280 --> 06:52.680
Got the net you got the internet connection back up

06:52.880 --> 06:56.960
You sound like me when I moved into this place the first job that I did was ran ethernet

06:56.960 --> 07:03.920
Well, everything needs it everything needs it even the clocks. I swear the internet and can I just register a complaint Alex?

07:03.920 --> 07:05.240
Can I register this?

07:05.240 --> 07:10.860
Can can think just stop assuming they know my location because of my Wi-Fi network and then just not check again

07:10.860 --> 07:16.600
I'm trying to get traffic on Google Maps and it's like oh, you're on your Wi-Fi network at home

07:16.600 --> 07:17.780
So you're you're at your home base

07:17.780 --> 07:20.360
I don't need to look up your location and I'm driving down the freeway

07:20.840 --> 07:27.400
And I couldn't get my dumb iPhone to just redouble check my location. I toggled airplane mode

07:27.400 --> 07:30.800
I closed at Google Maps reopened it it just

07:31.120 --> 07:34.520
Insisted I just had to set it down with Wi-Fi turned off for like an hour

07:34.520 --> 07:39.460
And then I picked it back up and it had sorted itself. I think you might be what they call an edge case there Chris

07:40.640 --> 07:42.640
I know I know

07:42.880 --> 07:44.720
Did you see it was on Hacker News?

07:44.720 --> 07:50.720
I think this week a guy has a little you know children's toy trolley and he filled it up with 99 Android phones

07:50.720 --> 07:52.800
And he created a traffic jam in Google Maps

07:52.800 --> 07:54.020
I did see that I you know

07:54.020 --> 07:57.360
What's cool about that is I'd always wondered had that ever crossed your mind

07:57.360 --> 07:59.880
Like if you just got a whole bunch of Google Maps devices and yeah

07:59.880 --> 08:03.500
How many people does it take to make the road turn yellow or red or whatever?

08:03.500 --> 08:08.480
You know what impressed me about that is that the phones could get the signals in and out in that pile. That's

08:09.120 --> 08:13.440
That is really impressive from my radio engineering standpoint

08:13.440 --> 08:16.160
I mean if you think about a double decker bus or something like that

08:16.160 --> 08:20.200
You could have 50 to 100 people on that pretty easily true

08:20.600 --> 08:27.040
It's a bit bigger than a little children's toy trolley admittedly, but yeah, these are all stacked on top of each other. Hmm

08:27.040 --> 08:34.560
Yeah, that's pretty nuts. It's been a huge transition for us. It feels like in a weird way coming home. Very very thrilled

08:34.560 --> 08:40.200
I I'm so excited about it that my wife and I wrote two blog posts about it and we recorded a podcast about it

08:40.200 --> 08:45.060
It's like I said, that's it work life and RV comm the podcast though is good

08:45.060 --> 08:47.600
I mean, I'm proud of it, but the blog posts have the pictures

08:47.600 --> 08:52.280
So if you want to see the gear, that's where you go is the blog post. There's some good stuff in there

08:52.520 --> 08:56.720
Well, thank you. So you have a little note here that we should talk about

08:57.760 --> 09:04.120
SSH remote file edit for Visual Studio code. This is one of my favorite plugins. Oh, yeah

09:04.120 --> 09:08.840
I don't know why it didn't occur to me sooner that VS code might have this functionality

09:08.840 --> 09:16.360
I wanted to edit one of my home assistant configuration files and for some reason the web UI wasn't working but SSH was

09:16.840 --> 09:21.560
So I just looked in VS code on a bit of a hunch and there it is

09:22.240 --> 09:28.080
So remote SSH file editing plugin you can essentially load any

09:28.720 --> 09:35.600
Directory on a remote system as if it was on your local system via SSH and you know what the chocolate to this peanut butter is

09:35.600 --> 09:39.480
the Docker compose plug-in for VS code that

09:40.200 --> 09:46.840
Visualizes the the yaml layout so if you like me make one space mistakes and screws up your entire yaml config

09:46.840 --> 09:50.080
It catches that which is nice when you're saving directly back to the server

09:50.080 --> 09:53.520
I love this plug-in because it's it's

09:53.880 --> 09:59.000
Functionality that I had on a really old Mac app called BB edit a hundred years ago

09:59.280 --> 10:02.900
That I had a hard time ever finding replicated functionality for it. This is it

10:02.900 --> 10:10.540
Did you note though that it only works on Linux this remote file edit plug-in only works on Linux you have to be

10:11.060 --> 10:17.900
On oh, oh, I'm sorry Windows 10 if you're using the official open SSH server now

10:18.820 --> 10:21.820
You can you can use it on that now. That's a surprise

10:21.820 --> 10:26.940
It doesn't work on Mac OS because they use a very similar SSH type setup to what we do on Linux

10:27.020 --> 10:29.860
That's what I thought and now I'm not positive

10:29.860 --> 10:35.500
I suppose it could work on any client, but it's the server that it's expecting certain SFTP features

10:35.700 --> 10:42.260
There is a lot going on with this plug-in and it's just a real signal to me

10:42.260 --> 10:46.060
That VS code is just going to be the editor that sticks around for the next 10 years

10:47.540 --> 10:49.260
Atom was good

10:49.260 --> 10:50.860
Sublime was good

10:50.860 --> 10:54.620
You know, you can argue that VM or Emacs or whatever are good in their own ways

10:54.620 --> 11:00.620
But for me the thing that makes VS code so so good is I can run it on any platform

11:01.140 --> 11:05.460
You know electron. Thank you for that and I can even run it in the browser

11:05.460 --> 11:09.500
You know home assistant has a one-click plug-in to deploy it as part of home assistant

11:09.620 --> 11:14.700
You can run a container that runs it, you know in an isolated space on any system

11:15.220 --> 11:16.100
It's just great

11:16.100 --> 11:22.740
I realized that I was really liking VS code when I had a realization that if I had ever switched away from the Linux desktop

11:22.740 --> 11:27.340
I would still use VS code on whatever platform I ended up on it

11:27.340 --> 11:30.140
But let's move quickly beyond that and talk about wikis

11:30.140 --> 11:35.060
You dropped the wiki bomb in the last episode and you didn't sit around and do nothing about it

11:35.060 --> 11:42.060
You went off and installed a whole bunch of wikis and I'm really interested to see what you learned because if I remember Alex your requirements

11:42.060 --> 11:47.920
Were a fuzzy search and I added on to that something that might even be spousal

11:47.920 --> 11:53.600
Approvable. Have you ever had that worry about what would happen to all your systems after you pass on?

11:53.600 --> 11:57.200
I have and I've seen it come up in the community a little bit too

11:57.200 --> 12:02.480
Like what do you do you write a wiki? I think just just some basics, you know a wiki

12:06.160 --> 12:12.000
Okay, not a will no no no the self-hosted podcast recommends you write a wiki folks

12:12.600 --> 12:15.200
Okay, I'm with you. I'm with you though. I follow you

12:15.200 --> 12:18.960
Maybe my wiki could constitute my last will and testament, right?

12:18.960 --> 12:24.100
I mean you could be it could be in there right written in markdown. No doubt. Yeah in markdown. Yep

12:27.260 --> 12:32.960
Well, there is that saying that goes around that my biggest fear in life is that my wife will sell my computers for what?

12:32.960 --> 12:34.960
I told her they cost

12:34.960 --> 12:42.960
I have not heard that but yeah, that's good. You can apply it to anything so guitars cars

12:47.120 --> 12:52.980
Okay, but so the reason I wanted a wiki was not to document my last will and testament believe it or not

12:53.320 --> 12:56.120
the reason that I wanted a wiki was to just try and

12:57.200 --> 13:03.560
Descatter my documentation. I have some stuff in a git repo from when I tried to do it that way

13:03.560 --> 13:09.840
And I think it's on my github called today. I learned to till TIL. I've got some stuff in Evernote

13:09.840 --> 13:16.080
I've got some plain text notes in a folder on my server that aren't in git that are in next cloud

13:16.080 --> 13:17.200
I think

13:17.200 --> 13:20.120
I've got maybe five or six different random

13:20.480 --> 13:24.720
Things that have tried and failed over the years and I wanted to try and fix that problem

13:24.720 --> 13:28.160
I'm just sitting here nodding my head. I'm thinking yeah add Dropbox to that list

13:28.840 --> 13:30.840
iOS notes to that list

13:30.840 --> 13:37.440
Qo notes on that list of Google Keep. Mmm. Yes got a key things in Google Keep too

13:37.680 --> 13:42.680
This needs to stop here. The line must be drawn here. And so when you look on

13:43.200 --> 13:47.520
Reddit and you know, it's generally my source of inspiration for self-hosted stuff actually

13:48.280 --> 13:54.320
There's a few different options and loads of people espouse bookstack as being the gold standard

13:54.840 --> 13:56.840
it has this concept of

13:56.840 --> 14:01.040
shelves and books and that and chapters and that kind of thing and

14:01.680 --> 14:06.280
It kind of tries to divide up your notes into this kind of logical structure

14:06.280 --> 14:08.280
Which not every single note kind of follows

14:08.440 --> 14:12.040
but you can kind of make it work for what you need so you could say have a book for

14:12.280 --> 14:17.760
Computer hardware and then a shelf for servers and then a chapter about each of your different servers

14:17.760 --> 14:22.560
For example, sounds like you're spending a lot of time though figuring out how to get your information to fit into its structure

14:22.560 --> 14:30.360
Yeah, that's kind of what I found and also another pain point that I really couldn't get past and I admittedly probably spent

14:30.840 --> 14:36.120
20 minutes trying to figure this out. So if you know the answer, please let us know self hosted dot show slash contact

14:36.120 --> 14:39.200
I found that image uploads were a real pain in the butt

14:39.200 --> 14:43.360
I couldn't upload any images that were over a certain size and I think that size was like

14:44.160 --> 14:46.360
900 by 600 pixels or something

14:46.360 --> 14:52.560
Oh, you mean image size not necessarily file size and do you know where you're using the s3 back end or I think both

14:53.000 --> 14:56.680
And bookstack wasn't using s3 to my knowledge

14:56.680 --> 15:00.560
It was just spun up as a you know using a volume on my server with a container

15:01.080 --> 15:06.560
Yes, right then you can use an s3 back end with it, which might change that aspect of it

15:06.560 --> 15:10.760
Well, maybe maybe but in general, I just wasn't quite feeling it

15:10.760 --> 15:11.440
You know

15:11.440 --> 15:16.720
You can spend half an hour with with a tool and just generally get a feel for whether it's going to work for you or

15:16.720 --> 15:19.480
Not and I think a wiki is going to be a highly personal thing

15:19.480 --> 15:24.240
So I know there's gonna be some people listening to this going. Oh, I love bookstack. Why doesn't he like it?

15:24.240 --> 15:30.840
It looks really nice. I mean the UI looks pretty great. It's not bad. You know, it's a solid option

15:30.840 --> 15:38.200
It just didn't quite work for me because I want this to be an Evernote grade kind of experience

15:38.200 --> 15:41.440
I want it to look as nice as feel as nice and just not have to

15:42.200 --> 15:48.000
Manually convert images to the right size to fit into that thing and it images is a real pain actually in this

15:48.360 --> 15:53.440
In this whole sphere, what kind of images are you doing screenshots? Are you taking pictures of stuff?

15:53.440 --> 15:56.320
Like for me, it's business cards notes that kind of thing

15:56.440 --> 15:59.960
Yeah, both like instead of writing down the specs of a system

15:59.960 --> 16:06.000
I'll just do a neo fetch to get the specs of a specific box and then just put that screenshot into the system page

16:06.000 --> 16:13.480
As well as you know photos I've taken on my phone of serial numbers of things and all sorts of crap. Yeah

16:13.480 --> 16:19.720
Yep, same over here. Now. The next one that I tried was wiki.js. Now this thing is

16:20.800 --> 16:23.620
Gorgeous. Yeah, this is even better looking than bookstack

16:23.620 --> 16:30.600
It has a really nice easy to follow and understand layout and looking at this it it appears. It's it's a node.js app

16:30.600 --> 16:33.680
So it must set up its own web server than you pointed out a database. I

16:33.680 --> 16:37.200
Started out with my sequel. I say I started out

16:37.200 --> 16:42.200
I continued until the end with my sequel, but you I used my sequel to start with and

16:42.920 --> 16:45.780
It also supports obviously Maria DB

16:46.280 --> 16:52.120
Postgres as well as MS SQL or SQLite 3 as well. It's a node.js application and

16:53.440 --> 16:58.680
Version 2 is build a stable. There is a legacy version 1 which I didn't try

16:58.680 --> 17:06.200
I tried the new version 2 and in general, I really really like this application except for one really fundamental thing

17:06.400 --> 17:12.080
It didn't feel finished every time I went to click on something. It had this little coming soon banner

17:14.080 --> 17:16.080
Partner dust which is fine

17:16.080 --> 17:22.400
I guess I wish I could turn that off in settings like I don't want to see coming soon all over the UI every time

17:22.400 --> 17:24.240
I'm using something and

17:24.240 --> 17:31.360
One of the things that really got me was sitemap is coming soon. And that's one of the key things that I wanted to have

17:31.360 --> 17:37.920
I love looking through a git repository that has a folder structure that makes sense for me

17:37.920 --> 17:39.920
I need my notes to kind of fit into that

17:41.320 --> 17:42.960
hierarchical structure

17:42.960 --> 17:46.760
Almost like files and folders do and if possible

17:46.760 --> 17:52.560
I'd like to be able to tag something with multiple tags and have it show up in multiple places potentially because it's

17:52.560 --> 17:56.860
So often the case that you end up with I don't know

17:56.860 --> 18:00.300
Let's let's use a bash script as an example, but that bash script is about Docker

18:00.620 --> 18:03.100
So you might want it to show up in your Docker?

18:03.900 --> 18:11.540
Note section as well as your bash scripts note section. I couldn't find a way to make wiki.js quite mold into my

18:12.380 --> 18:16.100
Situation. However, I will say it is stunningly beautiful

18:16.700 --> 18:18.860
The search worked pretty darn well

18:18.860 --> 18:26.380
And I think it is definitely one to watch serious contender. Yeah. Yeah, it definitely will be it's gpl3, too

18:26.380 --> 18:31.740
As well, I believe which is pretty nice. That's nice. Yeah, I like the fact that on their website

18:31.740 --> 18:37.940
You know, there's three ways to host this thing your AWS digital ocean or self hosted and I love the fact that

18:38.300 --> 18:43.180
These guys are putting that front and center. I think it's I think it's perfect, you know

18:43.180 --> 18:50.540
So give it time. I think it will be the wiki gold standard moving forward and and certainly the screenshots

18:50.540 --> 18:53.300
You can see on their website, which is wiki.js.org

18:54.540 --> 18:59.860
You can get a good sense for just how beautiful this thing is and it's it's so close to what I want

19:00.500 --> 19:05.300
Now an honorable mention for another tool that is not self hostable and is not open source

19:05.860 --> 19:09.980
Unfortunately, because if it was it would be a slam dunk is gitbook

19:09.980 --> 19:15.700
Now we actually use that over at Linux server to host all the documentation over there

19:15.700 --> 19:22.940
And it's it's got that beautiful fuzzy search that I was after it will show you words within the documents as well

19:23.340 --> 19:24.820
Mmm, that is nice

19:24.820 --> 19:27.340
You can not only just search the titles

19:27.820 --> 19:30.940
Because I don't about you my brain files stuff based on the odd

19:31.100 --> 19:36.560
Keyword or stuff like that with with which I know is in an email or is in a note somewhere

19:36.560 --> 19:40.720
And I can spend hours looking for that one keyword, which I know is in there

19:40.880 --> 19:47.980
But the search algorithm isn't looking deep enough. And so all that led me finally towards tiddly wiki

19:48.400 --> 19:52.320
One other one. I should actually just mention briefly is mkdocs

19:52.920 --> 19:54.920
Now I really did like this one as well

19:55.480 --> 20:00.280
It's git based and that wasn't quite what I was looking for in this situation

20:00.280 --> 20:05.600
But it was really close between mkdocs and tiddly wiki in the end by this point

20:05.600 --> 20:09.080
I tried out half a dozen wikis and I just wanted to start actually documenting stuff

20:09.560 --> 20:16.740
So I just went with tiddly wiki and it's version 5 and I must say I've been super duper impressed with it

20:16.880 --> 20:21.120
It's not the prettiest. I mean, it's not ugly by any stretch. It's just

20:21.880 --> 20:25.840
functional just gets the job done gets out of your way shows you the information that you want and

20:26.560 --> 20:30.000
Each note that you create is called a tiddler

20:30.000 --> 20:37.040
I'm loving the names and each tiddler can have a tag it can have multiple tags and guess what?

20:37.240 --> 20:41.180
When you tag something with multiple tags, it can show up under multiple categories

20:41.780 --> 20:44.040
Which means that I can have that

20:44.580 --> 20:49.320
Wonderful esoteric system that molds with the weird-ass way in which my brain works

20:49.320 --> 20:54.200
Oh that is perfect for you and have stuff stored in three different categories all at once

20:54.200 --> 20:59.920
It sounds like maybe you did find your perfect wiki then. Yeah, maybe so I'm curious about the setup side of it

20:59.920 --> 21:04.320
What's it like as a server piece of software to get going? Well much like all the other wikis

21:04.320 --> 21:08.400
I ran it out of a container. So it was up and running in a couple of minutes flat and

21:09.000 --> 21:15.120
If I look at my stats on my server at the moment, it's currently using 90 megabytes of RAM

21:15.360 --> 21:18.160
So we're talking about a very lightweight application here

21:18.760 --> 21:21.760
If we look at smoke ping, for example that uses 40

21:22.600 --> 21:24.600
Plex is using

21:25.080 --> 21:27.080
2.5 gigabytes. Oof

21:27.080 --> 21:32.360
Nom nom nom. I think cheese might be watching a video right now

21:32.360 --> 21:38.200
But well, I mean it's it's doing a very different job than your wiki is so that's understandable

21:38.200 --> 21:43.120
So tiddly wiki the name didn't put you off. It actually has made me wince once or twice

21:44.280 --> 21:47.000
Yeah, yeah, it could have a better name

21:47.600 --> 21:50.960
And now image uploads again were a bit of a pain point

21:50.960 --> 21:57.840
you have to upload the assets as a separate tiddler and then sort of link that in to tiddly wiki and

21:59.120 --> 22:04.000
Creating a table of contents is a bit of a thing and you have to follow documentation

22:04.000 --> 22:05.880
I mean it it takes 10 minutes

22:05.880 --> 22:08.000
But I don't know why they don't just have it like that out the box

22:08.400 --> 22:12.280
Or a checkmark box that I can click and have it do do it that way

22:12.280 --> 22:14.560
I mean, there's lots of stuff that makes it great

22:14.560 --> 22:20.580
But equally I think there's definitely a lot that could be done in the user interface side of things to improve it

22:20.580 --> 22:22.440
But I'm really happy I found it

22:22.440 --> 22:27.760
I think I'm gonna stick with it for a little while and hopefully it doesn't end up like the XKCD comic of

22:28.060 --> 22:34.120
We've got 13 standards. We need one standard to rule them all and now we have 14 standards. Mm-hmm

22:35.400 --> 22:38.200
I'm sure it will but I hope not. Let me ask you a question

22:38.320 --> 22:43.520
Would you deploy this for a community or would you choose a different one for a group of people to work with?

22:43.560 --> 22:48.740
Because this sounds like it very much works with your kind of mind and thought process and way of retrieving information

22:48.740 --> 22:51.820
But what about a group of people? Well, the search is great for a start

22:51.820 --> 22:57.020
And I think for a community search is the number one thing that you need to work. Well

22:57.860 --> 23:02.860
The next thing you need to work well is kind of moderation and users and that kind of thing for a community

23:03.180 --> 23:08.620
Which leads me on to something I wanted to talk to you about really we can do this meeting live on air if you like

23:08.620 --> 23:13.260
It's a little production meeting right now. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. Come on in here in my office. I

23:13.260 --> 23:19.700
Get maybe half a dozen messages a day from people saying how do I do this or did you hear about this or where did?

23:19.700 --> 23:23.980
I find that link or yes, and I love it. I don't I don't mind. This is not a negative

23:23.980 --> 23:26.060
This is not a negative thing whatsoever

23:26.060 --> 23:30.620
but I think it would be good if we as a community could come together and

23:31.180 --> 23:36.060
Start building a central repository of where to find all of this information

23:36.620 --> 23:40.700
Because it is scattered across the web and there's a lot of smart people listening to this podcast

23:40.700 --> 23:43.500
I know because you email me and you tell me lots of amazing stuff

23:44.220 --> 23:48.700
So if we can all get together and try and build a wiki of some sort

23:49.340 --> 23:51.580
To be the ultimate self hostable

23:52.380 --> 23:56.620
Self hosted wiki on the internet and we can self-host it ourselves

23:56.620 --> 24:01.900
Then I think we're eating our own dog food number one, but number two when people are

24:02.620 --> 24:05.020
Trying to get into self hosting stuff

24:05.020 --> 24:12.140
They will discover this wiki and they'll discover the show and they'll start falling hopefully down the rabbit hole and we can just bring a whole

24:12.140 --> 24:14.940
bunch more people into the fold and

24:16.060 --> 24:20.700
Hopefully end up being the one-stop shop for this kind of stuff on the internet. You never know

24:20.700 --> 24:25.020
I tell you what. It's a big vision Alex. It's a big vision, but I actually think it's

24:25.740 --> 24:30.700
Pretty great. I'd get down on that. I'd probably even look at seeing what some of my personal documentation

24:30.700 --> 24:34.780
I could convert to a wiki to help other people. I probably have some stuff. I could contribute right away

24:35.180 --> 24:39.820
So how would you run something like this? I think you need some community help with that as well

24:39.820 --> 24:43.900
Well, I've had a couple of people on telegram already tell me that they're up for it in terms of

24:44.460 --> 24:46.460
Moderation and helping me build the thing out

24:47.020 --> 24:51.180
I think we'll probably be looking for three or four volunteers just to spend some time with

24:51.740 --> 24:55.740
Me and Chris on on telegram in a private group just to go through some stuff

24:55.740 --> 25:00.860
Figure out how to actually set this thing up and uh and get started. So if you're interested send me an email

25:01.820 --> 25:08.860
At self hosted dot show slash contact or you can tweet me on twitter at ironic badger and uh, we'll get that ball rolling

25:09.180 --> 25:13.420
I like it. We'll do a update in a future episode. That could be a nice resource

25:13.820 --> 25:16.940
I remember back in the day for last we thought about doing something similar

25:17.020 --> 25:20.220
But there were so many other resources that came along. It wasn't really necessary

25:20.860 --> 25:21.980
unfortunately

25:21.980 --> 25:29.100
the resources I use are pretty much project github pages and reddit and neither one of those are great because reddit is

25:29.260 --> 25:34.380
It's like a river. It's changing constantly and you lose stuff and github pages can just sort of be

25:34.940 --> 25:37.200
Really hit and miss in terms of details and documentation

25:38.220 --> 25:40.460
So I would love to see something like this

25:40.860 --> 25:46.140
Out of all the wikis that I tried the one that I think's most likely to fit our needs is that mkdocs one?

25:46.460 --> 25:50.540
Oh, really not tiddly wiki, huh? Because it's been a long time since I've seen anything like this

25:50.540 --> 25:56.460
Tiddly wiki, huh? Because it's based around git and we can then use github's pull request model to accept

25:57.100 --> 26:02.220
Stuff coming in and kind of filter it and curate it that way going back to the community slash team thing

26:02.300 --> 26:04.300
That makes a lot of sense

26:04.380 --> 26:09.900
Yeah, it's very easy to do git blame and figure out who modified chris fisher's wiki page

26:11.500 --> 26:13.580
I love that you're already planning trolling

26:14.860 --> 26:16.380
You've got to it's the internet

26:16.380 --> 26:22.220
You just exposed it though right here right here on the pod. I'm calling it a pod now the self-hosted pod

26:23.420 --> 26:27.660
It's so horrible. I mean if you want to sound like a douche be my guest. Uh-huh. Okay. All right

26:27.900 --> 26:31.740
Meanwhile, you're the guy with a robot vacuum. So let's talk about that for a little bit

26:31.980 --> 26:35.820
I'm the guy with a robot vacuum running a buntu darling what? Yeah

26:36.060 --> 26:40.940
What next you're gonna tell me you have a working with home assistant then i'm just gonna quit life. Oh, yeah, no

26:40.940 --> 26:46.940
I bought a robot vacuum and it's a it's a roborock s5 now roborock are owned by

26:47.240 --> 26:50.860
xiaomi the chinese company, so i'm well aware that

26:51.420 --> 26:56.860
You know, my data will be going off to a data center that contains coronavirus. Oh, geez too soon

26:58.620 --> 27:03.420
Is it still connected to their cloud service running ubuntu does it come running ubuntu no

27:03.900 --> 27:08.060
So it comes out the box with um a me home app that you pair it with

27:08.060 --> 27:12.460
like much of their other stuff and like light bulbs and and what have you

27:12.940 --> 27:14.700
And out of the box, it works just fine

27:14.700 --> 27:21.020
It has a little lidar thing on it that maps the room out and you know, it's it's pretty cool to humans detected

27:22.300 --> 27:24.140
Yeah, assimilate

27:24.140 --> 27:27.660
The robot vacuum is just the the room mapping is particularly creepy to me

27:27.740 --> 27:30.460
But I I do kind of also appreciate the utility of it

27:30.540 --> 27:34.140
Well, it's nice if you think about it because you can say to the robot

27:34.140 --> 27:39.740
Go clean the kitchen or go clean the toilet or whatever not the inside of the toilet

27:39.820 --> 27:44.380
Obviously, but you can say like different zones. I would buy that robot though

27:45.180 --> 27:47.180
Yeah, I would too

27:47.740 --> 27:50.060
And so naturally if i'm going to buy a gadget

27:50.220 --> 27:54.220
I want to make the most out of it and I want to try and integrate it with home assistant so that when I

27:54.300 --> 27:59.420
Leave the house I can have my robot vacuum start cleaning and when I come home it can go back to its dock

27:59.420 --> 28:01.420
So it's never running when I'm at home

28:01.420 --> 28:04.540
When I come home, it can go back to its dock. So it's never running when i'm here

28:05.420 --> 28:09.340
um, that's the simple use case or it could be like, uh, you know

28:09.740 --> 28:13.100
It's cleaning time where i'm doing some hoovering of the stairs for example

28:13.260 --> 28:15.900
And then the vacuum is doing its thing as well

28:15.900 --> 28:20.940
And if we're having a cleaning mode, it doesn't matter if it's churning away. So do you have a cleaning mode?

28:20.940 --> 28:28.620
Is that something you've done? Yeah, it plays blink 182 full volume through my stereos because that's peppy enough that it gets my energy going

28:28.620 --> 28:36.300
And then uh, yeah, we start doing some washing up or and then the robot vacuum deploys all the lights turn on the humans deploy

28:36.460 --> 28:37.660
and

28:37.660 --> 28:42.860
Yeah, and it it turns the lights on for 45 minutes and we have to keep going for that 45 minutes

28:42.940 --> 28:47.100
That's a neat idea. And then at the end of that 45 minute period the lights

28:47.500 --> 28:51.180
Dim or turn off on blink 182 stops playing and we know we're good

28:51.180 --> 28:56.060
You need to have some wine deploy somehow that would be the next level at the at the end. Oh

28:56.060 --> 29:00.940
Yeah, that would be good I guess you could always automate yourself to do that

29:01.820 --> 29:03.340
Yeah, I wouldn't have any issues with that

29:03.340 --> 29:09.660
That would be pretty easy and I and you automatically get the benefits of the location awareness when it's communicating with home assistance

29:09.740 --> 29:14.780
So that's nice as well and you can integrate with all the other automation. So there's obviously advantages to doing that

29:15.260 --> 29:20.060
So is there some sort of project out there designed to flash robot vacuums? Are they that popular?

29:20.540 --> 29:24.060
Yeah, believe it or not. I love the community. It's so amazing

29:24.060 --> 29:30.620
So to start with I discovered that I needed to obtain something called a xiaomi home access token

29:31.580 --> 29:35.100
And the documentation on the home assistant website was a little bit out of date

29:35.580 --> 29:39.420
So I submitted my first ever home assistant pull request. Yay

29:41.740 --> 29:45.900
And so if you use a specific version of the me home app an old one by the way

29:46.540 --> 29:51.100
You can actually go into the file system of your android device and retrieve the access token that way

29:51.100 --> 29:58.620
It's not too difficult, but it took me probably an entire weekend to figure it out because the documentation wasn't up to date. So

29:59.260 --> 30:01.260
There you go. I saved you some time

30:01.340 --> 30:08.220
And then so once you have your token you can enter that into home assistant and use the xiaomi home assistant integration and it just

30:08.620 --> 30:09.900
Just works

30:09.900 --> 30:16.460
But I wanted to go a step further than that. I wanted to root my vacuum. I wanted to put ubuntu linux on my vacuum

30:16.460 --> 30:20.240
And to do that you use something called a valetudo

30:21.100 --> 30:29.340
Now valetudo is an open source firmware that you flash onto your robot vacuum and this thing uses the robot's wi-fi access point

30:29.900 --> 30:31.020
to

30:31.020 --> 30:33.020
Basically pretend to be the xiaomi servers

30:33.580 --> 30:37.580
You then flash the valetudo firmware onto it. This is all done over the air

30:37.580 --> 30:40.460
You don't have to plug any cables in you don't have to do any soldering

30:41.020 --> 30:44.400
All the documentation is on their website and it it's actually really straightforward

30:44.400 --> 30:51.120
And within a few minutes you'll have ubuntu on your network. You can ssh into your vacuum if you want to that's great

30:51.520 --> 30:53.520
I love that so much

30:53.920 --> 30:59.920
But one of the really super cool things that it enables as if a robot vacuum running ubuntu isn't cool enough already

31:00.560 --> 31:02.080
is you can

31:02.080 --> 31:04.080
now use mqtt

31:04.480 --> 31:08.800
So you can bring the map into home assistant using mqtt

31:08.800 --> 31:15.040
So you can have a card on your home assistant dashboard which uses the lidar sensor on top of the vacuum

31:15.280 --> 31:20.320
To actually map out your house in home assistant it updates in real time and tells you whereabouts in the house

31:20.320 --> 31:23.920
It physically is which is so cool. That's super high tech

31:26.000 --> 31:28.640
All right, okay, you're selling me on this now now

31:28.640 --> 31:31.360
You just got to build one of these and pre-flash it and ship it to me. That's all

31:32.800 --> 31:34.800
I got it on black friday. It was

31:34.800 --> 31:39.620
$160 this vacuum. Well, i've seen some of the I can't I can't remember the exact price

31:39.700 --> 31:45.220
But the one I saw was near 800 for a different name brand. Yeah, they get pretty pricey

31:45.380 --> 31:47.380
Well, you know what's next for you man is solar

31:47.620 --> 31:52.020
Power all this stuff with solar i'm telling you it's next level. There's so much to learn

31:52.580 --> 31:58.980
I I really am enjoying it if you and I know you do if you enjoy digging and researching and discovering new things and new tech

31:59.300 --> 32:02.900
It's right up your alley a little solar panel on the roof telling you

32:02.900 --> 32:09.140
I just need a bucket full of money to do it. That's true. Yeah, but then you could charge your robot vacuum from solar

32:09.780 --> 32:11.780
Oh my god

32:11.860 --> 32:17.380
I think if I buy an electric car, which will almost certainly be my next car purchase

32:18.100 --> 32:19.300
then uh

32:19.300 --> 32:21.780
Solar on the roof because I saw the uk is actually banning

32:22.560 --> 32:25.480
gasoline and diesel car sales from 2035

32:26.500 --> 32:28.660
That's pretty soon. I think it would be

32:29.380 --> 32:31.380
next level awesome

32:31.380 --> 32:36.420
To drive around a car that was charged by solar from at home. I mean that just

32:37.140 --> 32:41.780
I'm feeling pretty good having my whole home server systems running on solar right now. I'm feeling like hey, look at me

32:42.180 --> 32:44.180
But yeah, that's next level

32:44.180 --> 32:47.380
Tell people about the blog give give a plug for the old blog because you got some good stuff on there

32:47.380 --> 32:48.660
We don't mention it too often

32:48.660 --> 32:55.060
I have a personal blog over at blog.ktz.me where I try and document as much of my personal

32:55.440 --> 32:59.460
Shenanigans as I can. Yeah, and you also often take really great pictures over there

32:59.460 --> 33:04.580
So that's something that I appreciate about you and something i'm trying to knock off from you is i'm trying to try to

33:04.740 --> 33:07.140
do that same thing is put some good pictures on ours because it

33:07.780 --> 33:10.820
Not something we get to play with a lot in the audio medium

33:11.300 --> 33:14.900
So that's why I like to mention the blogs because it's like every now and there's a little extra stuff there

33:14.900 --> 33:20.340
You've documented a lot of these projects over there fair warning. My latest post was about brexit, but uh,

33:21.700 --> 33:23.700
Now we mention it

33:24.020 --> 33:26.020
my latest post

33:26.020 --> 33:30.980
Aside I quite often talk about all the projects i'm up to and you know how I do 3d printing and

33:31.700 --> 33:37.300
When I switch to ios for a week and you know, just that kind of stuff really. Yeah, that was an interesting week

33:37.940 --> 33:44.180
I just launched a blog chrislast.com and I did an episode little audio episode about the max vista moment

33:44.500 --> 33:47.460
So you should check that out. I know you're not a big catalina guy over there

33:47.540 --> 33:53.140
But you should give it a listen. My macbook is still on the one before catalina. You seem like a big mac guy

33:53.140 --> 33:58.740
Yeah, like you're really into it. Am I no i'm giving you a hard time

34:00.500 --> 34:00.740
All right

34:00.740 --> 34:05.780
