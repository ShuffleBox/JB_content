00:00.000 --> 00:05.200
Coming up on today's show, I report back from a failure that led to a couple of cold nights.

00:05.200 --> 00:09.600
Alex has been shocking and jiving and we have a pick for you pack rats. I'm Chris.

00:09.600 --> 00:11.600
And I'm Alex and this is Cell Hosted.

00:12.880 --> 00:14.880
What did you end up buying on Prime Day then?

00:15.680 --> 00:22.000
You got me. I actually almost avoided it entirely, but for some reason in the evening,

00:22.000 --> 00:26.400
maybe I'd had a glass of wine, I had a moment of weakness and I opened up the Amazon app

00:26.400 --> 00:32.800
and they had the Fire Tablet, the new 8-inch, I guess it's quote unquote new, on sale for $50.

00:33.680 --> 00:35.840
$50? That's nothing.

00:35.840 --> 00:40.640
I know. And I'd already been thinking, in fact, this is probably why I opened the Amazon app,

00:40.640 --> 00:46.160
is I'd been thinking I'm ready for a second wall-mounted always-on home assistant display.

00:46.880 --> 00:52.320
And I don't know if I love the Fire Tablets, but I could be pretty happy at $50.

00:52.320 --> 00:54.400
What about you? Did you get anything?

00:54.400 --> 00:57.760
So there's two categories of Prime Day purchases, aren't there? There's the ones

00:57.760 --> 01:03.760
that you tell your wife about and the ones that you don't. I'm only kidding, but-

01:03.760 --> 01:07.840
No, you're not because I also just remembered, and I don't think I've told the wife yet,

01:07.840 --> 01:09.600
I went ahead and got a SodaStream.

01:09.600 --> 01:12.560
Oh, wow. 1980s cool. They want their SodaStream back.

01:13.120 --> 01:17.200
I drink water in the studio all the time and I'm getting kind of bored. I've been doing it

01:17.200 --> 01:21.600
forever. Just nothing but water during the day. And I want to spice it up a little bit.

01:21.600 --> 01:24.960
So I picked up yet another TV. This one's from my kitchen.

01:24.960 --> 01:28.400
Oh my, a kitchen TV, Alex? That's what tablets are for.

01:28.400 --> 01:33.760
Well, yeah. I mean, we've been using my iPad for that for a little while, but I don't know,

01:33.760 --> 01:37.280
like when you're cooking, there's something about just having that big display on the wall.

01:37.280 --> 01:43.040
And so I bought a 43-inch TCL TV thinking it would be the same as the other two that I have

01:43.040 --> 01:48.400
with the Roku built-in. I didn't even look, just bought it from Target actually, not Amazon.

01:48.400 --> 01:52.960
It was $179. So it was really very, very cheap.

01:52.960 --> 01:53.760
Wow.

01:53.760 --> 01:57.520
And it comes with Android TV on it, would you believe?

01:57.520 --> 01:58.640
Not, but not Google TV?

01:59.440 --> 02:01.200
It says Android TV on the box.

02:01.200 --> 02:03.440
Oh, right. But it's not Google TV, right? It's not.

02:03.440 --> 02:07.600
No, I know what you're saying. Like it's supposed to be the same as what's on the new Chromecast,

02:07.600 --> 02:10.880
but it's different. It's the same as what's on the Shield.

02:10.880 --> 02:15.200
Ah, okay. That's great. How's the performance?

02:15.200 --> 02:20.720
Performance is what you'd expect from probably a three or four-year-old processor that they've put

02:20.720 --> 02:27.680
in there. Yeah, it's fine. It does the job. It's a very bright, punchy TV. It's not going to win

02:27.680 --> 02:30.560
any awards, but for the price, I don't really care.

02:30.560 --> 02:36.080
Well, here's the question. Are you going to attach any external set-top boxes to it,

02:36.080 --> 02:38.240
or are you going to use the built-in Android?

02:38.240 --> 02:39.920
Well, that's what I bought the Chromecast for.

02:39.920 --> 02:40.720
Oh.

02:40.720 --> 02:42.000
But now I don't need it.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.040
You're right.

02:43.040 --> 02:48.640
So now what are you going to do? You're going to keep the Android TV on there and then,

02:48.640 --> 02:51.920
oh, you know, that Chromecast, you could always just use it as a travel device if we-

02:51.920 --> 02:56.560
If we ever leave the house again. Yeah, maybe. I don't know what I'm going to do with it really,

02:56.560 --> 03:01.440
but it's interesting. It's amazing what you can get for the money these days, really.

03:02.000 --> 03:06.880
Yeah, I did see a lot of really good deals on TVs. I couldn't believe my eyes on some

03:06.880 --> 03:11.760
of the deals during Prime Day. I'm not in a place to really just hang a TV anywhere,

03:11.760 --> 03:16.720
so I didn't get one. But now that I think about it, you know, maybe as a business expense for

03:16.720 --> 03:20.560
the studio, I should have thought of something because I could always use another screen in here.

03:21.120 --> 03:23.520
Well, it's Black Friday again before you know it.

03:23.520 --> 03:23.760
Yeah.

03:24.800 --> 03:28.400
So coming up shortly, I'll talk to you about some of my hard drive purchases, but first-

03:29.520 --> 03:34.000
This episode is brought to you by a cloud guru. Tech moves fast, and so does ACG.

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
Their courses and labs are always online and obsessively updated. Plus,

03:38.000 --> 03:43.280
they curate all the news on AWS, Kubernetes, Linux, and more. Stay up to date at acloudguru.com.

03:44.640 --> 03:50.240
So Alex, you also got some drives and you've been doing some shucking and jiving, I understand.

03:50.240 --> 03:55.520
Indeed I have. I think I might classify this as a hobby now. I seem to do it really quite often.

03:56.320 --> 04:03.200
So I bought five different chucked drives or five different USB enclosure drives,

04:03.200 --> 04:08.000
mostly so that I could report to everybody here what the different types of drives on

04:08.000 --> 04:10.320
the market are and the prices and that kind of stuff.

04:10.320 --> 04:11.840
Interesting. Okay.

04:11.840 --> 04:20.160
I bought a 10 terabyte easy store from Best Buy, which was $189. I bought that about a week ago

04:20.160 --> 04:27.200
because I found out after my ZFS snafus a couple of weeks ago that one of the drives in the mirror

04:27.200 --> 04:33.920
was failing smart, so it's time to replace that one quickly. The others that I bought,

04:33.920 --> 04:40.560
I bought a pair of 10 terabyte Seagate USB 3 drives, which I think were about $179 again.

04:41.200 --> 04:47.280
Oh no, those two were actually on Amazon warehouse deals, so I got those for like $150-ish each.

04:48.000 --> 04:54.320
And then the final two that I purchased were actually on Prime Day because Best Buy were

04:54.320 --> 05:01.200
matching Amazon and they did 12 terabyte drives for $169 a piece, so I got two of those as well.

05:01.200 --> 05:04.880
And what's really interesting between all these different drives is you don't really know what's

05:04.880 --> 05:11.760
going to be inside the box until you crack the case open. And a few years ago, I shucked about

05:11.760 --> 05:18.160
10 or 12 10 terabyte easy stores and they were all purchased within a few weeks of each other.

05:18.160 --> 05:24.640
And so my logic for buying more drives now is that if one or two drives are starting to go now,

05:25.520 --> 05:30.960
the chances of others from that batch going is probably decently high.

05:30.960 --> 05:31.920
I agree.

05:31.920 --> 05:36.720
They've been subjected to the same environmental conditions, the same vibrations, humidity,

05:37.520 --> 05:45.040
workloads, etc, etc. So it seems logical to start replacing those drives a couple at a time,

05:45.040 --> 05:49.120
you know, every six months or so, or whenever Best Buy has a sale, really.

05:49.120 --> 05:52.160
Now, those people in Europe that want to do this kind of thing,

05:52.160 --> 05:58.480
you obviously don't have Best Buy over there, but Amazon do have some good deals.

05:58.480 --> 06:03.600
So use camelcamelcamel.com to go and track the prices of different things on Amazon,

06:03.600 --> 06:08.560
and then you can see what the historical highs and lows were. Bear in mind that US prices don't

06:08.560 --> 06:14.880
include tax and European ones do. The cheapest I saw was about 200 pounds or so for every drive.

06:14.880 --> 06:19.280
So it's a good deal for a 10 or 12 terabyte drive. So just keep an eye out. They are there.

06:19.280 --> 06:22.000
They are a little more expensive than over here, but they do exist.

06:22.880 --> 06:26.240
So we'll start off with the 10 terabyte Western Digital drives.

06:26.880 --> 06:34.240
Couple of years ago, you used to get rebadged Hitachi storage 10 terabyte Helium drives,

06:34.240 --> 06:41.040
which ran cool. They ran quiet. Everybody suspects that they were actually 7200 RPM drives that

06:41.040 --> 06:46.800
make the cut and were kind of underclocked in firmware to 5400 and rebadged and sold

06:46.800 --> 06:52.800
through the easy store program. Nowadays, in the 10 terabyte easy stores, they seem to be

06:52.800 --> 06:57.920
putting in air filled drives, and that doesn't sound like a big deal, Helium versus air, except

06:57.920 --> 07:02.480
for the fact that in my testing at the moment, and I'm burning all of these drives in right now,

07:02.480 --> 07:07.920
and I'll talk about that more later. I'm burning these drives in at the moment, and the air filled

07:07.920 --> 07:14.000
is running about 10 or 12 Celsius warmer than the Helium filled drives, and that's quite a lot. It's

07:14.000 --> 07:20.640
sat right now at 52 Celsius, whilst the Helium drives right next to it are at 40. So just an

07:20.640 --> 07:25.440
observation there. Yeah, if you don't like heat, take that for what it's worth. You know, if heat

07:25.440 --> 07:30.000
kills hard drives, you do wonder if that would multiply to if they were really smashed together,

07:30.000 --> 07:34.160
would there be even more extreme differences in the temperatures between the Helium and the air

07:34.160 --> 07:39.040
filled? Yeah, I think, you know, it's, heat is gonna, it's gotta go somewhere, you know, and

07:39.040 --> 07:44.400
hard drives don't need a huge amount of airflow, but they need some. And, you know, as long as

07:44.400 --> 07:50.160
they're getting that gentle breeze over them, they'll generally be okay. But a lot of NAS cases

07:50.160 --> 07:55.680
and server, you know, home server grade chassis don't have the best airflow in the world. So

07:55.680 --> 08:00.000
you've really got to pay attention to those temperatures. Somebody was asking me on Discord,

08:00.000 --> 08:07.760
how hot is too hot for a hard drive? And I generally try and keep things in that 40 degrees

08:07.760 --> 08:13.440
or lower range. Often it will go up to 45 at a max, you know, on a particularly hot day. And I

08:13.440 --> 08:18.720
generally think that's fine. But my rationale for that is if you look at the data center

08:18.720 --> 08:25.520
environments, most of those are kept between 20 and 24 Celsius. And, you know, my basement

08:25.520 --> 08:30.160
fluctuates a little bit either side of that, but generally speaking, just through natural convection,

08:30.160 --> 08:34.800
it keeps pretty much at that temperature. You know, if you're aiming to keep these drives

08:34.800 --> 08:40.720
at 45 or lower, you're probably having them in a similar kind of state to what a data center would

08:40.720 --> 08:46.320
be. And because data centers buy so many hard drives, you've got to imagine that that's how

08:46.320 --> 08:51.440
people engineer, these companies engineer those drives to succeed well in those temperatures.

08:51.440 --> 08:56.000
Now, before you shuck a drive, there's a few different considerations that you've got to make.

08:56.720 --> 09:01.920
You don't want to just run a full smart test and then burn the drive in in the enclosure with no

09:01.920 --> 09:07.040
fan on it, because very quickly you'll see your drive temperatures going north of 60 Celsius.

09:07.760 --> 09:13.680
Because those enclosures just aren't built for, you know, stress testing enclosures. They're

09:13.680 --> 09:18.400
basically built for someone to just dump a few, you know, bits of drone footage on to or some

09:18.400 --> 09:22.960
movies or something like that, and just stick it in a drawer and forget about it. They're not really

09:22.960 --> 09:29.280
designed as performance type things, which led me on to another train of thought. I was thinking,

09:29.280 --> 09:36.560
well, how performant are these drives? So I had my air filled 10 terabyte drive. I got a pair of

09:36.560 --> 09:46.000
helium filled 12 terabyte drives. In the Seagate boxes were a pair of Barracuda Pros, which normally

09:46.000 --> 09:53.200
sell for about $300 each. Whoa. So I was very pleased with that. What the heck? That's a great

09:53.200 --> 09:59.200
score. Yeah, no SMR stuff, which is nice. They're all CMR drives. So something else you want to try

09:59.200 --> 10:05.040
and watch out for. But the whole purpose of me burning in these drives now and stress testing

10:05.040 --> 10:12.320
them now when they're only a few days old was actually borne out perfectly for me by the real

10:12.320 --> 10:20.080
orange one over on the Discord. And he has a two month old hard drive, which is failing. And he's

10:20.080 --> 10:23.760
now having to go and do an RMA with Seagate. I mean, they'll replace it. It's under warranty.

10:23.760 --> 10:31.120
That's not the issue. The issue is when hard drive manufacturers replace drives, they almost always

10:31.120 --> 10:35.760
send you a refurb. Yeah. So put yourself in his shoes. He's now got a two month old drive that's

10:35.760 --> 10:40.560
a refurb. That's not great. No. And you wonder why it was sent in in the first place. And of course,

10:40.560 --> 10:46.560
a failure in a disc like that's either going to happen early in its lifetime or on the average,

10:46.560 --> 10:51.280
about what, five years later? It's the bathtub curve. It is indeed. The whole idea between

10:51.280 --> 10:55.120
stress testing them now is to weed out the weaklings whilst I'm still within my Best Buy or

10:55.120 --> 11:00.400
Amazon or Newegg or whatever retailer's return policy. So I can just send it back to them and

11:00.400 --> 11:06.480
make it their problem, not mine. Just reshuck. Yeah. I mean, seriously, it's not the retailer's

11:06.480 --> 11:13.360
fault that Western Digital made a faulty drive. But equally, it's not my fault. And I don't want

11:13.360 --> 11:17.920
to commit data to it either, and then have to copy all that data off in a couple of months time.

11:18.480 --> 11:25.120
And it's just, for me, it's about a day per terabyte to do the burn-in. Now I've written a

11:25.120 --> 11:31.280
blog post about how I do burn-ins. I use bad blocks to do it. Yeah, it takes about a day per

11:31.280 --> 11:37.200
terabyte. So I'm looking at 12 continuous days of burn-in here, but I think it's worth it.

11:37.200 --> 11:43.520
That is definitely a peace of mind test. That long of a test really is going to genuinely

11:43.520 --> 11:47.920
stress that disc. I would actually have a pretty good peace of mind after going through that.

11:47.920 --> 11:54.720
My question to you is, maybe with the Barracudas aside, none of these really seem necessarily

11:54.720 --> 11:58.800
server-grade discs. Is that part of why you're doing this? I don't think they are. I mean,

11:58.800 --> 12:05.520
some of them are rebadged Hitachi UltraStar drives. Some of them are rebadged Western Digital

12:05.520 --> 12:12.400
Red drives. It's this kind of whole situation with the white label drives that go inside the

12:12.400 --> 12:18.080
easy stores. A couple of years ago, you used to sometimes actually get red label drives. They

12:18.080 --> 12:24.160
didn't even used to have a separate skew for the easy store drives that went inside them,

12:24.160 --> 12:29.520
the white labels. But now they've cottoned on to the fact that we've cottoned on to the fact that

12:29.520 --> 12:35.920
they are shipping seconds, basically, in these boxes. They know we know that they know. Now we

12:35.920 --> 12:42.560
all know. Yeah. I think it's kind of an unspoken, you know, just, yeah, okay, we'll sell you drives,

12:42.560 --> 12:47.920
but you have to put a bit of effort in and take them out of the case, which is a five-minute job

12:47.920 --> 12:52.960
per drive. As long as you've got a couple of guitar picks and a screwdriver with a Torx bit

12:52.960 --> 12:59.760
on it, you're fine. I mean, it's really easy, so there's no fear there. But somebody was talking

12:59.760 --> 13:05.600
to me, and this wasn't on Discord, this was at work actually, saying that they thought that these

13:05.600 --> 13:12.320
drives were slow and that, you know, if you want rusty, spinning, slow drives, there's a Best Buy

13:12.320 --> 13:16.480
sale on today, was what they said. And so I thought, hmm, let's go and test the performance of

13:16.480 --> 13:22.160
the two-year-old drives I have in my basement versus the new ones we've got here. And it turns

13:22.160 --> 13:32.720
out that actually the, I have a, I bought an eight terabyte Hitachi $270, 7,200 RPM, 256 meg

13:32.720 --> 13:38.640
cache drive when I first got here. So it's, you know, it wasn't shucked. It was always shipped as

13:38.640 --> 13:44.960
a naked drive. And, you know, so theoretically it's as good as it gets on the consumer side of

13:44.960 --> 13:52.160
things. And what was interesting is that that drive, when I put it through some testing with FIO,

13:52.160 --> 13:58.720
and I used Jim Salter's Ask Technica, how to test your hard drive performance article, I used FIO

13:58.720 --> 14:04.320
to do this. So I got in the region of 134 megs writes to this drive, which is pretty good. And

14:04.320 --> 14:11.520
so then I compared it to a shucked Easy Store, which runs at 5,400 RPM, and I got 116. So 134

14:11.520 --> 14:17.360
plays 116. Now for me, the cost difference, you know, the eight terabyte drive that was shucked

14:17.360 --> 14:24.080
was about half the price. So for 18 megabytes a second, that's fine.

14:24.080 --> 14:28.480
Yeah. I think you could argue it's worth considering if these were disks that you were

14:28.480 --> 14:33.120
putting in your workstation and you were working from them. Okay. Maybe I'll hear that argument,

14:33.120 --> 14:39.120
but these are going into a RAID. The RAID has its own performance characteristics that also

14:39.120 --> 14:43.920
change the math on all of this anyways. And at the end of the day, you're storing items on this

14:43.920 --> 14:49.840
that you access infrequently. And when you do, you're likely accessing them over the network,

14:49.840 --> 14:56.000
possibly even over Wi-Fi. So you have to take the entire use case picture in when you're looking at

14:56.000 --> 15:01.440
the speed versus price argument, I think. Absolutely. Yeah. So, you know, if you're

15:01.440 --> 15:07.680
looking to buy a new drive on Black Friday, my personal advice would be steer away from the

15:07.680 --> 15:15.360
10 terabyte easy stores because they're now hot air drives and go for either the Seagate ones

15:15.360 --> 15:20.880
at 10 terabytes that you can probably find on Amazon warehouse for 150, 160 bucks a piece,

15:21.600 --> 15:27.920
or go for the 12 terabyte easy stores from Best Buy because they are helium drives and they run

15:27.920 --> 15:33.600
nice and cool and quiet and, you know, 12 terabytes. So it's more than 10, isn't it? So...

15:33.600 --> 15:41.600
Linode.com slash SSH. You go there, you get a $100 60-day credit towards your new account,

15:41.600 --> 15:46.720
and you can try out our hosting provider in the cloud. Some workloads are better in the cloud,

15:46.720 --> 15:51.120
and Linode is dedicated to offering the best virtualized cloud computing. If it runs on Linux,

15:51.120 --> 15:56.480
it will run on Linode. They started three years before AWS. They're independently owned and

15:56.480 --> 16:00.800
they're founded on a love for Linux and open source technologies. I started using them about

16:00.800 --> 16:06.800
two years ago, and I roped Alex into it, and Alex discovered that Linode has pretty excellent

16:06.800 --> 16:11.280
Terraform support. Yes, in fact, all of the self-hosted show infrastructure is running

16:11.280 --> 16:17.520
on Linode now, and we're using Terraform to use the infrastructure as code principles to spin up

16:17.520 --> 16:23.760
all of this infrastructure like magic, and it just works. The documentation is top-notch,

16:23.760 --> 16:28.400
and the integration with Terraform and other DevOps tools is fantastic.

16:28.400 --> 16:33.280
That is super slick, and it makes it really easy for us to prepare and test things for the show.

16:33.280 --> 16:37.120
Something else that I rely on a lot for show production, and you should consider it too,

16:37.120 --> 16:41.200
is object storage. Now, there's a lot of ways you could take advantage of object storage. If you

16:41.200 --> 16:46.160
don't know, it's an easy way for you to store and access data without the need for a front-end

16:46.160 --> 16:51.120
server that's producing a website or syncing files. It's perfect for data that doesn't change very

16:51.120 --> 16:55.280
regularly, like maybe you want to store some images, or I store audio clips and video clips

16:55.280 --> 17:00.560
up in the object storage. But additionally, you could use it to host files for a static website,

17:00.560 --> 17:05.680
and man, would your website load fast. It's really worth checking out object storage. If you need

17:05.680 --> 17:10.560
really easy cloud storage that you can generate public URLs for and then embed in websites,

17:10.560 --> 17:15.440
object storage is fantastic. I love Linode. I recommend it to all of our listeners. You can

17:15.440 --> 17:21.520
get a $100 60-day credit for a new account when you go to linode.com slash ssh. So sign up today,

17:21.520 --> 17:26.640
you support the show, and you get that $100 60-day credit. linode.com slash ssh.

17:27.920 --> 17:32.400
Well, it's that time of year. The leaf blowers are firing up and winter is coming.

17:32.400 --> 17:38.880
It's getting cold. Yeah, it is. And I finally hooked up my heating again. I'm very proud of

17:38.880 --> 17:43.520
the automations I've built for the heating system in lady tubes. I finally got them all plugged back

17:43.520 --> 17:49.920
in because what I like to do is during the summer, why not reclaim that space? I pack away the heaters,

17:49.920 --> 17:55.280
but I leave the smart plugs plugged in. So that way, everything's still talking to home assistant.

17:55.280 --> 18:00.080
And then I have a series of automations that will start and stop those heaters based on

18:00.080 --> 18:05.680
the temperature in that area, matching a condition that the sun is below the horizon.

18:06.240 --> 18:10.160
So I have heaters in my bedroom, in the living room, kitchen area, because again, this is a

18:11.200 --> 18:15.360
bus, right? So the living room and kitchen are essentially one area. And then the upfront driving

18:15.360 --> 18:21.520
area has a temperature sensor. My water bay has a temperature sensor and my battery slash electrical

18:21.520 --> 18:26.480
bay has a temperature, mostly so I can monitor if that's just getting too hot. But they all have

18:26.480 --> 18:30.560
temperature sensors in those areas. And the way the system works is it looks at all of that,

18:31.440 --> 18:35.600
looks at the individual rooms and it sees what the temperature is in the room. And it sees if

18:35.600 --> 18:41.520
the sun is above the horizon or below the horizon. And if the sun is below the horizon and the

18:41.520 --> 18:48.480
temperature is, say, below maybe it's the bedroom, so below 67 degrees, the heater comes on. And if

18:48.480 --> 18:53.760
it's really cold, I have I have like supplemental heaters that will kick in to really kind of get

18:53.760 --> 19:00.080
it up there because, you know, it's an RV. The walls are like maybe if I'm lucky, six inches thick,

19:00.080 --> 19:03.920
probably more like four or five inches thick. So it's a thermal loss was a big problem.

19:03.920 --> 19:11.520
Last year was our our best winter in an RV after five years because the the heating was finally

19:11.520 --> 19:18.320
just right. We were really always perfectly comfortable. It'd been really nice. And it had

19:18.320 --> 19:23.440
been just a bliss of having automations that just take care of it. You don't even think about it.

19:23.440 --> 19:30.640
And all of that, Alex, came to a chilling end this recent week. Chilling end. Who are you going to

19:30.640 --> 19:35.440
call? Who are you going to call? Myself. Right. And it's one of that's what's so awful. And

19:35.440 --> 19:39.360
I actually had a bit of a down moment during all this is like, oh, this isn't working.

19:39.360 --> 19:44.400
Dude, this is what I was saying last episode. The perils of self-hosting. Like if it breaks,

19:44.400 --> 19:49.280
you're the one on call. I think you jinxed me. I think you jinxed me. So sure enough,

19:49.280 --> 19:53.440
the night that I hook up the heaters, I think to myself, well, let's go make it cozy in the bedroom.

19:53.440 --> 19:57.520
So I tell home assistant, turn on the heaters in the bedroom, you know, get it nice and cozy in

19:57.520 --> 20:01.280
there. So, you know, I wanted my wife to walk in and go, oh, man, oh, yeah, the heaters are back.

20:01.280 --> 20:08.400
It's so nice. And sure enough, home assistant reliably fires off the heaters. And I have a I

20:08.400 --> 20:12.880
have an automation that when it gets to 73 degrees in the bedroom and if it holds that for three

20:12.880 --> 20:18.400
minutes to turn off the heaters and I'm in bed, I'm getting all comfortable and I hear the heaters

20:18.400 --> 20:25.520
click off, the automation kicked in perfectly to turn off the heaters. I fall asleep and I wake up

20:25.520 --> 20:32.080
right around two a.m. and I'm very cold, like because it's it was the first night here in the

20:32.080 --> 20:36.880
Pacific Northwest where it got into the mid 40s in the middle of the night. And it's so 2 a.m.

20:36.880 --> 20:41.200
I wake up because I'm so cold. That's what woke me up. Right. So, you know, it's uncomfortable in

20:41.200 --> 20:45.280
the room. And I'm I'm like, I wake up. I'm like, what the hell's going on? The heaters are hooked

20:45.280 --> 20:50.240
up like this isn't supposed to be happening. So I get up and I don't want to disturb my wife. So I

20:50.240 --> 20:56.960
go out into the living room perfectly cozy, very comfortable. Clearly that the heating automations

20:56.960 --> 21:03.520
had been working out in the living room flawlessly. But in the bedroom, of course, not working. So I

21:03.520 --> 21:07.760
didn't realize fully the extent of this. I thought, OK, there must have been some mistake. So I open

21:07.760 --> 21:11.440
up home assistant. I looked at I turned my did I turn off the automation because I didn't actually

21:11.440 --> 21:15.920
check because I just assumed I left it on. So I always do just what you want to be doing at 2 a.m.

21:15.920 --> 21:20.400
Oh, yeah. So go to home assistant. Oh, yeah. Look at that. I had left the automation, but I could see

21:20.400 --> 21:24.640
the last time it had been triggered was the first week of May because I haven't used the heating

21:24.640 --> 21:29.840
since then. So I hit the little play button that fires off the automation immediately. And the

21:29.840 --> 21:35.760
heaters kick right on. OK, OK. It's working. It's obviously working. I go back to bed temperature

21:35.760 --> 21:43.200
slowly coming up. I wake up at 6 a.m. and the room is cold again. What I realized was very reliably

21:43.200 --> 21:49.440
very reliably. The turn the heaters off automation works, but the turn the heaters on doesn't work.

21:49.440 --> 21:54.480
So they turn off, but they don't ever turn on. And I didn't really get this. Of course,

21:54.480 --> 21:59.920
it's like 6 a.m. and I hadn't slept well, but I'm dumbfounded, right? Because the turn things off

21:59.920 --> 22:05.280
automation is essentially just the reverse of the turn things on automation. And one's working and

22:05.280 --> 22:12.880
one isn't working. And I'm just really perplexed by this. And there was one star sized difference

22:12.880 --> 22:15.920
between them. But I'll get to that in a moment. But let me just say at first I was actually a

22:15.920 --> 22:21.840
little discouraged that morning. I telegrammed you. I was doing a round of Googling. And what

22:21.840 --> 22:27.280
I was finding is the recent rapid versions of Home Assistant, God bless him, have made it so that

22:27.280 --> 22:31.840
almost every release, something in automations kind of goes sideways for somebody out there in

22:31.840 --> 22:38.000
the Internet because of all these use cases and edge cases. And so you just find all of this

22:38.000 --> 22:43.360
backlog of stuff that's no longer relevant to troubleshooting anymore. All these forum posts

22:43.360 --> 22:47.760
and everything because Home Assistant so quickly outdates it that something that was posted in

22:47.760 --> 22:54.400
April is just really generally not very useful anymore. And the error was so generic that nearly

22:54.400 --> 22:58.800
everything I searched for kind of just showed up, you know, automation not firing off, not triggering,

22:58.800 --> 23:02.880
you know, the kind of basic crap you get with that. You just don't really get any help.

23:02.880 --> 23:08.240
It's like Googling something for Windows. Unless you have the very specific error code, you just

23:08.240 --> 23:15.520
end up in a tar pit of just useless information. Yep. So I go to work, you know, I figure

23:16.320 --> 23:19.200
I'll think about it, but I won't I won't stress out too much about it.

23:20.000 --> 23:23.920
And I'm chatting with my wife and she's like, so there's really no other differences between the

23:23.920 --> 23:28.800
off and on automations, really? You got to bear in mind, like I created these more than a year ago,

23:28.800 --> 23:33.120
right? So I don't implicitly remember them very well. So I open up the two automations,

23:33.120 --> 23:39.600
the off automations and the on automations side by side. And what I realized is the off automations

23:40.400 --> 23:44.880
run 24 hours a day, regardless of what the sun is doing. The idea being that if it gets above

23:44.880 --> 23:48.720
this temperature, I don't want the heat. So I don't want the heaters on. So just I don't care

23:48.720 --> 23:54.640
what time of day it is, turn the heaters off. But the turn on automations only trigger if the

23:54.640 --> 24:00.720
condition of the sun is below the horizon and if that's met and if that isn't met, the automations

24:00.720 --> 24:06.240
don't trigger. So with that realization, I kind of refined my Googling and I found a two year old

24:06.240 --> 24:12.080
Reddit thread that actually was my problem. So I had to change the condition. Now, the conditions

24:12.080 --> 24:16.800
are these options that prevent execution of an automation unless all of the, quote unquote,

24:16.800 --> 24:23.040
conditions are satisfied. So one of my conditions is that the temperature is at a certain threshold

24:23.040 --> 24:28.160
and that the sun is below the horizon. And, you know, I use the crap out of that for like all my

24:28.160 --> 24:33.760
outdoor lights, a bunch of the lights inside the RV are set to come on 30 minutes after sunset,

24:33.760 --> 24:38.960
and those are all working just fine. It's only the two heating automations for the bedroom.

24:39.600 --> 24:44.480
But for some reason, kind of still unknown to me, I had to just make a change in how I was

24:44.480 --> 24:50.240
checking the state of the sun. Stick with me for a second. The sun in Home Assistant is also

24:50.240 --> 24:55.280
essentially a sensor. And so I went from using the built in condition of the sun, which is built

24:55.280 --> 24:59.280
into the automation GUI wizard. You can say sun below horizon is just a built in option.

25:00.000 --> 25:07.040
I had to take that out and I had to instead go get the state of the sun sensor. And then I had

25:07.040 --> 25:14.240
to manually specify in just plain language when the state of the sensor is below underscore horizon.

25:14.240 --> 25:19.920
And when going from a state of the sensor as a condition, the automation started working again,

25:19.920 --> 25:25.680
as expected. And it seems to be maybe something in the logic of how the graphical interface builds

25:25.680 --> 25:31.360
that automation with the sunset condition. So essentially you end up using for if you want

25:31.360 --> 25:36.480
something to reliably work based on the sunrise and sunset in Home Assistant, you need to use the

25:36.480 --> 25:41.520
sensor state, not the built in sun condition. It's confusing. Even the language around it is

25:41.520 --> 25:46.720
confusing. And I still kind of have questions like, why did this only bite me now? I've had

25:46.720 --> 25:50.880
this automation for over a year. This reddit thread is two years old. So somebody ran into

25:50.880 --> 25:57.280
this two years ago. I don't really know when it broke. It must have broke during the summer when

25:57.280 --> 26:00.560
I had the heaters actually disconnected and I just didn't notice that the smart plugs were

26:00.560 --> 26:04.720
clicking on or off. I don't notice that. I'd leave them plugged in all the time. So when did it

26:04.720 --> 26:09.040
break? I don't know. Was it some particular update? I don't know. And why do my other

26:09.040 --> 26:14.720
automations that are using the original sun condition work fine still? And then I guess my

26:14.720 --> 26:19.600
last question is, are they eventually going to break on me? I think we can refer to this as like

26:19.600 --> 26:25.680
the Home Assistant half-life. You know, like they have an entropy of decay that just sort of

26:25.680 --> 26:32.560
happens. Automations just stop working for some reason. And sometimes it's not totally logical

26:32.560 --> 26:41.520
as to why and when it happens. Yeah. Yeah, I felt a little like less confident in the setup

26:41.520 --> 26:46.080
all of a sudden. And then just unrelated, Alex, just a couple of days later, I did an update.

26:46.080 --> 26:51.600
And that night, Home Assistant locked up on me. So I got the heating working for one night. And

26:51.600 --> 26:55.440
then the next night, Home Assistant locked up on me. None of the automations ran. I couldn't

26:55.440 --> 27:00.000
even get to the dashboard. I ended up just rebooting the entire host because it needed

27:00.000 --> 27:05.280
to reboot for some security updates anyways. But so for the second night, so one night it works,

27:05.280 --> 27:10.720
the next night, no heat again throughout the entire place now because Home Assistant just

27:10.720 --> 27:16.640
locked up. It hasn't done that in forever. And I had to reboot the whole host. It's very reliable

27:16.640 --> 27:23.440
for me. I don't have any lockups or anything like that. But I do find that sometimes automations

27:24.400 --> 27:28.560
just stop working. And I don't notice that they stop working straight away. And I don't know

27:28.560 --> 27:35.760
whether it's the pace of updates, like you mentioned, breaking stuff, or whether it's just

27:35.760 --> 27:43.280
that I've introduced another change somewhere else. It maybe almost needs a testing framework

27:43.280 --> 27:50.160
for these automations, like a CI build passing set of badges or something for each automation

27:50.160 --> 27:54.880
somehow. I'm not sure how that would even work. But I don't want to make a change in one place

27:54.880 --> 27:58.800
and then have it break something somewhere else. So I need a way that when I dust this dinosaur

27:58.800 --> 28:04.800
bone over here, the tail doesn't fall off the dinosaur at the back. It's a tricky one though.

28:04.800 --> 28:09.040
Tricky problem. I think that could be doable, Alex. I just got a supervisor add-on that checks

28:09.040 --> 28:14.400
the Home Assistant configuration against any new version. So it takes your existing config,

28:14.880 --> 28:19.760
it looks at the new release config defaults, and does a compare and tells you if there's going to

28:19.760 --> 28:23.280
be any issues. And I could see something like that expanding to automations.

28:23.280 --> 28:28.480
Yeah, particularly given all the changes they made in the latest birthday release to the YAML

28:28.480 --> 28:31.920
structure and that kind of thing. I could see that being useful.

28:31.920 --> 28:37.360
All things considered, I am happier today with Home Assistant than I have ever been. I continue

28:37.360 --> 28:43.040
to be extremely enthusiastic about it. I am constantly integrating new things with it. I

28:43.040 --> 28:50.160
went ahead and just recently integrated the studio's Amazon Echoes, which support Amazon Guard.

28:50.160 --> 28:57.040
And now I can toggle the guard status inside Home Assistant, and all of the Echoes do not disturb

28:57.040 --> 29:04.640
switches and other features show up as sensors and options in Home Assistant now. It's really cool.

29:05.840 --> 29:11.360
So I just have been just bringing more and more into it. Also, I've recently learned that the

29:11.360 --> 29:17.680
Ring API integration is pretty decent. You can bring in still images from Ring cameras into Home

29:17.680 --> 29:23.520
Assistant. You can also bring in their motion sensors into Home Assistant. You can get a little

29:23.520 --> 29:29.520
Lovelace card that shows you the last time they detected motion. It's all great because the way

29:29.520 --> 29:32.800
Home Assistant works with all this stuff is at the end of the day, they're all just like sensors.

29:32.800 --> 29:39.280
So you can just build everything around these. And it still to this day feels like this great

29:39.280 --> 29:45.680
unifier of all these rando products that these different vendors make. And I bring it all

29:45.680 --> 29:51.280
together in Home Assistant. Well, let me just take a moment and thank a cloud guru. You know,

29:51.280 --> 29:56.320
a cloud guru has a system D course. Now it might be worth checking out because system D has taken

29:56.320 --> 30:01.680
over the Linux landscape and you may know some of the basics, but there's a lot more it can do.

30:01.680 --> 30:06.000
It's got some components that you can put together as well, which we'll mention later on in the show

30:06.720 --> 30:11.040
that can make your life a little bit easier. So go to a cloud guru.com or use the link in our show

30:11.040 --> 30:15.680
notes to take you directly to this course. It's a course designed to demystify the sometimes

30:15.680 --> 30:21.840
difficult and admittedly deep topic of system D. You might be using system D today, but are you

30:21.840 --> 30:26.240
really taking full advantage of it? There's an opportunity here to learn more. Use the link in

30:26.240 --> 30:32.960
our show notes, 5.8 hours of content, 40 total lessons and eight hands-on labs. Link in the show

30:32.960 --> 30:38.800
notes and thanks to a cloud guru.com. All right, it's time for some listener feedback. Pete writes

30:38.800 --> 30:43.600
in about his OBD2 data. Yeah, he says, Hey guys, on one of the JB shows a while back, Chris explained

30:43.600 --> 30:50.160
his usage of his OBD2 readings from his vehicle to save him some money on fuel. I was wondering if

30:50.160 --> 30:54.240
Alex does something similar and if you have any interest in to capture this data and maybe put

30:54.240 --> 30:58.480
it into a self-hosted solution like Grafana. So I don't know if either one of us are actively

30:58.480 --> 31:04.160
capturing our OBD2 data from our cars, but I know we both have done things with them. Well, I was,

31:04.160 --> 31:07.760
I was using this thing called the automatic, which you put me onto actually, Chris.

31:07.760 --> 31:12.880
And it wasn't self-hosted. It was an entirely proprietary thing. And I used to talk to if this,

31:12.880 --> 31:18.000
then that and log all my trips in a spreadsheet. And it was, it was kind of interesting. It didn't

31:18.000 --> 31:23.920
really do a lot that was, you know, life shatteringly interesting. I would be really

31:23.920 --> 31:32.080
interested in a device that went into my OBD2 port and could talk to my Grafana and InfluxDB

31:32.080 --> 31:38.080
set up. But then you have to factor in that it needs a cellular connection as well as GPS. And

31:38.880 --> 31:43.920
very quickly it becomes quite a complicated device. So unless you already have a LAN in your vehicle

31:43.920 --> 31:51.760
like I do, not everyone's house is their car. Yeah. I actually mostly just use this for real

31:51.760 --> 31:59.120
time data. It is so aggravating how much information my truck's computer inside the RV has

31:59.120 --> 32:04.320
that is not displayed on the dashboard. I kind of get it for your average commuter car, maybe,

32:04.320 --> 32:09.120
you know, just a couple of dummy lights and some dials fine, but in a super duty engine that's

32:09.120 --> 32:12.880
massive, that has all these different thermal things and just like all these sensors that

32:12.880 --> 32:19.040
they've built in the, the car computer, the truck engine computer is collecting an incredible amount

32:19.040 --> 32:24.960
of information and doing nothing with it. And I find that so aggravating. So I did get just some

32:24.960 --> 32:31.040
crappy one, some Bluetooth OBD2 dongle that you plug in every car manufactured in the United

32:31.040 --> 32:37.600
States since 2012 or sold in the United States at least since 2012 has these ports. You plug it in

32:37.600 --> 32:41.280
there and different vehicles will give you different levels of information. So you need to

32:41.280 --> 32:46.080
pair that with a device that understands the information from your vehicle's engine. A lot of

32:46.080 --> 32:50.640
the apps that you can get for your phone that talk to these dongles have a database of vehicles and

32:50.640 --> 32:55.280
they can kind of do something with the information. And I put that up on either an iOS device or an

32:55.280 --> 32:59.360
Android device as I'm going down the road, especially when I'm going over passes, and I get

33:00.240 --> 33:05.040
all my coolant information, all of my air intake information, I get my engine performance, my turbo

33:05.040 --> 33:10.400
boost information, I get the transmission temperature, the oil temperature, I get all the

33:10.400 --> 33:16.080
sensor information that is never displayed to me on my dash. And I've never thought about capturing

33:16.080 --> 33:20.960
that. But when Pete wrote in with this email, kind of made me realize this would be a fascinating

33:20.960 --> 33:26.320
way to monitor the long term health of an engine, wouldn't it? It's taking all of this data and

33:26.320 --> 33:30.800
graphing it and then seeing trend lines change over time. That's really the power of a good

33:30.800 --> 33:36.160
graph, isn't it? It's just seeing that the overall trend. I mean, the humidity in my basement to

33:36.160 --> 33:41.440
come back to a previous episode, I was able to spot different storms throughout the year and

33:41.440 --> 33:46.320
notice the trend that in the summer it was getting too high, because I had it graphed every day. And

33:46.320 --> 33:50.960
I think if you're able to take a decent set of readings are actually meaningful readings. I mean,

33:50.960 --> 33:55.920
I don't know what you'd necessarily do with oil temperature, although maybe you'd see that over

33:55.920 --> 34:01.120
six months, it creeps up by an average of three or four degrees. Who knows? Certainly an interesting

34:01.120 --> 34:06.480
thing. And if anybody has any, any solutions in the audience, please write in self hosted dot show

34:06.480 --> 34:12.080
slash contact. Optimus Gray writes in. He wants us to put on our consulting hats. So get your day job

34:12.080 --> 34:18.000
hat on there. Alex says I was looking at my Docker list and I have four MariaDBs running. One is my

34:18.000 --> 34:24.160
personal website. I have C file. I have get T and next cloud. Should I work on merging these into

34:24.160 --> 34:30.000
one database, one's database server, or is it worth keeping four copies or more of the same

34:30.000 --> 34:36.560
image running? What a great question. There is no right answer to this question. I don't think. No,

34:36.560 --> 34:41.680
I agree. You asked three different people, you get three different answers. So there are two main

34:41.680 --> 34:45.920
schools of thought, right? So my assumption is that all of these different things are using the

34:45.920 --> 34:53.040
same database engine underneath, whether that's MySQL, Postgres, whatever, it doesn't really matter

34:53.040 --> 34:58.560
what the database is. For a while, for a couple of years, I actually just ran one MySQL database

34:58.560 --> 35:04.400
I actually just ran one MySQL container and then just manually went in through the MySQL command

35:04.400 --> 35:09.760
line and created new databases, added new users, scoped them correctly and learned a little bit

35:09.760 --> 35:16.240
about the MySQL command line. But lately I've been spinning up a lot of stuff for the show

35:16.240 --> 35:21.840
on Linode and doing a lot of stuff for family members and friends and stuff like that and just

35:21.840 --> 35:25.840
testing out a lot of stuff for the podcast, really. And so I don't want to have to futz

35:25.840 --> 35:30.400
with that every time. And most containers that you spin up, most database containers,

35:30.960 --> 35:35.040
have the option to feed in through environment variables, the username and password for that

35:35.040 --> 35:40.560
specific database table you need to create for the app. And so lately I've moved into

35:41.440 --> 35:47.760
creating a database instance per app. It's a bit wasteful in terms of system resources, but

35:48.640 --> 35:52.960
I think it's, you know, in terms of simplicity, it's a lot easier to manage in terms of backups,

35:52.960 --> 35:59.600
in terms of administration, initial setup. One database per container is my current strategy.

35:59.600 --> 36:04.400
Yeah, it really is what you're trying to get out of your setup. Do you want simplicity

36:04.400 --> 36:07.760
and the ability to just easily tear it down and throw things back up again,

36:07.760 --> 36:13.680
or do you want efficiency? And you could also argue that if you only have one instance of a

36:13.680 --> 36:18.960
database running, not only do you save system resources, but you theoretically reduce your

36:18.960 --> 36:22.960
tech surface, right? So there's not as many vulnerabilities when there's something that shows

36:22.960 --> 36:28.000
up in MariaDB. You have only one instance instead of four. You have one version instead of

36:28.000 --> 36:32.400
potentially four different versions, depending on how the containers are set up. So while there is

36:32.400 --> 36:36.880
advantage to it, I think I'm going to side with Alex here is because we kind of used to do the

36:36.880 --> 36:42.880
same exact thing, is we had one database server, both for our cloud instances and for our local

36:42.880 --> 36:49.200
instances. And then all of the containers and applications would use those. And it worked fine.

36:50.080 --> 36:56.480
But we did run into a couple of instances where the application expected it was the sole

36:56.480 --> 37:02.080
use of the database, or there were several scenarios where it became a lot more overhead

37:02.080 --> 37:06.320
to maintain that one instance and reconfigure software on the regular. And what we ended up

37:06.320 --> 37:12.080
doing when we kind of redid things recently is we did the same thing as Alex just suggested.

37:12.080 --> 37:16.160
We just went ahead and did a database for each one of the applications we're running that pulls it

37:16.160 --> 37:20.400
down. And it does mean that I have a couple of instances of the same database software running,

37:20.400 --> 37:24.560
and I don't find that ideal. But because they're not open to the general public,

37:24.560 --> 37:29.280
they're not even open to the general network, I don't consider the attack surface issue to be

37:29.280 --> 37:36.160
as serious as I would have back in the day when these were entire VMs or they were entire physical

37:36.160 --> 37:41.040
servers that were on the LAN and maybe even connected to the public internet, God forbid.

37:41.040 --> 37:47.360
And in that scenario, I would consider the efficiency and the lower attack surface a much

37:47.360 --> 37:51.600
higher important consideration. But when you're running it for yourself on your own LAN,

37:51.600 --> 37:56.240
you maybe have very limited control of what can talk to it publicly. I think the risk scenario

37:56.240 --> 38:00.640
goes down, and then the convenience and reproducibility factor becomes more important.

38:00.640 --> 38:06.160
And I say, just let it be and run each one individually and save yourself the hassle.

38:06.160 --> 38:11.840
The other thing is, if you want to port one service to a different system, let's say you

38:11.840 --> 38:17.280
wanted to move Nextcloud from your LAN to a Linode instance, for example, you haven't got to then

38:17.280 --> 38:22.720
worry about MySQL commands to export and dump databases and all that kind of stuff. You just

38:22.720 --> 38:28.160
move the Docker app volumes and you're good to go. Jay writes in with our last email this week,

38:28.160 --> 38:31.760
and it's a frustrating one. He has an issue where when his clients go to sleep,

38:31.760 --> 38:36.560
they're unable to remount the NFS on his FreeNAS. He tried Samba, but it's not ideal with FreeNAS

38:36.560 --> 38:42.160
in his opinion. And he wanted a solution to automatically remount these. We've mentioned

38:42.160 --> 38:47.040
AutoFS in the past, but he said it's running into some deficiencies. And so I knew this has got to

38:47.040 --> 38:51.040
be a problem that other people run into, where you have a laptop or you have a desktop, it goes

38:51.040 --> 38:56.080
into power saving mode, you bring it back up, and now your mounts are dead. They just will not

38:56.080 --> 39:00.480
reconnect despite all of the tools that are supposed to make them do it. I have some advice

39:00.480 --> 39:04.560
for you, Jay, and anyone else that runs into this. This is an area where it's worth learning

39:04.560 --> 39:10.560
a little bit of SystemD because SystemD has a facility for this that is network aware.

39:10.560 --> 39:13.920
And then it notices that when your network connection comes back up, which is actually

39:13.920 --> 39:19.040
what's happening when you're waking from sleep, it'll auto remount those file systems. And I have

39:19.040 --> 39:24.880
resources in the show notes to help with that. Cloudfree.shop. This is where you go to buy stuff

39:24.880 --> 39:30.880
that's ready to run on your LAN and never needs a cloud connection. A wide range of smart home devices

39:30.880 --> 39:35.600
that come pre flashed with Tasmota. No cloud connection means that you run it for as long as

39:35.600 --> 39:41.040
you want. You own it. And something that Alex and I brought up last episode and we've been informed

39:41.040 --> 39:47.360
is on the cloudfree.shop is these little metal NFC tags that work outdoors that are kind of,

39:47.360 --> 39:52.560
I think, the best looking to. They're on the shop for a dollar a piece. How great is that? So go to

39:52.560 --> 39:57.600
cloudfree.shop and use the coupon code self-hosted at checkout and you'll get a dollar off each one

39:57.600 --> 40:01.760
of the smart plugs you get, which I think they're only like 10 bucks, right? Correct. Yeah. And

40:01.760 --> 40:05.840
they're pre flashed with Tasmota. So it's a great way to get going with Home Assistant and devices

40:05.840 --> 40:13.280
you fully control at a great price. Cloudfree.shop. Well, it finally happened. Can you believe it?

40:13.280 --> 40:20.960
ESXi on a Raspberry Pi. Now, are you taking it seriously? No. I thought this might be it. Yeah,

40:20.960 --> 40:25.360
ESXi. Now, it's a fling edition, which means it's not really meant for production,

40:25.360 --> 40:29.760
but I think they're really serious about it. And I'm going to try it out. There is some

40:29.760 --> 40:34.320
current limitations I thought maybe people should be aware of that are kind of important,

40:34.320 --> 40:38.880
but I think this is huge. Is it the limitation that I read where you can't actually run any VMs

40:38.880 --> 40:44.800
on it? No. No, it's the issue is there's no local storage at the moment. Not even USB.

40:44.800 --> 40:49.520
Not a big deal at all, that one. No, you just do it over NFS. It's fine. It's fine. Yeah,

40:49.520 --> 40:55.680
you do it over it. But it is ESXi 7. You do have to have UEFI boot. And so there's a few extra

40:55.680 --> 40:59.360
steps you have to go through. I'll have a link in the show notes to how to walk through all of that.

40:59.360 --> 41:06.400
But all said and done, you can run four or five ARM VMs on this. You have about six gigs of RAM

41:06.400 --> 41:11.840
leftover after you have VMware in the core OS. It uses somewhere in the neighborhood of just under

41:11.840 --> 41:16.480
two gigs. But if you have an eight gigabyte edition Raspberry Pi 4, you could still run a

41:16.480 --> 41:24.240
couple of VMs. And you get a lot of the more enterprise grade features like vMotion. But also

41:24.800 --> 41:29.600
you could use this to just access VMFS file systems where in the past you'd have to have

41:29.600 --> 41:33.920
a massive expensive x86 server just to mount a disk that you need to recover files from.

41:34.480 --> 41:38.960
Now you can do it with a Raspberry Pi. Additionally, if you are learning VMware,

41:38.960 --> 41:43.280
you say you're getting a job somewhere that is using ESXi infrastructure and you don't

41:43.280 --> 41:47.280
understand VMware, well, you don't have a lot of options that aren't super expensive

41:47.920 --> 41:54.400
to learn on. But now you could go get a $75 Raspberry Pi and actually run an image from them

41:54.400 --> 41:58.640
that gives you a lot of that experience and lets you plug in with the wider VMware infrastructure.

41:59.200 --> 42:02.800
And there's got to be some decent backup scenarios. I'm not even thinking with this.

42:02.800 --> 42:08.240
So you're going to be limited to ARM VMs, but you imagine something like this, Alex,

42:08.240 --> 42:13.760
and you say the Raspberry Pi 8. And now all of a sudden you could see how this could be

42:13.760 --> 42:18.800
really great, like at the edge or on-premises virtualization to run several services on a low

42:18.800 --> 42:24.320
power little Raspberry Pi. But you get the additional benefit of everything being in VMware

42:24.320 --> 42:29.680
so you can manage it with your entire tool set. And I could see this going somewhere kind of cool.

42:29.680 --> 42:32.080
It's early days, but I could see it getting pretty neat.

42:32.080 --> 42:36.560
The cynic in me thinks the only reason VMware are doing this is because of Apple.

42:36.560 --> 42:40.720
When I listened to a podcast, which we have a link in the show notes too, that talked about

42:40.720 --> 42:48.560
a lot of the larger server ARM boards that are these massive ARM systems, minimum 16-core,

42:49.520 --> 42:53.600
160 gigs of RAM minimum kind of system, like massive ARM boxes,

42:53.600 --> 42:58.320
and go up to several terabytes of RAM and whatnot, 24 cores and 32 cores.

42:58.320 --> 43:02.240
One of the things they were saying, though, is that, again, it's the problem of developing

43:02.240 --> 43:08.720
software for those big data center ARM boxes. Developers need something that is approachable

43:08.720 --> 43:13.600
that they can execute ARM code on. And the nice thing about VMware here is they're abstracting

43:13.600 --> 43:19.120
out the details of, are you specifically supporting the Raspberry Pi's video card

43:19.120 --> 43:23.840
and network controller? Or can you just deploy for VMware and just focus on creating really

43:23.840 --> 43:27.200
fast ARM code and then eventually move that up to the cloud? And I think that's part of

43:27.200 --> 43:30.800
their strategy is to give people a development environment they can run on their land,

43:30.800 --> 43:35.600
throw in their bag to deploy on ARM in the cloud running VMware.

43:35.600 --> 43:40.240
You know where I can see this being useful? If you're a traveling salesperson or pre-sales

43:40.240 --> 43:45.120
engineer or something, whip out a Raspberry Pi in a sales meeting and boom. If you don't want

43:45.120 --> 43:48.160
to use AWS for some reason, I don't know. You know that's going to be a thing,

43:48.160 --> 43:52.640
right? People showing up with Pi's and little virtual environments. I'm not a big VMware guy

43:52.640 --> 43:59.440
anymore, but I did, as part of an old job as a previous life, run an infrastructure on VMware.

43:59.440 --> 44:04.960
And so I get kind of excited about this. If this was usable for say, solidly four VMs,

44:05.520 --> 44:08.880
I could see have gone, I mean, have gone this way. I could have gone this way potentially,

44:08.880 --> 44:12.000
instead of having four Pi's, I could have had maybe one eight gig Pi.

44:12.000 --> 44:16.240
I view this very much as a signal of intent rather than something that's useful right now.

44:16.240 --> 44:20.000
Yeah. Something I'm definitely going to keep an eye on and I'll probably wait for a couple of

44:20.000 --> 44:25.040
builds because they're getting a lot of community feedback and they're rolling out releases. So I'm

44:25.040 --> 44:28.400
going to wait for a release or two to land and then I think I'm going to try it on my eight gig Pi.

44:28.400 --> 44:32.880
Now we found a pick for you. This one's called Archivee and it's a self-hosted knowledge

44:32.880 --> 44:37.520
repository that allows you to safely preserve useful content that contributes to your own

44:37.520 --> 44:41.600
personal knowledge bank. Yeah. Imagine like sucking down an entire website and all of its

44:41.600 --> 44:47.280
assets into your own knowledge bank. That's a pretty cool idea. And I like that it ties in

44:47.280 --> 44:51.600
with pocket. If you happen to use that, you can set it up so that anything you put in pocket,

44:51.600 --> 44:56.480
it just sucks all down into your own personal database. I think the UI to navigate it

44:56.480 --> 45:02.320
is a little simplistic, but it gets the job done. And it's a really super cool concept. If you are

45:02.320 --> 45:06.960
an archivist who likes to just pull down all of the things for your research, I've definitely had

45:06.960 --> 45:12.000
projects where we linked to stuff and then that website goes offline or the story changes. And

45:12.000 --> 45:16.240
I really had wished I'd archived an original version. Yeah. Having that local copy of stuff's

45:16.240 --> 45:21.200
very useful. I can't remember what the show was, but I saw another example of Netflix or was it

45:21.200 --> 45:26.720
maybe Disney censoring? I think it was The Simpsons. So it must be Disney censoring episodes of The

45:26.720 --> 45:32.640
Simpsons that are on Disney Plus. Whereas if you had the DVD on your shelf, they could never change

45:32.640 --> 45:38.160
it. So it's a similar kind of mindset. It seems like the project is fairly active and the developer

45:38.160 --> 45:42.400
intends to add integrations with Hacker News and Reddit. So if you have stories on there that you've

45:42.960 --> 45:47.520
upvoted, you could potentially integrate that in with this and just have it go and automatically
