1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,280
Coming up on the show, I discover a networking miracle.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,440
Alex has been playing with electrics and we review the wise cam three.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,680
I'm Chris and I'm Alex, and this is self-hosted.

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,320
Well, this is a bit of a low hanging fruit, isn't it?

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,320
I remember a time before Google,

6
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,920
and that was what it was like this morning, wasn't it?

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,720
That's where you're going with that.

8
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:24,400
Oh, yeah, right.

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,840
Because as we record this, Google had itself a bit of an outage.

10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,520
They experienced a system outage

11
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:33,520
that was due to an internal storage quota issue, according to Google.

12
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,160
So Google ran out of storage.

13
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,680
Oh, oh, oh, yeah.

14
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,320
Yeah. Then, you know, it wasn't what more than a month ago

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,160
that there was a big outage with Amazon when one of their

16
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,000
just one of their regions went out.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,960
More is reluctant to say cloud bad, local good.

18
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,360
But, you know, sometimes it is it is nice to wake up to these notifications.

19
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,800
You know, you see on Twitter and stuff, people losing their minds

20
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,480
and you're like, oh, um, I didn't even notice.

21
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,520
Well, this is why I think it's good to have a little balance.

22
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,640
I mean, you and I have a very balanced approach to it.

23
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,720
It's you have a little bit of here, you have a little bit of there

24
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:11,240
and you have a little bit of knowledge, maybe across several clouds, too,

25
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,720
if you're going to cloud host.

26
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,960
So that way, not one outage takes you out.

27
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,200
But, you know, there's nothing you can really do other than educate yourself,

28
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,520
which is why this episode is brought to you by a cloud guru.

29
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,440
You know, this whole tech area moves really fast,

30
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,720
so you need to keep up to date.

31
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,160
It's sort of just the way it works, and that's what ACG does.

32
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:32,120
Their courses and labs are always online and obsessively updated.

33
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:35,120
And they curate all the news on AWS, Kubernetes, Linux and more.

34
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,920
So stay up to date at a cloud guru dot com.

35
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,000
And it's why I've opted to move some of our storage here offline at the studio.

36
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,840
I have more and more that I store at the studio

37
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,800
and more and more services that we run on premises than ever before.

38
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:54,360
And even this that you this tool that you and I are using to communicate

39
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,320
once the session is established, it's peer to peer.

40
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:01,920
And the tool you and I are using to write code EMD is self-hosted.

41
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,440
It's up on a cloud server that we control that we self-host.

42
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,280
Yeah, the downside is when all those alerts start firing,

43
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,560
it's you that has to fix them.

44
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,680
I've said this many times.

45
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,840
Yes, that is the downside of self-hosting.

46
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,960
Absolutely. It is absolutely that.

47
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:20,120
And then the more people that you have using it, the more stressful that gets.

48
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,240
That's why I kind of really like my home network,

49
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:29,040
because it's it's this knowable problem with a set limit on users

50
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,720
and a set limit on severity of everything.

51
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,520
Right. So if there's an outage for a day, it's OK.

52
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,760
We'll just we'll get by.

53
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,800
You know, it's funny is this week I've been doing hardware shuffles in my house.

54
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,280
I've been rebuilding servers and moving hard drives around

55
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,440
between different cases and boxes and stuff.

56
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,640
It was really as a consequence of the Helios review,

57
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:54,200
realizing that device wasn't going to be suitable for my main NAS.

58
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:59,040
I bought a U-NAS chassis off of eBay for 125, I think.

59
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,560
It takes eight three and a half inch drives.

60
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,240
So I've been moving stuff around all week.

61
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,480
And I didn't want to have Plex online whilst I did that,

62
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:11,240
so that libraries didn't index stuff that was missing and things like that.

63
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:15,240
And I got it back up last night after about five or six days.

64
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,040
And Catherine went, oh, I've really missed this.

65
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,920
Yeah, I would definitely miss it if there was an outage.

66
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,160
That's for sure.

67
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:27,640
But it is a different scale of severness, I guess is what I'm thinking.

68
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,840
But it was still kind of even with that.

69
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:36,400
I just recently completed kind of a rechange of my home server set up in Lady Joops.

70
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,800
Yeah, I saw on Instagram you've got like a sexy LED home server

71
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,320
covered going on now, right?

72
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,440
Well, previously on Self Hosted Alex.

73
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,440
You remember when I was talking about my upgraded LTE system,

74
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,640
and there was one component that still had to get wired in,

75
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,240
and that was the antenna that goes externally.

76
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,440
And so when I talked about it last time on the show,

77
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:00,280
I was using an antenna array that was internal to the RV.

78
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:05,040
And I have this seven in one that is on the roof that does all these great things.

79
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,440
But it needed to be completely wired in.

80
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:11,480
And where I wanted to wire it in, I was not comfortable drilling myself

81
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:15,640
because it was where some wiring has been done for the solar panel.

82
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,560
So really wanted to be careful and have an expert's eye on it.

83
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,880
And I brought it into the shop.

84
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,360
I waited because they were super busy.

85
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,720
I bring it into the shop.

86
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,360
And he says, we can't drill there.

87
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,440
He looks at he says, yeah, we can't drill there.

88
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:32,440
And I was a little devastated because this spot that I had

89
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,560
was where I was going to move everything,

90
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,440
because those who have been listening for a while know that over the summer

91
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,120
when I traveled to Texas, I had severe thermal issues

92
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,280
with where I had put all my server gear.

93
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:48,000
And I have identified a new spot that would be perfect.

94
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It's ventilated. It's got power.

95
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,240
And if I could just bring the antenna in right there, it would have been ideal, Alex.

96
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,600
But the problem is that antennas cord length can't be any longer than six feet.

97
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,920
So where that antenna goes, everything else has to go.

98
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,920
What does it plug into?

99
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:08,120
Is it like an RPSMA on the end of it or essentially it plugs into my router.

100
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:12,960
The antenna feeds into my router, which is just these small standard antenna connections.

101
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,840
Ethernet, then?

102
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,760
They're common RF coax connectors.

103
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:20,520
Specifically, these are Jack female and male plugs that come in.

104
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:25,280
There's like six or seven of them that come in as a bundle

105
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,520
that are all really kind of tightly bundled together

106
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,400
that plug in directly to the back of my PEP Wave router.

107
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:35,280
OK, so it's like the thing that goes into the back of your cable box or something.

108
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,280
Very similar, right?

109
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,600
Right, and so that means the router has to be there,

110
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,640
which kind of dictates where the switch goes,

111
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,960
which then kind of dictates where the servers go

112
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,920
because I don't want to have my servers connected back to my switch over Wi-Fi.

113
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:52,920
And it kind of just it's a whole domino effect of where all the equipment goes.

114
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:58,120
And when this spot that I had really picked out from a thermal solution was going to be perfect.

115
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,800
So when that didn't work out, my my only other spot was was plan B.

116
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:07,480
And it was up in the driver's cab area where there is some cupboards

117
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:12,560
that get very hot, Alex, like a like a pizza oven.

118
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,640
So we we wrecked a pair of headphones by leaving them in there over the summer.

119
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,360
Like they just disintegrated the plastic.

120
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,280
Oh, no, I really didn't want to put the antenna in this spot.

121
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,000
But when you look at the wiring and what's available and the distances

122
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,160
it needs for metal objects on the roof and all the solar panels I have up there,

123
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,680
which I didn't consider this problem when I went all solar crazy.

124
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,040
I had to put it up in this front cab and that's where it just had to go.

125
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:41,920
And so so then I had to figure out a way to get enough equipment in this cupboard

126
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:45,280
that could be maybe somehow have a chance of succeeding.

127
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,120
I knew I couldn't put the raspberry pies in there, though.

128
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:52,240
And after years of research, Alex.

129
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,480
And I'm not kidding you.

130
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,240
I cannot I could not exaggerate this point enough.

131
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:04,200
I watch four or five to a dozen RV videos a day for the last five years,

132
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,880
literally seven days a week.

133
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:10,720
I'm a member of several RV community forums, including community forums

134
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,160
that are specifically about mobile data and networking in RVs

135
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,280
that have an eighty dollar a year membership fee.

136
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,760
So we're talking like people who really want to be in this club,

137
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:25,960
who really are detailed and nowhere ever has anyone ever told me

138
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:29,800
if power line networking works in an RV.

139
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,560
Those of you who are not familiar with power line networking,

140
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,720
it's essentially a way to transmit data over the power line,

141
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,760
kind of kind of like how DSL works.

142
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,840
It's that over your power line in your house.

143
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,520
And there's certain limitations.

144
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,400
And an RV is certainly no home.

145
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:49,760
And so because I had never seen anybody ever talk about this,

146
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,720
I assumed it was absolutely impossible.

147
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,480
But I figured I'll give it a go, Alex.

148
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:58,000
I picked up these TP-Link AV1000 adapters.

149
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,120
Have you ever tried this power line networking stuff?

150
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,080
I did, actually.

151
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:05,040
And this is when I was a teenager a while ago.

152
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:08,840
And it was slow and it was fairly reliable.

153
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,920
And it certainly beat running an ethernet cable through brick

154
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,320
and plasterboard walls in England.

155
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,840
But has it gotten better now?

156
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,680
Yes, because the last time I tried it was probably no joke,

157
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:24,800
probably about 18 years ago, maybe 15 years ago.

158
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,840
It's been a long time.

159
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,880
And I got maybe 8, 10, 11 megabits back then,

160
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,960
if I was lucky.

161
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,560
Funny, I think that's probably exactly the same sort

162
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,440
of time frame, 15, 18 years ago.

163
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,280
They kind of just had their moment back then

164
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,240
because Wi-Fi wasn't really reliable.

165
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,000
They faded after Wi-Fi got so popular.

166
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I remember struggling with Wi-Fi drivers on Windows XP.

167
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,400
I think that was what drove me to power line ethernet.

168
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,160
Right, well, and remember the early stuff

169
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,040
was only like 11 megabits in the home, which was just not

170
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:55,360
even enough to stream videos to the Xbox or something.

171
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,160
So that's what I started using it for,

172
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,520
was to connect whatever I was using back then

173
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,400
as a media server to my Xbox that was either hacked

174
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:06,680
or just trying to use DLNA or something to play video.

175
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,120
And it was just enough back then.

176
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,160
But in the intervening years, they've kept at it.

177
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,720
And I think TP-Link is one of the standout companies

178
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,440
in this area now.

179
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,360
And I've been happier and happier with TP-Link

180
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,560
since I got their KASA devices.

181
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,920
And they just integrated so easily into Home Assistant.

182
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,120
And so when I saw TP-Link was in this market,

183
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,760
they were one of the first I looked at.

184
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,160
And I picked up an AV1000 kit.

185
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,240
Now, on the box, it claims it's going

186
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:39,200
to get you 1,000 megabits.

187
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,380
I don't know, maybe.

188
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,760
I don't know if that's possible.

189
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,560
Maybe if nothing else is plugged in, I'm not sure.

190
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:49,280
But I'd have been happy with a good solid 100 megabits.

191
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:55,120
Because what I decided to do was put the router, a switch,

192
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,960
a couple of items that I need for my POE

193
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:01,160
gear for the junkyard that's POE, which I can talk about more

194
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,120
in a bit.

195
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:02,920
And that's about it.

196
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,040
I got a really small switch.

197
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:07,520
I got a really cheap TP-Link gigabit switch.

198
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,660
I installed them all.

199
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:12,680
They all have to be really well held down because it's moving.

200
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:17,760
So I installed them all using this industrial grade Velcro

201
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,760
on top of a large laptop cooling fan.

202
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,600
So the router and the switch and the POE gear

203
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,880
have air blowing on them from this laptop cooling fan.

204
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,800
And then we drilled ventilation holes

205
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,580
underneath and in the back of the cab

206
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:35,600
so it can draw air and exit air to hopefully get

207
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,920
a little bit of airflow going.

208
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,160
I'm going to actually add a fan to the exit hole,

209
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,660
but I just haven't done it yet.

210
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:43,040
And then the POE adapter sits in there,

211
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,200
and it connects back to the booth where I have now

212
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,760
a reduced Raspberry Pi load.

213
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,840
And I've split up some of the Wi-Fi and the internet

214
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,000
connectivity gear from the server gear,

215
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,120
and I've linked them up over POE.

216
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,320
And it worked out of the box in the RV.

217
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,200
They just immediately saw each other.

218
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,760
I had zero configuration.

219
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,160
Plug one in, plug the other one in, boom, they're online.

220
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:10,520
And I'm getting 300 megabits transfer rate between them.

221
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,600
That's perfect.

222
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,680
It's great, Alex.

223
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,400
It's great.

224
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,320
And so it means now I can spread out the load.

225
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,240
And I would really appreciate any experience

226
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:22,440
the audience has with these power line adapters.

227
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,640
What happens if I add another one?

228
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,920
What happens if I add two more?

229
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,400
Do I have to add them in pairs?

230
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,200
How does that work?

231
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,740
Because what I was thinking is that original spot

232
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:34,520
that I had thought would work really well for the servers,

233
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,440
if I could spread things out a little bit,

234
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,360
I could maybe put a power line adapter in there

235
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,240
and set some stuff up in that original spot

236
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,080
I was thinking of that would have been so great,

237
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,600
take advantage of the cooling there,

238
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,880
and connect it all together with power line networking.

239
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:52,000
But I really don't want to have an impact on the performance.

240
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,320
And looking at the way the technology works,

241
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,360
it seems like any more traffic you put on the power line,

242
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,800
it will reduce performance.

243
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,320
But are we talking by 50% or are we talking 5%?

244
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,600
It's just not clear to me.

245
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,360
And it's not really clear to me if it

246
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,560
has to be done in pairs or what.

247
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,440
So it feels a little bit like black magic.

248
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,720
It feels like I stumbled onto something

249
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,760
that no one in the RV community is talking about.

250
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,520
This is a fundamental game changer

251
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:25,040
for networking in a van or other, a bus or an RV.

252
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,520
As far as I'm concerned, this changed my life.

253
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,680
And I'm not kidding you.

254
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,680
This changed my life.

255
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:34,200
Because before today, I was a I'll always

256
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,360
have to be Wi-Fi in my RV guy.

257
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,840
And I don't like that.

258
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,480
I don't like it for media playback.

259
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,400
I don't like it for connecting servers back

260
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,920
to routers and switches.

261
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,240
I want a wired backhaul.

262
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,240
I always have.

263
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:50,480
It's maybe because I've been doing this forever.

264
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,520
This means even if in small quantities I can have that,

265
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,840
it's going to forever change how I have my home set up forever.

266
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,640
It's so great.

267
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,040
And they're the TP-Link AV1000s.

268
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,160
They claim a gigabit.

269
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,400
At least in my setup, I'm getting 300 megabits.

270
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,800
And when I thought through the way that electrical works

271
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,160
in the RV, it seems obvious.

272
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,560
Because the way the electrical done

273
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,960
is pretty much like a traditional house that

274
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,200
goes back to a fuse panel, a box.

275
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,840
And then that goes down to the Victron system,

276
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,360
where the solar is at.

277
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,480
So I'm delighted.

278
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,240
I put all that together in this cupboard.

279
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,560
And then I did, because this is the self-hosted podcast,

280
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:30,600
I had to put an Aotech multi-sensor in there

281
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,840
so I could monitor the temperature of the cupboard.

282
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:38,800
Because it's a glass cupboard, it's got a see-through glass,

283
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:43,320
I decided to put some LED light strips in there.

284
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,880
And I made it, at least for a little bit,

285
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,280
it was rotating rainbow colors.

286
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,320
So that way the family would see it and remember

287
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,000
what an awesome setup dad built for them.

288
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,680
And it just was really cool in Star Trek.

289
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,040
But now what I've done is it's just a nice glow.

290
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:01,400
And then when the cupboard reaches 85 degrees or higher,

291
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:05,760
the LED light strip will come on with a bright red.

292
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,000
And it'll glow red.

293
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,840
The cupboard will start glowing red because it's very bright.

294
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,960
And that'll be a visual indicator that the cupboard's

295
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,440
getting too hot, which I won't have to worry about now

296
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,560
because it's the middle of winter.

297
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,920
But in the summer.

298
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,040
Idea for you.

299
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:24,600
When you open the door, you have the Star Trek door noise play

300
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,480
through Alexa or something.

301
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,760
That'd be awesome to add some sound effects.

302
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,200
It's really pretty great.

303
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,520
It works super solid.

304
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,760
I've even had a chance to take it out into the woods

305
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,760
last week and test the entire setup,

306
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,560
the automatic cellular switch over.

307
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,200
And Alex, if it wasn't perfect, it

308
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:46,240
became perfect when I actually experienced an outage.

309
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,600
AT&T's tower just went out, just went offline.

310
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:54,560
But the bonded VPN setup that I have through this router

311
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,000
never missed a beat.

312
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,200
I was on a call when it happened.

313
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,600
And it was a Wi-Fi call.

314
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,800
And it stayed connected.

315
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,080
It just switches over to Verizon, and then it manages.

316
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:07,560
And then when AT&T came back on 10 minutes later,

317
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,640
it just integrated it right back.

318
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,000
It was perfect.

319
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,120
The whole thing worked exactly like I wanted.

320
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,200
We spent five days off grid in the woods

321
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,800
with about an 80 megabit cellular connection.

322
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,040
It was a little bit slower than last time

323
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:25,400
because we went down a little bit further into the canyon.

324
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,160
But it was great, Alex.

325
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,520
It was so perfect.

326
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:31,400
It really felt like I had reached the peak

327
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:36,240
technological point, where we have the Home Assistant doing

328
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,360
the automation, and we have the PEP Wave doing

329
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,640
the cellular routing.

330
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:42,240
The backbone of it is this power line networking

331
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,800
that links the server switch to the telco switch.

332
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,240
All of the in-house streaming is just

333
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,960
working so good to the TVs.

334
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,280
Everything is really humming along right now.

335
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,280
Important question, then.

336
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,840
When are you going to come and see me?

337
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,600
Yeah, I know.

338
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,420
Well, I guess I'm better to come down there

339
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,960
when it's warm so I can put it all

340
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,640
through the thermal testing.

341
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,240
Oh, the other thing I've got to consider

342
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,760
is, do I want to drill another hole

343
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,680
in the side of the cupboard?

344
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,600
This is a spot where you can see it.

345
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,520
I'll put a link to the pictures in the show notes

346
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,960
so everybody can visualize what I'm talking about.

347
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,840
Do I want to drill a hole and run an ethernet cable

348
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,720
through there?

349
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,560
Because I've got this extension cable,

350
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:21,880
and I run PoE out to a WISP antenna at my home base.

351
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,040
And it just, I don't know what to do with it.

352
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,600
I just, I hate to drill a hole somewhere like that where

353
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,240
you can see it.

354
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,160
And I'm not very good with that kind of stuff.

355
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,360
So right now, I just kind of have

356
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,520
running through the door with the door slightly cracked,

357
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,680
and then the cord comes into the PoE adapter.

358
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,280
Oh, yeah, because that looks better.

359
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,960
Yeah, I know.

360
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,800
It's just not permanent, so it's like, I haven't committed.

361
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,440
Get yourself a 3D printer, drill a hole,

362
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:47,520
and then print a custom cable grommet for it.

363
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,160
Ooh, that sounds really fancy.

364
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,760
You're right, I do need to come visit.

365
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,280
I'll come down there, and we'll work on that.

366
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,240
lino.com slash SSH.

367
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:58,400
Go there to get a $100 60-day credit towards a new account,

368
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,280
and you go there to support the show.

369
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,940
It's our cloud hosting provider.

370
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:04,160
When I mentioned earlier that I had a bonded VPN,

371
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,840
I set that up on Linode.

372
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,520
And unlike entry-level hosting services

373
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,200
that lock you into their platform,

374
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,840
Linode gives you full back-end access

375
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:14,320
to customize and control the server to fit your needs.

376
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:17,480
So I followed a guide to reimage and set up

377
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:22,720
a Linode with a custom OS that PepWave uses, or PepLink uses,

378
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,640
for this bonded VPN that combines multiple LTE connections

379
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,400
together.

380
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:31,240
And what's super nice is I can support multiple Linodes.

381
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,080
So I can spin up one in multiple areas,

382
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:36,320
and then I can have up to three that all are participating

383
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,880
in this bonded VPN.

384
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:41,240
And because Linode's prices start at $5 a month,

385
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:45,520
this is significantly less than what the company PepWave,

386
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,520
or PepLink, whoever, would charge to host this.

387
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,220
Their price, I'm not kidding you, is $100 a month,

388
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:53,720
and that has a ridiculous data cap on it.

389
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,800
So when you look at what you can do at Linode for $5 a month,

390
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,300
it just was the obvious way to go,

391
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,440
and it just took me 15, 20 minutes.

392
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,960
I followed a guide and got it done.

393
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,440
But you can do one-button deployments.

394
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:09,240
One time, I was trying out different WordPress setups

395
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,420
to see which was fastest, because Linode has what's

396
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:14,000
called the stack scripts, where you can deploy

397
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,160
different applications on different distributions.

398
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,040
You're not stuck to one distribution.

399
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:21,760
And so they had ones that were like WordPress sitting

400
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,280
on top of a web server that runs out of RAM,

401
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,720
and WordPress that sits on top of NGINX,

402
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,040
and WordPress that sits on top of Apache.

403
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,400
So I was like, well, let's just see what

404
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,480
it's like to use all of them.

405
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,200
And so I deployed one of each, one at a time,

406
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,880
and just tested each one out for a website I was building,

407
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,800
and then I picked the one that worked best for me.

408
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,680
And it's great like that, because then you just

409
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,280
destroy the machines you don't need, and you're good to go.

410
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,360
And when you get $100 credit, you've got a lot to work with

411
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,880
here, because like I'm saying, those prices are great.

412
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:53,480
So make sure you go to linode.com slash SSH

413
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,280
to get that $100 60-day credit towards your new account.

414
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,000
You support the show, you get the credit,

415
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,600
you can do some really fun stuff.

416
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,520
And the great thing about Linode is they've been around

417
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,840
forever, they know how to do this.

418
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,140
They started before AWS, they followed the tech,

419
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:07,120
they figured out where it was going,

420
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,440
and they were driven by a passion.

421
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,960
And I think maybe you get why that matters.

422
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,960
So try them out, linode.com slash SSH.

423
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,900
Okay, power usage time.

424
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,080
I promised this last week.

425
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,640
And again, this is a follow-up almost,

426
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,760
or kind of, to the Helios stuff.

427
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,700
So we're talking in the Discord with King Hat, actually,

428
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:30,680
I think his username is, about the power usage

429
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,080
of the Helios and things like that.

430
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,480
And in last week's episode, I proclaimed it was 30 watts

431
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:38,000
at full load, no matter what you did.

432
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,520
But I've done a little bit more testing

433
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,200
and a bit more detail and compared it

434
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:46,200
to my dual Xeon setup, an i5-8500, and the Helios.

435
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,360
So here we go.

436
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,120
The Helios is, of course, an ARM base CPU.

437
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:57,240
So low idle power draw is its bread and butter,

438
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,600
you would think, wouldn't you?

439
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,360
I would hope, that'd be maybe number one reason

440
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,200
I'm buying it.

441
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,300
Uh-huh, so 14 watts at idle.

442
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,040
So what I did, I did a 10-minute average

443
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:10,960
with one of my smart plugs, it has metering built in,

444
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,220
and I used Home Assistant to measure a 10-minute average,

445
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:17,320
rolling average of each of these numbers

446
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,160
you're about to hear.

447
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:22,560
So the Helios was 14 watts, no hard drives or anything,

448
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,840
just idle, running at bone stock, Debian install,

449
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,520
that was all it was doing, just,

450
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,900
there was no services running, nothing.

451
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:33,080
Plugged into the network, SSH'd in, and that was it.

452
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,800
Running HTOP, I think.

453
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,720
Brilliant that you thought to test at baseline

454
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,280
without the disk, that's a great idea.

455
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,760
And so then I thought, hmm, I've got an i5-8500 CPU here

456
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,440
with my Blue Iris box.

457
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:50,180
So why don't I do the same test with that?

458
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,840
23 watts.

459
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,560
So we're talking a nine watt difference

460
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:59,480
between an i5-8500 and the Helios 64.

461
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:03,800
And there is a significant, to sound like you there,

462
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:07,560
significant difference between the two

463
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,300
in terms of capabilities.

464
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,600
Well, yeah, that's a good way to put it

465
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,160
because it's not just performance, is it?

466
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,320
It's also compatibility.

467
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,320
Absolutely.

468
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:19,600
And so then for giggles, I did my dual Xeon system as well.

469
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,120
And that one, as you would expect, was atrocious.

470
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:26,080
140 watts idle, so 10 times the Helios.

471
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,000
Yeah, that's bad.

472
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,440
That said, the dual Xeon did have 128 gigs of RAM in there,

473
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,540
so that might have contributed to it.

474
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:35,080
Again, all of these systems had no hard drives connected.

475
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,400
It was literally just bare minimum,

476
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,720
minimum viable system to get these numbers.

477
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,400
So then I did a full load, 10-minute average

478
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,560
using STUI, S2E, something we've covered

479
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,600
on LAP previously, I think.

480
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:54,560
And so the Helios, and again, no drives, 20 watts.

481
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,000
So you went from 14 to 20 at full load.

482
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,740
So the CPU's only drawing six watts

483
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:02,480
is what we can conclude from that, I think.

484
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,960
When it's under full load.

485
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:08,220
The i5 jumped up to 93 watts,

486
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:10,840
but the dual Xeon, 410.

487
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,560
Geez, that's like running a kitchen appliance, practically.

488
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,120
Yeah, it's legit.

489
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,440
And you think about the requirements that that creates.

490
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,080
I have a UPS in my basement.

491
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,960
So when I moved here a couple of years ago,

492
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,720
I accidentally ordered the backup battery,

493
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:31,680
like additional battery, instead of the UPS part itself.

494
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,080
Oh, I've done that once.

495
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,920
And so I went to return it to Amazon and I said,

496
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,740
oh no, keep it, it's too expensive to return.

497
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,640
It's hazardous materials or something.

498
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:43,360
And so I ordered the actual UPS part and connected that in.

499
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,640
And so I've got like a half an hour,

500
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,040
40-minute runtime on three, 400 watts,

501
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:51,960
but it's noisy when the fan starts spinning in the UPS.

502
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,800
You can hear it.

503
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,240
You wouldn't want it in the house.

504
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,200
And so when you've got like a 400 watt load

505
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,760
going through it, you have to size everything accordingly.

506
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:04,320
So you've got Helios at 20, i5 at 90,

507
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,120
and the Dual Xeon at 410 watts.

508
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,360
Big difference.

509
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,680
Now, what I thought would be interesting to do

510
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,080
would be to add some hard drives into the mix.

511
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:18,400
So I added eight drives because the i5 CPU

512
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,840
I put in the UNAZ chassis,

513
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,260
which has eight three and a half inch bays.

514
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,800
The Helios only takes five, of course.

515
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:28,560
So take these numbers with a little bit of a grain of salt,

516
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:33,560
but the Helios with five drives was 51 watts at idle,

517
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,880
which was higher than I was expecting,

518
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,320
to be honest with you.

519
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,960
One watt of 24 seven operation

520
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,320
costs approximately a dollar per year.

521
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,920
That's how I tend to think of it to run.

522
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,520
So 50 watts is 50 bucks a year.

523
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:51,720
Now the i5 system was 98 watts.

524
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,960
So twice what the Helios does,

525
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:57,520
but I would argue way more than twice as capable.

526
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:02,440
But the interesting thing is that the Xeon system

527
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:06,580
was only 185 watts with all those drives connected.

528
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:11,580
So the eight drives in the Xeon system added 45 watts

529
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,840
to the overall system.

530
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,100
Whereas with the i5 system, for some reason,

531
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:20,760
it added like 65, 70 watts.

532
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,080
It just didn't make sense to me.

533
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,060
So I ran the test again

534
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,680
and came up with the same numbers three times.

535
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:27,080
So it must be correct.

536
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:32,080
But with the Helios five drives added about 35 watts or so.

537
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:35,280
So it's just an interesting little experiment.

538
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,120
Yeah, it is.

539
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:36,940
It's interesting.

540
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:39,480
So you think of it in terms of total cost annually,

541
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,560
power consumption.

542
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:45,160
And I think of it as how many hours does that shave off

543
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,880
my ability to run off of batteries?

544
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,280
That's always the math I'm doing.

545
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:53,280
And that is a super high cost because less battery time

546
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:56,400
sometimes means I stay at an area less,

547
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,480
which means I can maybe work less

548
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,680
and I have to pack up and move everything

549
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,160
and bring the slides in sooner.

550
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,080
So it has a pretty high cost for me.

551
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:05,920
Yeah.

552
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:10,920
So sometimes my baseline is how low can I get the power draw

553
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,460
and can it do the core job I need it to do?

554
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:16,160
But I like to go a little bit above that.

555
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,720
And I feel like that's where the Raspberry Pis are for me.

556
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,400
And I, you know, what are they 15 watts, 20 watts, those?

557
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,040
I should have tested a Pi.

558
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,000
I'm kicking myself for not doing that now.

559
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,080
Maybe next time.

560
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,640
But here's where it gets really interesting

561
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,760
is when you wanna start transcoding video.

562
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,680
Yes, right.

563
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:34,440
This is for me, primarily a media server.

564
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:39,440
So Plex is gonna be the primary creator of heat,

565
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:43,640
of noise, of electricity consumption and stuff like that.

566
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:46,280
But this seems like an area where probably the Intels

567
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,080
would probably clearly have an advantage.

568
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:48,920
Yeah, absolutely.

569
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,180
So the Helios 64, I didn't even bother

570
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:54,560
because I started trying to do a 4K transcode

571
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:57,280
and it was just a full load and after eight minutes,

572
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:00,120
the 4K stream hadn't even started playing.

573
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:04,160
So I just gave up with the Helios.

574
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,080
Fail.

575
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:07,120
I know 4K transcoding is a torch test,

576
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,600
but that's kind of the point of this exercise, right?

577
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,600
You know, my philosophy is try to get the best quality

578
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:16,800
you can and then downstream it to devices for compatibility

579
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,640
because your screens are only gonna get better over time.

580
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:22,840
And, you know, I know a friend who back when HD

581
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,880
was coming along, he said it was too much storage

582
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,360
to capture the HD versions.

583
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,760
I'm just gonna capture the standard definition.

584
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,960
They're fine.

585
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,400
And now his entire collection looks like total garbage,

586
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,340
right, and he's watching off of my Plex server.

587
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:37,680
Yep.

588
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,680
And so then I did a 4K.

589
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:44,160
So this was a 4K high bit rate file.

590
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,500
I'd actually downloaded it from YouTube with YouTube DL.

591
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,080
It was one of the Costa Rica things.

592
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,660
So it was a constant file.

593
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,880
And I down sampled it, I guess,

594
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:58,120
or transcoded it to 720p at two megabytes per second.

595
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:01,760
So down from like a 40 or 50 megabit a second down to two.

596
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,960
So I was doing quite a lot of processing.

597
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:08,960
Now with the i5 at, this is software transcoding only.

598
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,200
This was with no drives connected by the way,

599
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,700
just a little bit confusing,

600
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:16,160
but this was before I put the drives in.

601
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,680
i5, 75 Watts.

602
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,800
The dual Xeon, 304.

603
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:25,960
So the dual Xeon was a lot more performant than the i5.

604
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:29,160
The stream started playing after only eight seconds

605
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:32,640
instead of about 15 or 16 with the i5,

606
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,960
but at a more than three times the energy cost.

607
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,680
Hmm, so that'd be an area probably

608
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:41,480
where I'd be willing to take that compromise.

609
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:45,780
Now the Xeon CPUs don't have quick sync.

610
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:48,240
And this is where the real magic happens.

611
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,720
The i5 does.

612
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:52,300
And this is the entire reason I selected this CPU.

613
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,700
Do you want to take a guess

614
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:59,180
at what a 4K transcode with quick sync drew?

615
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:02,440
We were at 75 with software, 75 Watts.

616
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,280
70, okay.

617
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,680
So we're at 75 Watts of software,

618
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:08,600
quick sync being the CPU accelerated encoder,

619
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,120
decoder in the Intel CPU.

620
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,960
Yes, for H.264 content.

621
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:17,240
So idle is 23 Watts, transcode is 75.

622
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,760
Where do you think quick sync put us?

623
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,640
I'm going to say 60 Watts.

624
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,000
Wrong, 35.

625
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,840
Whoa.

626
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:28,120
Quick sync was using 12 Watts to do this.

627
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,040
Game changer.

628
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,520
That is huge, huge, huge game changer.

629
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,560
Mm-hmm.

630
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,800
Absolutely phenomenal.

631
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:39,120
And to top that off, the performance matched the Xeon.

632
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,060
So it started playing in nine seconds instead of 16.

633
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:43,400
Oh, that is faint.

634
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:46,400
Did you have to do any finagling to get quick sync working?

635
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,480
Because it sounds like you tested it

636
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,280
in both on and off modes.

637
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:52,080
No, so Plex, you need Plex Pass

638
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,500
to enable hardware transcoding.

639
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:57,180
I run my Plex in a container, of course.

640
00:28:57,180 --> 00:29:00,240
I use the Linux server one, obviously.

641
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:05,240
And you pass through the device, so slash dev slash DRI

642
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,000
and check the hardware encoding box

643
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,680
in the settings of Plex and you're good to go, that's it.

644
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,820
Well, I may be picking your brain on that

645
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:19,920
because thanks to JDM's recommendation from Server Builds,

646
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:24,040
I picked up a ThinkPad, IdeaPad on a Black Friday sale

647
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:28,120
for $150 and it has an i5 with quick sync in it.

648
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:32,240
And I'm just in the process of slowly upgrading it

649
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,480
because I had to order it apart from Alibaba.

650
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,400
And so I'm just kind of putting it all together

651
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,800
thinking if I replace the PIs,

652
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,240
this is what I replace it with.

653
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:44,320
And I would love to get access to quick sync.

654
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,800
Now, you're running it native on the host,

655
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,320
so it's not like through a VM, is quick sync available?

656
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,780
Well, I was for the testing,

657
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:53,300
but then when I wanted to move it into production,

658
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:57,440
I decided to put Proxmox on the UNAZ box

659
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,920
that the new NAS I'm building.

660
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:03,080
I looked into PCI pass through of the Intel GPU

661
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:06,200
in order to give the VM access to quick sync

662
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,920
and then you could pass that through to the container.

663
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,920
Some people will think I'm mad for running a container

664
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:13,280
in a VM when I could just run the container

665
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,160
on the native host, but whatever.

666
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,520
That's what I choose to do.

667
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,600
Enjoy it, deal with it.

668
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,440
I kind of like it.

669
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,160
I mean, it's a lot of layers of snapshots

670
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,680
and backups and recovers.

671
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,840
Yeah, it is.

672
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:29,840
Now, the coolest thing is something called Intel GVT-G.

673
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:35,400
Snappy name, but awesome, awesome thing you can do here.

674
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,580
So this is kind of like the SRIOV stuff

675
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:39,480
that Wendell's been banging on about

676
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,480
on his YouTube channel for the last few weeks

677
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:45,760
with asking Nvidia to create virtual GPUs

678
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,760
that you can pass through to VMs.

679
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:51,880
So using the Intel GPU built into your CPU,

680
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:57,120
I've passed that virtual GPU through to the VM

681
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,560
and then given the Plex Docker container

682
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,780
access to that virtual GPU.

683
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:04,420
So what this means is PCI pass through used to be,

684
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:07,480
you'd have to have one GPU per VM,

685
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:10,200
but with this virtual GPU slice,

686
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,520
I can have three or four VMs

687
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:15,720
all hooked into that quick sync hardware.

688
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,520
So what I'm gonna try over the next couple of weeks

689
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:21,320
is running Blue Iris in a VM as well

690
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:25,120
and using the quick sync hardware for Plex

691
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,960
and Blue Iris at the same time.

692
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,500
Awesome, and does Proxmox give you the UI

693
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,460
to do this pass through,

694
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:32,760
or is this a command line thing you had to do?

695
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,600
How'd that work?

696
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,680
It's command line, but the documentation is really great.

697
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:39,520
If you've got any familiarity with kernel parameters

698
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:42,600
and grub and passing that kind of stuff,

699
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,120
it's pretty easy to be honest with you.

700
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,320
If you don't, feel free to hit me up in the Discord.

701
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,920
This is something I'm really, really,

702
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,940
it's what got me interested in Linux in the first place

703
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:52,000
was PCI pass through.

704
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,760
So I'd be happy to help anybody get this sorted.

705
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,280
I know Unraid makes it easy

706
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,860
to pass that stuff through through the GUI,

707
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:00,880
but I don't mind Drop.

708
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,800
It would be nice if Proxmox just had that built in,

709
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:07,040
but if it's doable at all, that gives me hope

710
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:10,200
because that's how I want to base my next setup as well.

711
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,480
I don't know if I'm gonna do it

712
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:15,240
because I mean, what I have now is working really well.

713
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:18,560
And I feel like there's more and more people out in the world

714
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,440
that are trying to build things on Raspberry Pis.

715
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:24,320
I see it all the time in the Home Assistant forums

716
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,840
and on the various different Home Lab Reddits and whatnot

717
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,600
that people are trying these Raspberry Pis out.

718
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,480
And I feel like in a way, it's sort of beneficial

719
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,880
to be there and talking about it here on the show.

720
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,840
But at the same time, like,

721
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,200
I wonder if I could take two or three Raspberry Pis,

722
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,420
I only have two running at the moment,

723
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:45,420
and consolidate it all down to one ThinkPad with QuickSync,

724
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:50,060
all based on Proxmox, I'd really like the way,

725
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:51,840
I'd like how solid that is, you know?

726
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,920
And then it's got the crash cart built in

727
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,640
if anything goes wrong.

728
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,720
I was astonished, honestly.

729
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,240
I put together this spreadsheet

730
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,120
and I couldn't believe my eyes.

731
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,280
35 watts.

732
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:05,780
So you want to offset when you're buying this stuff,

733
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:09,360
at idle, I'm saving approximately $100 a year

734
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,520
over my Jouelzeon setup.

735
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,720
And when it's doing transcoding and stuff like that,

736
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,660
the energy usage is minimal.

737
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:19,980
So instead of doing a 300 watts burst for a few minutes,

738
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:22,800
it's doing a 35 watt burst for a few minutes, you know?

739
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,640
So-

740
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,460
Huge, that's huge.

741
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,080
I think over a year,

742
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:29,560
I'm probably going to save 100 to $150 or so,

743
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,180
which, you know, starts to pay for this.

744
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:32,600
This used gear off eBay,

745
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,260
I think I paid 100 for the CPU,

746
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:36,920
100 for the motherboard and 100 for the case.

747
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,640
So in three years, it will pay for itself approximately.

748
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,320
So that's kind of the lesson, isn't it?

749
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,040
Like having gone through the whole gamut,

750
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,160
because I've seen your setup,

751
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:47,440
it's an impressive server grade setup.

752
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,440
You're now kind of on the other end of it going,

753
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,840
okay, now after I've done that,

754
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:53,240
I think I'm going to go more consumer grade with my hardware

755
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,600
and maybe I even prefer it.

756
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,520
What enabled it, and we talked about this in LUP last week,

757
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,700
was the Pi KVM project.

758
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:05,700
So now I can get BMC, IPMI grade remote access

759
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,000
to the system when I'm not in front of it using the Pi.

760
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,520
So that was like the final missing piece

761
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,680
of the jigsaw for me.

762
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:13,800
Yeah, obligatory plug.

763
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,720
You should check out that episode of Unplugged

764
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:20,000
because it was pretty cool Pi KVM setup.

765
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,400
Not the like virtualization KVM, no, no.

766
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:25,400
We're talking about the keyboard video mouse kind of KVM.

767
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,400
You remember those?

768
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,280
Episode 383, by the way.

769
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,120
Ah, there you go.

770
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:31,040
I was just looking for it.

771
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,600
Yes, 383, Murder of a Distro, where Alex covers that.

772
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,660
But I think there's just one obvious conclusion

773
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:39,920
from all of this, which I don't think you've touched on yet.

774
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:40,760
What's that?

775
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,660
Well, you clearly need to buy an Apple M1 device

776
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:45,800
to compare and contrast the power draw to performance now.

777
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,400
Oh no, you've triggered half the audience.

778
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,840
They're fed up of hearing about the Apple stuff now.

779
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,840
Ha ha ha ha.

780
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,720
Well, let's take a moment and thank

781
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:57,660
an unofficial official sponsor of the show, Cloudfree.shop.

782
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,160
This is a member of our community,

783
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:02,080
and they've done exactly what I always hoped somebody would do,

784
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:05,280
and that is create a super easy to use store that

785
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,280
sells devices that are already disconnected from the cloud

786
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:12,060
and just work over your LAN with things like Home Assistant.

787
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:14,960
There's a series of smart plugs, so if you're looking at setting

788
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,960
up something for the holidays, or you've

789
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,400
heard me talk about how I have some outdoor Wi-Fi and Z-Wave

790
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,280
devices, Cloudfree.shop has a outdoor smart plug,

791
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,000
a weatherproof outdoor smart plug

792
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,240
with two plugs pre-flashed with Tasmota.

793
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:33,640
Ready to go, 15 amps per plug, has overvoltage and overheating

794
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,920
protection, and I don't know how he's making any money

795
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,600
because he only charges $20.

796
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,200
I bought the same plug off Amazon

797
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:43,640
before he had that for $35, so there you go.

798
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,400
It also has the Aqua button, which

799
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:49,640
is a $16 little Z-Wave device that you can join to your network

800
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:52,160
and then you hit that button to trigger an automation.

801
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:55,040
For my use, it would be to set light scenes or something

802
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,120
like that.

803
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,560
There's different ones that are Z-Wave and Zigbee,

804
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,400
so you check them out there.

805
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,800
But have you dug around to anything

806
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,920
that looks good to you, Alex?

807
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,480
I have, yeah.

808
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:05,480
I ordered a couple of the smart plugs from Cloudfree.shop,

809
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,920
and they're just so easy to set up.

810
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,280
They arrive in the box.

811
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,060
You take them out, plug them in.

812
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:13,720
They broadcast a Wi-Fi network, so this is just

813
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,680
standard Tasmota setup because they

814
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,960
come pre-flashed with Tasmota.

815
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:20,640
And you connect to the Wi-Fi network on your phone,

816
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,400
put in your Wi-Fi credentials, and then it just

817
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,880
appears on the network.

818
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,920
You can then log into the web UI, which all Tasmota devices

819
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:33,920
have, set up in QTT, advertise it to connect to Home Assistant,

820
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,520
and bada-bing, bada-boom, you're good to go.

821
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,680
Magic.

822
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:42,480
He also has those nice metal gentleman NFC tags over there

823
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,200
that we've talked about before on the show,

824
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:49,480
as well as an even cheaper $0.50 NFC tag, cloudfree.shop.

825
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:52,000
And when you check out coupon code self-hosted,

826
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,160
you may get something off.

827
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:53,520
I don't know.

828
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,040
It's really just to kind of support a community member

829
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,560
and let them know we sent you.

830
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,800
Like I said, it's an unofficial official sponsor,

831
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:05,680
and we're really happy to see them grow, cloudfree.shop.

832
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:09,440
So whilst we're on the topic of home automation, sort of,

833
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,560
was the Home Assistant conference this weekend?

834
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,000
Yeah, it was a big deal.

835
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,160
They had some ridiculous amount of people

836
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,280
get tickets for this thing.

837
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,480
And they used a pretty decent platform

838
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:25,240
to get a kind of like conference experience,

839
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,480
where you had a reception area, and you

840
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:30,200
had different speaking rooms, and each room had chat areas.

841
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,600
It was very easy to navigate.

842
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:35,800
Probably the best UI I have seen yet.

843
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:36,840
I think it's called Hoppin.

844
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,680
Just H-O-P-I-N was the platform.

845
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,200
And one of the better ones.

846
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,800
How many of these virtual conferences

847
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,280
have you attended this year, Alex?

848
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:47,280
I've got fatigue, half a dozen or so.

849
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,760
So what happens is I put them on YouTube, a live stream

850
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,600
or whatever, and then there's a couple of speakers

851
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:55,400
that start buffering, or something goes wrong,

852
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,840
and then I lose interest, and I go and do something else.

853
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,600
Yeah, they're rough, right?

854
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,520
I have watched a lot.

855
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,880
And I know you weren't as big of a fan,

856
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:08,320
but this was, as far as these virtual conferences go,

857
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,520
I think one of the better ones, honestly,

858
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:14,440
from both the experience of participating and attending.

859
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:17,040
I even connected with a speaker who

860
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:20,400
had a talk on his off-grid bus.

861
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,480
So obviously, that was a talk I was interested in.

862
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:26,120
And he and I are going to communicate and collaborate

863
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,440
on what we're doing for our rigs.

864
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,760
And I'm going to maybe even invite him

865
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,120
on one of the shows, maybe this show, in the future.

866
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,160
And that was really great.

867
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,040
So I actually even had that conference-like experience

868
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,040
where that was one of the things I love about going,

869
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,920
is I would network and meet people,

870
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,640
and then convert them into guests,

871
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,800
or maybe even one day co-hosts, right?

872
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,160
Yeah, who would that be?

873
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,560
So this is the first one out of all the virtual conferences

874
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,640
I attended that actually facilitated that.

875
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:53,160
And they really tried to make it a little bit better.

876
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,520
The participants really had their stuff together.

877
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,280
I think everybody had done an audio and mic check.

878
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:01,480
So it was rough, because it's a virtual conference.

879
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,060
But as far as virtual conferences goes,

880
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:05,200
it was one of the better ones I attended.

881
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,860
I'll put a link to it in the show notes.

882
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,600
But there's some big news announced,

883
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,840
as far as Home Assistant goes.

884
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,840
They announced their first hardware device,

885
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,880
which we knew this was coming, but we just

886
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:16,440
didn't know when it would actually show up.

887
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,720
It's Home Assistant Blue.

888
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:19,880
You ordered one, didn't you?

889
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:20,360
I did.

890
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:23,920
I was, you know what?

891
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,520
I'm not even kidding.

892
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:29,480
I tell you what, I was looking at the Odroid N2 Plus,

893
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:32,840
thinking to myself, you know, if this laptop doesn't work out,

894
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,840
maybe this is the route I go.

895
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:38,000
Because it's got pretty good performance.

896
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,320
I know that the developers, the Home Assistant developers,

897
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,240
have talked about how they like it before.

898
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:45,600
It has eMMC instead of SD cards.

899
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:49,320
So what they've announced is $140 all-in-one device

900
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:54,660
with a blue logoed metal chassis in a case

901
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:58,200
with a essential plug-and-play kind of pitch for this device.

902
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,000
What's special about the Odroid?

903
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,280
Was it N2 Plus?

904
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,480
Yeah, the N2 Plus, it's a six-core CPU,

905
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,560
so you've got a lot of processing power there.

906
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:11,280
It has a decent amount of USB, while also

907
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,640
still having gigabit.

908
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:16,060
And I think that eMMC is just, it's faster,

909
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:19,160
it's more reliable, it lasts longer.

910
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:22,080
So I think when you look at it compared to the Raspberry Pi 4,

911
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,200
it's kind of a bit of a better candidate.

912
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:29,240
Although the Pi 4 with USB disk, it's a pretty good contender

913
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,760
too, because it's so well-supported.

914
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:33,560
It has such a network effect and ecosystem.

915
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,240
Interesting, I'll be really curious to take

916
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,200
your thoughts on that.

917
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,360
The chassis, like the case of it, looks pretty cool.

918
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,880
You can swap the lid around.

919
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,560
Yeah, and I want to support them.

920
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,040
I like what they're doing.

921
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,480
You know, this kind of stuff, it feeds directly back

922
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:50,000
into the project, kind of why I'm now just comfortably

923
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,600
playing for Nebuchadnezzar Cloud,

924
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:56,120
because it's paying for now eight full-time developers.

925
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,640
Well, eight full-time staff members,

926
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,100
some of which are developers, that

927
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:00,720
are working on Home Assistant.

928
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,320
And their incentive is to make Home Assistant better.

929
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:07,680
And it is a value for value that I can recognize

930
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:08,760
and I'm comfortable with.

931
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:11,120
They're not getting the value from my information.

932
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:14,160
They're not getting value from selling ad placements

933
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:18,160
or special gold standard integrations in Home Assistant.

934
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:21,680
They're getting value by making Home Assistant better

935
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,760
and getting more people to use it, who then subscribe

936
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:27,120
to Nebuchadnezzar Cloud, who then pay them,

937
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:29,080
and then they continue to develop.

938
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,320
And I like that.

939
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,960
You can't see me, but I'm nodding.

940
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,400
And I think it's a really great way

941
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,080
to kind of give back to the project in a way that

942
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:38,840
gets you something with the remote access

943
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:44,120
portion and the lady cylinder integrations that they have.

944
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:47,200
But the important thing is that it's a choice.

945
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:51,240
It's not when you buy a product that comes with a subscription,

946
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,680
you have to pay it in order to continue using the thing

947
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,080
that you've purchased.

948
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,880
With Home Assistant, I'm choosing

949
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,360
to support the project because I want to.

950
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:02,360
And I think that's a key difference.

951
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,080
Yes, well put.

952
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,120
Thank you.

953
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:06,800
OK, so they also announced a new versioning system

954
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,840
for Home Assistant Core.

955
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:11,920
That's the core application that Home Assistant

956
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,040
is built around with Supervisor.

957
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:16,000
It's the version you can install just via Docker.

958
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,360
Home Assistant Core is now using calendar versioning.

959
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:24,760
So they're basically at the 1.0, but instead of just going 1.0,

960
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:27,800
which they are doing 1.0 with the beta just to have fun,

961
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,840
the date will now consist of the year, month, and patch number

962
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:33,240
to indicate the bug fix level.

963
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:36,560
They're also, along with that, changing the release cadence

964
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:37,440
a little bit.

965
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:40,000
So Home Assistant Core will now be released every first

966
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,680
Wednesday of the month.

967
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,360
So it essentially goes from a three-week release cadence

968
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,160
to a four-week release cadence.

969
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,040
I do get a bit tired of the updates, though,

970
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:51,080
like every three or four weeks or whatever,

971
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:54,320
having to press that button and then clench a little bit

972
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,280
as it does the upgrade.

973
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,080
Do you know what I mean?

974
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:57,860
Yeah, and that's where the numbers kind of start

975
00:42:57,860 --> 00:43:00,640
to mean nothing, too, and maybe where the dates will make

976
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,860
a little more sense because you'll look at it and go,

977
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:04,600
I'm only a week behind, no big deal.

978
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,920
Or you'll go, oh, this install's a year behind.

979
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,400
It'll be a lot more clear now.

980
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,200
Yeah, I do hope that they find a way

981
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:13,160
to solve the stuff changing all the time.

982
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:17,040
Like, I was messing around earlier on the terminal

983
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:20,560
of the HA, I think I'm running Hass OS,

984
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:24,760
and they have this command line client of HA something.

985
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:26,800
And it said, HA is now deprecated.

986
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,080
Please use core.

987
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:30,720
I'm like, oh, something else has changed.

988
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:34,560
Yeah, I can imagine with,

989
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,080
because if you look at the market they're addressing

990
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:40,320
and how much work it is to really do all of this,

991
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:42,420
it's such a high velocity task.

992
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:44,000
It's gonna be a lot of change for a while,

993
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,720
and that's why I have been gravitating more

994
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:50,480
towards a Proxmox setup that is then running an OS

995
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,240
with this running inside a container.

996
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:55,280
Or maybe I run their custom OS inside a Proxmox

997
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,160
that I can snapshot there, and I can also snapshot

998
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,560
using Supervisor in Home Assistant.

999
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:01,880
Because of this very reason, Alex,

1000
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:06,480
because it is so core to the function of my home right now

1001
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:10,200
that I can't stand the idea of something going wrong

1002
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:11,280
because of one of these updates.

1003
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:14,680
So that's why I'm gravitating towards virtualization.

1004
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:16,960
They also announced automation blueprints.

1005
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,480
This is huge.

1006
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:21,360
So an automation blueprint is a pre-created automation

1007
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:23,560
with user-settable options.

1008
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:26,640
I have needed this since I've started using Home Assistant.

1009
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:29,680
You separate out the logic and the inputs of an automation.

1010
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:32,200
So the trigger and what happens can be separated out.

1011
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,680
So imagine a blueprint that controls a light

1012
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:37,240
based on motion that allows you to configure

1013
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:40,360
the motion sensor to trigger on and the light to control.

1014
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:42,120
It's now possible to create two automations

1015
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:45,120
that each have their own configuration for this blueprint

1016
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:46,920
and act completely independently,

1017
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:50,080
yet are based on the same automation configuration,

1018
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:52,980
and then you can share that blueprint with other people.

1019
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:54,860
So these blueprints are shareable.

1020
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:57,440
I love this because I sometimes have devices

1021
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:00,760
that come and go, and so I'd like to keep the trigger series

1022
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:03,040
but have what it triggers and what lights turn on and off

1023
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:05,840
or devices outside be able to change.

1024
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:06,800
So this is really cool.

1025
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,320
And blueprints make it a little bit easier

1026
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:11,280
to kind of just get started, have a base logic,

1027
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,760
and then share that with people.

1028
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:14,440
So if you had a really easy,

1029
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:17,280
like pretty basic system that you liked,

1030
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,640
and then you just save it off for yourself

1031
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:20,920
or send it to somebody.

1032
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:22,160
When they mention blueprints,

1033
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,320
well, I think of this Factorio, so.

1034
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:25,920
It does kind of make you think of that.

1035
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,440
There's actually a lot of other stuff in there.

1036
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:30,400
So just a couple other small ones, really quick.

1037
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,560
They now have better non-Google voices

1038
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:35,000
via Nebuchadnezzar Home Assistant Cloud,

1039
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,160
and they say, in their words, stunning quality.

1040
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,360
Haven't tried them myself.

1041
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:41,360
I'll be the judge of that, thank you, darling.

1042
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:42,240
Yeah, exactly right.

1043
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,320
Whether it's stunning or not.

1044
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:45,960
And then another thing that's landed,

1045
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,520
and amongst a bunch of other stuff,

1046
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,560
but another thing that caught my attention,

1047
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:51,160
Home Assistant will now have the ability

1048
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:53,000
to temporarily disable devices,

1049
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,240
which imagine you set up some lighting for the holiday,

1050
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:57,960
you take them down, you can now disable them

1051
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:00,360
and then re-enable them when it's time to put them back up.

1052
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:01,480
It's great for guys like me

1053
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:04,520
who have outdoor devices at my home base when I leave.

1054
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:07,360
Right now, they're just like broken and offline.

1055
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:09,080
And I really wish I could just go in

1056
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:10,440
and toggle them off while I'm gone

1057
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:11,600
and then toggle them back on.

1058
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,920
And wouldn't it be great if I could even automate that?

1059
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,400
So that's now in there as well.

1060
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:16,640
Very neat, yeah.

1061
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,400
I mean, overall, I thought it was a good conference.

1062
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,760
Lots of interesting news came out of it.

1063
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:24,280
And yeah, good job, guys, overall, well done.

1064
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:26,720
All right, at the risk of overrunning, Chris,

1065
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:30,320
you got a new camera in the mail this week.

1066
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:32,280
Big episode this week, Alex.

1067
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:33,200
Huge. Big episode.

1068
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,840
Huge. Yep.

1069
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:38,560
I got my Wyze 3Cam, just got it set up last night.

1070
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:40,400
So this is my first impressions.

1071
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:43,480
But this is a $19.99,

1072
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:48,120
I mean, $19.99 Wi-Fi camera when you buy it direct.

1073
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:50,240
So we're talking about a $20 camera here

1074
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:51,800
I'm about to tell you about.

1075
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:54,960
And no cloud subscription, no monthly subscription

1076
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:57,040
for any of the basic features.

1077
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:00,760
You do need the cloud connection to use their app

1078
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:04,240
and set some of the settings and whatnot,

1079
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:06,840
unless they release an RTSP firmware.

1080
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:10,080
There is not an RTSP firmware for it at this time yet.

1081
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:11,600
Does have an SD card slot.

1082
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:13,720
So you could pop a micro SD in there

1083
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:16,960
and do a little local video recording, no cloud required.

1084
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:19,560
And now the thing that's new about the Wyze 3

1085
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:22,440
is it's now an indoor or outdoor camera.

1086
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,880
Lots of people are using their Wyze cams as outdoor

1087
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,200
because you know, 20 bucks,

1088
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:27,920
you could buy a handful of these things,

1089
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,880
put them all over your yard on your Wi-Fi.

1090
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,480
I have like eight, nine of these things

1091
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:32,920
cause I have them for the studio.

1092
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:35,080
I have them all over the RV.

1093
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:38,960
And so I'm pretty familiar with the Wyze 2 camera.

1094
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:41,880
So this is, it's a nicer looking camera.

1095
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:45,520
It has that kind of cutesy Wyze look, but it's more refined.

1096
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:48,360
They put a little rubber booty over the power plug,

1097
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:51,120
which is now, it has a tail cable

1098
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:53,760
that has a female adapter that you plug

1099
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:56,760
the same USB micro adapter into.

1100
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:59,360
So that if you've run any power lines like I have,

1101
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:02,400
your power will still work for these cameras,

1102
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:05,560
but it is now, it plugs into this little tail,

1103
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:08,200
which means I'll have to redo some of my wire management.

1104
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:10,240
But that little tail has that rubber booty,

1105
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:11,560
which keeps it dry.

1106
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:14,120
So if you put it outside, you're good to go.

1107
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:16,600
It has the same versatile mounting options

1108
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:18,440
that the version two had, so you can screw it in.

1109
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:20,760
It comes with a really nice little tripod

1110
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:22,120
that it sits on that it can pivot on,

1111
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:24,360
but also you can magnetically mount it,

1112
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:26,040
which is what I've done.

1113
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:28,560
So this is extremely nice for me

1114
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:32,160
because I can just literally pop the version two off

1115
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,960
the old magnetic mount and pop version three on.

1116
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:38,760
And I've just significantly upgraded my cameras.

1117
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:40,880
It has a better two-way speaker.

1118
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:42,680
So you can actually do two-way conversations

1119
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:44,320
with people a little more clear now,

1120
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:47,680
but the significant big upgrade for the version three

1121
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:50,440
has gotta be the much wider field of view.

1122
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:53,480
So I could actually cover more area with less cameras now.

1123
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:56,080
It has 130 degree field of view.

1124
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:59,240
And the night performance, which I have not tested yet,

1125
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:02,160
I can update you later if people are interested,

1126
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:04,160
but it's reported to be amazing.

1127
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:06,360
On their website, they say it's capable of seeing

1128
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:09,920
in color at night with very limited lighting.

1129
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:12,080
You can even use it to watch the stars

1130
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:13,960
or take a time-lapse of the stars.

1131
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:15,560
And it does have a time-lapse feature.

1132
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:18,520
They refer to it as an all new starlight sensor.

1133
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:20,320
And I must say the pictures on the website

1134
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:21,520
do look very impressive.

1135
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:23,320
So I'll be interested to hear your thoughts.

1136
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:25,160
Yes, I will be testing this soon.

1137
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:27,400
Of course, it's nothing but gray clouds.

1138
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:29,920
You do live in Seattle, bro.

1139
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,040
Yeah, yeah.

1140
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:32,560
So it does enroll you in a two-week trial

1141
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:33,720
when you first set up the camera.

1142
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:34,640
So just be aware of that.

1143
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:35,760
It's easy to go through.

1144
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:38,200
The app for me, the Wwise app has been fine,

1145
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:40,080
but this, I had all kinds of issues.

1146
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:43,400
I had weird EULA overlay on top of the UI.

1147
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,520
And when I wanted to change Wi-Fi networks,

1148
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:46,640
it was super clunky.

1149
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:48,600
And it made me switch the Wi-Fi network

1150
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:51,680
that my phone was on before I could change the Wi-Fi network

1151
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:53,400
that the camera would go on because I wanted

1152
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:54,400
to just transfer the setting.

1153
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,080
The whole thing was that part of it

1154
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:57,680
I was not very impressed with.

1155
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:59,600
And if I have to do this a dozen times over,

1156
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:00,960
it's going to be annoying.

1157
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:03,480
But they do say on their website that they're

1158
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:07,400
planning to release an RTSP firmware for this, which

1159
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:11,120
I will put on there immediately because then it requires

1160
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:12,840
no cloud connectivity.

1161
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:16,480
So this is a $20 camera that you can put an RTSP firmware

1162
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,240
on there, and then you can plug it

1163
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:21,080
into something like Shinobi or one of the other applications

1164
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:21,880
that Alex likes.

1165
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:22,640
What was it called?

1166
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:23,120
Blue what?

1167
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:24,360
Sentinel?

1168
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:25,120
Blue Dog?

1169
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:25,760
Blue Iris.

1170
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:26,520
Blue Iris.

1171
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:27,040
OK.

1172
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:28,840
Which has been super solid, by the way.

1173
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:29,520
Yeah.

1174
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:30,760
Sounds like it.

1175
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:34,400
So I'd say for $20, I recommend it with caveats

1176
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:37,000
if you're OK with limited cloud requirements that have

1177
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,960
some really nice options.

1178
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,800
Like their advanced detection services

1179
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,840
that it enrolls you in, it's really good.

1180
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:46,960
And they're adding things like vehicle detection,

1181
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:50,200
package delivery detection, all that,

1182
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:51,960
along with better person detection.

1183
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:54,280
So $20 with optional cloud services,

1184
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:57,240
with a local SD recording, and the company

1185
00:50:57,240 --> 00:51:00,600
is committed to an RTSP firmware that you will then

1186
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:02,360
have to use microSD to reflash it.

1187
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:04,480
But once you've done that, it's all yours, my friends.

1188
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:11,440
And I've run the V2s in the studio and LadyJuice 24-7.

1189
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:12,800
And they've been really solid.

1190
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:15,280
They're not always the best little RTSP streamers.

1191
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,240
And sometimes I have to reboot them.

1192
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:18,720
But the V3 is a clear upgrade.

1193
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:20,840
And one of the other areas that I

1194
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:24,520
think could be a nice improvement is it has more RAM

1195
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:27,760
and it has a faster CPU on its little SOC.

1196
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:30,440
So it could mean it also is a little better at RTSP

1197
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:33,000
streaming as well, which will be something I'll

1198
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,840
test when they release.

1199
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:38,280
When they release that, this is an easy recommended $20.

1200
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:40,080
Well, it's just constantly astonished me

1201
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:41,400
with their price points.

1202
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:44,240
I mean, they've just announced a smartwatch

1203
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:47,160
with over a week's battery life for $20 as well.

1204
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:50,320
So obviously, I've ordered one of those.

1205
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:52,080
Oh, I love to hear how that goes too.

1206
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:55,760
And then maybe if you could plug the data in to Home Assistant.

1207
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:59,480
The Home Assistant iOS developer really knows his stuff.

1208
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:01,520
I have to say, it's remarkable.

1209
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,160
Home Assistant, when you look in the log,

1210
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:06,040
it knows when I'm likely commuting and driving.

1211
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:07,960
So I can actually build automations

1212
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:10,260
around when I'm commuting.

1213
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:14,640
It's incredible what they can get from the iOS device

1214
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:18,440
with your permission, of course, and no massive hit

1215
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:19,840
to battery life.

1216
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:20,880
It's really impressive.

1217
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:24,120
And one of the other features that he said he's adding

1218
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:27,280
is local notifications are coming to the iOS devices

1219
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,160
soon too with no internet connection required.

1220
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:30,400
So that's really great.

1221
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,560
Anyways, so just to wrap it up, I'm very happy.

1222
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:35,060
And when they start shipping, because I was an early backer,

1223
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:36,520
so I got mine a little early.

1224
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:39,480
When they start shipping, I think I may swap out

1225
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:40,300
a couple of mine.

1226
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:41,600
I don't know if I need to do all of them,

1227
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:43,800
but I think I might pop out a couple of my twos

1228
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:46,960
and put a three or two in.

1229
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:48,440
Wise continually amaze me.

1230
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:50,360
All right, we really should get out of here.

1231
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:53,240
But thank you to our self-hosted site reliability engineers.
