1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
Well, I know this isn't the Apple Today podcast,

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,160
but we've got to acknowledge that there

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,040
was an event this week which has put a big hole in my wallet.

4
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:10,120
Oh, did it?

5
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,560
Yeah, this is one of those tech events

6
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,160
that sucked all the air out of the tech room

7
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,840
for the entire week that we're recording.

8
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,120
There's just no way around it.

9
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,000
So you get a big boy.

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,680
You get one of them Macs Macs.

11
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,360
I actually felt really sorry for Google,

12
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:25,720
just to digress for a second, because they held their Pixel

13
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,840
event the day after Apple announced all these MacBooks.

14
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:29,340
Yeah.

15
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,080
And you could just tell all the tech press were like, yeah,

16
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,360
we've already heard all about this Pixel thing.

17
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,480
MacBook, MacBook, MacBook.

18
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,880
Let's just cover the MacBook.

19
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,120
I know, and Google announced their Tensor SOC,

20
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,040
and it really didn't get much interest in it.

21
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:41,760
Not at all.

22
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,400
You know, like I told you after the event,

23
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,240
one of my first thoughts was like, man, you know, Alex,

24
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,240
what I'm kind of excited about is the idea of one

25
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,240
of these is a home server.

26
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,860
I've been thinking of this more and more.

27
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,520
You know, when a Mac mini is just sitting there

28
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,600
not doing much, the processor's taking hardly any power.

29
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,200
12 watts is like an average load.

30
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,040
That's incredible.

31
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,680
And you could really see, if they're

32
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:06,320
building an H.264 accelerated encoding and decoding

33
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,240
in these chips, and these things are low power,

34
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,480
and they have Thunderbolt expansion,

35
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,800
and who knows if they'll make desktop models,

36
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,280
I could see these being a pretty legitimate home server,

37
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,560
replacing Pis.

38
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,840
Yeah, I was thinking that the biggest problem with it

39
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,000
would be connecting disks up to the damn thing.

40
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,840
But if you have Thunderbolt, I suppose

41
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,840
you could be baller and spend thousands of dollars

42
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,840
on a Thunderbolt shelf and connect disks that way,

43
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,400
if you like.

44
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,400
You know, I'd much prefer real expansion, right?

45
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,160
But for my situation, I'm doing USB storage.

46
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:40,840
I never thought I would do USB storage in a million years.

47
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,700
But here I am with the Raspberry Pi 4,

48
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,640
and I have pooled USB storage.

49
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,160
So external Thunderbolt would actually

50
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,920
be an upgrade for me.

51
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,520
I see you like to live dangerously.

52
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,360
I do.

53
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,960
You know, that's why I like to stay trained, just in case

54
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,620
I ever need a plan B. And you can, too,

55
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,320

61
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,680
Couple of months ago, I sold my 16-inch MacBook Pro.

62
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,680
I had an i9 model with a 5600M Radeon GPU in it.

63
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:24,580
It was, you know, like a $4,000, $4,500 laptop.

64
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:27,160
Kind of crazy, actually, when you think about it.

65
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,980
And I sold it to somebody two months ago,

66
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,480
because we've known this event's been coming for a while.

67
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,200
And I thought, right, can I live with just an M1 MacBook Air

68
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,400
as my primary system for two or three months

69
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,900
until these new MacBooks come out?

70
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,240
And you also have a desktop system as well.

71
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,980
So it's not like your only computer.

72
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:48,240
True, but I do 99% of my work now

73
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,240
on this MacBook Air, the fanless MacBook Air.

74
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:50,740
Do you?

75
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:51,240
Do you?

76
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,640
It is a phenomenal system, truly.

77
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,520
And I'm very excited.

78
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:00,600
I've ordered one of the M1 Mac's 14-inch MacBook Pros.

79
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,520
Oh, yeah, the 14-inch seems like a pretty sweet rig,

80
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,200
a lot of horsepower for a pretty small footprint.

81
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,960
64 gigs of RAM in that bad boy.

82
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:11,000
I have no idea why I need 64 gigs of RAM.

83
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,120
But hey, you know, in for a penny, in for a pound.

84
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,560
That's a tough one, huh?

85
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,720
Because it's like you can't change it after the fact.

86
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,000
So if you think maybe you're going to use a lot of RAM,

87
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,680
you might as well go all the way in.

88
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,280
And I don't really know how this works,

89
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,820
but I think that also means then you've

90
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,880
got 64 gigs of video RAM addressable or something

91
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,120
like that, because I know it's a unified memory space.

92
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,800
Something like that, yeah.

93
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:39,640
Yeah, 32-core GPU and the M1 Mac's 10-core, whatever it is.

94
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,600
I'm not entirely sure.

95
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,400
Honestly, I watched the event, and I

96
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,240
pressed Go on my purchase after the store went live

97
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,920
within about three or four minutes, honestly.

98
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:52,020
I really didn't spend very long, because it's 2021,

99
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,480
and everything is in short supply.

100
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,400
And I knew if I waited even an hour,

101
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,200
it was going to take weeks extra.

102
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,280
Yep, yep, yep, yep.

103
00:03:59,280 --> 00:03:59,800
I know it.

104
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,960
And I'll tell you, I would have been there with that instant

105
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,440
buy if they had announced everything that's

106
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,960
in that 14-inch Macbook in a mini, a little headless Mac

107
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,200
mini, that would have been the way for me.

108
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,960
Like I said, that would just be such an incredible server.

109
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,920
But also, with that kind of horsepower,

110
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,720
you could also have it be your desktop.

111
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,240
That's, for me, a consolidation.

112
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,440
That'd be nice.

113
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,360
The only thing missing from this new set of laptops for me

114
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,600
was a single USB-A port.

115
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,160
I think it was possibly asking a bit too much for them

116
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,200
to put that one back in.

117
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:36,760
But I was hoping, because being back in England last month,

118
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:40,600
I was doing a lot of stuff with old tech.

119
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,960
I was taking files off my mom's old Windows XP laptops.

120
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,840
I needed USB-A, so I had to have a dongle for that.

121
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,000
So I'm still going to have to keep that one around.

122
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,920
But thank the Lord, there's an SD card slot.

123
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,840
Yes, there is.

124
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,520
Yes, there is.

125
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,320
Hallelujah.

126
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:55,920
Yes.

127
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,640
And you know, people say, why do you need SD?

128
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,560
It's like, come on, man.

129
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,160
Even if you don't have a camera that uses it,

130
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,160
you could use it for external storage, portable storage.

131
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,080
It's great for backup.

132
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,480
Yeah, yeah.

133
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,680
Yeah, I think they set the bar.

134
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,120
I really think they set the bar with this one.

135
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,560
And I'm really kind of looking forward

136
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:16,000
to see where the Asahi Linux team gets with support for Linux,

137
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,380
because I could see running these things with macOS

138
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,460
and then trying to do Docker on top of all of that.

139
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:24,240
But it seems like a lot of pain in the knee

140
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,360
when you could just run Linux directly on there.

141
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,080
And I think they're making good progress.

142
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,400
We'll see where that goes.

143
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,640
I have an M1 Mac Mini now.

144
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,160
I haven't gotten through setting it up yet.

145
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,840
But my intention is to try Asahi on it and see how it goes.

146
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:42,920
And of course, I ordered the Mac Mini.

147
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,280
I thought, all right, fine.

148
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,840
I know Asahi Linux will support this,

149
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,680
because that's what the developers are using.

150
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,800
Even though I know Apple's about, even though I knew,

151
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,040
I knew Apple was about to announce new machines.

152
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,080
I ordered the Mini M1.

153
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,080
Even risking there might have been an updated Mini,

154
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,240
because I knew that would have the best compatibility.

155
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,160
But I have to say, the next day, Apple announced the event.

156
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:04,920
And it still hurt.

157
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,640
It still felt like I should have waited.

158
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,800
But it's good.

159
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,480
It's here now.

160
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,320
I've already got it.

161
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,600
But they didn't announce anything in the Mac Mini

162
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,200
form factor.

163
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,320
So in a way, you were vindicated.

164
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:15,840
That's true.

165
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,000
I suppose so.

166
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,200
I suppose so.

167
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,680
I've been trying to, I've just been

168
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,060
trying to think of my setup and how I'm going to redo it.

169
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:25,560
Because now that I am doing so much more on my Raspberry Pi

170
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,340
in Home Assistant, I'm running MQTT now.

171
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,520
And I've got a lot more automations going.

172
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,920
And I'm now doing power statistical tracking

173
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,360
for a lot of different devices.

174
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,320
And it has noticeably slowed down.

175
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,920
The speed difference now between my Home Assistant Blue,

176
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,400
which is doing a lot less, and the Raspberry Pi

177
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:49,440
4 in the RV is extremely noticeable.

178
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,120
It's night and day.

179
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,160
We're talking like 10 minutes, 15 minutes

180
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,360
to do a snapshot on the Raspberry Pi,

181
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:01,040
and two minutes to do a snapshot on the Home Assistant Blue.

182
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,040
So you were thinking about doing some stuff

183
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,080
with your router at the studio.

184
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,480
Have you gotten any further with that yet?

185
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,280
Not necessarily.

186
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,840
We hit a wall, a hardware wall.

187
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,760
But one thing we're thinking about trying in the meantime

188
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,680
until we get the right hardware, because we

189
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,440
found this nice little x86 box that we

190
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,920
thought would work really well.

191
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,440
But we just can't, we cannot get it.

192
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,920
Nobody has it available right now.

193
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,280
So we are thinking about just in the interim trying a Raspberry

194
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,160
Pi just as a temporary solution.

195
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,040
I saw an interesting post on this,

196
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:35,080
which I'll try and find and put in the show notes,

197
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:39,040
where people were using VLANs to actually use a Raspberry

198
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:43,240
Pi 4 and its single ethernet port as both a WAN

199
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,200
and a LAN port.

200
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,080
So I thought that might be an interesting experiment for you

201
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,840
to try.

202
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:52,000
My thought was just put the WAN on a USB ethernet,

203
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,520
because USB 3.0 is pretty good, and it's just Comcast.

204
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,760
So I could put that on a USB ethernet,

205
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,720
and then the LAN side would be connected

206
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,920
to the actual ethernet port.

207
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,600
Well, if you try out OpenSense, which

208
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,560
is my current favorite firewall of choice

209
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:10,040
for the self-builders, I've come across a really cool repo.

210
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,920
I think I've mentioned it briefly on the show,

211
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,920
but I'm going to go into a bit more detail today.

212
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:17,120
This is from a guy on Twitter who goes by the handle

213
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,120
MIMU underscore MUC.

214
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,960
That rolls off the tongue, doesn't it?

215
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,760
There's a link to his Twitter in the show notes.

216
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:28,200
But essentially what this does, this repo,

217
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:32,600
is it provides a whole bunch of plugins for OpenSense that

218
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,160
aren't officially supported.

219
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:39,080
So there's stuff in there like traffic, speed test, caddy,

220
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,360
unify controller.

221
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,400
But for me, the killer app is that I can now

222
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:47,040
run AdGuard Home directly on my OpenSense instance as well.

223
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,680
So I've completely disabled the unbound DNS

224
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,080
that's built into OpenSense and just replaced it completely

225
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,880
with AdGuard Home.

226
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,760
And for me, that's been really solid.

227
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,180
And when I'm coming in over WireGuard,

228
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:03,520
I can now get AdGuard Home straight away on the same box

229
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,120
as WireGuard.

230
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,160
It's just really nice.

231
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,520
Yeah, I have to say that that is a very compelling setup.

232
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,640
And this kind of reminds me a little bit

233
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,120
of Hacks for Home Assistant, where

234
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,840
it's a community-created set of repositories

235
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,800
that you can add on.

236
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,400
It's a very similar deal, yeah.

237
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,600
And it's nice to see this.

238
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,960
The essentials are in there.

239
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,560
I also noticed that, of course, you've

240
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,960
got speed testers in there, Makesense, Grafana, Influx.

241
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:32,240
That's all really nice to have as an easy-to-install add-on.

242
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,160
That's great.

243
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:38,600
If you wanted to, you could even run Mosquito MQTT.

244
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,120
It's split into two halves, right?

245
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,580
There's a bunch of plug-ins, which

246
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,320
have a bit more about them.

247
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,180
So they require graphical configuration

248
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,320
and that kind of thing.

249
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,400
There's also a list of packages, which if you install those,

250
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,160
you'll need to drop to the terminal to configure those.

251
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,560
And there's a few that stand out for me in here.

252
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,280
Cloudflare D, which is pretty useful.

253
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:01,080
Influx is in there, Mosquito, Smokeping.

254
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,680
You can actually run that directly on your firewall.

255
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,800
Tailscale, which you know I love these days.

256
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,400
So yeah, I've found this repository

257
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,420
to be an incredibly valuable asset to make OpenSense.

258
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,120
It just takes it to that next level for me.

259
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,160
And really makes it that all-in-one box.

260
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:16,720
Absolutely.

261
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,080
I mean, you could argue it's now a single point of failure

262
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,160
for a bit more stuff.

263
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,920
But it was doing DNS and Intel anyway.

264
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,640
So if that went out when I was in England,

265
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,320
I was out of luck anyway.

266
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,920
So am I bothered?

267
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,480
You're not a 1,000-person enterprise.

268
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,440
Yes, there is more risk to having it on one box.

269
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,880
But when you're in a home, there's

270
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:39,680
also advantages to simplifying and reducing power usage.

271
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,200
Absolutely.

272
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:44,040
Now, talking of monitoring and keeping things available

273
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,200
and stuff like that, we've set up a new status

274
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,760
page for the network using one of my new favorite tools

275
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,360
in the world called Uptime Kuma.

276
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,940
And isn't this nice and clean?

277
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,680
And we're putting it all out there.

278
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,900
If there's an outage, you're going to know about it.

279
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,960
That is Jupiterbroadcasting.com.

280
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,960
I mean, I used to use Statping for a little while.

281
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,040
But then there was a new version came along,

282
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,320
and it broke a bunch of stuff.

283
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,520
And then the developer kind of got bored and just quit,

284
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,280
I think, is what happened.

285
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,360
I mean, if you go to the Statping repository now,

286
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,880
the last update was about 10 months ago.

287
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:20,440
I did see on Reddit this week that there's a statping-ng fork

288
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,420
appeared, a statping.

289
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,640
So we'll have to keep our eye on that one.

290
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:27,760
But Uptime Kuma is designed after Uptime Robot,

291
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,400
if you're familiar with that one.

292
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,640
There's a live demo on their GitHub page, which

293
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,440
is linked in the show notes.

294
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,120
And this thing is just simple.

295
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,760
It monitors an endpoint.

296
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,680
So it could be an API, or in our case,

297
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,040
it could be an RSS feed for all the shows

298
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,080
that we have as a network.

299
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,000
And then I've got a group with me, Chris, and Wes in it

300
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,760
that we all get a notification if these pings fail

301
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,760
for more than three minutes.

302
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:58,280
So it supports Telegram, Discord, Go to Fight.

303
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:01,480
There's a bunch of stuff it supports out of the box.

304
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,840
And I've just run it in a container

305
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,600
on a separate Linode instance.

306
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,920
And it just works great.

307
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:13,120
Yeah, and it's given us a nice, just easy, no-brainer

308
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,280
overview of what's going on.

309
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,360
In fact, just recently, we had a listener say, hey,

310
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,720
is such and such RSS feed down, or was there no show today?

311
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,040
Let me go check.

312
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,760
Hold the status feed.

313
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,680
It's up.

314
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,680
Linode.com slash SSH.

315
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,160
Go there to receive $100 in 60-day credit,

316
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,720
and you support the show.

317
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,760
Linode can be your lab in the cloud.

318
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,840
That's how I use them.

319
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,840
I'm always trying things out, because their infrastructure

320
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,600
is super fast.

321
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,360
They're constantly investing in that.

322
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,880
They are their own ISP, so all of their connections

323
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,000
between data centers and out to the internet are super fast.

324
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
The hypervisors have 40 gigabit connections coming in.

325
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,520
And Linode just recently revamped their block storage

326
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:56,600
with MVME super fast PCIe disks, and they cost 30% to 50%

327
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,320
less than the major cloud providers out there.

328
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,360
So it's just a great way to experiment and try something

329
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,480
out, and then grow it and scale it up,

330
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,320
because they make it really straightforward to expand

331
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,240
the RAM, the storage.

332
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,840
And you can utilize things like object storage.

333
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,600
They have S3-compatible object storage

334
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,080
that you can use to increase storage as much as you like.

335
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,800
I mean, that kind of stuff makes it super flexible,

336
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,560
but it's just a great way to learn, too.

337
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,640
And if you've never set anything up before, don't worry.

338
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:24,480
Not only do they have great guides, super good tutorials,

339
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,360
but they also just have one-click deployment.

340
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,920
So you could do a one-click deployment of Nextcloud

341
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,560
and see if you like it, or anything really,

342
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,160
because you can start with a pretty base image of just

343
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,160
the OS you like, some container runtime stuff,

344
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:40,600
and then you add the container on top of that and try it out.

345
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,720
And I know for some of us, you're

346
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,560
willing to invest the time to learn something,

347
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,360
but you want to see if it's worth it first.

348
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,120
And Linode is great for that kind of thing.

349
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,360
So I'll do a one-click.

350
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,560
I'll figure out how it's set up and how it's running.

351
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,440
If I like the application, if it's worth all the effort,

352
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,520
and then I'll often rebuild it either locally or on Linode

353
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:02,280
with a DIY setup or in my existing application server.

354
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,960
One of the things that we do here

355
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,120
is we run all of our Jupyter broadcasting services

356
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,400
up on Linode for anything that's public facing.

357
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,600
And there's a lot of catch-all services

358
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,760
that just do things like supply us a pasteboard for us

359
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,160
to put our emails from our listeners,

360
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:22,680
or check the uptime of a server, or host our HedgeDock Markdown

361
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,440
collaborative editing instance.

362
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,880
And there's applications.

363
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,880
And you can put all of that just on one Linode

364
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,520
because they're so crazy powerful and fast.

365
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,960
If it runs on Linux, it's going to run on Linode.

366
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:36,240
They started in 2003 as one of the first in this business,

367
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,320
and they have refined and honed it ever since.

368
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,520
And nobody does it like them, and they back it up

369
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,520
with the best customer service in the business.

370
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,960
I've been a customer for more than two years now,

371
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,160
and I've been happy every single day.

372
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,840
They haven't let me down yet.

373
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:52,160
Go try them out, support the show, and get yourself $100.

374
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:56,680
Linode.com slash SSH.

375
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,360
Well, it's time to welcome back to the show

376
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:03,120
our resident doorbell expert, Morgan the Doorbell Guy.

377
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:03,960
Welcome back, Morgan.

378
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,040
How are you doing?

379
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:05,360
Thank you.

380
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,360
I'm not sure how I feel about the Doorbell Guy,

381
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,960
but it's a pleasure joining back.

382
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,120
Hey, we had a jingle with that phrase in it.

383
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,200
I mean, that name's going to stick now.

384
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,320
Yeah, I think that's true.

385
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,040
That is true.

386
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,380
I think it's time to actually join Twitter as the Doorbell

387
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:18,880
Guy.

388
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,240
Yeah, although today we're not just talking doorbells.

389
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,520
We aren't, no.

390
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:28,280
We thought we'd finally bring up Frigate, which

391
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:32,760
is a new NVR, network video recorder piece of software.

392
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,640
It's free and open source.

393
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,880
And Morgan, you've been playing with it.

394
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,960
Yeah, so I went ahead and I got it set up.

395
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,520
Based on the previous episode where

396
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,960
you mentioned WiseBridge, I was able to get WiseBridge set up

397
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,720
really quickly.

398
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,920
It found my doorbell.

399
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,960
It found all my V3s.

400
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:55,900
And I was able to pipe using RTSP from WiseBridge

401
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,540
over into Frigate.

402
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,960
It was a little difficult to get set up,

403
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,400
mainly because I couldn't read the docs very well.

404
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,840
But once I got it up and running, it was pretty good.

405
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,960
One thing I would recommend, though,

406
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,920
and I know this is pretty crazy, go with the beta.

407
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:15,280
The beta seems to be where the software writer is going.

408
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,800
He did a lot of changes.

409
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:21,840
24-7 recording, for example, is now standard in the 9 beta.

410
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:26,160
But the biggest improvement that I saw over 0.8

411
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,760
was GPU acceleration worked, which was huge.

412
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,640
Obviously, it recommends you have a Coral device.

413
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,240
You definitely want a GPU accelerator

414
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,960
if you're running a Wyze doorbell,

415
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:39,240
because the Wyze doorbell comes in at 90 degrees.

416
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,720
So you either rotate it at the Wyze bridge,

417
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,800
which I don't recommend, doesn't support GPU acceleration,

418
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,560
or you do it in Frigate.

419
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,120
So that little adjustment of just 90 degrees

420
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,120
is going to eat up your CPU.

421
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,760
Yeah, that's just what I was going to say, actually.

422
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,720
You were using the iGPU built into your CPU

423
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,840
with QuickSync to do all of that transcoding, right?

424
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,680
That's correct.

425
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,320
Yeah, so as I mentioned when I was on the show

426
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,840
not too long ago, I purchased the UNAZ from you

427
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:10,840
running an i5-8500T, switching over to the GPU QuickSync.

428
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:14,600
It was, I think my CPUs are at 41, 42C steady,

429
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,480
and that's monitoring three cameras.

430
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,640
So for those that aren't familiar,

431
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,560
Frigate is a real-time object detection piece of software.

432
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,800
It uses the Google TensorFlow library

433
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,400
to perform real-time object detection.

434
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,600
So it can do stuff like pick out cars, people,

435
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,520
bears, dogs, cats.

436
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,680
And actually, Morgan, you told me the other day

437
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,600
that you think it saved your cat's life.

438
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,640
Yeah, so I have kids.

439
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,640
I mentioned before on the show that I have kids.

440
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,600
And the downside of kids is that they're often, you know,

441
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,400
they can be careless without realizing it.

442
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,920
We came back from dinner one night,

443
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,080
one of the rare outings, you know.

444
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,400
We come back in, the kids are messing around outside,

445
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,440
they get yelled at to come inside,

446
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,120
and somebody doesn't close the front door properly.

447
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,440
We hear the door open about an hour later from the alarm,

448
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,840
somebody goes and shuts it, no big deal.

449
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,280
Getting ready to go to bed.

450
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:07,040
So I quickly grabbed my phone, I looked at Telegram,

451
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,040
and I noticed that it said,

452
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,400
a cat was detected at the doorbell.

453
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,160
We have a couple stray cats in the neighborhood,

454
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,360
didn't think anything of it,

455
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,360
but for some reason, I decided to look at the video.

456
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,320
And in the video, I see these two yellow eyes

457
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,440
peering out of the bushes,

458
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,320
and out comes my 10-month-old cat.

459
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,920
Babe, wake up, the cat's outside.

460
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,480
We go outside, we spent 30 minutes looking for the cat.

461
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,200
We find the cat across the street under the neighbor's car.

462
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,520
You know, it was, it's pretty crazy to think

463
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:36,200
that home automation and AI and ML

464
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,840
potentially saved my cat's life.

465
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,480
Right, you had to get it, that was part of it, too,

466
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,680
is you have to get it in front of your face.

467
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,880
Just really kind of a funny, ironic thing.

468
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:47,960
I also had a situation with a cat just the other day.

469
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,920
I decided to put a little WiFi camera under the RV

470
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,320
just to watch what was going on

471
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,400
while we were parked out in the woods.

472
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,160
And the morning we were leaving,

473
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,520
I checked, I checked my camera events

474
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,520
and found out that a cat was living under the RV.

475
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,680
And I don't know what would have happened

476
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,960
if we would have fired up and started rolling

477
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,080
because we were packing up and getting ready to go.

478
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,440
And the cameras, and the alert

479
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,760
that there was motion down there,

480
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,520
in my case, it wasn't as nice and fancy as yours,

481
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,080
but it alerted me, and I thought,

482
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,240
you know what, I better check this.

483
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,480
I don't always check these

484
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,560
because anything can set it off, really.

485
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,120
But that one time, I thought, I'm going to check that.

486
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,000
And man, was I surprised when I pulled that up

487
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,400
and saw a cat.

488
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,160
Stowaway alert. You were, too.

489
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,120
Yeah.

490
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,840
So to talk more about Frigate,

491
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,360
one of the things that I would recommend,

492
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,760
obviously I mentioned this,

493
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,520
and the project mentions it as well,

494
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,600
you definitely want to get a Coral device.

495
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,120
They do not recommend using CPU for the detection.

496
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,960
And as I found when I first set it up,

497
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,240
it is very CPU intensive.

498
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,760
Even with GPU acceleration,

499
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,560
you think you still need a Coral?

500
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,680
Yes, you definitely want to get a Coral.

501
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,200
The downside is finding them.

502
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,320
I had to purchase mine off eBay for twice the MSRP.

503
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:01,480
That is the reality right now of the supply chain shortages.

504
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,720
But it's fantastic.

505
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,920
You plug it in through USB,

506
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,480
you pass it in through your Docker file,

507
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,640
it detects it right away and you're good to go.

508
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,480
Unless you're Alex

509
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,920
and it makes your instance crash every time.

510
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,880
Yeah.

511
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,880
I've just been trying to run it on a Raspberry Pi 4

512
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,760
I've got just for testing for this episode.

513
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,240
And I've been having kernel panics.

514
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,480
So goodness knows what's happening over here,

515
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,000
but it's not working terribly well for me.

516
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,120
But I know that you've had some success.

517
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,560
So why don't you tell us more about it?

518
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:32,840
So my doorbell sits on that infamous 45 degree angle.

519
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,160
You know, I went out and bought the door,

520
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,160
the Wyze doorbell specifically

521
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:39,080
because of the Wyze bridge that came out

522
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,680
and I'm on a corner.

523
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:43,840
So I'm able to see two of my neighbor's houses

524
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,600
because of the way the house curves.

525
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,840
And I get alerts from Telegram that says a human,

526
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:52,240
you know, a person has been detected on the doorbell.

527
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,280
So I of course watched the video

528
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,800
and I kid you not all the way across the street,

529
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:00,160
this itty little, bitty little speck of a human being

530
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,280
walking their dog.

531
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,040
So it detects the dog and the person.

532
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,760
You know, you do have some false negatives.

533
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,480
Like sometimes it tells me my cat is a dog,

534
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,320
but in the end of the day,

535
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:12,280
the detection quality of Frigate is really good.

536
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,680
I have it set up to only retain, you know,

537
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,360
to retain one day worth of video

538
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,600
since I send all the clips to Telegram.

539
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,000
I abuse the free Telegram, you know, storage.

540
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,320
So it, I think right now with the three cameras,

541
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,840
they're all running HD, you know, streamed from Wyzebridge.

542
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,560
I'm seven or eight gigs a day and it auto refreshes.

543
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,280
It really just needs an RTSP feed.

544
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:39,120
You use Wyzebridge, but any camera that had RTMP would work?

545
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:39,960
Correct.

546
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:44,560
So I actually had a brand new Wyze V3 sitting in the box.

547
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:48,760
I pulled it out, set it up, flashed the new RTSP firmware

548
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,600
and it did work.

549
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:54,120
I have not migrated any of the other cameras.

550
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,160
This one is still sitting on my desk.

551
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:01,160
So the idea is I will move all of the V3s over to the RTSP.

552
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:06,200
The downside is I don't see the doorbell camera

553
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,640
getting RTSP.

554
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,560
Yeah, I don't think so.

555
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,040
I also think there may be more of an encoding delay.

556
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,480
I'm not sure, but I've been testing this.

557
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:16,560
It is possible Wyzebridge may actually be faster

558
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,560
than running the RTSP firmware directly on the Wyze camera

559
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:22,560
because right now with, and I'm very grateful

560
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,840
Wyze released the RTSP firmware for the V3.

561
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,040
Thank you, Wyze.

562
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,040
But I'm getting about a two and a half, three second

563
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:31,120
encoding delay when I pull it directly off the camera.

564
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,360
Whereas with Wyzebridge, it's nearly immediate.

565
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,280
Correct.

566
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,000
That is one of the best features, right?

567
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,840
It detects the cameras.

568
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,240
You don't have to modify anything.

569
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,080
But then again, as we all know, that is inherit fear.

570
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,080
How long before they turn it off?

571
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,000
There are only certain firmwares that are supported.

572
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,200
The V2s were working and a new firmware came out

573
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,720
and then they stopped working.

574
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,800
And in all honesty, we are at the mercy of Wyze.

575
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:02,400
Whereas if you flash the RTSP, it does work.

576
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,480
They do have a land mode only on the Wyzebridge,

577
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,680
which is great.

578
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,200
But again, you still have to authenticate.

579
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,880
And I'm pretty sure it's not going

580
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:15,240
to take long before they say this is eating into our money.

581
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,400
One of the big issues I saw personally,

582
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,040
especially with the Wyze app, just to talk about how they

583
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,080
steal features away from you, you

584
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,400
used to have the ability to save video clips to your phone.

585
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,480
I was trying to save a video clip from the Wyze app

586
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,280
to send to the wife last night.

587
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,720
And I realized that I don't have that option anymore.

588
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,080
Do you have an SD card in the camera?

589
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,960
No, so I don't run the SD cards.

590
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,000
I actually took all the SD cards out

591
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,240
since I'm now using Frigate.

592
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,000
Right.

593
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:43,880
There is that feature.

594
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,400
You can still do the playback thing

595
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,680
if you have an SD card and that kind of stuff.

596
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,600
The question is, how many customers are actually

597
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,040
really running the SD card?

598
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,760
Yeah, and it's more expense, too.

599
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,960
One of the nice advantages is they're pretty low cost

600
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,320
cameras, but you add an SD card and you almost

601
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,560
double the price.

602
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,680
You mentioned briefly that you're not using the Home

603
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:03,880
Assistant integration, but I got to be honest with you, Morgan.

604
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,920
That seems like that's why I would want to use Frigate,

605
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:10,360
because it creates sensor entities and camera entities

606
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:13,020
and switch entities in Home Assistant for me,

607
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:15,640
and it uses Home Assistant's media browser

608
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:19,200
to show me the still clips from motion from the camera feeds

609
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:19,900
that it detects.

610
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,320
The Home Assistant integration seems

611
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:25,040
like the perfect aspect of this, but you said,

612
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,240
no, I don't actually like it.

613
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,080
Was it not working well?

614
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:27,960
What happened there?

615
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,600
Well, it's not that I didn't like it.

616
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,120
The version it was using was the stable version.

617
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,960
You didn't have the option to use whenever I set it up,

618
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,320
and I'll be honest with you.

619
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,040
Unlike a lot of people, it's working right now,

620
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:43,600
so I haven't revisited it, because it works.

621
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,120
But at the time,.9 was still in beta,

622
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:52,200
and when you did the 8 when you installed the Home Assistant

623
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,920
integration,.8 was the only one that was there.

624
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:58,560
And again, the.8 was not working for me

625
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:03,160
at all with GPU acceleration, and that was definitely a need.

626
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,240
The features were great.

627
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,760
It was super easy to set up Telegram.

628
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,840
Whenever you had the Home Assistant integration,

629
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,200
it was easy to set up Telegram.

630
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,680
But definitely, when he gets.9, or he gets the 1.0 release

631
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:19,920
up and running, use the Home Assistant integration.

632
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,640
But for right now, if it currently

633
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,960
doesn't support.9, the beta, and you

634
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:29,360
want to get some of these extra features, the 24-7 recording,

635
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,760
the GPU acceleration, you're definitely

636
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,160
going to have to look at doing it outside in Docker Compose

637
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:34,920
separately.

638
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,600
And then it sounds like to really make

639
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,500
it sing, getting one of those Google Coral devices

640
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:42,800
to do the specific machine learning required

641
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,520
for the quick object identification.

642
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,240
That's really the cherry on top.

643
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:46,760
It is.

644
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:50,840
So that thing is like a machine learning AI.

645
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,640
I don't know, it's about the size of two fingers

646
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:56,960
next to each other, like a very small candy bar or something.

647
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,240
And this thing, it's pretty cool if you think about it.

648
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,120
It's basically a machine learning chip on a USB stick.

649
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,240
It's essentially what it is.

650
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:08,040
And it just accelerated everything.

651
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,920
Like Morgan said, the CPU usage just

652
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,080
disappeared when we plugged this thing in.

653
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,600
It was pretty incredible.

654
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,160
It makes me really appreciate the impact

655
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,440
of dedicated silicon.

656
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:21,060
So when I look at the Apple silicon announcement this week,

657
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:25,600
and they're talking about the dedicated ProRes encoding

658
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,800
circuitry that's in their new CPUs,

659
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,240
it's a similar thing here.

660
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,880
We're entering a new era in computing.

661
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:37,160
We're leaving the general purpose CPU-only stuff behind

662
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:40,560
and moving into sort of more ASIC-dedicated hardware

663
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,120
territory.

664
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:45,280
And it's very impressive what this little thing can do.

665
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:48,280
So one last update before I go, and Alex

666
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,920
will truly enjoy this.

667
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,040
I have the worst luck possible.

668
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,600
I always wait until the last minute

669
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,840
and say, OK, let me just go ahead and buy this.

670
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,580
I buy it, and a month later, they

671
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:00,000
come out with a new version.

672
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,680
Wyze just announced the new Doorbell Pro.

673
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,240
It's bigger.

674
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:06,080
It has the higher, the fisheye.

675
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,520
And I really like it.

676
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,400
And I'm probably going to buy it, which

677
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:13,520
means I'll be back to then review that Doorbell.

678
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,120
And I'll take the Doorbell.

679
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,920
That's the Doorbell guy.

680
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,680
You see?

681
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,200
Good.

682
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,760
It's just how it works.

683
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,240
Well, we'll also have links to Morgan's Create

684
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,480
Configs in the show notes, too, if anybody out there

685
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,320
needs a few pointers.

686
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,960
Thanks for sharing those with us, Morgan.

687
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29,800
Yeah, definitely.

688
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,180
Thanks for having me back on the show, guys.

689
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:31,960
It's always fun.

690
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:35,520
And maybe I'll come back with a different review that

691
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,560
isn't a Doorbell.

692
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,840
Nah, not interested.

693
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,120
Not interested.

694
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,640
Only interested in Doorbell reviews.

695
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,960
Backblaze.com slash SSH.

696
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,640
Go there to get a free trial, no credit card required,

697
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,800
and start backing things up.

698
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,000
This is also the way I go for all my friends and family.

699
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,480
For people that ask me, Chris, how should I back up?

700
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,600
Don't fuss with all the details.

701
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,800
Don't mess with all the different crazy plans out there

702
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,200
from all the different providers.

703
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,600
Just focus on Backblaze.

704
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,640
This is what they do.

705
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,680
And you know them for storage, and they

706
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,680
have an awesome deal for you.

707
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,960
Unlimited computer backup for Macs and PCs

708
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,420
for just $7 a month.

709
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:13,600
This is incredible.

710
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,080
And I just gave this to my mom, too,

711
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,500
to get all of her documents backed up

712
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,160
off of her old Mac and her music and all of her photos.

713
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:22,640
She only had that stuff on spread-out external drives.

714
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,240
It was just no good.

715
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,840
And if she ever has any problems,

716
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,440
she can restore files from anywhere

717
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,800
using the web or a mobile app.

718
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,960
And my mom is also a graphic artist,

719
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:36,160
so some of her Photoshop files are huge, ginormous.

720
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,240
Not only does Backblaze have no problem with that,

721
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,200
but if you ever need to restore like a big chunk,

722
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,760
they'll let you restore by mail, snail mail.

723
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,720
You can purchase a disk from them and restore.

724
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,760
They'll restore everything you need right to that,

725
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,540
and you can use that to restore at home.

726
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:52,480
And then you can send it back to them for a refund.

727
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,960
How great is that?

728
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,000
I think that's pretty nice.

729
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,900
And if mom's ever worried about maybe deleting files

730
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,520
and she wants to go back a few revisions with her Photoshop

731
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,520
projects, which this is actually something that

732
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:05,240
has happened to her in the past, for $2 a month,

733
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:05,960
she's good to go.

734
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:08,320
And I like that, too, for myself for business documents.

735
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,160
I think that's great.

736
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,040
You get retention for up to a year.

737
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,320
And the mobile apps are really well done.

738
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,640
And Backblaze has proven it for 50 billion files

739
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,480
that have been restored with their customers.

740
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,640
I mean, you know Backblaze.

741
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,960
You know they're good for this.

742
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,640
This is what they do, but you've been

743
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,520
waiting for a great opportunity.

744
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,400

756
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,600
The Linux trucker writes in, I was

757
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,400
listening to your last episode and heard you

758
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,360
talking about Wall Panel.

759
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:01,040
Although it's great software, I feel there's a better option.

760
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,760
The fully kiosk browser does everything

761
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:06,920
that Wall Panel does, including motion detection, auto-launch,

762
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:10,360
and it will even function with the Home button on Android.

763
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:13,640
There's a very small $5 fee to unlock all of the features,

764
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,520
but I don't mind supporting great software

765
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,160
that I use every single day.

766
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,920
Now I was looking into this as part

767
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,120
of the research for this episode and noticed

768
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,880
that there's been an announcement around Wall Panel,

769
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,080
Chris, right?

770
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,640
Indeed, and yes, Wall Panel is great software,

771
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,280
but it seems that it's just recently

772
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,560
had a maintainer change.

773
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:36,240
One of those kind of classic open-source situations,

774
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,840
if you will, where the maintainer kind of came up and said,

775
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,400
gosh, I think I'm done.

776
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,960
After all these years, I think I'm burned out.

777
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,560
Somebody stepped up right away, and we'll

778
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:48,160
have the new GitHub for that in the show notes.

779
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,120
It now has a new maintainer.

780
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:54,760
But it looks like also if you were a user of the Alarm MQTT

781
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:58,720
project that's a similar project that helps you set up alarm

782
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,760
panels with your own home automation system, that's

783
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,080
still looking for a maintainer.

784
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,840
That was another one of his projects.

785
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:08,000
So perhaps it's worth keeping an eye on Wall Panel

786
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,640
for a little while and see where it goes.

787
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:12,440
I love it because it's in the Amazon App Store

788
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:15,200
and the Google Play Store and other places, of course.

789
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,520
But being in the Amazon App Store

790
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,980
means that you can go pick up a Fire tablet

791
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:22,520
when they're on cheap sales and just

792
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:25,240
toss that app on there via their app store, and you're good to go.

793
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,160
But it seems like maybe Fully Kiosk Browser

794
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,440
is a pretty good contender and worth looking into.

795
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,120
So I'll give that a try soon.

796
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:34,280
Yeah, when we stop using our Fire tablet as a baby monitor,

797
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,760
I'm going to put the Fully Kiosk Browser on that.

798
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:39,720
Remember, I put Lineage on that tablet a little while ago.

799
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,080
It's been super solid.

800
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,740
We just leave it plugged in all the time

801
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:45,280
because the battery is completely knackered anyway.

802
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:48,680
And we just use it as a Wyze Cam baby monitor.

803
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,120
We can put it up on our phones.

804
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,360
It's really useful.

805
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,640
The one thing that wall panel does,

806
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,560
and I'd be curious to see if Kiosk does this,

807
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:57,960
wall panel communicates back to Home Assistant over MQTT,

808
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,720
which is really nice, and also can

809
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,000
turn the front-facing or rear camera into a camera

810
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,840
that you can feed into Home Assistant.

811
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,480
Oh, OK.

812
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,680
That's pretty legit.

813
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,520
That's pretty cool.

814
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:12,440
It is nice because it turns every tablet

815
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:15,800
into a camera that's feeding Home Assistant.

816
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,320
I love that.

817
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,080
But I have to say, so I've bought

818
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,200
a lot of these Fire tablets, probably half a dozen.

819
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,920
And thrown half of them in the sink as well, I might add.

820
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,240
There was that.

821
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,780
Because I have some here at the studio,

822
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,000
and I have some at home.

823
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,800
And this most recent one I got, which I think is a seven-incher

824
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,240
or something like that, I can't remember.

825
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,640
And I've had another seven-incher, four, from them.

826
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:40,280
It crashes almost every day.

827
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,280
It's a piece of garbage.

828
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,640
So maybe if I did put Lineage on there,

829
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,600
it'd be in better shape.

830
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,560
I think it's the OS and all that crap.

831
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:50,360
And the fact that it acts as an Echo, I think also,

832
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,060
which I thought would be neat.

833
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:53,160
I thought that'd be neat.

834
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,920
But it's too slow and laggy.

835
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,560
I saw this going around online, Alex.

836
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,680
And I think you already have the solution for it.

837
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,920
But I don't know if we've ever mentioned it on the air.

838
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,040
So I thought this would be an opportunity.

839
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:08,400
Essentially, and we all have been through this,

840
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,960
a self-hoster goes through a lot of effort

841
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,880
to set up a beautiful Plex library.

842
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:17,120
In this particular case, he has 8,000 movies,

843
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,120
curated movies in his Plex library.

844
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:24,480
Everything's beautifully set up, all of the art's working,

845
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,920
gigabit ethernet from the video player back to the NAS

846
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,120
that has everything on it.

847
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,800
But when the wife sits down on the couch,

848
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,520
she goes to Netflix every single time.

849
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,680
And so he said, okay, so I'm just curious,

850
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:39,080
what is it about Netflix that you like more?

851
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:42,240
And she tells him that she likes that Netflix

852
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,600
kind of just tells her this is what's trendy right now.

853
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,200
You'll probably like these.

854
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,440
And there's too much choice when she's using Plex.

855
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,640
And he wanted to know if there was a way

856
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,680
to create her a curated experience.

857
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:57,160
Now, you and I happen to share Plex instances,

858
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,640
and I've been on your server.

859
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,920
And I know that you really have taken,

860
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,920
or at least put some effort into curating collections.

861
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,880
And you can go to your collection screen

862
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,280
and you have collections of everything.

863
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,600
And it looks like you automated that.

864
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:12,440
I thought that'd probably be the solution

865
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,820
for this individual who's trying to come up with a way

866
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:17,260
to curate the experience for family members.

867
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,600
Collections for days, bro.

868
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,000
Yeah, I've got loads of them.

869
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,200
Yeah, you do.

870
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,800
I use this thing called Plex Meta Manager.

871
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,640
I'll put a link to it in the show notes.

872
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,000
It's a Python script.

873
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,880
And this thing basically just runs

874
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:32,800
through your Plex library using the Plex API,

875
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:37,600
looks at the different TMDB IDs, IMDB IDs,

876
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:40,840
and creates collections based on those IDs.

877
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,160
And the really nice thing about this

878
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:46,080
is it has a whole bunch of predetermined collections.

879
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,700
So if I go to my movies right now,

880
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:50,000
I've got a popular section.

881
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,200
And in there, it looks at what's popular on IMDB,

882
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,260
for example.

883
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:56,880
And right now, I look at my top four on here

884
00:34:56,880 --> 00:35:00,560
and I've got the Tomorrow War, Mortal Kombat, The Matrix.

885
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,560
I guess a lot of people are catching up on The Matrix

886
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,000
ahead of the version four coming out,

887
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,520
and The Wrath of Man.

888
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:09,360
I didn't have to do anything to create this collection

889
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:13,320
except set up Plex Meta Manager in the first place.

890
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,560
I've got an Ansible role that I use to do this

891
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,200
linked in the show notes as well.

892
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,920
And essentially, all it does is it puts a couple

893
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,040
of config files in YAML,

894
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:25,080
and I can set up collections based on stuff that I want.

895
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:28,400
So I want a bunch of collections based on decades, say.

896
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,600
I've got that set up in my config file,

897
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:33,640
but honestly, the defaults it comes with,

898
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:36,360
you've got popular, top-rated, Oscars,

899
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:40,120
and then it starts doing things like by studio, by actor,

900
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,800
all sorts of different filters, basically,

901
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,960
that it creates these collections with.

902
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,400
That's exactly what he needs,

903
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,080
and that's actually something I think

904
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,160
I want to take advantage of too,

905
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,440
because I've done a few manual collections

906
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,420
and I just don't keep up with it.

907
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:55,380
It's a pain to keep up with, absolutely.

908
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:57,440
Now this script, I have it set on a cron job

909
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,560
to run every night,

910
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,520
and let me just go and look at my health checks instance,

911
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,680
because I've started monitoring

912
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,880
how long it takes these jobs to run.

913
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,400
Ah, a nice metric.

914
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,240
Plex meta manager, it takes on average,

915
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,520
let me have a look,

916
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:14,960
anywhere from an hour to the longest,

917
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:15,800
I think it was the first one,

918
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,800
was about four hours to run.

919
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,760
So it's something you want to set up to run overnight,

920
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,200
because it will churn through your library

921
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,080
every single time it does it.

922
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,900
But if you have a lot of content,

923
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,600
obviously that could take a while.

924
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,880
So just be aware of that.

925
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,120
But yeah, I mean, looking at the average time here,

926
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,120
it's about an hour for me,

927
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:34,680
and I've got about a thousand movies in my collection,

928
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,720
so just be aware of that.

929
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,800
Also just a note,

930
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,400
people have been writing in and letting us know,

931
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,720
and we also saw,

932
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,280
after we recorded last week's episode,

933
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,860
we mentioned that there was a big change

934
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:47,040
in the way Tuya devices were handled with Home Assistant.

935
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,460
And it seems like for a lot of people,

936
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:50,960
when they're upgrading to the October release,

937
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,660
the 2021 October release of Home Assistant,

938
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:55,360
it's nuking their Tuya setups.

939
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:58,360
So if you're a Tuya user, be careful,

940
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,160
make sure you got your backups.

941
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:03,660
They have moved over to an official built-in integration,

942
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:04,960
but it's cloud only.

943
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,200
And so what's a common thread,

944
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,960
and I hate this because this has happened to me too,

945
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,440
is people were just going along,

946
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,360
they hit the update button,

947
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:16,320
and all of their local Tuya control was wiped out.

948
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,440
And man, have I been there when something like that's happened.

949
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:21,440
I just recently tried to do the Z-Wave migration myself,

950
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:25,160
and that was a dumpster fire I had to restore from backup

951
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,080
and just get out of there.

952
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:29,040
And I've just determined I am sticking

953
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:32,040
with the old Z-Wave integration for as long as possible.

954
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,600
And I'm going to hope to just switch to Matter

955
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,880
like sometime next year.

956
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:38,420
And then I went online, Alex, and I looked it up,

957
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:42,440
and man, people said they were spending like six days

958
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:45,240
fixing their setups after they migrated

959
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,000
to the new Z-Wave JS integration.

960
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,560
I love Home Assistant.

961
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,880
You all know this, and it is a universal truth in my life.

962
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:55,520
But it feels to me a lot like Alex as a teenager.

963
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,920
I used to come along to my parents and say,

964
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,160
I've got this cool idea

965
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,280
about how you can make your life easier.

966
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,240
All you do is this.

967
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,460
You just do this.

968
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:04,680
You just do that.

969
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,720
And I kind of feel like Home Assistant

970
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,200
is in that kind of adolescent phase at the moment

971
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:13,720
where you just need to do this migration just this once,

972
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,220
and then it'll just be fine.

973
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:17,280
And six days later,

974
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,880
you're just still picking up the pieces.

975
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,900
It's a-

976
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:20,740
Yeah.

977
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:22,420
Sometimes I understand it's a necessary evil,

978
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:26,520
but also I do think we need to be careful

979
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,200
somehow as a community.

980
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,800
I don't know what the solution is

981
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,680
because if people don't maintain the old stuff,

982
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,400
we've got to move to new stuff, right?

983
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,760
Yeah, it's tricky too with open source

984
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:37,200
because you only have so many contributors

985
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,280
and they only have so much time.

986
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,440
And yeah, I do get it.

987
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,720
And I am actually just grateful

988
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,120
they've kept the old integration working

989
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,480
for as long as it does.

990
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,560
And I'm hopeful it makes it until next year

991
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,480
because that's when I'll probably switch over.

992
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,120
And there were plenty of resources,

993
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,480
but you have to have a few people

994
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,800
that take a dive and try it and report back on how it goes.

995
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,280
And maybe if you've got any success stories, let us know.

996
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,240
In fact, we love all of your stories,

997
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,520
your war stories, your success stories,

998
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,460
