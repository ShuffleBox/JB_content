00:00.000 --> 00:07.600
Coming up on Self Hosted 13, Alan Pope from Canonical joins us and Alex crashes a drone

00:07.600 --> 00:08.940
into a tree.

00:08.940 --> 00:09.940
I'm Chris.

00:09.940 --> 00:10.940
And I'm Alex.

00:10.940 --> 00:15.200
And this is Self Hosted, episode 13.

00:15.200 --> 00:17.500
Welcome back to Self Hosted, everyone.

00:17.500 --> 00:20.800
We start today with a special guest, Mr. Alan Pope.

00:20.800 --> 00:21.800
Hey, Popey.

00:21.800 --> 00:23.800
Hey, how you doing, guys?

00:23.800 --> 00:24.800
Great.

00:24.800 --> 00:26.080
I appreciate you coming on.

00:26.080 --> 00:32.280
And honestly, I think our topic today, I think you're going to make me put my words in my

00:32.280 --> 00:36.960
emotive when you have to eat what you said, because today Popey is going to join us and

00:36.960 --> 00:39.400
convince us why IRC is not dead.

00:39.400 --> 00:44.440
When I went on air and said IRC is totally dead, but I was actually just being a little

00:44.440 --> 00:45.440
click baity.

00:45.440 --> 00:46.920
So I appreciate you being here.

00:46.920 --> 00:48.000
You triggered me, Chris.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.560
You triggered me.

00:49.560 --> 00:53.400
Alex, before we started the show, you and I were talking drones, and I discovered this

00:53.400 --> 00:55.960
week that you managed to crash a drone into a tree.

00:55.960 --> 00:58.880
And a car park and a building.

00:58.880 --> 01:03.360
And so to be clear, it's not one of the DJI balloon simulator drones.

01:03.360 --> 01:08.800
It's a racing drone made of carbon fiber that does 70 miles an hour.

01:08.800 --> 01:11.680
And yeah, this thing ended up in a tree.

01:11.680 --> 01:17.200
And there's a video in the show notes, one of my buddies made, where we have to fly another

01:17.200 --> 01:22.320
drone with a rope tied to it over the tree I'd crashed into to actually shake the damn

01:22.320 --> 01:23.320
thing out of it.

01:23.320 --> 01:25.080
So yeah, that was a lot of fun.

01:25.080 --> 01:26.080
That was my Sunday.

01:26.080 --> 01:28.800
So you threw another drone at that drone?

01:28.800 --> 01:33.960
We tied a piece of string or a rope to the bottom of another drone that I have, flew

01:33.960 --> 01:38.940
it over the tree that it was stuck in, did a sort of loop-de-loop to try and tie it in

01:38.940 --> 01:45.400
some kind of like a Maypole style situation around the tree, and then used the quad that

01:45.400 --> 01:50.360
had just flown over with the rope as like an anchor, like a barb fishing hook or whatever,

01:50.360 --> 01:53.200
to shoot the tree.

01:53.200 --> 01:55.520
And it all came down and I didn't lose any drones.

01:55.520 --> 01:59.200
The only thing that happened was I snapped an arm off the drone, which sounds like a

01:59.200 --> 02:03.360
big deal, except for the fact the frames that I use have a lifetime warranty.

02:03.360 --> 02:08.280
So I just email them a picture and they send me a new one for five bucks every time I actually

02:08.280 --> 02:09.280
have to cover shipping.

02:09.280 --> 02:14.760
Do you send them a picture of the drone in the tree or just the drone that's broken?

02:14.760 --> 02:17.120
You have to send them a picture of the carnage.

02:17.120 --> 02:22.300
I posted it on Twitter about how I cracked the arm of this thing, but you can maybe see

02:22.300 --> 02:25.840
how I can bend this thing.

02:25.840 --> 02:27.680
That doesn't look like it should do that.

02:27.680 --> 02:29.520
No, that's pretty bad.

02:29.520 --> 02:33.080
We will put a video to this in the show notes.

02:33.080 --> 02:35.760
Were you trying to use toilet paper at first to recover this thing?

02:35.760 --> 02:43.600
It looks like toilet paper, but it's actually a piece of AT&T rope that they use.

02:43.600 --> 02:45.480
Like fishing string through cable.

02:45.480 --> 02:48.480
It can hold like 2,000 pounds or something crazy.

02:48.480 --> 02:51.440
So you were being a fancy fly boy and you were flying too close to the trees.

02:51.440 --> 02:52.440
What happened?

02:52.440 --> 02:53.440
Yeah.

02:53.440 --> 02:58.960
Or I just ran out of talent and... Well, I have no excuse because I flew my

02:58.960 --> 03:02.440
drone into the side of a barn the other day.

03:02.440 --> 03:04.320
Can I say the tree leapt out at me?

03:04.320 --> 03:06.680
I think barns are inanimate, aren't they?

03:06.680 --> 03:07.680
Yeah.

03:07.680 --> 03:08.680
Yeah.

03:08.680 --> 03:09.680
Totally.

03:09.680 --> 03:10.680
Totally.

03:10.680 --> 03:14.280
Well now, before we prove why I was wrong about IRC, you have been writing recently

03:14.280 --> 03:18.320
and I have been sneaking into your computer at night, checking your documents and following

03:18.320 --> 03:19.320
along.

03:19.320 --> 03:24.120
I don't know if I should be creeped out about this or... I think I'm creeped out.

03:24.120 --> 03:26.600
Well, you did give me pseudo access after all.

03:26.600 --> 03:27.600
Oh yeah.

03:27.600 --> 03:28.600
Yeah.

03:28.600 --> 03:29.600
Maybe I should revoke that.

03:29.600 --> 03:33.000
But Docker Compose workflows has been on your mind.

03:33.000 --> 03:37.280
It's funny that this came up in the show because this week I've been told by a couple of individuals

03:37.280 --> 03:41.880
that Docker is dead and I asked them if they've met my friend Docker Compose because I think

03:41.880 --> 03:46.040
it's sort of breathed new life into people using Docker online.

03:46.040 --> 03:50.520
Every project you see now, somebody dropped some Docker Compose example along with it.

03:50.520 --> 03:52.640
Why do they think Docker is dead though?

03:52.640 --> 03:53.720
That's what I want to know.

03:53.720 --> 03:58.000
I am the worst person to ask about Docker because I never use it for anything.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
Well that's the way.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
Hold on.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
That's a good perspective.

04:01.000 --> 04:06.320
I think there's one service that I installed, two services that I installed via Docker and

04:06.320 --> 04:11.480
that's only because that's the upstream supported way of doing it and I couldn't find a better

04:11.480 --> 04:18.360
way and that's Mastodon and Discourse and they were both upstream supported ways.

04:18.360 --> 04:19.560
So that's what I used.

04:19.560 --> 04:23.840
I don't feel part of a Docker ecosystem or I don't feel like a power user or anything.

04:23.840 --> 04:28.560
I just pasted a command in a terminal and the service started and I was like, okay,

04:28.560 --> 04:29.560
I'm done.

04:29.560 --> 04:31.320
But that's how it goes the first few times, right?

04:31.320 --> 04:33.400
With anything, not just Docker.

04:33.400 --> 04:39.720
And that's really what it's supposed to be like, you know, if you're consuming some software

04:39.720 --> 04:43.320
and you want to start a service, you just want to run a command.

04:43.320 --> 04:47.080
You want to run whatever the right command is to get the thing working and then walk

04:47.080 --> 04:50.800
away and leave it and then come back to it three months later and think, how did I set

04:50.800 --> 04:51.800
this thing up?

04:51.800 --> 04:53.840
I've got to do some software updates on this and I don't know.

04:53.840 --> 04:58.440
I had to relearn like how to do it all and that was a learning curve.

04:58.440 --> 05:00.640
But yeah, once you get over that, it's fine.

05:00.640 --> 05:03.060
Yeah, that's a very fair assessment of it.

05:03.060 --> 05:04.060
That's really true.

05:04.060 --> 05:08.400
I just recently went back to a system I set up a couple of months ago and went, oh, oh

05:08.400 --> 05:09.400
right.

05:09.400 --> 05:10.400
I have this URL.

05:10.400 --> 05:11.400
I go to admin it.

05:11.400 --> 05:13.520
I have this URL where I go to use it.

05:13.520 --> 05:14.520
Okay.

05:14.520 --> 05:15.520
Yeah, right.

05:15.520 --> 05:16.520
I can remember all of this.

05:16.520 --> 05:20.080
And maybe that's part of what appeals to me about some of these newer install techniques

05:20.080 --> 05:22.400
like using Docker Composes.

05:22.400 --> 05:26.880
I can go read a compose file and it's all in YAML and I can have a pretty good understanding

05:26.880 --> 05:28.080
of what it's doing.

05:28.080 --> 05:32.280
But Alex, to answer your question, I think it's a combination of answers.

05:32.280 --> 05:36.140
Fundamentally, Docker isn't doing anything that other technologies can't do because it's

05:36.140 --> 05:40.240
relying on underpinning technologies that are built into the operating system.

05:40.240 --> 05:44.700
So a lot of different vendors have different takes on how to solve this problem.

05:44.700 --> 05:49.160
And a lot of times they are better integrated into their overall product than Docker itself

05:49.160 --> 05:50.680
is.

05:50.680 --> 05:55.080
And when you combine the technical aspects of what a container actually is and how any

05:55.080 --> 05:59.280
Linux host operating system or many other OSs now can run them and the fact that many

05:59.280 --> 06:04.760
distributions have a preferred container technology that tends to work better on their distribution

06:04.760 --> 06:10.120
and ecosystem, I think it's understandable that people kind of see Docker as sort of

06:10.120 --> 06:12.680
being pointless, not necessary.

06:12.680 --> 06:17.040
And then you have the VM crowd as well, who is maybe not even totally bought off on the

06:17.040 --> 06:20.880
idea of running applications in containers when they could just run it in a VM system.

06:20.880 --> 06:26.320
I was about to argue with you that various different people didn't have their own versions

06:26.320 --> 06:27.320
of container runtimes.

06:27.320 --> 06:32.280
And then I realized that Red Hat have their own, Docker have their own, VMware have bought

06:32.280 --> 06:36.320
Pivotal, so they're going to have their own, so yeah, you're totally right.

06:36.320 --> 06:39.240
I can see why people might come to that conclusion.

06:39.240 --> 06:42.640
And if I was on the Red Hat platform, I might use Podman.

06:42.640 --> 06:45.200
And I could be wrong, but if I'm on Ubuntu, I'd probably use LXD.

06:45.200 --> 06:47.680
Yep, I use LXD for everything.

06:47.680 --> 06:48.680
Right.

06:48.680 --> 06:53.880
And there's even nice scripts or applications built around those tools to make setting up

06:53.880 --> 06:59.640
environments super quick and fast and kind of a no brainer when you're on those platforms.

06:59.640 --> 07:06.060
So my thrust for bringing this up really was that one of the first questions I see and

07:06.060 --> 07:11.540
hear from people getting into containers for the first time is, is there a UI?

07:11.540 --> 07:12.540
Is there a GUI?

07:12.540 --> 07:16.640
Is there a web app that I can run that exposes this stuff to me?

07:16.640 --> 07:20.180
And my general answer is you don't need one.

07:20.180 --> 07:21.180
What do you think?

07:21.180 --> 07:24.160
Do noobs need a UI?

07:24.160 --> 07:26.880
What are noobs doing running containers?

07:26.880 --> 07:30.240
They're running unraid boxes or free NAS boxes or...

07:30.240 --> 07:32.200
Which have web UIs, don't they?

07:32.200 --> 07:34.000
Or Raspberry Pis.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
Running what though?

07:35.000 --> 07:38.760
You don't, nobody, nobody goes out to install a Raspberry Pi.

07:38.760 --> 07:43.760
You go out because there's an appliance that you want to put on a Raspberry Pi, or there's

07:43.760 --> 07:47.960
some device you want to build around a Raspberry Pi.

07:47.960 --> 07:52.120
Or you just think, hmm, that's $25, I'm going to buy one.

07:52.120 --> 07:53.760
And then what should I do with it when it arrives?

07:53.760 --> 07:57.560
And put it in a drawer with all the others.

07:57.560 --> 08:01.980
I have got a couple of Raspberry Pis here in service.

08:01.980 --> 08:07.160
One is my DNS, so it does Pi-hole and blocks adverts and stuff.

08:07.160 --> 08:08.440
That has a web UI.

08:08.440 --> 08:10.560
I almost never use it because I just don't care.

08:10.560 --> 08:11.560
It just works.

08:11.560 --> 08:17.720
Like if I have to whitelist something, then yeah, I consider myself expert.

08:17.720 --> 08:21.800
So I could use the command line, but the web UI is nicer.

08:21.800 --> 08:26.000
And for other things that I run on a Pi, they have web UIs as well.

08:26.000 --> 08:30.480
So I don't know, I think it's just a nicer experience.

08:30.480 --> 08:35.280
I could see the argument for being hardcore and doing it on the command line because it's,

08:35.280 --> 08:39.520
you know, you have total control and power.

08:39.520 --> 08:42.320
But I also quite like a pretty graph now and then.

08:42.320 --> 08:46.080
I don't necessarily disagree in a couple of ways.

08:46.080 --> 08:49.360
And I recently got a note from a listener who said, Chris, you're always advocating

08:49.360 --> 08:52.320
people just use the command line.

08:52.320 --> 08:58.860
And I have kind of in the last year and a half sort of transitioned to just learn the

08:58.860 --> 09:02.880
command line because it's sort of a universal tool that will always work.

09:02.880 --> 09:09.240
But working with team members that learn in different ways than I learn here on our podcast

09:09.240 --> 09:14.240
team, I realized that for some of them, they want to see what the end result is that they

09:14.240 --> 09:17.820
could achieve if they invest the time to learn the whole stack.

09:17.820 --> 09:23.340
So if they can do something that gets them deploying software and turning on things and

09:23.340 --> 09:29.240
actually using the end product that gets them excited and motivated, it's worth it.

09:29.240 --> 09:33.840
So they'll use a GUI to sort of skip learning how to get on the command line, learning how

09:33.840 --> 09:36.760
to run Docker and end up running the application.

09:36.760 --> 09:38.560
And they'll go right to using the application.

09:38.560 --> 09:40.760
They go from zero to using the application.

09:40.760 --> 09:41.760
They go, okay, this is great.

09:41.760 --> 09:43.040
This is worth it.

09:43.040 --> 09:45.280
And then they kind of walk it back.

09:45.280 --> 09:49.640
So in that way, I kind of think, yes, it is important to have a GUI tool because different

09:49.640 --> 09:54.080
people learn differently and some people are extremely visual learners.

09:54.080 --> 09:58.120
But I want to just sort of caveat all of that with, I just want to remind us that sometimes

09:58.120 --> 10:03.880
some groups do actually put some form of design into their tools.

10:03.880 --> 10:09.760
I remember, I think I might even have been having a conversation with you, Poppy, about

10:09.760 --> 10:15.600
having folks at Canonical look at the syntax of the snap commands or the Docker folks,

10:15.600 --> 10:18.940
they look at the syntax of the Docker commands to actually see if it logically makes sense.

10:18.940 --> 10:22.640
There is some design that goes into command line tools to make them more usable.

10:22.640 --> 10:26.600
So some tools are more usable than others on the command line.

10:26.600 --> 10:31.160
I think for me, it's not necessarily about being a hardcore elite super hacker.

10:31.160 --> 10:37.280
It's about having some way to repeatably rebuild my system when it goes tits up.

10:37.280 --> 10:43.720
I love committing text files to Git and just being able to copy paste whatever that Docker

10:43.720 --> 10:44.720
run command.

10:44.720 --> 10:45.720
I mean, this is how I started.

10:45.720 --> 10:50.680
I used to run one Docker run command after another and just keep that in a GitHub repo

10:50.680 --> 10:52.400
in a text file.

10:52.400 --> 10:55.480
I used Fig when that was new and Docker compose was new.

10:55.480 --> 10:58.560
And as it's gone on, Docker compose has matured.

10:58.560 --> 11:06.520
And now I manage something like 30, 35 containers on a single host with one interface to it.

11:06.520 --> 11:12.560
And for me, I have a single text file now, it's a YAML file admittedly, not a text file.

11:12.560 --> 11:17.880
I have a single file which defines what every single container on my system looks like.

11:17.880 --> 11:22.160
And if I want to add a new container, I have to add maybe eight lines of code because I

11:22.160 --> 11:24.960
figured out what the syntax of that YAML is.

11:24.960 --> 11:26.960
Now that's investment I've made to learn that.

11:26.960 --> 11:32.440
And I will fully admit that for a completely new user, that's not realistic.

11:32.440 --> 11:39.320
However, I think simply asking, is there a UI like Portainer or something like that?

11:39.320 --> 11:44.800
Using that as your crutch rather than actually investing in learning how the underlying stuff

11:44.800 --> 11:51.600
works, over time will bite you in the bum because it's just that question of when you

11:51.600 --> 11:53.920
want to redeploy something, how do you do it?

11:53.920 --> 11:58.240
I mean, taking a few steps to address that, I've started writing a Wiki at home as we

11:58.240 --> 12:05.240
discussed last episode, keeping notes as Chris is doing now, all these things, but nothing

12:05.240 --> 12:10.360
beats the source of truth, which is the file that you use to deploy the application itself.

12:10.360 --> 12:12.760
And for me, compose.yaml is the one.

12:12.760 --> 12:16.160
I think you're two steps ahead of me.

12:16.160 --> 12:22.160
I've just started a Wiki at home to keep track of some of these things because I've now been

12:22.160 --> 12:27.340
bitten in the butt where I, like I said, didn't remember how I set up the Mastodon instance.

12:27.340 --> 12:32.600
And now I have to revisit the thing because I've got to clean it up or upgrade it or something.

12:32.600 --> 12:36.600
And I think we're in a similar state along that course.

12:36.600 --> 12:40.960
But I think what a lot of people are doing is they want to get to the goal, as Chris

12:40.960 --> 12:43.160
says, they just want to have that appliance working.

12:43.160 --> 12:49.120
They want to have that thing installed and they want the fast track to get it in.

12:49.120 --> 12:54.760
And what they don't have is the blessing of experience that you've had of things going

12:54.760 --> 13:01.020
tits up over and again, and you learning from that experience and deciding to write stuff

13:01.020 --> 13:06.280
down so that the next time it does, or hopefully it doesn't, you've got a document that you

13:06.280 --> 13:09.880
can refer to to get your system back in order.

13:09.880 --> 13:18.820
And my pie hole has never broken, but it is a Raspberry Pi sat in a warm room and it's

13:18.820 --> 13:20.960
using an SD card for its storage.

13:20.960 --> 13:25.620
So inevitably it's going to fail at some point, right?

13:25.620 --> 13:29.440
And I couldn't tell you off the top of my head how I installed that thing.

13:29.440 --> 13:32.840
I probably just did curl pipe to bash or something like that.

13:32.840 --> 13:35.680
I think appliances are a different use case altogether though.

13:35.680 --> 13:41.420
I'm more talking about those people on FreeNAS, on Unraid, or maybe people like Open Media

13:41.420 --> 13:46.340
Vault users or people like me that just run Debian with some stuff, actually Ubuntu these

13:46.340 --> 13:51.480
days that'll make you happy, as my server OS, and I just run a bunch of containers on

13:51.480 --> 13:52.800
top of that.

13:52.800 --> 13:56.040
The other thing to think about, of course, is discoverability.

13:56.040 --> 14:00.640
App stores have shown us that people like to browse through a list of stuff and click

14:00.640 --> 14:03.720
on buttons and install things to try them out.

14:03.720 --> 14:08.680
There are some good resources that I use to kind of counteract the gooey discoverability

14:08.680 --> 14:11.240
versus the command line stuff.

14:11.240 --> 14:15.800
One of those is the awesome self-hosted list, which we'll link to in the show notes.

14:15.800 --> 14:20.600
And the other is a list of containers published by the linuxserver.io team.

14:20.600 --> 14:21.600
That's at fleet.linuxserver.io.

14:21.600 --> 14:26.080
And you can actually just look through the list and it will take you through to the project

14:26.080 --> 14:31.600
page and show you how to deploy each one and all that kind of stuff.

14:31.600 --> 14:36.600
And even when I was actively involved in that project, which I'm not anymore, I used to

14:36.600 --> 14:38.080
find containers on there all the time.

14:38.080 --> 14:40.240
I didn't even know they would have been working on.

14:40.240 --> 14:44.480
So, there are ways to find this stuff, even if you don't have a UI.

14:44.480 --> 14:50.860
I think that's a good point is now the Linux ecosystem has matured to the point where we

14:50.860 --> 14:57.120
have these different app stores and places people can go and browse a list of applications,

14:57.120 --> 15:03.720
whether they're containerized or not, is light years ahead of where we were going and finding

15:03.720 --> 15:08.440
all the individual components and compiling them from scratch like animals.

15:08.440 --> 15:15.560
Now it is a point and click user interface and you can stand up a service or a bunch

15:15.560 --> 15:19.000
of services really super easily these days.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
Too easily, maybe sometimes.

15:21.000 --> 15:24.200
Well, yes, I'm a danger to myself.

15:24.200 --> 15:29.640
I mean, what I mean by that is that if the barrier to entry is so low that you set something

15:29.640 --> 15:34.400
up and you have no idea how you did it, in six months time, maybe you set Nextcloud up

15:34.400 --> 15:40.400
using a snap or a container or whatever it is and you go, where's my actual data live?

15:40.400 --> 15:45.680
And you don't really understand how you did it and you wipe the wrong drive and oops,

15:45.680 --> 15:46.680
it's easy done.

15:46.680 --> 15:47.680
Yeah.

15:47.680 --> 15:51.480
And the bigger worry is if other people depend on that service, like if you set up a public

15:51.480 --> 15:57.880
service like a Mastodon instance and other people are using it and you haven't kept up

15:57.880 --> 16:05.440
with your security updates or you haven't set it up using the best practices, then people

16:05.440 --> 16:12.320
might come knocking on your door because their data is compromised or their features are

16:12.320 --> 16:13.800
not available anymore.

16:13.800 --> 16:15.680
And of course, it's going to happen on a weekend.

16:15.680 --> 16:19.920
When you're away from a keyboard and your only interface to your Docker containers is

16:19.920 --> 16:21.960
SSH on your mobile phone.

16:21.960 --> 16:26.260
This is why you need an IRC room filled with community members.

16:26.260 --> 16:31.960
And of course, everyone knows that IRC is exploding with popularity in 2020.

16:31.960 --> 16:34.200
Oh, Chris.

16:34.200 --> 16:39.280
So I made the bodacious claim, although I was a little out there, that IRC was dead.

16:39.280 --> 16:44.440
And that actually came from a Fosdom talk where a member at Fosdom said, I'm not joining

16:44.440 --> 16:46.840
your open source community because it's on IRC.

16:46.840 --> 16:50.200
I'm of the GitHub generation and I want to use Discord.

16:50.200 --> 16:51.440
I want to use Twitter.

16:51.440 --> 16:54.680
I want to use discourse, but I don't want to use IRC.

16:54.680 --> 16:56.880
Oh, my friends, we all chat on Slack.

16:56.880 --> 16:58.480
We don't chat on IRC.

16:58.480 --> 17:05.800
And he threw up some numbers like 13 million Slack users versus 400,000 IRC users.

17:05.800 --> 17:10.560
But there is a tinge of sadness when I talk about this because obviously you can self

17:10.560 --> 17:14.320
host IRC and you can run other things in IRC as well.

17:14.320 --> 17:19.640
How many of those Slack users actually want to be there versus the IRC users, though?

17:19.640 --> 17:20.640
Yeah, fair enough.

17:20.640 --> 17:25.440
I'd say a decent percentage are there simply because their employer mandates it.

17:25.440 --> 17:29.640
Yeah, I mean, there are some definite communities that use Slack, but you're probably right.

17:29.640 --> 17:30.640
Same with teams.

17:30.640 --> 17:31.640
It was a big number for teams.

17:31.640 --> 17:35.840
Yeah, I've been in slacks where it was the network effect.

17:35.840 --> 17:39.800
There was one individual who pushed everyone towards a Slack.

17:39.800 --> 17:44.460
And the second they left the company, everyone left that Slack completely.

17:44.460 --> 17:49.680
So nobody is in that Slack anymore as a result of it being actually not what anyone wanted

17:49.680 --> 17:51.120
it to use.

17:51.120 --> 17:57.680
And I realise, I appreciate that there are younglings who are using new modern tools,

17:57.680 --> 18:03.000
like you say, like Slack and Twitter and discourse, and that's fine.

18:03.000 --> 18:07.520
But it turns out there are still existing communities that have been around for a long

18:07.520 --> 18:12.300
time who do still have a presence on IRC.

18:12.300 --> 18:16.160
And it's actually not that painful to use IRC.

18:16.160 --> 18:23.800
Yeah, okay, if you're advocating for the use of ERC or BitChecks or one of the, you know,

18:23.800 --> 18:30.280
more quirky IRC clients, then for a new user, it's a bit frosty.

18:30.280 --> 18:37.560
But there are plenty of other ways to access IRC that are not quite as comparable with

18:37.560 --> 18:41.200
Slack, but nowhere near as frosty as it used to be.

18:41.200 --> 18:47.480
IRC Cloud is a great example of a very modern IRC client that I like to use.

18:47.480 --> 18:54.080
It does a lot of the things that Slack does, like image previews, URL previews, avatars,

18:54.080 --> 18:56.000
all just based on IRC.

18:56.000 --> 19:00.240
And the thing that pains me the most, and obviously our live stream for Jupiter Broadcasting

19:00.240 --> 19:07.080
still IRC, the community is going right now, it's just over my shoulder, is it's all text.

19:07.080 --> 19:12.520
At the end of the day, it's all beautiful, wonderful, gorgeous text.

19:12.520 --> 19:17.400
And I would think that would be extremely appealing to the community at large.

19:17.400 --> 19:25.840
I think there's certainly a compelling argument for getting down to raw ASCII.

19:25.840 --> 19:32.400
There are times when I sometimes want to paste an animated GIF or, you know, something richer

19:32.400 --> 19:38.040
in an IRC channel, but really you've got to think about all the other people in the room.

19:38.040 --> 19:39.520
What is the purpose of this channel?

19:39.520 --> 19:41.120
Why does it exist?

19:41.120 --> 19:45.200
It exists to discuss the development of a piece of software.

19:45.200 --> 19:53.480
And you've got a whole bunch of people from different cultures, perhaps different connectivity.

19:53.480 --> 19:59.880
And if you're respectful of those and just use text, then it's accessible to everyone.

19:59.880 --> 20:03.600
Absolutely, and you could layer on client richness on top of that.

20:03.600 --> 20:07.440
So if you're someone that wants to see that animated GIF get a preview, then you could

20:07.440 --> 20:09.440
elect to use a client that shows that.

20:09.440 --> 20:10.440
Right.

20:10.440 --> 20:16.000
I mean, if I'm using IRC Cloud, which I have done for a couple of years now, it feels very

20:16.000 --> 20:20.600
much like the more modern, richer clients.

20:20.600 --> 20:27.680
Actually I think Slack have not really done an awful lot in the last couple of years.

20:27.680 --> 20:31.520
And that's given an opportunity for some of the other clients to catch up.

20:31.520 --> 20:40.240
Whether it is the newer IRC clients or things like Mattermost and Discourse and Rocket Chat,

20:40.240 --> 20:44.560
a lot of them are catching up with the richness that Slack has.

20:44.560 --> 20:46.720
So they're getting to be mostly on a par.

20:46.720 --> 20:52.840
And yeah, I will concede IRC is a bit behind all of the others, but there are still, like

20:52.840 --> 20:58.240
I say, a bunch of projects that are still on IRC, and so sometimes if you're working

20:58.240 --> 21:04.440
in the open source world, as we do, it's useful to maintain a presence on IRC so you can talk

21:04.440 --> 21:05.840
to these people.

21:05.840 --> 21:10.200
It does one thing, it does one thing really, really well.

21:10.200 --> 21:14.760
And there is the saying that there'll be a few things left after a nuclear holocaust,

21:14.760 --> 21:16.500
cockroaches and IRC.

21:16.500 --> 21:17.500
And maybe ham radio.

21:17.500 --> 21:23.920
I mean, I look at IRC, it's almost like it's the communications protocol and then the client

21:23.920 --> 21:24.920
can add the richness.

21:24.920 --> 21:27.820
I know I've just said that, but I mean, think about it.

21:27.820 --> 21:32.000
One of the traditional complaints about IRC is that, well, I'm on mobile and I have varying

21:32.000 --> 21:36.200
connectivity so it's hard for me to follow a conversation, Slack handles that really

21:36.200 --> 21:37.200
well.

21:37.200 --> 21:38.200
Well, no.

21:38.200 --> 21:41.680
An IRC client that has a server log that is keeping track of the conversation and logging

21:41.680 --> 21:46.880
it to a SQL database and then disseminates it to a client when it reconnects works perfectly

21:46.880 --> 21:47.880
well.

21:47.880 --> 21:48.880
Quozzel can do that.

21:48.880 --> 21:49.880
You can host it yourself.

21:49.880 --> 21:50.880
It's doable today.

21:50.880 --> 21:57.240
I've used Quozzel for many years and the app that makes it the best IRC experience in my

21:57.240 --> 22:00.160
opinion is Quozzel Droid.

22:00.160 --> 22:02.760
Red Hat use it for most of their internal communications.

22:02.760 --> 22:08.200
So I'm on eight, 10 hours a day and I get all the notifications through to my phone

22:08.200 --> 22:09.200
and it just works.

22:09.200 --> 22:10.200
It's just great.

22:10.200 --> 22:16.840
I went for an alternative approach and I used to use IRC or I-R-S-S-I if you want to spell

22:16.840 --> 22:17.840
it out.

22:17.840 --> 22:22.840
I used to run that on my VPS and I would miss notifications when smart, I've been using

22:22.840 --> 22:28.800
it since before smartphones were a thing and when smartphones became a thing, I quite liked

22:28.800 --> 22:36.080
the idea of having that connectivity to IRC on the phone and I didn't get the notifications.

22:36.080 --> 22:44.760
There's an app in the Android App Store called IRC Notifier and you load a plug-in into IRC

22:44.760 --> 22:49.520
and then authenticate it with your Android device and from that point onwards, you get

22:49.520 --> 22:54.140
push notifications through to your phone when people mention your name or highlight you

22:54.140 --> 22:57.680
in some way or PM you on IRC.

22:57.680 --> 23:04.580
So I started to get that availability of the messages people were sending me and the conversations

23:04.580 --> 23:05.580
people were having.

23:05.580 --> 23:11.400
I didn't feel left out of the conversations but the problem was I couldn't then reply

23:11.400 --> 23:17.560
because they were just notifications and so I did find myself leveraging that SSH client

23:17.560 --> 23:23.960
on my phone and I would SSH into the VPS and use IRC inside a screen session so that I

23:23.960 --> 23:29.720
could bash out a quick reply to someone if it was urgent and then disconnect from SSH

23:29.720 --> 23:30.720
when I'm done.

23:30.720 --> 23:34.960
Okay, when you say all that, I know why people are switching to Discord.

23:34.960 --> 23:40.560
And that's quite brutal, I mean that is between 10 and 15 years ago I was doing that.

23:40.560 --> 23:46.280
I remember being on holiday 15 years ago with my daughter in a pram and getting a push notification

23:46.280 --> 23:51.600
on IRC but something was going on and while I'm pushing my daughter along with one hand

23:51.600 --> 23:57.040
I'm typing in my SSH password on my phone with the other and getting into IRC but it's

23:57.040 --> 24:03.780
possible but things have moved on a bit now and we now have better ways of being on IRC.

24:03.780 --> 24:10.200
The juxtaposition of you, Popey, on one hand you're advocating for UIs to make things simpler

24:10.200 --> 24:14.360
and on the other hand we're talking about SSH passwords on IRC from our phone.

24:14.360 --> 24:20.960
Yeah, I'm not complaining, I love the fact that I could SSH to my VPS from walking along,

24:20.960 --> 24:25.780
having a stroll around the Isle of Wight with my daughter, that was great.

24:25.780 --> 24:30.040
So what do you use for IRC on iOS, Chris, because that was one of the major pain points

24:30.040 --> 24:31.040
I had.

24:31.040 --> 24:37.480
I got iOS in the fall last year in autumn and I just couldn't get away with any clients

24:37.480 --> 24:41.200
that really were as good as Quasildroid.

24:41.200 --> 24:45.960
Quasildroid does look really good so I don't know if this is as good but I just use the

24:45.960 --> 24:51.160
IRC Cloud client for iOS which is just a native IRC app.

24:51.160 --> 24:55.680
I think I might have some unique requirements in that the Red Hat IRC stuff I have to be

24:55.680 --> 25:01.480
on a VPN to connect to it so IRC Cloud wouldn't really work for that use case.

25:01.480 --> 25:05.740
That's sort of the tricky thing is you can both roll your own solution and you have to

25:05.740 --> 25:08.600
roll your own solution with IRC in that regard.

25:08.600 --> 25:13.320
So I'm not going to sit here and try to say it's as easy as all of the other alternatives.

25:13.320 --> 25:16.880
It might even honestly be easier to set up a Mattermost server than an IRC server these

25:16.880 --> 25:24.260
days but there's other aspects of IRC that I don't know what we would do if say we switch

25:24.260 --> 25:30.440
to Discord I guess we would rewrite JBot I guess I don't know.

25:30.440 --> 25:34.760
The bot aspect is a very nice thing about IRC and it feels like it's a Wild West you

25:34.760 --> 25:39.320
can do whatever you want whereas with these other platforms you have to get an integration.

25:39.320 --> 25:44.360
And I think that's one of the reasons why Slack took off so well with open source developers

25:44.360 --> 25:49.120
is you could press a couple of buttons and you'd have an integration that told you whether

25:49.120 --> 25:53.040
your Jenkins was operating correctly and whether your code was landing and if someone had reviewed

25:53.040 --> 25:59.320
your code and so for developers Slack with a few integrations was a very compelling argument

25:59.320 --> 26:04.740
against oh well IRC and I have to write some Python to make my own bot or go and find a

26:04.740 --> 26:09.440
bot that someone's made and create a new IRC account and all that nonsense.

26:09.440 --> 26:12.760
I could totally see why that's more compelling.

26:12.760 --> 26:16.760
So the whole reason we're really talking about IRC and the reason that Popeys on the show

26:16.760 --> 26:22.440
today is he reached out to me a few days ago about something he's just put into a snap

26:22.440 --> 26:23.440
is that right?

26:23.440 --> 26:26.360
Yeah it's actually been a snap for a while but we've improved it.

26:26.360 --> 26:32.560
It's an IRC client shall we say but it's a web front end so you can effectively think

26:32.560 --> 26:41.120
of it as self-hosted IRC cloud so you install it it's called the lounge and it's a fork

26:41.120 --> 26:44.940
of a previous project that was called Shout IRC.

26:44.940 --> 26:50.960
You install the lounge on your own machine you create an account for every user who's

26:50.960 --> 26:57.900
going to use it so multiple users can use that IRC client and then you just point your

26:57.900 --> 26:59.560
web browser at it and log in.

26:59.560 --> 27:05.520
Once you've logged in you can then sign into all your different IRC networks and the connection

27:05.520 --> 27:13.400
is then maintained from that the lounge server to all of those IRC networks and so you don't

27:13.400 --> 27:18.700
have to run any client anywhere because the lounge is the client and all you need to do

27:18.700 --> 27:24.120
is point a web browser at it and you're an IRC and you can point a web browser at it

27:24.120 --> 27:28.920
from anywhere like from your desktop or from your phone.

27:28.920 --> 27:36.080
So I have a Chrome window on my my desktop but it could just as easily be Firefox or

27:36.080 --> 27:42.240
any other browser and that window points to my lounge server which is connected to all

27:42.240 --> 27:49.160
my IRC but then I also have a similar browser window on my phone which points to exactly

27:49.160 --> 27:54.560
the same URL and connects to all the same IRC channels.

27:54.560 --> 28:00.640
So I can be on exactly the same IRC channels on my phone in a browser with the rich content

28:00.640 --> 28:04.760
that you see with you know images showing up and stuff like that that you would see

28:04.760 --> 28:10.200
in something like IRC cloud or you know other modern chat systems.

28:10.200 --> 28:14.960
It's made a real change to me because I'm now self-hosting my own IRC client again instead

28:14.960 --> 28:22.720
of relying on IRC cloud but also I can access it from anywhere on the phone and the desktop.

28:22.720 --> 28:28.600
That's great I like that a lot and it's something that the Linux server team containerized quite

28:28.600 --> 28:33.440
some time ago so you can get it in a container as well if that's more up your street.

28:33.440 --> 28:37.600
It looks like the UI is really sharp too it probably is I would even say competitive with

28:37.600 --> 28:39.960
IRC cloud do would you agree having used it?

28:39.960 --> 28:45.400
Yeah I went through a process last week of disconnecting from all my IRC networks in

28:45.400 --> 28:49.540
IRC cloud and closing it and now I only use the lounge.

28:49.540 --> 28:55.320
The thing that I love about it is because it's self-hosted I feel a lot more safe it's

28:55.320 --> 29:01.300
logging everything on my own server and a change that we made last week to the snap

29:01.300 --> 29:07.620
because we've got it published in the snap store we integrated certbot into the snap

29:07.620 --> 29:13.840
so now once you've installed the lounge you can then put an SSL cert on it with one line

29:13.840 --> 29:18.400
and then it puts a cron job on your system automatically and it will just keep refreshing

29:18.400 --> 29:25.220
that SSL cert so I've now got SSL between me and my lounge server whether I'm on my

29:25.220 --> 29:30.360
phone or I'm on the desktop and then from my lounge server to my IRC networks I've got

29:30.360 --> 29:34.680
an SSL connection there as well so I feel a lot happier.

29:34.680 --> 29:38.120
I always had this nagging thing in the back of my head that I was there's nothing wrong

29:38.120 --> 29:44.300
with IRC cloud it's great but all my IRC logs are hosted on IRC cloud and there was that

29:44.300 --> 29:48.520
little twinge in the back that I just thought I don't like this.

29:48.520 --> 29:53.040
You're kind of losing one of the best things about IRC by doing it on IRC cloud and I do

29:53.040 --> 29:57.160
it out of convenience but I think of this weekend I'm gonna make the switch to this

29:57.160 --> 30:01.680
this looks so so nice do you happen to recall what the database back in that it's storing

30:01.680 --> 30:02.760
all of this in?

30:02.760 --> 30:09.120
The logs are free text stored on your file system I love that it also does push notifications

30:09.120 --> 30:13.560
because it's in a browser I just press the button to say enable push notifications and

30:13.560 --> 30:19.120
now on my phone I get notifications when people mention me on IRC I click on them and it takes

30:19.120 --> 30:23.480
me straight into the browser window it feels like an app you know it's it's just a browser

30:23.480 --> 30:28.220
window just like all the cool kids use these days.

30:28.220 --> 30:32.360
It's so nice to see something like this that you can host yourself ah I love this kind

30:32.360 --> 30:36.720
of stuff Poppy I love it the lounge we'll have a link in the show notes of course I

30:36.720 --> 30:42.160
don't know if I'll switch from my beloved causal droid but we'll see I'm gonna I'm gonna

30:42.160 --> 30:44.160
try that and spin it up at least.

30:44.160 --> 30:51.680
People who use IRC who have used it for years are often totally wedded to the solution they've

30:51.680 --> 30:58.800
got like IRC for me I don't care what IRC client anyone else uses this is God's own

30:58.800 --> 31:04.480
IRC client and you will never make me move from it right but you'll hear people just

31:04.480 --> 31:10.360
as passionate about Quossel or any of the others the guys in France at Canonical have

31:10.360 --> 31:14.400
their favorite IRC client and that all the guys in France seem to use the same one and

31:14.400 --> 31:18.580
all the guys in the UK all seems to use IRC I don't know why whether the translations

31:18.580 --> 31:22.520
are better or different or what I don't know but people are super passionate about their

31:22.520 --> 31:28.640
IRC client which is a thing you never get with slack because there are no really first

31:28.640 --> 31:34.640
class alternative clients for it it's just not a thing you just don't have that choice

31:34.640 --> 31:40.680
right yeah it's very true that's a good point so Chris I have a question for you yes sir

31:40.680 --> 31:47.340
why are you in your dressing gown oh outing me like this on the show the furnace is broken

31:47.340 --> 31:53.480
in the studio and I'm doing a podcast when it's 30 degrees outside so I figured you know

31:53.480 --> 31:59.500
I'd get comfortable and put my robe on so the furnace broke in your RV and the studio

31:59.500 --> 32:03.600
in the same week well the furnace in the studio has been going out for the last couple of

32:03.600 --> 32:07.560
years and it was just this winter that it kind of gave the ghost out you know just like

32:07.560 --> 32:13.760
some sort of like final thing happened and it's just falling apart it works but it only

32:13.760 --> 32:19.020
it only heats the upstairs so like 50% of the studio is livable good job heat rises

32:19.020 --> 32:26.920
hey I know but when I do get it fixed I'm gonna need somewhere to document the fix Alex

32:26.920 --> 32:33.960
do we have perhaps a wiki the self-hosted wiki is in full flow we have a group now with

32:33.960 --> 32:40.920
about 15 or 16 people already since the last episode who have started contributing their

32:40.920 --> 32:45.860
free time chatting all day every day about what you know different technology stacks

32:45.860 --> 32:52.160
to use for now we're using mkdocs but we are trying to decide whether to use that platform

32:52.160 --> 32:58.360
or another one called Hugo which is a static site generator that might have some more customization

32:58.360 --> 33:03.560
when it comes to theming but we're early enough in the process that what we're really looking

33:03.560 --> 33:11.080
for right now is good solid content and we're not trying to reproduce stuff that's already

33:11.080 --> 33:14.640
out there on the internet you know we don't want to provide a list of self-hosted apps

33:14.640 --> 33:20.920
because the awesome self-hosted list already does that what we're looking to do is actually

33:20.920 --> 33:26.760
provide you know code snippets docker compose for example snippets of maybe the lounge or

33:26.760 --> 33:32.080
causal like we talked about on this episode just to help people break down that barrier

33:32.080 --> 33:38.000
of entry of self-hosting some of this stuff you know I flashed some tasmota devices the

33:38.000 --> 33:42.720
other week so I'm in the middle of writing up a little page to go on there about tasmota

33:42.720 --> 33:47.700
and what it is and why you might like it but also we'll link back to the particular episodes

33:47.700 --> 33:52.260
in which we talk about certain stuff as well so one of the things I quite often get is

33:52.260 --> 33:56.020
oh which episode did you talk about cameras I don't want to go through the show notes

33:56.020 --> 34:02.440
one by one but if I can search it in the wiki and find the episode that way that's one of

34:02.440 --> 34:05.880
the problems we're trying to solve with this wiki but I've been delighted with the response

34:05.880 --> 34:10.720
I must have had 30 or 40 different emails or telegram messages from people just in this

34:10.720 --> 34:17.040
last few days alone so if you want to be part of it you can go to wiki.selfhosted.show which

34:17.040 --> 34:22.840
will take you to the github pages hosted site we are going to host it ourselves but for

34:22.840 --> 34:29.940
now it's on github pages and be part of it help us choose the tech stack choose what

34:29.940 --> 34:34.200
content goes in there and what the different directory structures and layout and all that

34:34.200 --> 34:39.060
kind of stuff looks like it's going to be a crowdsourced thing so if you want to have

34:39.060 --> 34:44.560
input now is the time I'm really happy to see people that are getting involved with

34:44.560 --> 34:48.800
this it's like really that telegram groups almost too much at this point for me this

34:48.800 --> 34:54.840
is completely throwing me I've got my own wiki on like poppy.com it's just a docu wiki

34:54.840 --> 35:01.320
that I use for keeping some notes but I've also been using Hugo for another project and

35:01.320 --> 35:07.160
now you've mentioned it I'm thinking why don't I just replace my wiki with a Hugo instance

35:07.160 --> 35:12.520
and then I could do it all nicely in markdown I can just use standard git tools to commit

35:12.520 --> 35:18.880
my changes and then automate pushing it live such a good idea use github issues and pull

35:18.880 --> 35:23.960
requests and all that kind of stuff no I just commit to master because it's my it's my wiki

35:23.960 --> 35:28.480
I could do what the hell I want what was it you called me earlier a leet hacker hardcore

35:28.480 --> 35:34.680
leet hacker yeah that must be you now yeah so you're loving Hugo huh oh yeah there's

35:34.680 --> 35:41.240
a theme I'm using on one of my sites I think it's called paper and it automatically changes

35:41.240 --> 35:47.560
light to dark throughout the day so when I refresh the browser if I if it's in the evening

35:47.560 --> 35:51.980
I know it's the evening because the browser just all dims nicely it's really really nice

35:51.980 --> 35:56.480
that is slick don't look out the window and see what the light level is no just look at

35:56.480 --> 36:03.080
your browser yeah who needs it we can automate that my blind is closed I can't see outside

36:03.080 --> 36:11.560
I never never do that so how will the self-hosted podcast end up self-hosting it's self-hosted

36:11.560 --> 36:16.240
wiki stay tuned and find out but in the meantime wiki dot self-hosted dot show if you want

36:16.240 --> 36:20.600
to get involved I guess we kind of need to get a sense of what the interest is to kind

36:20.600 --> 36:23.520
of get an idea of what the traffic's going to be to then decide how we're going to host

36:23.520 --> 36:29.200
it so that's the phase we're in right now it's looking really great though so that's

36:29.200 --> 36:34.480
super neat that's really cool so pope where should people go to find more of you throughout

36:34.480 --> 36:41.640
the week oh gosh well they can go to my wiki I have a contact page but that might be moving

36:41.640 --> 36:48.040
can they find your last will and testament there I had a very funny email actually from

36:48.040 --> 36:54.760
a gentleman who was it no it was on Twitter honey I need to set up a wiki yep that was

36:54.760 --> 36:59.480
great that was very funny Twitter exchange but yes we need to have a morbid conversation

36:59.480 --> 37:05.080
in case something ever happens to me we need a wiki darling yes of course pope you're on

37:05.080 --> 37:10.980
user error which is one of my favorite podcasts yes absolutely oh thank you yes it's lovely

37:10.980 --> 37:17.880
having a an argument with Dan and Joe about all kinds of random stuff we enjoy hearing

37:17.880 --> 37:24.960
the audience questions and trying to answer them so if people have questions for us just

37:24.960 --> 37:30.440
ping us in the JB telegram with hashtag ask error or on Twitter or anywhere we'll probably

37:30.440 --> 37:35.240
spot it I am delighted by how often you are voicing exactly what is in my head even you

37:35.240 --> 37:39.400
are all the way across the pond all the way over there that's worrying it is a bit actually

37:39.400 --> 37:46.020
isn't it it's really quite something you really often echo my thoughts on very many topics

37:46.020 --> 37:49.680
but you deliver them better than I would so it really it is one of my favorite shows as

37:49.680 --> 37:53.640
well and of course rumor has it the Ubuntu podcast may be coming back soon so of course

37:53.640 --> 38:00.200
Ubuntu podcasts it's more than a rumor we're recording first episode of season 13 next

38:00.200 --> 38:07.920
week as we record this boom oh announcing season 13 on ssh 13 I like it right there yes

38:07.920 --> 38:16.640
very nice very nice well thank you Poppy for making it thanks for having me on
