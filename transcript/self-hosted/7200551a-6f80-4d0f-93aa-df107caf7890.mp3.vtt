WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.680
Now, I know you're going to give me a really hard time about this, but I actually had to...

00:03.680 --> 00:10.160
I ran out of fingers counting how many golfs I've bought. Yes, I bought another VW Golf.

00:10.160 --> 00:14.640
Okay, so first of all, you do have 10 fingers, so that means it's more than 10 golfs.

00:14.640 --> 00:17.040
Oh, no, okay, I think it's one hand. Let's go with that.

00:17.760 --> 00:22.880
Okay, although I wouldn't be surprised, actually, if you told me it was 10 golfs, I could see it.

00:22.880 --> 00:26.240
You know what I'm just the most upset about is that I didn't take a bet on this.

00:26.240 --> 00:31.040
So that for the listeners that don't know, Alex is a golf enthusiast, you know, Volkswagen Golf

00:31.040 --> 00:36.320
enthusiast. I own one too. We've been golf buddies for a long time. But when the prices

00:36.320 --> 00:40.800
on used vehicles got crazy, Alex did the financially smart thing and sold his golf back.

00:40.800 --> 00:45.120
I did. I mean, that one was a lease. So in fairness to me, like I got out of the lease

00:45.120 --> 00:49.520
basically for free. I had a free car for two, three years, two and a half years or so.

00:49.520 --> 00:52.080
That's not bad, but it ate at you, didn't it? You missed it.

00:52.080 --> 00:57.840
I really missed it. I mean, so I've been test driving vehicles for months now. It started off

00:57.840 --> 01:03.440
when I test drove a Toyota Tundra about three or four months ago. I've driven an F150. I've driven,

01:03.440 --> 01:11.520
I drove a BMW M3 and F80. That thing was amazing, but it was like $70,000. I also drove a Porsche

01:11.520 --> 01:22.240
911 from 2012 and that was $80,000. That's getting a bit rich. You know, that's a lot of money for a

01:22.240 --> 01:29.280
car. And the Golf just fits in that beautiful 40 ish sweet spot. Even, you know, in the current

01:29.280 --> 01:35.040
market, that's stupid money. I know, but it just sits in that beautiful price that I'm willing to

01:35.040 --> 01:40.720
stomach sweet spot, you know? Were you shocked when you filled it up and how much gas has gotten

01:40.720 --> 01:43.920
since the last time you, how expensive it's gotten since the last time you filled it?

01:43.920 --> 01:48.720
Yeah, I mean, it's about a buck, a gallon more or so. It's more expensive.

01:48.720 --> 01:52.960
What I want to know is how tempted were you by the F150? I mean, I'm just trying to picture you

01:52.960 --> 01:56.560
as an F150 driver. Very, yeah. But yeah, I could see it.

01:57.840 --> 02:03.760
Live feedback in the chat room. You seeing this? How many Golfs? Someone screenshot it by YouTube

02:03.760 --> 02:08.000
face. Uh-oh. Yeah, they're getting your YouTube thumbnails ready.

02:08.000 --> 02:12.560
So let me break it down for the audience, right? I mean, I'm very interested in the F150 Lightning.

02:12.560 --> 02:16.960
I will just set it up front, but I don't think the availability is going to be there for two,

02:16.960 --> 02:20.240
three, four years. The electric charging infrastructure isn't going to be there for

02:20.240 --> 02:25.120
a similar length of time, at least. So I will keep that one on the back burner. And for now,

02:25.120 --> 02:30.720
I've got my old Chevy pickup, which will do double duty just fine as like a going to the

02:30.720 --> 02:33.040
dump with boxes in the backside kind of thing.

02:33.040 --> 02:35.360
Like a rock.

02:35.360 --> 02:43.840
Rock. So this is Golf Number 6. I bought the exact, and I do mean identically,

02:43.840 --> 02:48.160
spec'd. The exact same Golf R that I had a year ago.

02:48.160 --> 02:51.760
Amazing. I mean, I know you loved it, so it makes some sense.

02:51.760 --> 02:58.640
I did love it, yeah. It's a 2019 Mark 7.5 Golf R in lapis blue with the English town wheels.

02:58.640 --> 03:03.440
Now we're just trying to figure out when somehow... Alex and I geographically are very far apart,

03:03.440 --> 03:09.360
about 4,000 miles of driving. So we want to go driving. We would love to go driving.

03:09.360 --> 03:13.760
We do, yeah. So this one only had 6,000, well, 5,000 miles on it when I bought it.

03:13.760 --> 03:16.320
Well, put a few more on there and drive up here. What's the big deal?

03:16.320 --> 03:20.960
No, but this is the thing. I've got a low mileage example. I'd like to keep it that way.

03:20.960 --> 03:25.920
So I was looking into shipping the car over to you for Linux Fest Northwest next year.

03:25.920 --> 03:32.000
Ah, here we go. Maybe we could do some canyon carving together up in the old cascades.

03:32.000 --> 03:36.560
That'd be pretty great. You know, I'd always be down. Just a few roads I'd take you on.

03:36.560 --> 03:42.800
So I'll just be very brief. But Golf No. 5 was another Golf R. Golf No. 4 was the one that I

03:42.800 --> 03:46.640
bought when I emigrated here, which was a red GTI, which is the one that you rode in.

03:47.360 --> 03:52.880
No. 3 was a black GTI that I had in England, which is a Mark 7, 2016.

03:52.880 --> 04:00.560
I had one of the Dieselgate 2-liter diesel Mark 6 Golfs. My very first one, though,

04:00.560 --> 04:09.040
was a 1.6 petrol T-Redge from 1997. That was my first Golf, and I loved that thing. It was so great.

04:09.040 --> 04:13.680
Well, what you could do is if you could get all of them again, you could just sort of stack them

04:13.680 --> 04:18.080
end to end and build a bridge over to the UK for your upcoming meetup in August.

04:18.080 --> 04:22.320
I could, yeah. Before I segue into that, though, I'm just going to say, I do want to buy one more.

04:22.320 --> 04:23.600
There's such a good segue, though.

04:23.600 --> 04:24.640
I know.

04:24.640 --> 04:26.480
All right. Okay. All right. We'll let it go.

04:27.200 --> 04:34.400
I want to buy one more Golf, and that is the Mark 4. The Mark 4 R32 in that beautiful blue color.

04:34.400 --> 04:40.320
You know the one. You know the one. It's got the VR6 engine in it, so it sounds like a Wookiee

04:40.320 --> 04:41.280
when it goes.

04:41.280 --> 04:44.160
I think also my son, Dylan, that's... He wants that to be his first car.

04:44.160 --> 04:48.480
He's been looking. He's already looking. Can you believe that? It's a beautiful car.

04:48.480 --> 04:54.320
You went down there. Yeah, you claimed your prize again. You found your one true car love,

04:54.320 --> 04:57.440
and then you drove it home. It's kind of a romantic story in a way.

04:57.440 --> 05:02.800
I had to go to Tampa to get it, but, you know, Tampa's weird. I'll just say that up front, Mike.

05:03.360 --> 05:07.360
No disrespect to anybody that lives there, but, you know, some of the people that spoke to me were

05:08.400 --> 05:08.960
peculiar.

05:08.960 --> 05:14.480
All right. Shall I take you up on your Segway offer now?

05:14.480 --> 05:16.160
Yeah, yeah. I still offer it up.

05:16.160 --> 05:22.400
UK Meetup is still provisionally happening. However, over the weekend, American Airlines

05:22.400 --> 05:28.560
emailed me to say, Hey, Mr. Kretschmar, we've changed your flight. Good news. It's earlier.

05:28.560 --> 05:33.760
And I'm like, that's not good news, because what we planned was to do the meetup on the Saturday

05:33.760 --> 05:38.640
and then fly home immediately on the Sunday so that, you know, if we got sick or anything like

05:38.640 --> 05:43.680
that, there'd be no problems with re-entry or anything like that. So I don't really want to

05:43.680 --> 05:47.760
compromise on that by having the meetup, you know, a week earlier or anything like that,

05:47.760 --> 05:52.480
you know, for obvious reasons. I don't want to be stuck in the UK. That would just be horrendous.

05:52.480 --> 05:57.920
Who could put up with that? So what I'm thinking at this point is we'll probably end up moving it

05:57.920 --> 06:03.520
to the Friday night. So that'll be Friday night, and then we'll be flying back to the UK on Sunday.

06:03.520 --> 06:08.160
Friday the 5th of August. I would implore you to keep an eye on the meetup page,

06:08.160 --> 06:14.560
meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting for all the details as they happen in real time,

06:14.560 --> 06:18.640
you know, venue dates, all that kind of stuff. It's all still up in the air right now. So please

06:18.640 --> 06:23.840
don't book anything until we say it's confirmed. Yeah. So keep an eye out there if you are planning

06:23.840 --> 06:27.600
to attend, because there will be an update soon as Alex gets everything sorted out.

06:29.040 --> 06:32.400
Sorry to hear that, man. It's happening to a lot of people right now with the travel stuff. It's

06:32.400 --> 06:37.520
just sort of the situation I think the airlines are in. Yeah, it's a problem with Raleigh as an

06:37.520 --> 06:45.520
airport, I think, because it only gets one direct flight a day. And if for any reason that flight,

06:45.520 --> 06:50.240
you know, the equipment's not available or crews, and it's a bit far out to be worrying about that.

06:50.240 --> 06:54.160
I would have thought if you're American, but I guess not. Thank you for the update,

06:54.160 --> 06:58.400
even if it is sort of it's the good news is the meetup goes on. It's just the date's going to

06:58.400 --> 07:02.320
have to adjust and the location will likely have to adjust. All right. Well, let's shift gears.

07:02.320 --> 07:06.720
We've talked before about this trend of small command line utilities becoming web apps,

07:06.720 --> 07:12.480
and we've covered scrutiny back in what was it, Alex? 28 ish? Episode 28. Yeah. All right. Give

07:12.480 --> 07:18.160
us an update, sir. Well, those of you that remember that far back, episode 28, we talked

07:18.160 --> 07:24.080
about a hard drive monitoring utility called Scrutiny. The developer Analog J was talking

07:24.080 --> 07:28.160
about GitHub sponsors at the time and how if he got enough, he was going to open source it.

07:28.160 --> 07:33.040
That happened, and so he open sourced the project. Great. Some time has elapsed since then,

07:33.040 --> 07:41.200
and he has just released a new big update, version 0.4. It looks really good too. You wouldn't think

07:41.200 --> 07:46.880
there's so much to get out of a tool like this, but if you have a setup with several disks in it,

07:46.880 --> 07:52.000
like we have three servers here at the studio that have a ton of disks in them, this is really handy.

07:52.000 --> 07:57.840
It is actually. One of the things I love about open source is how people like this developer

07:57.840 --> 08:03.520
show up in our Discord and say, hey guys, I'm doing a beta test on this new feature. Can I

08:03.520 --> 08:08.640
have some people to just try this out for me? He was actually in our storage channel talking to

08:08.640 --> 08:13.440
people in the Discord for the last week or two ahead of this release. What he's done is he's

08:13.440 --> 08:20.400
added InfluxDB support, which has lots of really nice features. The biggest of which is that it

08:20.400 --> 08:25.920
now has automatic data down sampling support. What that means in English is rather than having

08:25.920 --> 08:32.240
minute by minute updates of your hard drive stats for 10 years, which am I going to look at minute

08:32.240 --> 08:39.120
by minute stats of my hard drives five years ago? No, probably not. With the data down sampling,

08:39.120 --> 08:44.240
he can significantly reduce the size of the databases and obviously that then increases

08:44.240 --> 08:49.440
performance and everything else that goes with it. One of my other favorite features in this release

08:49.440 --> 08:55.040
is he has made the thresholds that he's using against the Backblaze database, which is what's

08:55.040 --> 09:00.240
underpinning his failure thresholds, he's made those thresholds tweakable. If you see a parameter

09:00.240 --> 09:06.240
in there that you think, yeah, that says failed, but actually I trust that particular parameter,

09:06.240 --> 09:12.160
whatever it might be. CRC cable errors, for example, might trigger a failure in scrutiny

09:12.160 --> 09:15.200
that actually I know was just a bad cable that I've swapped out.

09:15.200 --> 09:19.440
That's slick. It's such a great use of that Backblaze data as well to give you a baseline

09:19.440 --> 09:25.840
to know are these numbers, are these normal or is this a problem? That's pretty great.

09:25.840 --> 09:28.640
Will you get that loaded on our servers here? I mean, come on.

09:28.640 --> 09:32.400
Yeah, I mean, I should do. I actually gave him some feedback about the app and how

09:32.400 --> 09:37.280
drives were identifying themselves. He was using dev slash SDA as the main identifier.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.920
And those of you that have worked with Linux servers for any time know that SDA is not a

09:41.920 --> 09:47.920
guaranteed, you know, that drive could tomorrow when it reboots be SDB or SDQ or whatever it

09:47.920 --> 09:53.200
might be. And so he's actually enabled a bunch of other features as well around disk identification

09:53.200 --> 09:57.840
via label and a bunch of other features, too. So it's a great release. Go and check it over at

09:57.840 --> 10:03.040
GitHub dot com slash analog J slash scrutiny. There'll be a link to that in the show notes.

10:03.040 --> 10:09.520
Indeeds at self hosted dot show slash 72. Well, I think this next I hate to call it app because

10:09.520 --> 10:14.320
it's much more than that. But this next find of yours is going to be one that'll be hit with my

10:14.320 --> 10:19.760
kids. It's called Cartridge. It's a self hosted game library. It's really targeted at folks like

10:19.760 --> 10:25.280
me who have a ridiculous amount of classic roms because I guess I just can't really go beyond the

10:25.280 --> 10:30.320
old games. I don't know. I just still love old retro games so much. I was thinking how perfect

10:30.320 --> 10:37.680
this would be for anybody that's got a steam deck or any kind of gaming handheld. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

10:37.680 --> 10:44.000
So essentially what this thing is, it's a self hosted game library for roms. Read only media.

10:44.000 --> 10:49.680
That's what it stands for, right? In the old days, read only. Yeah, read only memory. Oh,

10:49.680 --> 10:56.000
yeah, probably that. Right now it's quite basic. It's still in its early stages, version 0.1. But

10:56.000 --> 11:00.480
on the roadmap, there's some really interesting features, which I thought we should mention on

11:00.480 --> 11:07.280
the show. So for now, you can scan for rom files and match it with an IGDB game information database.

11:08.000 --> 11:13.440
And you can serve rom download links alongside those game details. But the things that are

11:13.440 --> 11:18.880
coming that actually have me really interested are user creation. So you'd be able to manage

11:18.880 --> 11:22.960
access to games for your kids and say, right, you're not allowed to play Sonic the Hedgehog.

11:22.960 --> 11:29.840
It's too risque. Or users can request games a bit like, you know, Plex requests or what's it called

11:29.840 --> 11:36.880
OMBi, I think these days. But here's the coolest one. He's planning to add support to play select

11:36.880 --> 11:42.400
roms in the browser using JavaScript emulators. That really would make it perfect on the deck

11:42.400 --> 11:46.880
because you got a web browser on the deck. It's just a nice way to display your roms too.

11:46.880 --> 11:52.320
There's that element of it that I think I like is for me, they're all just in a folder that just

11:52.320 --> 11:56.160
sits on my file server. There's nothing really flashy about it. There's no like front end like

11:56.160 --> 12:01.120
I have with my movies and my TV shows. You know, there's no way for the kids really to kind of

12:01.120 --> 12:05.360
review them and select them. It's sort of like dad sets them up with one and lets them go for a

12:05.360 --> 12:10.480
while. So if you're interested in that kind of, you know, retro gaming scene, go and go and check

12:10.480 --> 12:15.760
that out. There'll be a link in the show notes. The app is called cartridge. Now you were checking

12:15.760 --> 12:22.160
out a self-hosted bookmark management tool called service. Yes, I was. And this is something that I

12:22.160 --> 12:27.520
use a lot in my workflow. I find a story, I'm reading a story and I want to capture it while

12:27.520 --> 12:31.840
I'm on the go or something like that. And I want to save it in a bookmark manager. I don't use

12:31.840 --> 12:37.760
bookmarks a lot in my web browser, but I do use bookmarks a lot with services that will capture

12:37.760 --> 12:42.560
the URL and tag them and generate feeds around them. And then on top of that, I even have tooling

12:42.560 --> 12:48.640
internally that will send them, depending on how I tag a link to different channels for different

12:48.640 --> 12:56.240
show production purposes. So a self-hosted bookmark manager has been on my radar for a long time.

12:56.800 --> 13:02.240
And this is one that I think has a lot of potential. It's super easy to get up and going.

13:02.240 --> 13:07.200
They make a Docker image available. They've got an example Docker compose that you replace a few

13:07.200 --> 13:11.440
variables. The application also creates an environment variable folder and a file where

13:11.440 --> 13:15.760
you can go in there and set some environment variables if you need to. The idea is it's a

13:15.760 --> 13:21.600
self-hosted bookmark manager that lets you organize bookmarks with tags, group them together. And then

13:21.600 --> 13:27.280
it also has a really cool command line palette. So you can find them, search through them,

13:27.920 --> 13:31.760
get at them really quickly. This is, it sounds like something you wouldn't need very often, but

13:31.760 --> 13:37.200
sometimes we're two weeks down the road after a story came out and we remember, wasn't there a

13:37.200 --> 13:41.520
story about such and such? It's great for that kind of thing. I mean, I'm curious to know what

13:41.520 --> 13:46.480
your workflow actually is because I do a bunch of, you know, collation, you know, into two weeks in

13:46.480 --> 13:52.240
between each episode. You know, like on Reddit, for example, I'll upvote something or I'll star

13:52.240 --> 13:56.640
it or save it. And then I'll go through and look at the things that I've saved in between, you know,

13:56.640 --> 14:00.880
when we're creating a show doc, for example. I would love it if I could have some way of scraping

14:00.880 --> 14:06.720
those saved Reddit things into a bookmark manager or some description, but also have a way of saving

14:06.720 --> 14:11.280
things outside of Reddit on mobile. Cause that's where I discover, you know, that's where I doom

14:11.280 --> 14:17.360
scroll. Yes, same. Absolutely. I mean, if that is the number one requirement for this workflow for

14:17.360 --> 14:22.640
me. So I have not gotten that far to test this because as I was registering and setting it up,

14:22.640 --> 14:26.560
I started getting server 500 errors and then it was time to do the show and I never got it working

14:26.560 --> 14:30.880
after that. So I don't know what the mobile workflow is, but what I use today, and this is what

14:30.880 --> 14:38.240
this will have to do is I use pinboard and there's apps that you can install on the share sheet. So,

14:38.240 --> 14:43.920
you know, I'm looking at a story on Reddit or I'm in a news reader or I'm on a webpage. Every

14:43.920 --> 14:48.800
application on mobile lets you share the URL. And so you got to have something that works with that.

14:48.800 --> 14:54.400
So right now what I do is I share, send it to pinboard. A lot of times it just auto generates

14:54.400 --> 14:58.480
the title, but sometimes I put a title in and then I give it a tag. So like for this show,

14:58.480 --> 15:04.080
it's SSH, you know, for Linux action news, it's LAN pinboard generates RSS feeds for each one of

15:04.080 --> 15:10.080
those tags. So then I bring that into my feed reader. So I have meta feeds essentially in my

15:10.080 --> 15:14.160
RSS feed reader for each of the shows where I have every link from across every service that I've

15:14.160 --> 15:19.040
collected. So when it's time to sit down and prepare a show doc, I bring up my feed reader,

15:19.040 --> 15:24.320
I bring up my feed reader, I go to self hosted, I've got, you know, Reddit links, I've got emails,

15:24.320 --> 15:27.840
because when an email comes in, I might throw it in our pay stock. And then I'll pinboard that as

15:27.840 --> 15:31.520
well. So I can grab that and I just have it all right there in one list. And so that's what I'd

15:31.520 --> 15:35.520
like to replace with this. That's the way to do it. Yeah, that sounds like a pretty good workflow.

15:35.520 --> 15:40.480
Pinboard you say? Now that is a service I don't mind supporting because it's an independent

15:40.480 --> 15:45.600
developer. You know, he built up his own infrastructure and he kind of created it after

15:45.600 --> 15:49.680
I think it was like Delicious. There was a bookmarking service called Delicious. They

15:49.680 --> 15:54.000
got a whole bunch of people on board and then one day they're like, all right, well, so long. Thanks

15:54.000 --> 15:58.400
for all the fish. See you later, everybody. And we were all just left holding the bag being like,

15:58.400 --> 16:04.960
well, what do we do now? And so this developer came along and said, I'll build something. I

16:04.960 --> 16:09.040
became a user immediately. So I have like some sweetheart price that I pay for it.

16:09.040 --> 16:14.560
That sounds pretty nice. Now a bit of real time feedback in the Discord. Someone has just linked

16:14.560 --> 16:21.280
something called dogsheep.github.io. And this thing looks pretty cool. So it builds itself

16:21.280 --> 16:27.920
as a collection of tools for personal analytics using SQL Lite and Dataset. And it looks like

16:27.920 --> 16:33.440
essentially this thing scrapes all of your cloud services. So Twitter, HealthKit, Google,

16:33.440 --> 16:39.600
GitHub, Hacker News, et cetera, and then puts it all into a central SQLite database.

16:39.600 --> 16:42.160
Wow. I've never even heard of a dog sheep, huh?

16:42.160 --> 16:45.680
Yeah, I thought it was going to be something else for a second, but no dog sheep people.

16:45.680 --> 16:49.600
It's not rude. All right. We'll put a link to this in the notes. I haven't tried it,

16:49.600 --> 16:55.120
but this looks pretty cool. This is like a meta collector. Yeah, I definitely want to get all

16:55.120 --> 16:59.600
this on my own storage and that kind of stuff. That's big. Well, if you want somewhere to host

16:59.600 --> 17:07.680
it, you know where we could send people, right? linode.com slash SSH. Go there to get $100 for

17:07.680 --> 17:12.320
60 days on a new account. And you go there to support this here show. Linode is where we build

17:12.320 --> 17:16.880
anything that we're going to deploy in the cloud, especially anything that our listeners are going

17:16.880 --> 17:22.480
to bang on. Or like if we've got a project or today we're live streaming on our own self-hosted

17:22.480 --> 17:27.920
PeerTube instance. Yeah, that runs on Linode. And actually the way I do that is pretty crazy.

17:28.480 --> 17:32.640
Pretty complicated. I'll get into that because we decided to use NixOS on Linode. I'll get into

17:32.640 --> 17:37.360
that another time. But the actual deployment of PeerTube itself, that's really just a bunch

17:37.360 --> 17:41.920
of Docker compose stuff. You got to set a few environment variables for that as well.

17:41.920 --> 17:45.200
And then you can get up and going. And there's even simpler deployments on Linode. They've got

17:45.200 --> 17:49.680
one-click applications and what they call their marketplace. And that lets you deploy an entire

17:49.680 --> 17:54.560
stack of like GitLab or Jitsi if you want to replace Zoom. Tons. I mean, I could go on and

17:54.560 --> 17:58.000
list all of them. They have new stuff they're adding all the time. And they're really super

17:58.000 --> 18:02.560
great about always adding the latest and greatest distributions on there. So in the new Alma Linux

18:02.560 --> 18:06.400
ships, pretty quickly they have it on there, right? So if you want to deploy on CentOS,

18:06.400 --> 18:10.960
they got it over there. Just about any distro you want to deploy on, even Alpine, they got it over

18:10.960 --> 18:14.960
there. And then one of the nice things that we do like with our PeerTube instance and with our

18:14.960 --> 18:22.320
Nextcloud instance is the backing storage is Linode's S3 compatible object storage.

18:22.880 --> 18:27.440
And that's freaking great because now we're not sitting there managing storage all the time.

18:27.440 --> 18:31.440
We're not sitting there worrying about like, you know, is our Nextcloud server going to run

18:31.440 --> 18:37.520
out of disk space, which is how I used to do it. Now we use object storage and that has been such

18:37.520 --> 18:41.600
a game changer for us, especially for something like this. Like, I don't know how large this

18:41.600 --> 18:46.000
file is going to be. I'll put it on object storage and it just lets us grow as we need.

18:46.000 --> 18:51.520
We just maintain that set. It's been dynamite. They've also been rolling out MVME storage

18:51.520 --> 18:55.440
upgrades to some of the rigs that we run. So we just got like a big performance boost.

18:55.440 --> 18:59.040
And there was just a study, you can find it on Linode's Twitter feed. There was just a study

18:59.040 --> 19:05.280
released that compared Linode to all of the other hyperscalers for performance and GPU compute.

19:05.280 --> 19:09.680
And Linode blows them all out of the door, blows them all out. And it's an independent party that

19:09.680 --> 19:13.680
did that. And you can find that on their website. There's performance reasons, there's support

19:13.680 --> 19:18.240
reasons. Plus there's the opportunity to get $100 to support the show, to go deploy something for

19:18.240 --> 19:24.000
yourself or for your business, get $100, kick the tires and try it. With $100, you can really,

19:24.000 --> 19:28.400
really try the feature set. It's like actual real money you can work with to see what the

19:28.400 --> 19:32.320
services like. They wouldn't do that unless they were confident you're going to like it.

19:32.320 --> 19:35.360
Linode makes it simple and affordable and accessible to deploy and manage

19:35.360 --> 19:39.520
your own infrastructure in the cloud. Go to linode.com slash SSH.

19:42.000 --> 19:45.520
Now I see in the chat that we have one of the core developers of Git T

19:46.080 --> 19:50.800
in there today, which is kind of poignant and kind of relevant to the next topic.

19:51.360 --> 19:56.640
I finally, finally got around to diagnosing why my CI broke in February today.

19:56.640 --> 19:58.800
Oh, great. This should be fascinating.

19:58.800 --> 20:02.080
How many months is that? Three? It's been broken?

20:02.080 --> 20:02.960
Oh man.

20:03.840 --> 20:08.240
I mean, okay, so the CI works if I go in and do the build manually. The thing that was broken

20:08.240 --> 20:13.040
was the webhook. It just took me this long to actually be bothered enough to go in and fix it.

20:13.680 --> 20:21.840
So it turns out in version 1.16, Git T introduced a new webhook allowed host list variable.

20:21.840 --> 20:25.280
Written a blog post about it. There'll be a link in the show notes. It's a very simple

20:25.280 --> 20:29.680
one line change in the app.ini file. Once I'd figured it out, and actually gone and

20:29.680 --> 20:34.320
read the logs that told me exactly what the problem was, it was about 10 minutes to go and fix it.

20:35.040 --> 20:39.520
Isn't that funny? Something gets broken, takes months to get to it. And then when you finally

20:39.520 --> 20:44.960
do get to it, it's not that big of a change. But nice. I'm glad to hear you did find this.

20:44.960 --> 20:50.560
I've definitely been there. That may be what ends up happening with my whole Z-Wave conversion with

20:50.560 --> 20:54.560
homo systems. When I finally do pull the trigger, it's like not that bad. And I end up waiting

20:54.560 --> 21:00.800
months before I do it. So I just want to say thanks to 6543, who's in the Discord chat,

21:00.800 --> 21:06.560
in the live chat as we're live streaming. Thanks for all the great work. Git T is a fantastic

21:06.560 --> 21:10.880
Git server. For those of you that haven't used it, go ahead and check it out. It's spelled Git,

21:10.880 --> 21:18.880
G-I-T-E-A, Git T. It looks very similarly themed to GitHub, but it's self-hostable,

21:18.880 --> 21:22.960
and it's a lot more lightweight than GitLab. I just love it. I've run it for years now.

21:22.960 --> 21:28.240
It's a fantastic project. Well, we got a little bit of news in the self-hosted land that's kind

21:28.240 --> 21:34.800
of in my neck of the woods. I'm becoming a bigger and bigger matrix enthusiast. I kind of feel like

21:34.800 --> 21:38.880
the rest of the world hasn't caught on to the fact that it's like the new HTTP protocol and

21:38.880 --> 21:44.720
the new SMT protocol all in one. But I think the folks over at Rocket Chat have figured it out.

21:44.720 --> 21:48.480
Did you see this announcement, Alex? I'm going to answer your question in a second. I totally

21:48.480 --> 21:53.040
thought you were going down the Ron Burgundy route. I'm becoming more and more of kind of a big deal.

21:54.160 --> 21:59.280
I'm bigger and bigger of a matrix kind of guy. I'm a big deal on matrix, Alex.

21:59.280 --> 22:04.240
That's where you went. That's where you went with that. So yeah, there was some really fantastic

22:04.240 --> 22:09.680
news out of the Matrix project today. Well, out of Rocket Chat too, both of them.

22:09.680 --> 22:14.400
So we just wanted to take a moment to welcome Rocket Chat to Matrix. Given the announcement

22:14.400 --> 22:19.280
that they are switching to using Matrix for standards-based interoperable federation,

22:19.280 --> 22:23.680
this is incredible news. Rocket Chat is one of the leading open source collaboration platforms

22:23.680 --> 22:28.800
with over 12 million users. And shortly, they will all have the option to natively

22:28.800 --> 22:36.560
interoperate with the wider Matrix network. This is slick. Rocket Chat is, you could call it a

22:36.560 --> 22:39.920
Slack, open source Slack alternative, just to kind of give you an idea of what it does.

22:39.920 --> 22:46.800
And as most of these platforms, they were facing a demand to federate, to connect with other

22:46.800 --> 22:51.280
instances. And so I got to imagine what happened is they looked at it, they started doing the math

22:51.280 --> 22:54.400
and they said, well, could we just roll this feature out ourselves and interconnect all these

22:54.400 --> 23:01.760
different Rocket Chat instances? And instead of another chat project, creating another set of

23:01.760 --> 23:08.320
standards for another unified federated network, they decided, well, we'll use the Matrix protocols.

23:08.320 --> 23:14.000
And I think this is fantastic because it's going to use the encryption. It's going to mean that if

23:14.000 --> 23:18.320
you have a Matrix compatible client, and there's more and more of them out there, you can chat now

23:18.320 --> 23:23.360
with somebody on Rocket Chat and vice versa. So there's just a lot of benefit, I think, to this.

23:23.360 --> 23:28.480
Plus, it's sort of like when you try to roll your own encryption, you generally don't roll the best

23:28.480 --> 23:31.760
encryption. It's generally pretty unsafe. I think that's probably pretty true with a lot of

23:31.760 --> 23:36.560
communications protocols too. When you roll your own, it tends not to be great, at least for a

23:36.560 --> 23:42.080
while. So if you can instead use something that's an open source standard that's been tested for

23:42.080 --> 23:46.560
years, it's one less thing you have to worry about. It's one less thing you have to be an expert in.

23:46.560 --> 23:50.160
Anyone remember XMPP? Wasn't that supposed to be the future?

23:50.800 --> 23:59.920
I still love XMPP. I still do. There is a low-key movement in podcasting, in the podcasting 2.0

23:59.920 --> 24:08.560
corner, to use XMPP as a back-end real-time comments in podcast apps that would sort of use

24:08.560 --> 24:13.120
XMPP to move it between the various podcast apps on the background. So it may come back

24:13.120 --> 24:16.960
in podcasting. You never know. If you wish hard enough, Alex.

24:16.960 --> 24:22.320
Now, have you ever needed to give anybody access to your server that you weren't completely

24:22.320 --> 24:25.760
comfortable giving them access to, to run a command or something?

24:25.760 --> 24:31.520
Hmm, just that Alan Jude, you know, you put him on one of your boxes, next thing you know, it's a free BSD machine.

24:31.520 --> 24:41.920
That wasn't quite what I meant. What I meant was something like restarting Plex or doing a wake-on-land command or something like that.

24:41.920 --> 24:46.960
Well, I have a project for you if you ever wanted to solve that problem, and it's called Olive Tin.

24:46.960 --> 24:53.520
This project lets you safely give access to commands for less technical people in the web browser.

24:53.520 --> 25:04.880
In the web browser? Yeah, right. So what this does is you configure a bunch of commands under the hood that you want it to execute, and it then displays each command as a different button in its web UI.

25:04.880 --> 25:09.280
Oh, this is slick. Big buttons, too. So it kind of almost like a dashboard, but simplified.

25:09.280 --> 25:14.960
Yeah, be very good and useful for, you know, triggering something. Plex is a good example.

25:14.960 --> 25:21.120
I used to have a Telegram bot that I configured for my family when I was having loads of transcoding issues a couple of years ago.

25:21.120 --> 25:27.280
They would text the Telegram bot and say, you know, slash Plex, and it would restart the Docker container.

25:27.280 --> 25:31.680
But this would be just as good and probably an awful lot easier to set up than a Telegram bot.

25:31.680 --> 25:43.120
Yeah, so essentially it outputs for you a very simple web page with very large buttons, and it looks like you can set like emoticons to add some graphics to it.

25:43.120 --> 25:45.920
I see on the back end, it's just executing some command line script.

25:45.920 --> 25:54.880
I guess it must execute with whatever privileges you're running this application as, so it has to be something that application user has access to.

25:54.880 --> 25:59.360
Well, of course, it runs as Docker or runs in a Docker container.

25:59.360 --> 26:06.320
So, you know, if you want to run commands on the host, you'll have to give it all those various permissions and that kind of thing.

26:06.320 --> 26:13.280
I'll be fine. I just run Docker as root, so I'll be fine. Don't run Docker as root, I kid.

26:13.280 --> 26:20.480
So did you see that Google have done the big 180 on the G Suite legacy edition stuff?

26:20.480 --> 26:25.520
Yeah, they walked this one back. You know, we covered this. We were not very impressed.

26:25.520 --> 26:31.120
And it seems like a lot of people were not very impressed. I'm kind of surprised they walked it back, actually.

26:31.120 --> 26:41.360
Well, what was supposed to happen was by the end of June, June 27th, the G Suite free edition was supposed to be transitioned away to a paid only version.

26:41.360 --> 26:50.320
And it turns out that enough people have either just straight up quit G Suite or have made enough of a stink about it.

26:50.320 --> 26:59.680
Or what I suspect has happened is they didn't actually finish the dev work needed underneath to migrate that number of people to the real paid product.

26:59.680 --> 27:01.840
That could very well be. That's funny.

27:01.840 --> 27:08.240
Yeah, they've now actually just decided to say, well, actually, those of you that did procrastinate for long enough.

27:08.240 --> 27:13.440
Oh, by the way, we're the good guys now. Yeah, isn't this funny how they feel they just, well, we're not going to do it.

27:13.440 --> 27:18.160
They earn points. So it's sort of a win win situation for them. Plus, you know, they can afford it.

27:18.160 --> 27:24.080
But I think we should take it as the warning shot that it should be. I was thinking about this earlier today.

27:24.080 --> 27:28.720
This is one of the reasons why I want to start using PeerTube for some of our video hosting here.

27:28.720 --> 27:36.320
Not only do I like to self host our infrastructure, but as long as we're using YouTube, I have to maintain a Google account.

27:36.320 --> 27:40.160
And I've been thinking, like, how far do I have to go to de-Google?

27:40.160 --> 27:47.520
And it's pretty nuts because on the back end of JB, we're using the Google apps for email, at least in calendaring.

27:47.520 --> 27:52.640
And then for the video publishing, we're using YouTube, which requires a Google account.

27:52.640 --> 28:04.640
And so when you think about how deep that rabbit hole is, these kinds of shifts by large tech companies give some of us an opportunity to reevaluate just how tight in we are.

28:04.640 --> 28:11.760
And I think a lot of people saw their opportunity to break away. Some people aren't as deep in as I am.

28:11.760 --> 28:15.360
And I think they took it as an opportunity to leave. And I think Google saw some bleeding.

28:15.360 --> 28:19.440
So I think it was a bit of they weren't ready to migrate everybody.

28:19.440 --> 28:23.680
And I think they took a big hit and I think people canceled.

28:23.680 --> 28:29.680
If you look at the business model of our sponsor, Talescale, you know, they build in to the business model.

28:29.680 --> 28:41.680
The fact that if you get smart people on board to using your product early, that will have trickle down effects into the enterprise or trickle up, I suppose, more accurately.

28:41.680 --> 28:47.120
You know, you get DevOps engineers using things at home, you get sys admins using things at home.

28:47.120 --> 28:51.040
They'll go into work and be like, hey, let's just use G Suite. It's brilliant.

28:51.040 --> 28:54.880
Yeah, it's just so easy. We don't have to worry about exchange. We don't have to do all this crap.

28:54.880 --> 29:11.680
It just works. And I wonder how much attrition they saw of people in that segment who are savvy enough to go to Fastmail or go to any other self-hosted email solution or, you know, that kind of thing.

29:11.680 --> 29:15.360
I wonder how much attrition they saw. I'd love to know the data. Obviously, we never will.

29:15.360 --> 29:19.760
But I'm sure they didn't lose too much sleep over it, but I bet it was more than they were comfortable with.

29:19.760 --> 29:24.000
I think Fastmail benefited a lot just based on some of the chatter I saw in our community.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.080
It seemed like a lot of that landed for Fastmail.

29:26.080 --> 29:28.080
I moved to Fastmail. It's been great.

29:28.080 --> 29:35.680
But, you know, when you were talking about it, it almost made me feel like there's almost nothing we can do, though, to stop the overall trend.

29:35.680 --> 29:45.280
Because all three of my kids and every one of their friends at school have Chromebooks and they've had them now since kindergarten.

29:45.280 --> 29:52.640
And they've got multiple, they have like a personal Google account and a school Google account and they know how to use all of the Google tools.

29:52.640 --> 29:56.880
And when they need a document editor, the first thing they do is they go to Google Docs now.

29:56.880 --> 30:02.800
They don't launch LibreOffice. He has LibreOffice on his computer. I bet she's never launched it once.

30:02.800 --> 30:04.400
Get them early. Get them young.

30:04.400 --> 30:06.080
Yeah, it's the old Apple technique.

30:06.080 --> 30:09.120
It's smart. I mean, if you were an exec, that's exactly what you'd say.

30:09.120 --> 30:13.200
It'd be like, this is a 20-year strategy, guys, but this is the way to go.

30:13.200 --> 30:16.160
I feel like we're kind of maybe a dying breed.

30:16.160 --> 30:18.080
Definitely. Definitely. I think so.

30:18.080 --> 30:22.960
I mean, I think it's an interesting thing, like self-hosting in general.

30:22.960 --> 30:29.280
I'm well aware that I'm a nerd and I find sitting in front of a computer screen interesting.

30:29.280 --> 30:31.840
There are plenty of people in this world.

30:31.840 --> 30:35.760
The last thing they want to do is spend their weekends on evenings sat in front of a computer screen.

30:35.760 --> 30:39.200
They want to be detailing their car. They want to be doing woodworking.

30:39.200 --> 30:44.640
They want to be walking their dog or whatever it is that you do you find interesting that isn't self-hosting.

30:44.640 --> 30:52.080
And to them, the trade-off of giving up a bit of privacy and all of their data to advertisers is worth that trade-off.

30:52.080 --> 31:02.240
But, you know, those of us who think about these things, good or bad, I would love to de-Googleify, but it's really hard.

31:02.240 --> 31:04.400
I wonder if they do value.

31:04.400 --> 31:07.840
I just saw a survey today. I should have grabbed it for the show.

31:07.840 --> 31:21.440
I just saw a survey go by today that a ginormous percentage of average consumers that were surveyed, something like 85%, said that the trade-off for their privacy was not worth it.

31:21.440 --> 31:28.240
I was shocked. I didn't grab it for the show, but I think it's a lack of options.

31:28.240 --> 31:34.720
I think they care. I think it's in part a lack of time to invest to find the options and the skill set.

31:34.720 --> 31:42.080
Yeah, I mean, you and I have spent 15 years plus building these skills that allow us to run a Linux server.

31:42.080 --> 31:43.520
And it's not a judgment call.

31:43.520 --> 31:47.040
No, not at all. It's not easy either.

31:47.040 --> 31:55.920
Like, you know, if you were to genuinely sit down and try and explain, I'm thinking back to Linux Action Show with Noah's switch to Linux challenge right now.

31:55.920 --> 31:56.800
Right, right.

31:56.800 --> 32:03.280
If you were to walk into Best Buy with an SSD and say to someone, here, go and stick this in your computer.

32:03.280 --> 32:10.960
First of all, how many people would have a computer that could actually take an SSD that isn't soldered onto the motherboard, for example, these days?

32:10.960 --> 32:11.840
I know.

32:11.840 --> 32:18.640
But how many people genuinely would have the first clue what to do next?

32:18.640 --> 32:25.920
And it's such a lot of information that we've learned over, like I say, my whole life.

32:25.920 --> 32:35.280
I built my first computer when I was 13 from parts, and then the first Linux I ran was, I think, Ubuntu 7, whatever that was.

32:35.280 --> 32:51.120
I wonder if this conversation is similar to the conversation that radio enthusiasts had as radios became normalized and car enthusiasts had as cars kind of became sealed up and people didn't do their own oil changes and things like that anymore.

32:51.120 --> 32:54.400
But there's still people that are into that stuff, but it's more of a niche.

32:54.400 --> 33:07.040
And so I feel like it's kind of on us to use this stuff to drive demand and create a market for it, because otherwise, if we don't do it, like literally no one else will.

33:07.040 --> 33:11.040
Well, I mean, the self-hosted subreddit is one of the busiest that I frequent.

33:11.040 --> 33:14.240
So I think self-hosting in general is pretty healthy.

33:14.240 --> 33:29.600
There's lots of people who, you know, don't live in the Western world, for example, that rely on things like this to get around great firewalls and censorship of various different degrees and stuff like that.

33:29.600 --> 33:38.080
You know, it's not just people like you and me who are choosing to reject big tech, for want of a better phrase.

33:38.080 --> 33:43.120
Some people have to to escape governments and, you know, whatever it might be.

33:43.120 --> 33:48.800
So I think there's also the privacy aspect for just a lot of people is becoming more and more even in the West.

33:48.800 --> 33:50.640
I think it's becoming more and more important to them.

33:50.640 --> 33:52.400
It's a bigger and bigger motivator.

33:52.400 --> 33:53.360
I don't think it's the only reason.

33:53.360 --> 33:56.800
I think there's several there's lots of things that drive people into self-hosting.

33:56.800 --> 34:01.200
Sometimes it's like we've said before, you just want to have your own media library and sometimes it's privacy.

34:01.200 --> 34:02.640
Sometimes it's issues with big tech.

34:03.200 --> 34:04.800
It's not going to die, right?

34:04.800 --> 34:05.600
In fact, it'll grow.

34:05.600 --> 34:06.640
It'll continue to grow.

34:07.280 --> 34:10.720
The Google trends and stuff continue to grow at a faster rate, I suppose.

34:10.720 --> 34:15.200
Yeah, this gives me a chance to plug one of my favorite websites, killedbygoogle.com.

34:15.200 --> 34:17.280
Yeah, yes.

34:17.280 --> 34:22.800
But, you know, the self-hosting trend in general, there's lots of trends in the media industry that

34:22.800 --> 34:27.440
push people are pushing people away from legitimate streaming services at present.

34:28.000 --> 34:34.720
Five years ago, maybe the only option in the room was Netflix, maybe an Amazon Prime video.

34:34.720 --> 34:35.280
Yeah.

34:35.280 --> 34:36.640
How many are there now?

34:36.640 --> 34:38.000
It could not even tell you, man.

34:38.000 --> 34:38.960
It's crazy.

34:38.960 --> 34:41.440
And, you know, it's like we just created Cable 2.0.

34:42.000 --> 34:48.320
So I know a lot of people are rejecting that and going to, you know, r slash piracy and

34:48.320 --> 34:51.280
doing all sorts of nefarious things over there.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.960
I feel like we're in a good spot generally as a community.

34:54.960 --> 35:01.040
There's so much open source software that just you could only have dreamt of 10 years ago.

35:01.040 --> 35:03.760
You know, you could legitimately run your whole business using nothing

35:03.760 --> 35:06.560
but open source software without too much compromise, I think.

35:06.560 --> 35:09.040
TailScale.com slash SSH.

35:09.040 --> 35:13.280
Go sign up for TailScale for up to 20 devices for free and support the show.

35:13.280 --> 35:15.600
It's a zero config VPN.

35:15.600 --> 35:17.920
It installs on any device in minutes.

35:17.920 --> 35:20.240
It manages your firewall rules for you.

35:20.240 --> 35:24.720
It works from anywhere, even if you have the dreaded double carrier NAT like I do.

35:25.360 --> 35:27.920
I switch between networks real time.

35:27.920 --> 35:32.560
I'm talking like my neighbor's Wi-Fi, multiple cellular connections and Starlink.

35:32.560 --> 35:35.760
And TailScale keeps up. I don't know how they do it, man.

35:35.760 --> 35:39.520
If you've got like under 10 devices, I bet you could probably get it deployed on all

35:39.520 --> 35:41.280
your systems in under five minutes.

35:41.280 --> 35:46.160
And what I love about TailScale is it's protected by WireGuard's noise protocol.

35:46.160 --> 35:48.000
So they have a backplane that helps you get connected.

35:48.000 --> 35:51.440
But you build a mesh network between all your machines.

35:51.440 --> 35:56.000
That also keeps their costs down, which lets them keep that free account for up to 20 devices.

35:56.560 --> 35:58.320
TailScale rolls out in minutes.

35:58.320 --> 36:00.320
Your devices get connected to your network.

36:00.320 --> 36:03.360
It rolls out in minutes. Your devices get connected directly.

36:03.360 --> 36:05.040
They'll work from any physical location.

36:05.040 --> 36:06.560
I run it on my VMs.

36:07.360 --> 36:09.680
I run it on my Raspberry Pis.

36:09.680 --> 36:11.280
I run it on my mobile devices.

36:11.920 --> 36:15.200
Sometimes when Alex and I want to collaborate for prepping for the show,

36:15.200 --> 36:19.040
he'll create a machine on his network and then he'll just share it to me in TailScale.

36:19.040 --> 36:22.880
And then all of a sudden, now I see one of Alex's machines on my TailScale list.

36:22.880 --> 36:25.280
And you can restrict it to like a specific port.

36:25.280 --> 36:27.280
You've got full control over it, too.

36:27.280 --> 36:28.640
Super great for that kind of thing.

36:28.640 --> 36:31.280
It was pretty cool this week when I flew to Tampa to buy that car.

36:32.240 --> 36:37.680
I wake up in Raleigh and within two hours I'm in Tampa sat in a car dealership

36:37.680 --> 36:40.640
waiting for them to do whatever it is they do in car dealerships.

36:40.640 --> 36:42.160
It takes forever, whatever it is.

36:42.160 --> 36:44.640
Fire up TailScale and it's as if I'm here.

36:44.640 --> 36:50.080
It's such a mind-bending operation and it's a really cool tool.

36:50.080 --> 36:52.160
Yeah. I mean, I'm not new to VPNs, man.

36:52.160 --> 36:53.840
I am not new to VPNs.

36:53.840 --> 36:57.520
I have been using VPNs since I was on dial-up modems.

36:57.520 --> 37:00.080
And I have never had an experience like this.

37:00.080 --> 37:01.440
Nothing beats TailScale.

37:01.440 --> 37:03.040
It changes the way you work.

37:03.040 --> 37:06.480
It's great for connecting friends and family, too, if you want to provide support for them.

37:06.480 --> 37:08.480
It's even better when you're working on the go.

37:08.480 --> 37:09.760
Even just a few of your devices.

37:09.760 --> 37:12.960
You got a mobile device and a desktop and you want to connect them directly together

37:12.960 --> 37:14.800
over a flat network.

37:14.800 --> 37:16.880
Well, TailScale is going to do it.

37:16.880 --> 37:17.600
Go try it out.

37:18.240 --> 37:20.880
20 machines for free and support the show.

37:21.520 --> 37:22.400
TailScale.com

37:22.400 --> 37:31.280
Now, Bronzewing writes in with 9001 SATs talking about 3D printing.

37:31.280 --> 37:32.320
Hi, Chris and the Badger.

37:32.320 --> 37:35.360
I just wanted to thank you for the content that you guys create.

37:35.360 --> 37:39.680
I've listened to every episode and I just recently jumped into the 3D printing world.

37:39.680 --> 37:42.240
Any chance I might hear more of that type of content?

37:42.240 --> 37:46.800
I find 3D printing really complements small board computers and you can make some really

37:46.800 --> 37:48.480
neat stuff that runs Linux.

37:48.480 --> 37:50.320
Well, you're our 3D printing guy, Alex.

37:50.320 --> 37:51.200
Apparently so.

37:51.200 --> 37:56.080
Yeah, it's a question that we've tossed around internally this week after getting this

37:56.080 --> 37:56.800
bit of feedback.

37:57.600 --> 38:01.040
We might do some special episodes on it, you know, around the holidays and things like

38:01.040 --> 38:04.800
that, where we need a week off for travel or whatever it might be.

38:04.800 --> 38:10.640
We don't have any plans really to make it a regular feature, mostly because, Chris,

38:11.440 --> 38:13.280
you don't really know much about 3D printing.

38:13.280 --> 38:16.880
So I suppose if I ever got one, we'd talk about it, right?

38:16.880 --> 38:18.880
You can almost see a whole different show, really.

38:18.880 --> 38:20.480
It could be its own show, really.

38:20.480 --> 38:21.680
It could, absolutely.

38:21.680 --> 38:21.920
Yeah.

38:21.920 --> 38:23.360
I mean, who knows?

38:23.360 --> 38:27.600
We've floated the idea of doing self-hosted weekly for so long now that I don't think

38:27.600 --> 38:28.400
it's ever going to happen.

38:28.400 --> 38:28.960
Who knows?

38:28.960 --> 38:29.680
Who knows?

38:29.680 --> 38:30.480
Watch this space.

38:30.480 --> 38:31.360
We'll see.

38:31.360 --> 38:33.680
Yeah, maybe if we get a few more boosts.

38:35.040 --> 38:40.160
But in the off weeks, for example, there could be space for like a show about maker stuff,

38:40.160 --> 38:42.800
you know, electronics and 3D printing and that kind of stuff.

38:43.440 --> 38:47.040
If you're interested in that kind of thing, give us an idea of how many people listen

38:47.040 --> 38:51.440
to this show would find that interesting because it would be a lot of work to spin up a whole

38:51.440 --> 38:51.920
new show.

38:51.920 --> 38:54.000
But we're not averse to the idea.

38:54.000 --> 38:57.200
I think we'd also be interested if somebody is pretty deep into the stuff and they feel

38:57.200 --> 38:59.280
passionate about it and feel like they could present it.

38:59.280 --> 39:01.600
Yes, that would be interesting to hear from that person as well.

39:01.600 --> 39:02.480
Absolutely.

39:02.480 --> 39:04.720
You know, maybe we build a show around a host at some point.

39:05.520 --> 39:10.080
Turquoise Fox boosted in seven days ago with 2349 sets.

39:10.080 --> 39:11.600
I feel like that's meaningful.

39:11.600 --> 39:18.800
It's a very specific 2349 and he's just sharing some UK meetup hype, which we've got a lot

39:18.800 --> 39:19.280
of that.

39:19.280 --> 39:20.000
What would?

39:20.640 --> 39:21.520
Yeah, yeah.

39:22.080 --> 39:26.960
But as I as I look at the meetup page right now, there's 59 people have accepted.

39:26.960 --> 39:29.200
So I know I'm going to change the date on.

39:29.200 --> 39:34.080
So that might that might fluctuate a little, but be interesting to see how many people

39:34.080 --> 39:34.400
show up.

39:34.400 --> 39:36.400
You've been throwing some parties recently, Alex.

39:36.400 --> 39:37.680
You've been throwing some parties.

39:37.680 --> 39:38.080
I know.

39:38.080 --> 39:41.200
I know I need to slow down and, you know, chill.

39:42.160 --> 39:44.080
Marcel's calling you out seven days ago.

39:44.080 --> 39:45.280
One, two, three, four sets.

39:45.280 --> 39:49.760
Alex, weren't you just criticizing bundled containers in a recent episode?

39:49.760 --> 39:52.880
This is a reference to last week's or last two weeks episode.

39:52.880 --> 40:00.640
So Marcel, my friend, my wonderful pal, there is a difference between a monolithic bastard

40:00.640 --> 40:04.880
of a container like GitLab that pulls down six gigabytes of RAM.

40:04.880 --> 40:06.400
And I think they've changed it now.

40:06.400 --> 40:08.080
I don't think that container exists.

40:08.080 --> 40:09.920
Someone told me I haven't checked.

40:09.920 --> 40:14.400
But anyway, the there's a difference between that kind of bundle container that's running

40:14.400 --> 40:22.640
8000 services in one container and a self-hosted recipes app running a small web server and

40:22.640 --> 40:24.160
the application itself.

40:24.160 --> 40:27.520
Two services versus eight million.

40:28.400 --> 40:31.520
For me, I think it's a pretty obvious.

40:31.520 --> 40:32.800
It's not a hard law.

40:32.800 --> 40:36.320
It's just one that has to be interpreted depending on the application and how many people

40:36.320 --> 40:38.160
and how many things it's bundling.

40:38.160 --> 40:42.560
Our last official message, our boost, our last boostagram, I guess you could call it,

40:42.560 --> 40:47.840
came in from the Golden Dragon seven days ago, like he always does with a row of ducks.

40:49.120 --> 40:52.000
And he says, Pew Pew, thanks for the show.

40:52.000 --> 40:54.240
I've been listening since episode one.

40:54.240 --> 40:55.680
I've started learning self-hosting.

40:55.680 --> 41:00.880
I've gotten brave enough to try Jellyfin and when it works, it works very well.

41:00.880 --> 41:04.560
The learning experience has been great and I learn more and more each episode.

41:04.560 --> 41:06.960
Have to give the recipe apps a try as well.

41:06.960 --> 41:13.600
One question I had was, are there any Wi-Fi enabled e-ink displays that you know of?

41:14.480 --> 41:15.360
Great question.

41:15.360 --> 41:18.720
I could I would love to have a wall mounted e-ink display for home assistant.

41:19.520 --> 41:20.960
Yes, but they're expensive.

41:22.080 --> 41:26.560
So there is a bunch of e-ink screens by a company called Waveshare and they will plug

41:26.560 --> 41:28.240
directly into a Raspberry Pi.

41:28.240 --> 41:34.640
But to give you an idea, a seven and a half inch e-ink display on its own without the Raspberry Pi,

41:34.640 --> 41:37.840
which is on Obtanium right now, of course, is $70.

41:38.800 --> 41:42.800
And for that, you could buy a tablet.

41:42.800 --> 41:46.800
I mean, if it's plugged into a Raspberry Pi, it has to be powered anyway.

41:46.800 --> 41:49.280
It's not going to be on a battery, which is where e-ink would win.

41:50.320 --> 41:54.720
Now you can get e-ink displays that will connect into like ESP devices,

41:54.720 --> 41:58.560
like an ESP32 or something like that, and refresh those.

41:58.560 --> 42:02.080
Because obviously an e-ink display only uses power when it updates.

42:02.080 --> 42:05.280
When it's sat there, you know, displaying whatever it's displaying,

42:05.280 --> 42:07.680
it's not using any energy whatsoever.

42:07.680 --> 42:11.040
So for that use case, e-ink is uniquely brilliant.

42:11.040 --> 42:16.480
But for almost every use case I can think of where I want a permanent screen,

42:16.480 --> 42:18.400
there would be power available.

42:18.400 --> 42:23.040
Even if there isn't power all the time, an Android tablet has a battery and it's probably

42:23.040 --> 42:25.680
going to have like five, six hours of battery life.

42:25.680 --> 42:30.640
So I know this because there are times when we're out boondocking,

42:30.640 --> 42:33.920
and I unplug the tablets to let the batteries drain down too.

42:33.920 --> 42:36.400
But when I plug them in, I'm monitoring how much power draw they are.

42:36.400 --> 42:38.640
And it's totally nothing, right?

42:38.640 --> 42:40.800
It's just nothing.

42:40.800 --> 42:43.520
So yeah, you could get even lower with an e-ink display.

42:43.520 --> 42:44.640
I would love to see that.

42:44.640 --> 42:45.520
I don't know.

42:45.520 --> 42:48.080
Let us know what you would use that display for, GoldenDragon.

42:48.080 --> 42:52.320
Because I could picture it, but maybe only for like status update type things,

42:52.320 --> 42:54.880
weather reports, things that don't change very often.

42:54.880 --> 43:00.240
I'm still using that Kindle Fire that I flash with LineageOS as a baby monitor at the moment.

43:00.240 --> 43:06.560
We run the Wyze cams as our baby monitor because that means we can have as many baby monitors

43:06.560 --> 43:10.640
screens as we want without paying the stupid extortionate prices of those things.

43:11.200 --> 43:17.200
So I put Lineage on an old, really old Kindle Fire tablet a long time ago.

43:17.200 --> 43:18.720
And it just works.

43:18.720 --> 43:19.440
It's just reliable.

43:19.440 --> 43:22.560
It just sits on my wife's nightstand and just does its thing.

43:22.560 --> 43:23.600
She can bring it around with her.

43:23.600 --> 43:26.560
But the other nice thing about having WyzeBridge is, I've noticed too,

43:26.560 --> 43:29.760
she could bring it up on her phone if that's what she has with her as well.

43:29.760 --> 43:32.080
So that's very handy.

43:32.080 --> 43:36.000
I'm interested to know what your impression is of the performance.

43:36.000 --> 43:41.600
Because the performance with the stock Amazon Android image on there is dog doo doo.

43:41.600 --> 43:42.720
It is bad.

43:42.720 --> 43:45.120
It is bad, bad.

43:45.120 --> 43:51.040
I think we paid 25 or 28 pounds for the ad-supported version like seven years ago.

43:51.040 --> 43:53.200
I always pick them up on some ridiculous sale.

43:53.200 --> 43:54.080
That's the best part.

43:55.200 --> 43:57.760
It's only worth it if you can put Lineage on it.

43:57.760 --> 44:01.440
Because then it strips out all the cruft and all the crap.

44:01.440 --> 44:06.160
And performance goes from being complete dog turd to being not great.

44:06.720 --> 44:11.280
I'm sure Amazon loves when you remove the ads from their ad-supported version.

44:11.280 --> 44:14.240
So the newer ones, you can't really do that very easily.

44:14.240 --> 44:17.680
So be careful if you are buying a Kindle Fire with that in mind.

44:18.400 --> 44:19.440
Careful which one you buy.

44:19.440 --> 44:21.760
Go and look at the LineageOS wikis and all that kind of stuff.

44:21.760 --> 44:24.720
And they'll give you some good info about what's supported.

44:24.720 --> 44:29.920
In the before times, I would have considered like a little CM4 powered display system, right?

44:30.560 --> 44:31.520
CM4.

44:31.520 --> 44:38.160
Because where I have one of my screens mounted, it's on a bathroom medicine cabinet that we don't use.

44:38.160 --> 44:41.280
And it doesn't have a mirror, just as a wood medicine cabinet.

44:41.280 --> 44:42.960
So the tablet's mounted to that.

44:42.960 --> 44:48.160
But it would be not really much of a problem to drill a hole through that medicine cabinet.

44:48.160 --> 44:51.280
I could have like a Raspberry Pi mounted at the back of the medicine cabinet.

44:51.280 --> 44:53.600
And then just the display on the front and be a lot cleaner.

44:54.320 --> 44:56.480
I think a lot more responsive.

44:56.480 --> 45:02.960
But these days, compute modules are like, you know, as valuable as plywood and wood and gold.

45:02.960 --> 45:04.320
It's getting ridiculous.

45:04.320 --> 45:09.280
And I just got another I find I, you know, I picked one up recently and I just received it.

45:09.280 --> 45:11.120
And now it's like, what do I do with this thing?

45:11.120 --> 45:13.360
Like, they're so rare and precious.

45:13.360 --> 45:16.480
Whatever job I give this, it's going to be it's got to be like important now.

45:16.480 --> 45:21.360
Like, I've I've totally gone from having a drawer full of Raspberry Pis to now everyone I get is like

45:21.360 --> 45:24.400
precious and limited and can't be wasted.

45:24.400 --> 45:25.680
It's getting bad, Alex.

45:26.400 --> 45:28.720
Maybe when that clears up, maybe then I'll build one.

45:29.440 --> 45:30.880
We got a couple of thank you boosts.

45:30.880 --> 45:36.560
J24 boosted in saying he loves the value for value model and also that he loves using Keybase

45:36.560 --> 45:38.480
for personal repositories.

45:38.480 --> 45:43.520
And then we also got one anonymous thank you boost with no message, just a thank you.

45:43.520 --> 45:47.520
I'd love to take a moment to say thank you to our site reliability engineers over at self hosted

45:47.520 --> 45:49.360
dot show slash SRE.

45:49.360 --> 45:51.760
You subscribers over there make the show possible.

45:51.760 --> 45:52.240
Indeed.

45:52.240 --> 45:54.320
And they let us be picky about who we talk to.

45:54.880 --> 45:58.000
And this is something I'm mentioning just for a short period of time, but we get a lot of

45:58.000 --> 46:03.200
this is something I'm mentioning just for a short period of time, but we get all kinds of weird

46:03.200 --> 46:06.160
sponsor requests and one that happens on the Coder show.

46:06.160 --> 46:10.160
It happens on this show occasionally happens on Coder Radio all the time.

46:10.160 --> 46:14.320
It's people email in that want to pay us to interview them and pretend like they're not

46:14.320 --> 46:16.320
paying us to interview them on the show.

46:16.320 --> 46:18.720
Yeah, which is easy money for a podcaster.

46:18.720 --> 46:19.840
That's easy money.

46:19.840 --> 46:20.960
I could do that all day long.

46:21.840 --> 46:25.840
So the members, they let us not even have to consider that kind of crap.

46:25.840 --> 46:28.480
We get to stay focused on super serving our audience.

46:28.480 --> 46:29.360
That's what the members do.

46:29.360 --> 46:30.560
They give us that runway.

46:30.560 --> 46:36.240
So as a thank you, we've created an ad free version of the show and soon not ready yet

46:36.240 --> 46:38.400
because we're building the back end infrastructure to make it possible.

46:38.400 --> 46:41.760
But soon we're also going to create a live feed for our members.

46:41.760 --> 46:44.720
So the live shows that we're now doing, which is now a regular thing for the self hosted

46:44.720 --> 46:49.040
program, soon our members will have an option between two feeds, the ad free feed that we've

46:49.040 --> 46:51.600
always had and the new live feed.

46:51.600 --> 46:54.960
So that way they can just subscribe to that and they get even more show.

46:54.960 --> 47:00.080
And as a thank you to the ad free version, they also get a post show, which is only available

47:00.080 --> 47:00.720
for our members.

47:00.720 --> 47:03.520
Again, self hosted dot show slash SRE.

47:03.520 --> 47:08.960
Now we're doing this show live at the moment every two weeks, 730 pm Eastern.

47:09.520 --> 47:12.160
Where can people go to find that when we're live, Chris?

47:12.160 --> 47:16.480
You say at the moment, but as far as I know, I think we're doing it going forward, right?

47:16.480 --> 47:18.080
Jupiter dot tube.

47:18.080 --> 47:23.120
And we do it on Wednesdays at 730 pm Eastern for 30 pm Pacific.

47:23.120 --> 47:24.480
And we'll keep it posted over.

47:24.480 --> 47:26.000
We'll have it archived over there, too.

47:26.000 --> 47:29.840
That's the idea is that if you'd like to catch a live version and you'd like to see the video

47:29.840 --> 47:32.240
version, we will have it archived there.

47:32.240 --> 47:35.760
Our focus is going to remain the audio feed that gets released.

47:35.760 --> 47:40.000
But we felt like this was a nice way to kind of interact with our community on a more ongoing

47:40.000 --> 47:44.000
basis, gives everybody an opportunity to show up, say hi, hang out.

47:44.000 --> 47:48.320
Now, most of you already know this, but self hosted dot show slash contact is the place

47:48.320 --> 47:49.760
to go to get in touch with us.

47:49.760 --> 47:54.560
You can find me on Twitter at ironic badger, and I'm in the discord at Alex KTZ.

47:55.280 --> 47:55.680
That's right.

47:55.680 --> 47:58.720
That discord is at self hosted dot show slash discord.

47:58.720 --> 48:00.800
I'm on Twitter at Chris LAS.

48:00.800 --> 48:03.600
The network has a telegram group that you can join.

48:03.600 --> 48:06.240
Jupiter broadcasting dot com slash telegram.

48:06.240 --> 48:07.440
Thanks for listening, everybody.

48:07.440 --> 48:22.240
That was self hosted dot show slash 72.
