1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
you probably didn't see the uh teaser for the stream today it's actually a lady badger

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:11,840
it's hard to tell but it's a lady badger it's a lady badger it looks like a medieval lady badger

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,880
yeah i think so but she's she's still a big self-hosted fan or is she renaissance it's hard

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,800
to tell maybe we should ask her she could be larping i don't know that could be a thing where

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:26,800
did that come from i made it i just decided i was looking for badger people and that's what came up

6
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:36,000
so you made it nms paint did you yeah basically paint.net well here we are it's episode 75 there's

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,080
a lot to get to today alex is about to jump on an airplane and our buddy brent is inbound we're

8
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:48,400
sitting down in the middle of a thunderstorm over at alex's house real life update brent is supposed

9
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:55,840
to be departing toronto literally right now as i'm talking to you as we're recording and his flight

10
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:01,760
inbound from calgary landed about 10 minutes ago so i don't think that's happening i think

11
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:07,440
i think brent will be here tomorrow morning and more most likely okay and when do you fly out

12
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:11,840
tomorrow night yeah you have you might be two ships passing each other in the night on the

13
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:18,080
yeah it's unfortunate uh it is unfortunate well we'll get into it but i wanted to start today

14
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,840
by discussing something that i don't know if we have it on record but i know at least off record

15
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:29,280
you you called this one alex this week nebuchadza announced the works with home assistant program

16
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,400
they write today we're introducing the works with home assistant program to allow manufacturers to

17
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,760
show their support and commitment to home assistant and its community and like you would expect with

18
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:44,800
a program like this alex they got like little badges that says works locally with home assistant

19
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:49,200
works via the cloud with home assistant works with z wave you know the kind of the kind of

20
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,560
works with it's an interesting program i don't want to foreshadow anything about my other

21
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:01,760
predictions this year but uh nailed it i called that one yeah he did it's nice it's nice to finally

22
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:07,760
get the w bro yeah it is nice to see this in fact it's kind of perfect because i just recently had

23
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:15,200
a good reminder of how how crappy the experience is right now and i have to say i'm a bit disappointed

24
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:21,200
that they didn't announce a hardware partner at launch but they did say uh they're gonna have

25
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,320
their first hardware partner announced soon but you know just recently i was kind of doing like

26
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:32,080
a virtual rebuild of my home assistant setup like let's say in theory my home assistant yellow or

27
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:39,440
whatever it's called now shows up and i rebuild my home setup and i thought maybe that'd be a good

28
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:45,520
time to just move over to zigbee i know i could just stick with z wave but it seems like zigbee

29
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:50,320
and matter will eventually be the future so i started researching one-to-one replacements

30
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:57,120
for my z wave devices like my outdoor switches sprinkler controllers uh motion sensors power

31
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,800
smart plugs that also have real-time power data monitoring i tried to find solid zigbee alternatives

32
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:10,800
to those and getting any kind of signal out of the noise if one device over another is compatible

33
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:17,280
with home assistant is a really bad experience and at best you're kind of just taking a stab

34
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:23,040
like you really can't order anything with absolute confidence that it'll work in home assistant and i

35
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,640
do i will say over the last couple years it's gotten better like more and more stuff i just

36
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:33,600
buy works with home assistant locally but it's still almost impossible and i i would i would argue

37
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:40,560
in navigatable for a brand new user to this space presently so if this takes off this would make it

38
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,440
massively easier because i would just filter by this on amazon or wherever i'm shopping it is a

39
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:51,680
crapshoot absolutely and you know the the only way to know for sure something's going to work is to

40
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:57,040
buy it and try it and even then that's not a guarantee it's going to continue working for

41
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:02,560
the longest time i refer you to my comments about the govi led strips i bought in the last episode

42
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:08,320
you know even though that was relying on a third-party api provided by govi it worked one

43
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:15,040
day via a custom integration and then govi decided to rate limit the api so even then it's not a

44
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:21,840
perfect guarantee so i'm delighted to see this program come into existence i think it's a signal

45
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:27,840
that the project has ambition in a certain direction you know if you think about all the

46
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:33,280
other made for programs i think made for iphone was probably one of if not the first kind of

47
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:41,120
certification sort of like this in our industry it guarantees companies some kind of interface

48
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,560
to develop against so you look at the iphone as the perfect example right they had that 30 pin

49
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,760
dot connector for a decade now we've had the lightning connector for i think a decade and

50
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:59,600
we're probably due usbc on the iphone any day now uh we can hope anyway and so when i look at this

51
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:07,680
announcement i think wow geez okay cool so if i'm you know making the cheapest possible thing i can

52
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:14,080
and i don't want to pay any license fees or minimal license fees to get a little cute label

53
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:19,920
on the box to put it on the shelf in home depot or wherever it is uh around the world that little

54
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:24,240
blue home assistant logo looks pretty good right i mean if you can put the alexa one on there and

55
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,960
the google one on there why not slap home assistant on there yeah and here's a couple of things about

56
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,920
the program that i like uh the program requires manufacturers to maintain the integration of their

57
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:39,440
products in home assistant they have to provide product samples and give engineering contacts for

58
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:44,880
the home assistant team to escalate to huge manufacturers will be able to use the works

59
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,920
with home assistant badge in return on their products and documentation and the terms of the

60
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:55,440
works with home assistant program are enforced in agreement signed by both nebu casa and the

61
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,320
manufacturer so it's not just like they're handing these labels out and so i think when i see one of

62
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:04,880
these labels as a consumer i'm going to be able to trust that it actually does work and i'm not

63
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:13,920
joking like i would just filter on this and only buy these products it really lives and dies in the

64
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:19,520
manufacturer adoption but what happens in a situation like we had and i'm not saying it will

65
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:25,920
happen soon but like just happened with the z wave stuff your migration that you've been moaning about

66
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:34,160
on air for ages and ages what happens in 10 years time when home assistant needs to deprecate a

67
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:39,600
certain interface right and i i don't know what it is i'm not even going to speculate let's say the

68
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:45,120
replacement for matter has come along and it it deprecates support for all previous matter devices

69
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:51,200
for whatever reason i'm just making this up but it had that made for home assistant logo on the

70
00:06:51,200 --> 00:07:00,160
box what are the terms of this relationship is it a made for a specific year of home assistant

71
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:06,800
releases is it made for 10 years like what's the contract here i would like to know and if if the

72
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,840
home assistant team are listening please tweet at me or let me know something like that because

73
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:17,120
it's important for us to know these details as as nerds i'm excited to hear who their first

74
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,520
partner is and i would love to hear more details i think you're asking some good questions there

75
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:26,160
and maybe time will tell when you said when you called this i want to say it was like back in

76
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,800
december when you said something like this should come this year it immediately clicked like yes

77
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,360
this is exactly what they need and this makes the experience so much better and then you combine

78
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:41,200
a program like this with something like the home assistant yellow or or you know a future iteration

79
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:46,720
when the supply chain isn't all screwed up a out of the box ready to go you drop it on your land

80
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:52,240
and then you just go buy the works with home assistant labeled devices and everything's just

81
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:58,400
out of the box good to go from home assistant from nebu casa you know it's a huge potential

82
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:03,200
revenue stream that i don't know if they're interested in i think they should be if they

83
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:08,320
want to help keep the business growing and you know make it a better overall product

84
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:13,840
i think we've seen over the years in this technological space that the only real way

85
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:21,120
to have a cohesive user experience and i'm talking like apple level of integration here

86
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:28,080
is not convergence and we saw that with the ubuntu phone years ago and you know everything

87
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:34,800
they did with the unity desktop back in that era the only way to have a cohesive user experience

88
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:41,840
is to control everything unfortunately it's it's true i think and that means from all the way up

89
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:46,560
from the home assistant yellow all the way up to the light bulb i screw into my light fixture

90
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:54,080
and everything in between if they can offer a cohesive suite of hardware and software and have

91
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:59,680
it all guaranteed to work together no matter what you know air quotes whatever that means

92
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:08,560
then home assistant starts to become a viable recommend for people like me to slightly less

93
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:14,240
slightly less technical members of my family like yeah yeah because right now you know it's

94
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:21,440
it's the bastion of people that like to tinker as much as home assistant has improved extra ui

95
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:26,880
elements and wizards and blah blah blah i mean i rarely drop to the yaml these days like i used to

96
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:33,280
but it's not perfect and if something goes wrong within 10 minutes it's still in the domain where

97
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:37,760
you need to set it up for your non-technical friends and family you could bring them a box

98
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,960
and give it to them and show them the web ui but you've already set up the dashboard you've

99
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:44,160
already integrated all the devices you've already done all the network provisioning

100
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:49,920
you've managed all of that and this helps transition it into a different phase and

101
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:55,760
just my last thoughts on this and i hope this is a benefit that we continue to see just as

102
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:02,400
home assistant as a community grows but it means we have someone out there advocating

103
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:09,120
for local api and local controls but to that point and this is raised in the discord as we record

104
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:17,280
it's a bit of a slippery slope and i am worried that works with home assistant

105
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:27,440
if you give it enough time becomes doesn't work with other open standard maybe i guess it depends

106
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,240
on how the standard works because everything about home assistant would probably be open source in

107
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:37,840
this regard right i mean we'll see i'm not saying they're going to pull an mb but who knows you know

108
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:43,920
and the other thing is what about the testing that's done are they as an open source project

109
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:49,200
going to publish all the testing of their hardware vendors i can't imagine many hardware vendors

110
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,720
wanting to sign up to that but as an open source project do they not have a duty to do that i don't

111
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,720
to do that i don't know i'm just asking the question questions that we will probably get

112
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:04,240
answers to over time but may not like them all we got a message into the show via the jupiter

113
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,960
broadcasting telegram group and it was just a simple question hey do you guys use a self-hosted

114
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:14,480
to-do app and it's funny because this is exactly something i've been looking to host in my rv right

115
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:20,880
now something i could really focus just on road trips and stuff like that and i came across i'm

116
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:30,560
going to attempt to say it's the kunja v i k u n j a it's a self-hostable really good looking to-do

117
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:38,480
app and it has a little bit of everything that i like from inboxes for different tasks it has

118
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:44,080
namespace and user sharing so you can collect different projects together and then share them

119
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:50,080
with somebody like you know a spouse or a family member or a friend it has team support and of

120
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:55,840
course it also offers a hosted version which you could just pay for if you'd like they include a

121
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:00,800
how to use it in docker guide so that's probably the route i would take if i were to deploy this

122
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,680
i haven't yet but i'd love to get any feedback from anyone out there in the audience that's

123
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:11,040
either use this or another self-hosted to-do app this to me seems like the one to beat you can find

124
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:19,200
it at v i k u n j a dot cloud and yep it's got kanban boards alex i know how you like your kanban

125
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:27,760
me oh it just gives me the heebie-jeebies of like trello and jira yep yep yep did you ever really

126
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,160
stop and think about self-hosting your to-do stuff i gotta be honest with you i think i

127
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:37,200
just fell into using apps on my phone which are connected to proprietary services i thought about

128
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:43,120
it quite a lot actually when i was deep into my sort of emacs kick which lasted about three or

129
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:49,440
four months and i was doing all the org rome stuff which came out of rome research line of thinking

130
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:55,200
the what's it called second brain linking your thinking type stuff i was sort of going down this

131
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:00,480
whole productivity rabbit hole and realized i was spending way longer trying to be productive than

132
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:07,600
actually being productive so i looked at a few things built into emacs org mode primarily being

133
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:13,680
the one i looked at but mobile experience the mobile experience matters a lot because that's

134
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:19,280
where you know 90 of my random thoughts occur to me is oh i need to remember to change the filters

135
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:24,960
on the ac unit or i don't know remember to pick up this from the shop on the way home or something

136
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:31,600
like that and i ended up falling into the camp of just using todoist which is not a self-hosted

137
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,720
app unfortunately but for me it's worked very very well it's got some integrations with gmail

138
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,800
which i use all the time at work so there's a bunch of stuff i have to do in my day job

139
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:45,040
where i need to remember certain case numbers and add comments and all that kind of stuff

140
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:50,000
and i can just click a button in gmail and it adds it straight into todoist and i can

141
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,280
you know keyboard shortcuts and natural text input and all that kind of stuff

142
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,760
that's not really what you wanted to hear but i really like todoist i understand todoist and

143
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:04,400
its many integrations and its api are really really handy and i think that's the hosted

144
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:11,200
service to beat vikinja or however you say it what i was really impressed by is they maintain a

145
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:16,400
really clean user interface where you could just bang out tasks super quick but they also let you

146
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:21,920
really dig in and set all kinds of different bits of detail you can add relation you can add

147
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:27,440
attachments you can do progress tasks you can just do percentage updates you can have repeating

148
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:33,760
intervals priorities labels you can subscribe to certain tasks even if you're not the user if you

149
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:40,080
just want to get updates on it i mean it's got it's got like all the power features i love i think

150
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:44,320
it's going to come down to what it's like to maintain and run it so i'm tempted to give it a

151
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,240
go but i'll wait a week or two and get like input from the audience to hear what they're using for

152
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:53,120
self-hosted to do apps or maybe i should just not give it a go maybe you've got experience

153
00:14:53,120 --> 00:15:00,560
out there that says otherwise and i should just give in like alex and use todoist leno.com slash

154
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:06,000
ssh go there to get one hundred dollars and 60 day credit on a new account and you go there to

155
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,480
support the show linode is the best way to run an application on linux in the cloud it's how

156
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:17,680
we run everything we've built for the last two and a half years or so it's really really fast

157
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:22,400
they have great performance they have 11 data centers around the world mvme pcie storage they've

158
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:28,320
got amd epic processors and their cpu rigs 40 gigabit connections coming into the hypervisors

159
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:35,120
and they are their own isp so that's like all the things you need to just have fantastic performance

160
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:40,160
and on top of that they have the best support that's where they really try to differentiate

161
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,760
from the hyperscalers they're going to lock into their crazy platforms they really try to

162
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:50,080
differentiate with the customer service and the community support i'll say that they've been a

163
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:54,560
big supporter of jupiter broadcasting and they're making it possible for us to go down and get a

164
00:15:54,560 --> 00:16:01,200
tour of jpl and do a bunch of west coast meetups they invest in the community because they know

165
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:07,440
it returns a net benefit to them because linux is what they run on everything go build something go

166
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:12,640
learn something try linode out go get that hundred dollars and try out their s3 compatible object

167
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:18,160
storage maybe you want to play around with their vlan configurator their powerful dns manager

168
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:23,440
or perhaps you just want to try something maybe you want to performance test your network maybe

169
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,520
you want to deploy their new kali linux support and do a little penetration testing to make sure

170
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:32,640
everything's buttoned up you can do it 30 to 50 percent cheaper than you can at the hyperscalers

171
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:37,600
and you can support the show so go try out the best in virtualized cloud computing if it runs

172
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:44,960
on linux it runs on linode sign up today and support the show linode.com slash ssh that's

173
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:54,880
linode.com slash ssh to get that 100 and support the show linode.com slash ssh we've got a live

174
00:16:54,880 --> 00:17:01,920
brent update for you his departure flight from toronto is delayed by 10 minutes so i don't know

175
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:07,680
i don't know if he's off his original plane yet or through customs or or anything but it's seat

176
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:12,560
of the pants stuff i think it's going to be a full-on run running down the airport kind of

177
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:18,080
movie style moment for brent i think yeah yeah poor guy hopefully things go smoother for you

178
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:22,960
and the family hopefully so yes uh it's just a direct flight for us tomorrow rally to london

179
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:28,480
heathrow hopefully the baggage handlers are on point tomorrow i did buy a couple of extra air

180
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:33,920
tags to throw into my suitcases attaboy that's so fun the last time i traveled i did that and

181
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:37,920
we checked baggage and then you just watch and then as soon as it starts to get close and it

182
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:41,760
detects it again you know your bag's almost there and then you know you can tell when it comes down

183
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:48,160
the chute it was luxury checking i am actually i hadn't thought about the baggage reclaim part

184
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:54,880
i'm actually genuinely excited for that now yeah it's great you know i was going through the uh

185
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,480
inbox and a lot of people have caught that you're going to london obviously because we have the

186
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:03,920
meetup coming up and all of that and we clearly got people to want updates on your remote backup

187
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:10,880
setup you have across the pond well it's uh it's all change fairly soon anyway i think largely

188
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:16,320
speaking the fundamental stuff is going to stay the same but when i emigrated three or four years ago

189
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:22,080
i left my old server in england along with all the data that was on it and i just left it there

190
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:27,360
because i arrived in this country you know as a prospector with nothing but a suitcase and a

191
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:34,560
rucksack don't you know oh my god alex it's true though it literally is true and the container

192
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:39,440
that had all of my actual stuff in it took like three or four months to come across the ocean so

193
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:46,320
and now you here you are in a american house in the suburbs with big thunderstorms full of crap

194
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:54,080
lots of toys yeah you're doing it right you know the general idea was to use that server in england

195
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:59,840
as my primary endpoint for when i needed to come out at a residential ip address for i player

196
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,600
but also there was about 20 or 30 terabytes worth of hard drives in that system

197
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:11,760
which i pulled together using zfs i used to do zfs mirrors but i ran out of space and so i ended

198
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:17,600
up turning it into like a z2 array i think i can't remember the specifics a z2 array of like

199
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:23,120
five or six different three or four terabyte hard drives maybe they're eights but it doesn't really

200
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:29,920
matter the idea there is that over wire garden bear in mind this predates tail scale by what

201
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:37,440
three or four years i had to rely on open vpn originally to get an ssh to get into the the box

202
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:42,560
in england via open sense i had a site to site vpn between the two so that all the traffic was

203
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:48,720
encrypted and then encrypted within that tunnel as well over ssh and zfs send i used jim salter's

204
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:54,640
syncoid and sanoid to do all my snapshots on zfs and then syncoid is what's used to manage those

205
00:19:54,640 --> 00:20:00,320
snapshots and sync them to the remote endpoint but last year when i went back to england i did a

206
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,240
motherboard upgrade on that server and there's a blog post which i'll link to in the show notes

207
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:09,680
about the motherboard i'm using however shortly after i left england my father informed me that

208
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:14,960
they were selling the childhood home and moving and where they were moving to which if you've

209
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:20,560
listened to the show you'll know didn't really have the best of internet connections it's up in

210
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:28,560
uh it's up in the northeast and of england and the internet there was i think i'm generous in

211
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:36,880
saying two megabytes down and 0.5 megabytes up oh it's miserable yeah so they have got starlink

212
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:42,320
and it's a lot better now for stuff like tablets and phones and i player and whatever else they do

213
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:46,640
for normal people yeah it's way better for that kind of stuff but in terms of running a server

214
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:51,760
um it's not you know i'm i'm not throwing terabytes through that link anymore because

215
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:58,160
the you know the the main data set's already over there but if ever i needed to restore that data

216
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:07,600
you know starlink's probably just not the right way to go then somehow the gods smiled on me and

217
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:16,240
my mother-in-law who lives in rural norfolk she has had internet that has been awful for us to

218
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:21,200
for as long as i can possibly remember again it was in that sort of four or five megabyte down

219
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:28,240
one or two megabyte up region just dsl adsl uh if it got a bit windy the speed dropped you know

220
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:33,680
because the lines were suspended over such a distance she messaged me a month ago and said

221
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:39,920
hey good news i'm getting fiber to the property fiber out there i was like fiber to the property

222
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:46,480
i can't even get that you said yes right you said yes i said yes and so she now has i'm led

223
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:54,560
to believe a 500 symmetrical megabyte connection so my primary old british server is now going to

224
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:59,920
move from my father's to my mother-in-law's who i will bribe with something i haven't figured out

225
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:05,040
what yet a gadget maybe yeah she's already said yes but okay the fiber comes in at the wrong end

226
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:10,480
of the house from where we had a 4g connection for her before an lte modem on the roof because the

227
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:16,320
dsl connection was so bad uh and this is a lady that works fully remotely over the internet and

228
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:22,000
has done for years now uh so the internet's very important to her livelihood this is going to be

229
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,560
huge for her then and so for me i'm going to be drilling holes in walls and running ethernet

230
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:33,040
through brick walls not just uh american cardboard walls proper walls 18th century cottage walls no

231
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:39,280
less which are you know three three feet thick type deals honestly that sounds like a pain in the ass

232
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:44,720
to work on i don't think i'd want that yeah it's gonna be it's gonna be fun so i'll be doing a bit

233
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:49,280
of work whilst i'm over there running ethernet for her and i think my reward will be to host the

234
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:56,240
server at her house now since tail scale is now a thing i will be running all of my backups over

235
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:02,480
tail scale to that particular server and dispensing with open sense on the remote site i don't see the

236
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:09,680
need anymore tail scale works on my nvidia shield so i can run i player through android tv it also

237
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:16,160
works on my phone my ipad my laptop so i can come out with a british residential ip address with 500

238
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:22,400
meg up no problem i just don't really need wire guard anymore it's uh naked wire guard anyway i

239
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,400
mean nano tail scale uses it under the hood yeah when you were talking about how you had a point

240
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:32,480
to point vpn and your sshing over that and you know it's like that that's funny that's how i did

241
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:37,520
things for like 20 years but now that sounds like a really old way of doing things it's so nice and

242
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,520
i know tail scale sponsored the show so i don't mean to sound like a shill but they're not currently

243
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:45,600
sponsored this week so this is this is unpaid this is all true it's just you know it's your opinion

244
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:50,080
ah they well there you go that's how you know it's true i mean the reason that they sponsored

245
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:55,680
the show in the past is simply because we found them and we thought this is the way it should have

246
00:23:55,680 --> 00:24:03,440
always been this is the way and the other prong of my backup setup is i have a sinology box living

247
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:08,240
at my mother's house she only has i think it's fiber to the cabinet is what they call it in

248
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,560
england so they run fiber to a cabinet a few hundred feet away from the house and then it's

249
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:20,480
copper for the last few hundred feet so she gets about 60 or 70 meg down and maybe 10 or 20 up which

250
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,400
is sufficient for a backup server it's not sufficient for an awful lot of other things but

251
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:31,520
it'll do and i run that using auto restic which is a wrapper around restic i think i've talked

252
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:39,520
about this previously but that's the summary auto restic runs over tail scale and it just works i

253
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:44,640
actually went to check up on it the other day and was pleasantly surprised that it's still working

254
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:49,360
six months later that's what you want to see man that's what you want to see so that's going to be

255
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,200
quite a bit of work because you're going to have to shut that thing down move it set it back up

256
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:58,320
you're gonna probably have some networking stuff to configure out over at mom's and i mean you might

257
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:02,560
want to spin up a home assistant instance for her i don't know i mean i could see you doing that too

258
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:08,000
i could see this kind of rabbit hole i might take one of these spare raspberry pies i've got in the

259
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,520
drawer behind me as a backup for the mother-in-law's house so that i have another tail scale endpoint

260
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:19,920
that isn't the server itself inside the LAN so that i can kind of island hop within the LAN

261
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:26,080
look at you traveling with a raspberry pie mr baller over there that's a good idea though

262
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,520
i'll get to customs and they'll be like anything to declare and i'll be like yeah and a million

263
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:35,920
dollars worth of raspberry pies in my bag that's kind of funny but it's getting to that but really

264
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:39,520
uh i think what we should talk about is the fact that you're going to have a meetup while you're

265
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:45,600
over there that is very exciting and it's really coming together absolutely yes so in order to

266
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:50,240
accommodate a certain mr joe ressington there were certain requirements that had to be met

267
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:56,080
and one of them that was non-negotiable was being outdoors i kind of feel the same way as well so i

268
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:01,200
mean i know i shovel that on joe's shoulders but also it's it's my requirement too everybody can

269
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,480
just feel a little more comfortable this way so we're going to meet underneath the london eye

270
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:10,320
there's a big square green space between the shell center the london eye and the hungerford bridge

271
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:16,880
and we're going to meet there on the 5th of august around about six o'clock british summer time

272
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:21,680
we've got to be very specific about that yeah you got to watch out because the meetup page

273
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:29,280
is in jb's local time so the meetup page can send you a ride yeah so when it says 11 a.m

274
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:37,040
ignore that it's 11 a.m chris's time we will be there at six o'clock in the evening british

275
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:42,880
summer time and uh we'll be there until late i mean officially it says nine o'clock i think you

276
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:49,200
know three hours or so i do have a flight back here the next morning about eight or nine in the

277
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:55,680
morning so i probably won't be out getting completely uh completely plastered but i will be

278
00:26:55,680 --> 00:27:01,200
there and i have stickers if that's the final thing that gets you to come to come to the meetup

279
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:07,360
we have limited edition self-hosted diamond cut stickers that's so cool alex you're going to get

280
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:12,800
over 100 people i hope so i can tell you right now if you've got 99 people on the meetup and you

281
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:16,240
can tell the way this meetup page has been trending i've done this enough times to tell you

282
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,240
you're going to get over 100 people well they have to beat the rally lot how many did we get there i

283
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,840
think it was about 100 oh it was a little bit more it might have been closer to 200 in raleigh

284
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:29,200
i mean it's like the raleigh meetup is a good crew oh i like the way you i like the way you work sir

285
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,320
i think it was a little bit more so they're gonna have to put they're gonna have to try harder i

286
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:37,920
mean they don't want the americans to beat them right meetup.com slash jupiter broadcasting for

287
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:44,160
the meetup details i of course am looking forward to hearing how it goes we have created a jb meetup

288
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:49,280
matrix space as well of course this meetup is also being organized in the self-hosted discord

289
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:55,040
but in general we have created a jb meetups matrix space on our self-hosted matrix instance

290
00:27:55,040 --> 00:28:00,240
there is a london colony meetup in there and there's now a brand new chat room for a west

291
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:06,560
coast road trip that we're going on in september jupiter broadcasting has been invited to get a

292
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:12,800
personal tour of the jet propulsion lab in pasadena by a friend of the show tim canham who

293
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:18,320
is the operational lead for the mars helicopter that runs linux so it's an amazing opportunity

294
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:22,880
and linode is helping us get down there they're going to help just like they did last year so

295
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:27,600
we're going to do a whole series of meetups so that meetup page is going to be more useful than

296
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:32,560
ever as the summer comes up and of course in that matrix space which will have linked in the show

297
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:37,440
notes if you want to find out where we're going to be at or if you are a local in the area and you

298
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:42,400
want to give us a shout out so we know there's someone in that area to meet up with or maybe you

299
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:49,120
know a great place we could stop in the washington oregon california region join that matrix space

300
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:53,840
linked in the notes and say hi it's going to be it's going to be a massive road trip i mean we got

301
00:28:53,840 --> 00:29:00,400
a lot august we got the london meetup and then in september we're going to have oregon california

302
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:08,480
jpl it's it's going to be great alex jpl's down in la right yeah yep just uh pasadena area so

303
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:13,280
the outskirts wonderful yeah i'll have to figure out how i'm going to do that in the rv but we'll

304
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:18,800
get it dialed in i i hear that the uh the best way to do it is grand theft auto style you just drive

305
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:25,200
through the desert real fast and then you steal a jet plane and then you fly right in i think that'll

306
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:34,160
work alex i think that's gonna work visit humio.com hce to ingest and view all of your logs in one

307
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:40,320
place humio is a centralized log management and observability platform the company was founded by

308
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:44,800
developers in denmark in 2016 as an alternative to legacy logging solutions that make it cost

309
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:50,400
prohibitive to ingest and search data volumes seen today's it infrastructures i have been there these

310
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:55,440
used to be problems that we spent a lot of effort and money trying to solve but the real beauty of

311
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:00,960
humio is that it can take logs from any source and make them usable you don't need to constantly

312
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:06,400
massage the format it doesn't need a schema you just pump them all in there and then you have them

313
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:11,840
when you need them and of course the dashboard is great the platform is really pretty crazy

314
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:19,040
humio's index free architecture means you can ingest over a petabyte of data per day and search

315
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:25,280
that data with sub-second latency and humio is up to 80 cheaper than the competing platforms like

316
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:30,160
splunk or elastic thanks to its reduced hardware and computational footprint but you know the best

317
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:35,120
way to get going with humio is the community edition humio community edition so you can

318
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:40,960
humio community edition is the largest no cost data ingestion offering on the market today

319
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:47,280
allowing you to ingest up to 16 gigabytes per day with seven day retention not a trial period

320
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:52,000
you've got it for the long haul this is perfect for self-hosters who just want to ingest their

321
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,880
home logs and get a single view of everything happening in your environment rather than having

322
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:01,040
to go to all the separate places to look from your logs from every system every app every

323
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:06,160
component in your home humio gives you the ability to bring it all together and correlate it in one

324
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:10,320
place for easier troubleshooting i mean just to give you an example you can monitor your power

325
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:14,720
consumption your download speeds water consumption your router information i mean just basically

326
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:19,120
anything that you can get stats and home assistant well you could visualize it in humio you can also

327
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:23,520
help monitor power consumption but you know power consumption that's huge in australia

328
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:27,680
humio community edition gives one listener full visibility of a solar and power grid

329
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:32,560
home assistant and no dread all that data into humio he really likes to impress his

330
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:37,520
neighbors with that his voltage recently dropped from 240 volts to 160 volts so like you know

331
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:42,320
things like the display on your microwave work but the actual microwave function that doesn't

332
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:47,600
work he was able to dig through the logs in humio see it on the dashboard and take action to protect

333
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:51,600
his home computing infrastructure when it's your hobby you want it easy you want it quick and you

334
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:56,240
want it usable and you don't want it to have to be a job so get started with humio community edition

335
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:10,240
for free at humio.com slash h c e that's humio.com slash h c e what an opportunity jpl is going to

336
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:15,760
be so so cool i really hope you can find a way to meet up with chris on the way down if you're on

337
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:21,520
the west coast i'm going to start looking at flights i think that could be i think could be

338
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:25,760
worth the flight hey oh yeah that's a special opportunity totally all right you and i can

339
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,640
talk more i just didn't want to bring it up when you're in the middle of traveling but we could

340
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:35,760
talk more when you get back do i bring the family though oh that's a tricky one you know it's a work

341
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,440
trip quote-unquote so it's a jb work thing i mean i don't know it's up to you though i'd tell you

342
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:45,360
the mother-in-law who we just referenced is a physicist by trade so i think she'd be down i

343
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:50,800
think she's in raleigh for september so i think you might have to grease those wheels with the

344
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:58,480
mother-in-law as well it's already happening oh man so uh laurence writes in hey chris and alex

345
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,800
i love the show and i'm really looking forward to the uk meet up next month this is a broader

346
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:06,320
self-hosting question but with your combined experience i'm hoping you may be able to point

347
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:11,440
me in the right direction i'm a solicitor or attorney for those in the u.s looking to change

348
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:17,280
careers to the cloud and i'm unsure where to begin hey we should have fuzzy mistborn answer this

349
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:24,080
question eh given that he was on just recently and he's in that trade uh so as is the way a

350
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:29,520
pie was my gateway drug and it sent me down the rabbit hole on what has become quite the adventure

351
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:34,400
learning linux i've had offers from a few very expensive training providers purveying various

352
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:41,680
grades of snake oil and supposedly guaranteed jobs but in keeping with the self-hosting spirit i'd

353
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:47,840
like to try and do it myself i'm currently following a couple of udemy courses and self-studying to get

354
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:54,560
the aws cloud practitioner certification along with a couple of others uh and i imagine landing

355
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:59,760
any entry level role will be quite difficult without any prior experience any sage advice

356
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:04,560
would be greatly appreciated keep up the good work guys and get well soon chris thanks laurence

357
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:08,320
well thank you laurence i am feeling much much better now i'd say i'm like 95

358
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:13,920
percent better this is a great question and it's something that you are not alone in struggling

359
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:19,600
with because you get to this point where you've got a lot of hands-on um lab time where you've

360
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:23,760
built things and tried things or maybe you've deployed something in the cloud but you don't

361
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:29,120
necessarily have work experience and you want to take it to that next step that can be situational

362
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:35,040
but i will say one area that i looked at when i was hiring is i would ask people if they have

363
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:41,200
participated in any projects on github because it's just all your commits all your work everything's

364
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:47,120
documented right there and it can be an example of a work ethic it can be an example of you

365
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:51,760
participating in community even if it's not necessarily specific to the job you're applying

366
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:57,920
for i mean my own personal story i was working in retail at the apple store for a while and i

367
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:03,360
just ended up getting interested in linux in my spare time and then i was lucky enough to be able

368
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:07,920
to go and do a computer science master's degree for a year and that was kind of a deep dive into

369
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:14,480
programming and you know databases and all sorts of other really difficult stuff that was honestly

370
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:20,640
way beyond me and it's way beyond what i do in my day job now my advice would be such as it is

371
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:27,280
anyway find an area that you find interesting enough to self-study on whether that's infrastructure

372
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:34,640
whether that's development whether that's testing whatever it might be and just do it you know find

373
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:38,960
a project that you know solve a real problem and find a project around your house that needs

374
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:45,840
automating if it's infrastructure for example or you know if it's development find a problem that

375
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:50,080
nobody else has solved or find a problem that's been solved you think you could solve better and

376
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:58,480
just just nibble away at it yourself and i'm not a huge believer in certifications per se i i get

377
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,800
free certifications through redhat which is a lucky perk of the job but i've i've only done a

378
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:08,480
handful and it's because i just don't necessarily think that simply by having those letters next to

379
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:16,400
my name it means that i actually know an awful lot more than the next person yeah it means that i

380
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:22,480
learned the answers to that specific test on that day in history five years ago maybe i don't know

381
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:28,160
it's it's it's useful in some ways because it gets your foot in the door with employers to say yes

382
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:35,600
i've done xyz but in other ways i'm much more interested in hiring somebody who is able to speak

383
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:42,000
passionately about a specific area and can demonstrate some open source work so you almost

384
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:47,040
just i think you almost just hit it there too like i wonder if it isn't a passion thing like he isn't

385
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:53,440
he isn't tearing into a problem and becoming the most knowledgeable person about that problem in

386
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:59,200
the world thus discovering a community their problems and providing a solution and then

387
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,960
getting employment through those networking connections instead it almost feels like

388
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:08,000
lawrence you're the biggest problem you're trying to solve is employment and i get that but getting

389
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:16,400
a job is not an ends of means itself it it's like just part of it like it the job should be reflective

390
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,960
of what you're really passionate about um and it's a tricky thing because i think i realize you gotta

391
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:24,720
get a job you gotta get money you gotta get paid but it feels like you kind of put the cart before

392
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:28,160
the horse like you're kind of trying different stuff you're excited about a lot of it you know

393
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:32,560
you want to work in this area i see this all the time but you don't have a specialty you don't have

394
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:37,040
a focus you don't necessarily have a passion and if you do well then that's your obvious answer

395
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:41,200
and that's what you should probably be going after recommend that you give coder radio a listen as

396
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:45,840
well mike and chris talk about this kind of stuff all the time i mean it's a bit more small business

397
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:49,520
focused but sometimes they talk about you know how to get into the industry and that kind of thing

398
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:54,320
yeah thank you that is it's probably a good tip all right so brad writes in who wants to know about

399
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:59,360
our thoughts on tap business cards so you know some are tied to websites some are tied to apps

400
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:04,240
i was curious if this is something you guys have used or consider i want to be more environmentally

401
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:09,680
conscious and most business cards they just get thrown away i wonder though how much telemetry is

402
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:15,040
gathered by these card companies and what they'll do with it regards brad have you seen these

403
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:20,880
digital credit cards there's app versions there's physical versions some of them are nfc based some

404
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:27,520
of them are something else seems open to abuse yeah but saying that i've had a contactless debit

405
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:33,440
card in my pocket for five or six years and it's it's only been cloned once theoretically i like

406
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:40,720
this idea right i prefer not having another piece of paper and if i get if i get a business card

407
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:45,040
that i actually care about i almost inevitably end up like scanning it with my phone or you know

408
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:50,800
some contact application but i did do some digging around there is there are projects out there in

409
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:56,240
fact one that's been going around this week that lets you build your own business card out of your

410
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:03,440
own parts and then you run linux on the thing and um i guess you could be a little more secure in

411
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:09,920
that i honestly i don't think this is ever going to take off i really don't and the reason why

412
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:18,480
and i'm just maybe it's old man chris here but back in my day our palm pilots had little

413
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:24,240
infrared blasters built into them so you could exchange contact information did you just play

414
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:30,320
the palm pilot card we have been trying to solve this problem literally since the late 90s

415
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:36,240
since fax machines were popular to have in the home we have been trying to solve this problem

416
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:41,920
and we have tried different technologies and nothing has stuck even even as palm pilot friends

417
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:46,000
you know we were kind of like all right let's let's try this and you'd line it up and it just

418
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,680
never really took off you know what's going to happen in the real world is you're going to make

419
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:53,600
a connection with someone and then you're going to unlock your phone pass it to them and they're

420
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:58,160
going to type in their number or send you a text or a telegram or hey what's your discord or your

421
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:02,640
twitter or whatever that's the reality it feels like that's going to be the reality as long as

422
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:06,560
we have multiple vendors making multiple operating systems that want to implement their own standards

423
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:12,480
and don't necessarily have incentive to interoperate with maybe each other right as long as that's

424
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:16,720
as long as we've got a coke and pepsi of phone manufacturers and coke and pepsi don't want to

425
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:21,040
share their secret recipe i don't think we're very likely to have universal electronic cards

426
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:26,640
that actually be adopted it needs to be as easy as like you know you bump watches you tap phones

427
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:31,040
and it's completely seamless and unless it's that it's never going to take off i thought i saw the

428
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:36,640
answer at conference a few years ago which was scanning a qr code on a conference's badge but

429
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:42,080
all that turned into was another way to track me and that's the last thing i want real-time brent

430
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:46,720
update for the show and he's missed his flight unfortunately by about 10 minutes so let's hope

431
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:52,640
that air canada take care take good care of him tonight uh anyway matt writes in hey self-hosted

432
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:58,000
crew i wanted to start out by saying thank you to the entire jb team for consistently putting out

433
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:07,280
top tier linux content stop i've been listening for a few years now and y'all how did i do with

434
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:13,440
that not bad have really helped me in my journey to becoming a linux sys admin i've been building

435
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:17,840
up my home lab and since i got the promotion a few months ago i was curious if you have talked

436
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:22,720
about smoke detectors water and flood detectors or that kind of thing on the show previously

437
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:27,280
i've been able to replace all the pipes in my house and i haven't had any leaks

438
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:32,240
but i'm concerned that something might happen in the future thanks again for all that you do

439
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,920
he loved the word y'all there's three y'alls in there and he's trying to make the british man say

440
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:42,000
you're doing great alex you're doing great i do like the word what have you done for smoke

441
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,400
detectors and the lot now do you have those integrated have you kept them separate they're

442
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:52,320
bog standard five dollar smoke detectors from amazon and i've got one above my 3d printer

443
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:57,680
i have a z wave smoke detector like i said i got a lot of z wave devices this i purchased november

444
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:04,640
20th 2020 so i've had it for a couple of years now and i've never had a fire so i don't really

445
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:10,080
have a lot to say but i bought it on a recommendation from the home assistant community

446
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:15,120
it's the first alert z wave smoke detector carbon monoxide alarm you just join it to your z wave

447
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:18,960
network like you would all your other devices and it shows up in home assistant with the alarm

448
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:25,520
component and i like it a lot it's really easy to replace the battery too it's just got a little

449
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:30,240
side tray that pops out so when you do have to replace the battery you can and because it's z

450
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:35,360
wave you could it's not a big battery hog it's just two double a batteries so i'll put a link to

451
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:41,520
this in the show notes for at least smoke detector now what about leak detectors previous friends of

452
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:47,200
the show shelly actually make some flood detectors which uh i'm reliably informed by one of my

453
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:52,000
neighbors who has a rental property out at the coast work extremely well and i'm fairly sure

454
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:59,120
that akara aqara make a leak detector as well and then of course sticking with the z wave theme over

455
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:06,720
here the aotech water leak sensor these aotechs they work great with home assistant they uh also

456
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:11,040
make some great sensors they're just a little expensive although their leak detector is only 36

457
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:17,600
bucks and 36 dollars it's money well spent to prevent a leak and then of course another actual

458
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:24,400
z wave device although i i don't use it but we've had people write in is the ring leak detectors

459
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:30,240
which i'm told are pretty decent and actually talk z wave never used them myself but if you

460
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:34,720
already have a ring camera or you want to experiment with it you could try the ring leak

461
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:39,920
detectors as well can't vouch for it personally but we've gotten pretty good email on it all

462
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:44,480
right we got some boost with some new podcast apps cos peeling was in first this week with

463
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:52,160
3690 sats and he was writing in about his pi os setup from our chat in pi for every problem

464
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:58,560
he says that i use tumbleweed on my quote desktop pies and then i use raspian on the headless cody

465
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:06,560
pies and he uses nfs to avoid using the sd card all together he says thanks for the show that's

466
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:10,560
all well and good but what happens when the nfs server's down well then you're probably not

467
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:18,000
watching your movies anyways or the network switches down or yeah yeah no i i agree you know

468
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:24,240
but i stream all of my television over the network now and it's been okay but yeah yeah nfs to run

469
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:33,360
the system that that could lead to a bad day sir lurks a lot boosted in with 1337 sats because i'm

470
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:39,680
also a big believer and a fan of the of your support of the matrix ecosystem i do run my own

471
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:44,080
home server i've done it for a couple of years now and i've given you lots of feedback and moral

472
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:49,680
support for running matrix but i wanted to chime in and say that i fully support your use of discord

473
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:55,680
as well it's not a zero-sum game self-hosting is a journey and shows like this are to help

474
00:44:55,680 --> 00:45:01,280
light the way but if neophytes are on discord you got to meet them there to bring them into the

475
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:07,280
tent hallelujah well put lurks a lot he goes on to say with a double boost coming in with another

476
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:12,400
elite set of sats he says also once they're on the path you know the show could help nudge them

477
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:16,880
to matrix one day i'm glad you have a couple of matrix room for the self-hosted show maybe

478
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:20,720
encourage people to engage and pay attention over there hey i'm paying attention over there

479
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:24,160
he says too bad there isn't a bridge good enough to bring them together it's a shame

480
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:31,520
but that is the way thanks lurks a lot yeah thank you and i think it's uh it's important

481
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:37,760
you know that we talk about this stuff because there's always a there's always prevailing wind

482
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:42,960
in in tech that for one company to win or one standard to win all the others have to lose and

483
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:48,640
i think it goes back to a steve jobs quote originally i think that i'm referencing here that

484
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:56,480
there's this idea that for apple to win microsoft has to lose and it's just not true and i think

485
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:02,000
the same is true of discord and matrix yes and i think this type of debate should i host it myself

486
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,720
should i just use the dang service uh what are the pros and cons i think that's something the

487
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:12,080
audience probably struggles with quite a bit i'd say it's probably the biggest part of self-hosting

488
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:18,880
is deciding is it worth my time or not fun deck hermit boosted him with 2000 sats he says there

489
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:25,120
is a podcast called the amp hour that's located in raleigh with a host named chris and he says

490
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:30,080
maybe there'd be some event organization that could happen sometime and who knows man there

491
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:35,600
is a good community in raleigh that could be a thing that happens i like the name too rally iot

492
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:41,040
riot that's a fun one he came in with an another double boost fun deck hermit did another elite

493
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:46,480
set of sats he says not only does the authentic proxy application adhere to the specific protocol

494
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:51,440
it can also form a protective layer around dumb applications like pup cloud or jacket

495
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:57,280
hmm it has an internal build and built-in proxy but that is optional we had that feedback from

496
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:03,920
a few folks actually that uh not only can authentic be the authentication provider but

497
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:08,480
it can also do the same job as orthalia is only able to do as well so you end up with the best

498
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:16,320
of both worlds so uh i suspect that's just bumped up my list of should try soon agreed sucd boosted

499
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:22,800
in with a baby row of ducks 222 sats because i use the software called flight aware on the raspberry

500
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:32,480
pie uh and you can order it as a complete hit ready to go so it's 120 bucks basically but it

501
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:37,360
comes with the transponder it comes with the pi zero the power supply the indoor antenna with

502
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:42,800
a magnetic base all the cables you need the sd card everything to just have your own flight

503
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:48,720
aware setup that could be genuinely a cost-effective way to get hold of a raspberry pi in 2022

504
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:57,280
i was gonna say that all right bronze wing boosted in with elite set of sats 1337

505
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:02,720
feeling my pain alex says my home pods and siri also seem to be way worse recently i used to be

506
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:09,440
able to say hey you know who it's movie time or open the middle garage door now she usually takes

507
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:15,840
at least a moment it's very frustrating get slower please keep us up to date if a fix shows up so an

508
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:21,040
old update on that alex you know one handy thing that i have is i kind of have an ab environment

509
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:26,880
i noticed that the siri tubes in the studio are all still working perfectly fine they still control

510
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:31,760
all the devices they recognize everything i say it's only the siri tubes in the rv

511
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:37,920
and i kind of almost wonder if it's something to do with the home assistant home kit integration

512
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:44,160
like something's gone awry in that setup but i'm not sure yet i had a theory that it was to do with

513
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:48,320
the profiles that these assistants build up on you over time so you know how they do the voice

514
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:54,160
matching at right at the beginning uh where your voice is just a generic voice amongst the herd but

515
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:59,360
over the years right they'll hear you speak more and they'll learn more and more and more and that

516
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:06,480
as those profiles are supposed to get better they actually get to a point of diminishing returns and

517
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:11,440
then they just fall off a cliff the other way that's a theory because what i was reading is

518
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:18,400
that if you go into your google account or whatever and delete the profiles they have on you

519
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:23,600
that people's experiences have improved dramatically and i just thought perhaps we could crowdsource

520
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:28,880
some folks willing to test that out for us you know this is a great example of the knobs that

521
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:33,600
we don't get access to anymore with all of these new services and devices they're just completely

522
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:40,080
hidden from us and it's just they they seem to get worse and worse and worse and there's no way to

523
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:44,640
do this and worse and worse and there's nothing we can do uh and bronzewing says so you know he

524
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:49,280
goes on to say i'm looking at mycroft it seems like maybe the right way to go but 300 is a

525
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:54,160
steep hardware entry i reserved one but i just couldn't pull the trigger when it actually came

526
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:59,520
time to buy it so i got two homepod minis instead but the voice recognition space just seems really

527
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:04,720
rough right now i feel like i completely agree with bronze and wig and there is clearly a solution

528
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:11,680
home assistant based local based but the bar is high in terms of performance let's just remember

529
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:19,440
christmas 1998 when alex got his first family computer and we were all sat around this thing

530
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:26,960
i think we got it from pc world and it was a time computers pc and we had via voice on this

531
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:32,240
thing i don't know if you remember that program of course i do you had to train this thing you

532
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:38,640
had to speak sentences into this thing to train the algorithm and it would input text to you on

533
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:44,800
on the screen and let's just pump the brakes and saying how bad they are before we actually

534
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:49,760
realize how good they are first of all please yeah the fact that they can even pick us up now

535
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:54,720
when we're holding these mobile devices in like any environment pretty much is incredible because

536
00:50:54,720 --> 00:51:00,160
back then you needed a really close microphone maybe even a headset microphone for good dictation

537
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:03,360
and getting that microphone to work with that computer was not a given

538
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:11,120
oh old computers oh man optimus gray boosted in just a day ago with a full row of ducks

539
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:16,640
2222 sats he says i was just listening to the podcast and i was syncing everything up

540
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:21,440
but you know what this episode 71 might just be one of my favorites it's got cooking proxmox

541
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:27,360
bit warden with ansible what else could you want also i agree brent needs some gas money

542
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:31,920
and don't tell alex that we'll all be touching his chair when we have a house party over there

543
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:37,840
i still have the sign up here no touchy the chair and you see this on the stream but that

544
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:42,800
just makes people want to touch it that just makes them want to touch it it's still up there

545
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:46,640
it's like uh it's like a sign that says don't kick me then people want to kick you true it's

546
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:51,600
true yeah i do have a punchable face i've been told i like the idea too that brent's

547
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:55,040
gonna have a party while you're gone like you know a teenager having a party while their parents are

548
00:51:55,040 --> 00:52:01,600
out do it i mean there is a million cameras around here he won't get away with it no no

549
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:04,640
but there's not much you'll be able to do i mean you know it's probably gonna be archie's fault

550
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:10,080
archie's gonna be a bad influence i imagine yeah yeah that dog does like to drink we got a double

551
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:15,120
boost some double boost this week that's great guys 500 sats from optimus gray again uh he says

552
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:22,640
i live in a three-story townhouse about 650 to 700 square feet per level one unify ap on top

553
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:30,160
and the lower floor but i get poor speeds on that second middle floor do i really need a third

554
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:36,000
unify ap i tried the unified tools but all my neighbors with their isp modems and routers set

555
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:41,360
to blast just seem to be configured poorly uh just run ethernet everywhere just plug your phone in

556
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:46,240
via ethernet that will solve that problem yeah right yeah what about wi-fi 6 i don't know if

557
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:50,960
you have modern enough devices to support wi-fi 6 that uses a bit of extra spectrum that some of

558
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:56,720
the other neighbors might not have uh obviously every device doesn't support it but generally

559
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:02,800
speaking the unified tools do an okay job of defining you know the the spectrum that's

560
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:06,640
available if you scan the channels it will automatically move things around for you

561
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:12,240
i do have a firmware on my robo vac which might be of interest i don't know if you have a robo vac

562
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:18,560
or anything like that but i can actually send my valetudo based robo vac around the house

563
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:24,320
and it will generate me a wi-fi heat map of the wi-fi access points wow so you get an idea of

564
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:27,760
where the signal is the strongest from the neighbors and stuff like that that's pretty fun

565
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:33,200
now you don't necessarily need a fancy pants vacuum to do that there are apps on your phone

566
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:37,680
which will let you do the same thing that might be a good place to start i wonder too optimist

567
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:45,680
like a price aside why not get the third ap it sounds like you've got a ton of channel crossover

568
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:50,720
from your neighbors similar situation where i'm at here at the studio it's i open up my wi-fi

569
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:55,200
network screen and i would be i mean i've never really counted because i just have to scroll and

570
00:53:55,200 --> 00:54:00,800
scroll but it's probably like 35 40 ap's i can pick up it's disgusting and i have to imagine

571
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:05,120
there's just a ton of channel overlap you could be faced the same thing especially in a townhouse

572
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:11,040
like i am could totally see that the other thing is you could be just on the point between those

573
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:18,320
two access points where the signal is about dropping off from both of them and your devices

574
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:22,480
don't know which one to pick so they might be flip-flopping between the two all the time trying

575
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:28,000
to do that handoff thing and depending on how they're mounted the generally the wi-fi signal

576
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:34,960
is a bubble right it's like a it's like a mushroom top it goes out up and around it doesn't necessarily

577
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:40,480
go down below the ap it doesn't like go behind the ap so you may have a mushroom dome of wi-fi

578
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:44,160
on the bottom floor and then you have a mushroom dome of wi-fi on the top and they're both just

579
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:48,560
not intersecting the middle floor as much plus you maybe got something in the walls too that

580
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:52,320
could also be an issue i've seen places that have metal in the walls and that blocks the signal

581
00:54:52,960 --> 00:55:01,040
we got a baller boost from dean dean i'm gonna say 70 10 70 maybe dean 10 70 sent us a boost

582
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:07,120
just a day ago 10 000 sats he's boosting the dip he says i just wanted to show my appreciation for

583
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:11,840
the self-hosted show i thoroughly enjoy the topics you discuss especially naz storage and home server

584
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:17,200
options keep up the great work well thank you dean for boosting the dip sats are on sale right now

585
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:22,400
we got 100 sats from user 65 94 that said thanks and also 100 sats from josh the chest

586
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:27,280
said it's a great time to boost the show sats are cheap if you want to send us a boost you can do

587
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:32,320
so by getting a podcasting 2.0 app at newpodcastapps.com or just go grab breeze if you

588
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:37,760
don't want to switch your app breez.technology or if you want to nerd it up but i don't think

589
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:44,720
anybody did this week you can use boost cli which is a command line tool pretty cool i guess you

590
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:49,280
gotta be pretty elite for that now the chat room we're asking for some real-time feedback on the

591
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:56,160
wi-fi based robo vac heat map i've just put a link to that in the chat it's called valoroni i think

592
00:55:56,800 --> 00:56:01,760
and uh take a look in the show notes it'll be in there as well that looks really cool alex

593
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:06,400
i figured it'd be a neat visualization but i didn't realize it would be that neat so yeah

594
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:13,760
what's such a neat and wild use case for a robot vacuum well the thing is i have a dedicated iot

595
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:19,520
network which is 2.4 gig for all of my you know robo vacs and cam smart cameras and all the other

596
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:25,920
wi-fi crap shellies that are in is in this house and so i used that to figure out where to put

597
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:30,880
you know different access points and it turned out in my kitchen there was a spot that was

598
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:36,320
underneath the stairs and just behind the washing machines and the fridge that was of course just

599
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:42,160
which is where my dining room table is you can picture it that had no wi-fi signal and obviously

600
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:48,080
the dining room table is where i spend some hours a week you know with laptop whilst you know cooking

601
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:53,680
is happening and what have you so i just got one of those unify in wall ap's and slapped it into an

602
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:58,240
old phone socket and and pulled the wires through the wall into the crawl space it was good to go

603
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:03,360
it was you know probably only an hour or two's worth of work very nice and that's a great idea

604
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:08,800
for an iot network talk about getting a real on the ground view of your network i want to say

605
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:14,960
thank you to our members our sre subscribers make the show possible they let us be really picky

606
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:20,320
about the sponsors we work with they give us the runway to keep the show going if we have to say

607
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:27,440
no to some sponsors and as a thank you we create an ad free feed of the show and also we tack on

608
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:32,400
a post show that is exclusive to them if you'd like to sign up support the show become a member

609
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:38,000
at self-hosted dot show slash sre and then i imagine shortly after the new although i probably

610
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:43,840
shouldn't commit to anything but after we get the new website out the door like the next thing on my

611
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:49,440
list is upgrading the member feed so we have live versions so you can do your boosts for the member

612
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:52,800
feeds and all that kind of stuff so that'll be probably later in the year after we get the

613
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:57,600
website out at the end of summer but all that stuff is being worked on for our sre members because you

614
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:03,200
guys matter a heck of a lot to us i think it is really important just to hammer home how important

615
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:10,560
independent media is these days you see stuff in all sorts of spaces about how there are sponsored

616
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:18,640
videos here and non-disclosed sponsorships and all that kind of stuff and having a audience funded

617
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:25,360
show really allows chris and myself and the rest of the jb team to be authentic to you guys yes we

618
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:31,200
have a couple of commercial sponsors but primarily the show is funded by you the listeners and i think

619
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:38,000
keeping independent media independent is hugely valuable to our society i couldn't have said it

620
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:43,440
better myself so self-hosted dot show slash sre if you'd like to sign up you can find our discord

community over there as well at self-hosted dot show slash discord and don't forget we have the

622
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:53,440

623
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:59,280
of stuff coming up in the next few weeks obviously we've got the london meetup on august 5th meetup.com

624
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:06,640
