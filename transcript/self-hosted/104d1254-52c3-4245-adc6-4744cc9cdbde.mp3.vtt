00:00.000 --> 00:04.720
Coming up on Self-Hosted 11, we might have found the perfect light switch for home automators,

00:04.720 --> 00:08.080
we jump into the hardware corner and talk about shuckin' drives,

00:08.080 --> 00:13.120
and we give you our favorite self-hosting blogging platforms, plus we answer some of your questions.

00:13.120 --> 00:14.000
I'm Chris.

00:14.000 --> 00:14.880
And I'm Alex.

00:14.880 --> 00:16.320
And this is Self-Hosted.

00:18.000 --> 00:19.440
Welcome back to Self-Hosted.

00:19.440 --> 00:22.400
There's so much we could talk about today, Alex,

00:22.400 --> 00:26.800
but I think we'll start with what you love to do, and that's shuckin' and jivin'.

00:26.800 --> 00:30.640
So our very own Joe Ressington reached out to me this week asking about hard drives.

00:30.640 --> 00:31.440
Which should he buy?

00:32.080 --> 00:34.320
Is shucking a hard drive good?

00:34.320 --> 00:35.600
Is it dangerous?

00:35.600 --> 00:36.720
Is he going to lose data?

00:36.720 --> 00:38.480
Is it an inferior quality product?

00:39.360 --> 00:41.600
I don't know, Chris, you have some experience with this, don't you?

00:41.600 --> 00:42.880
I do, thanks to you.

00:42.880 --> 00:48.080
I actually was a shuck-avoider for quite a while because I thought,

00:48.080 --> 00:51.760
maybe they're like slammin' their lower grade discs in these cases

00:51.760 --> 00:55.040
and sellin' them to suckers at the average consumer box store.

00:55.040 --> 00:58.000
And that kind of crossed my mind, and the other thing was is,

00:58.000 --> 00:59.680
until I understood a little bit better,

00:59.680 --> 01:04.400
I thought there was some sort of flashing or even soldering required

01:04.400 --> 01:07.680
to get these things to work in my actual PC.

01:08.240 --> 01:10.960
Which is still kind of the case, at least when it comes to modification,

01:10.960 --> 01:12.720
but it's not as dramatic as I thought.

01:12.720 --> 01:13.840
Nowhere near, no.

01:13.840 --> 01:16.720
So I actually have 14 of these things down in my basement.

01:16.720 --> 01:20.640
I bought 14 of these drives because I had a budget for drives,

01:20.640 --> 01:24.000
and then the Easy Stores came out and they were half the price.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.360
So I was gonna buy seven, so I just spent the same amount of money

01:27.360 --> 01:29.120
and got twice the amount.

01:29.120 --> 01:31.360
So for those of you that aren't familiar,

01:31.360 --> 01:36.480
Western Digital make a series of hard drives called the My Book,

01:37.040 --> 01:41.520
the Easy Store, there's a couple of other different names for them.

01:41.520 --> 01:45.440
But essentially what they are is just a standard SATA hard drive

01:45.440 --> 01:50.400
in a USB external enclosure that they sell for anywhere from

01:50.400 --> 01:57.760
120 pounds for eight terabytes to 14 terabytes for $200 in the States.

01:57.760 --> 02:00.320
You can get them in Europe on Amazon and stuff like that.

02:00.320 --> 02:03.280
So it's not just a US only deal, this one, which is great.

02:03.920 --> 02:07.360
The thing that I really like about these drives is they're just a great value.

02:07.360 --> 02:10.160
The price per terabyte is as low as you're gonna get

02:10.160 --> 02:13.520
without going to a shingled storage drive,

02:13.520 --> 02:15.840
like one of the Seagate Barracudas or something.

02:15.840 --> 02:18.880
I got a trick for you and I'll put a link in the show notes to this sucker.

02:18.880 --> 02:25.040
I subscribed to a Telegram hard drive sales channel that just broadcasts,

02:25.040 --> 02:30.080
it's just a read only channel that just broadcasts crazy great deals in storage.

02:30.080 --> 02:33.840
Here's a great one, eight terabytes for 114 US greenbacks.

02:33.840 --> 02:34.400
Wow.

02:34.400 --> 02:35.360
Yeah, that's not bad.

02:35.360 --> 02:36.160
That's great.

02:36.160 --> 02:37.600
And so I'll put a link to this in the show notes

02:37.600 --> 02:40.960
because you can watch this and then strategically order.

02:40.960 --> 02:42.960
And I think that's a great way to go about with storage

02:42.960 --> 02:45.120
is order before you need it and just be strategic.

02:45.120 --> 02:48.000
But the one thing we didn't touch on, well, there's two things really.

02:48.000 --> 02:51.120
But the one thing that I think maybe it's just worth your opinion on

02:51.120 --> 02:53.520
is what do you think about the quality of these disks

02:53.520 --> 02:59.040
versus buying something that's bare, maybe it costs a little bit more,

02:59.040 --> 03:02.640
but it's just that product, it's not inside some sort of enclosure.

03:03.200 --> 03:06.240
Hard drive brand loyalty is definitely a thing.

03:06.800 --> 03:13.680
I've had drives from Seagate, from HGST Hitachi, from Western Digital.

03:13.680 --> 03:17.600
Samsung back in the day used to make hard drives before that got swallowed up.

03:18.480 --> 03:20.560
And honestly, I've had them all fail.

03:20.560 --> 03:24.800
I've had all different manufacturers, I've all had a failure on all of them.

03:25.440 --> 03:28.640
And I've purchased maybe 25 or 30 drives over the last decade.

03:29.760 --> 03:32.560
So I don't actually have a huge amount of brand loyalty.

03:32.560 --> 03:37.360
The only one that really stands out for me as being much poorer than the rest is Seagate.

03:38.080 --> 03:41.920
Now, if you were to go to Backblaze and look at their quarterly hard drive stats,

03:41.920 --> 03:45.920
they have some really interesting data because over the last decade or so,

03:46.560 --> 03:49.840
they've actually published a series of statistics

03:49.840 --> 03:52.640
from all the consumer grade hard drives they've been buying.

03:52.640 --> 03:56.560
So their backup service is actually running on top of consumer grade hard drives,

03:56.560 --> 03:57.360
or it certainly was.

03:57.360 --> 04:01.840
I think that's slowly moving into the enterprise type drives

04:01.840 --> 04:03.440
now that their business is expanding.

04:04.000 --> 04:09.040
But it's really the only major data point on the internet that we have besides

04:09.040 --> 04:14.960
people on Reddit going, oh yes, my Western Digital drives died three times in six months.

04:14.960 --> 04:17.760
I'm with you though on the brand loyalty thing.

04:17.760 --> 04:19.520
I've had them all die on me.

04:19.520 --> 04:24.640
And a lot of times I've found the ones to be in these enclosures to be fairly reliable.

04:24.640 --> 04:26.880
I think the manufacturer may expect them for it.

04:26.880 --> 04:30.000
So I actually don't think there's much of an issue of quality.

04:30.720 --> 04:32.480
Is he going to have to solder though?

04:32.480 --> 04:33.520
No, definitely not.

04:34.480 --> 04:35.360
I say definitely not.

04:35.360 --> 04:39.440
And I really hope I'm not proved wrong by the time it arrives.

04:39.440 --> 04:43.120
My experience has been with all of the easy stores that I've purchased

04:43.120 --> 04:46.800
is you need a couple of guitar picks and a couple of credit cards to pop the case open.

04:47.440 --> 04:50.960
No damage, takes maybe five minutes for the first time

04:50.960 --> 04:54.400
and then a couple of minutes once you learn where the clips are.

04:55.040 --> 04:58.240
And inside there's a small board about the size of a credit card again

04:58.240 --> 05:04.720
that has a USB 3 to SATA conversion chip on it and you unplug that.

05:04.720 --> 05:06.800
And then you have a normal SATA hard drive.

05:07.440 --> 05:09.520
Now there is one thing to be aware of.

05:10.240 --> 05:17.280
These drives respect the 3.3 volt pin reset in the SATA power standard.

05:17.920 --> 05:23.040
Now a lot of people have said that this is a way for Western Digital to quote unquote,

05:23.040 --> 05:26.480
gimp the drives, but it's actually part of the SATA spec.

05:27.120 --> 05:30.640
So in the data center, when you have racks and racks of these things,

05:30.640 --> 05:33.440
you don't want to have to go and pull a drive physically.

05:33.440 --> 05:36.400
You want to be able to reset that drive remotely.

05:36.400 --> 05:40.160
And the way that these drives do that is as soon as they detect some power

05:40.160 --> 05:44.000
on the 3.3 volt rail is they power cycle.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.080
The drive itself basically reboots.

05:47.120 --> 05:51.680
Now most consumer power supplies have a 3.3 volt rail on them.

05:52.240 --> 05:57.360
Thus, if you try and connect a consumer power supply to this drive,

05:57.360 --> 05:59.920
it will think it's constantly trying to be rebooted.

05:59.920 --> 06:02.880
Therefore, your BIOS won't see the drive.

06:02.880 --> 06:05.040
There's a very, very simple fix.

06:05.040 --> 06:11.200
Get a tiny, tiny piece of captain tape, maybe two, three, four millimeters across.

06:12.000 --> 06:18.240
Put that over the leftmost pins on the power port of the hard drive and it will just work.

06:18.240 --> 06:24.960
Now I actually made custom power cables and omitted the 3.3 volt cable completely from mine.

06:24.960 --> 06:30.320
I bought some Cable Matters SATA power splitters off Amazon and just did it that way.

06:30.320 --> 06:31.760
It took me half an hour.

06:32.720 --> 06:35.840
But there's a great video from the Bite My Bits YouTube channel,

06:35.840 --> 06:37.680
which we'll have a link to in the show notes,

06:37.680 --> 06:43.600
about how to put captain tape over the power pins of your EasyStore hard drive.

06:43.600 --> 06:45.840
One thing to note with these is you don't always know exactly

06:45.840 --> 06:48.640
what type of disk you're getting in the enclosure.

06:48.640 --> 06:50.880
I mean, you might know if you get a Western Digital enclosure

06:50.880 --> 06:54.960
that it's going to be a Western Digital drive or a Seagate or whatever,

06:54.960 --> 06:56.720
but you don't necessarily know what type.

06:56.720 --> 07:02.320
Western Digital like to sell you lots of very similar products

07:02.320 --> 07:04.960
with lots of different colored stickers on the front.

07:04.960 --> 07:08.320
So they have green for energy efficient drives.

07:08.320 --> 07:10.560
They have blue for standard desktop.

07:11.120 --> 07:16.800
Red is NAS and then they have red pro, which is for NAS pros uses.

07:16.800 --> 07:18.080
I don't really understand that one.

07:18.080 --> 07:22.480
Yeah, not just regular NASs, but serious NASs.

07:22.480 --> 07:28.400
Well, the difference is standard red is 5,400 RPM and red pros are 7,200 RPM.

07:29.280 --> 07:32.000
Those red drives apparently have special firmware

07:32.000 --> 07:35.440
that deals with TLER resets better for RAID users.

07:36.320 --> 07:38.240
Give me a break, that sounds like marketing to me.

07:38.800 --> 07:39.520
I mean, maybe.

07:40.400 --> 07:42.960
Sometimes they lack features intentionally

07:42.960 --> 07:44.960
just to make you buy something different.

07:44.960 --> 07:46.960
I mean, that's not uncommon in the industry.

07:46.960 --> 07:50.560
No shock, that's not like marketing, is it?

07:50.560 --> 07:52.400
And there's purple for surveillance as well.

07:52.400 --> 07:55.440
So obviously you need a different type of hard drive for surveillance

07:55.440 --> 07:58.160
than you do for just storing movies or whatever.

07:59.760 --> 08:02.800
Now, the drives that come inside these easy stores,

08:02.800 --> 08:06.320
there's an awful lot of conjecture online as to what's in there.

08:06.320 --> 08:07.840
The only thing we can be absolutely certain of

08:07.840 --> 08:10.480
is that they're what are called white label drives.

08:10.480 --> 08:13.840
Now, most people say that they are probably rebadged reds

08:13.840 --> 08:17.120
or drives that were supposed to be a larger capacity

08:17.120 --> 08:19.600
that didn't meet QC control.

08:19.600 --> 08:22.400
And so they just, let's say it was gonna be a 14 terabyte drive

08:22.400 --> 08:24.400
and only 11 terabytes was usable.

08:24.400 --> 08:26.720
So they slapped a 10 terabyte sticker on the front of it.

08:26.720 --> 08:29.920
And we have no real way of knowing, honestly,

08:29.920 --> 08:32.000
but there's an awful lot of good information

08:32.000 --> 08:34.240
over on the data hoarder subreddit

08:34.240 --> 08:36.080
if you're curious about this sort of stuff.

08:36.080 --> 08:37.600
Oh, that's a great resource.

08:37.600 --> 08:38.960
I forget about that subreddit.

08:39.440 --> 08:41.760
My thought was they wouldn't necessarily

08:41.760 --> 08:43.920
wanna put low quality components in there

08:43.920 --> 08:46.080
because that just is gonna create a support

08:46.080 --> 08:47.520
and brand nightmare.

08:48.400 --> 08:50.800
And a lot of people use these as backups,

08:50.800 --> 08:53.840
have them just connect to the PC running 24 seven.

08:54.400 --> 08:57.040
So they must take that into consideration.

08:57.040 --> 08:58.320
Who really knows?

08:58.320 --> 08:59.440
Right, and that's it.

08:59.440 --> 09:02.560
You know, I don't really worry too much

09:02.560 --> 09:04.880
about an individual hard drive failing anymore

09:04.880 --> 09:07.920
because for me, an individual hard drive failing

09:07.920 --> 09:08.880
is just an annoyance

09:08.880 --> 09:10.720
because I have stuff backed up everywhere else.

09:10.720 --> 09:12.080
Because I've been through that pain

09:12.080 --> 09:14.400
of having a drive actually fail and losing stuff.

09:14.400 --> 09:16.240
It's not something you wanna happen twice.

09:16.240 --> 09:16.800
Yeah, I agree.

09:16.800 --> 09:18.960
That's tricky though when budgets are tight

09:18.960 --> 09:22.080
and the amount of data is a lot, it's tricky.

09:22.080 --> 09:24.000
It's tricky when you wanna duplicate it.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.320
So I can understand wanting to measure twice

09:26.320 --> 09:28.000
and cut once.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.760
While we're talking about hardware though,

09:30.480 --> 09:32.000
I understand you got a device

09:32.000 --> 09:35.920
that I have toyed with the idea of getting over the years

09:35.920 --> 09:37.760
and it's the HD Home Run,

09:37.760 --> 09:41.360
which I think is a pretty slick little device,

09:41.360 --> 09:42.960
but I'm curious what your thoughts are.

09:43.600 --> 09:45.280
Yeah, it's really interesting.

09:45.280 --> 09:47.680
It's a network based TV tuner.

09:47.680 --> 09:50.640
So effectively it has a TV tuner

09:50.640 --> 09:52.320
and an ethernet jack on it.

09:52.320 --> 09:56.000
It's about the size of maybe a deck of cards and a half.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.520
That's a terrible way to measure something,

09:57.520 --> 09:58.960
but it's not very big anyway.

09:58.960 --> 09:59.840
I'm an old man.

10:00.880 --> 10:02.880
Maybe a couple of CD cases stacked

10:02.880 --> 10:04.320
on top of each other or something.

10:04.320 --> 10:05.440
Now I'm really an old man

10:05.440 --> 10:08.080
because I'm talking about optical media.

10:08.080 --> 10:08.580
Yeah.

10:10.160 --> 10:12.640
You know, it's about the size of a VHS,

10:12.640 --> 10:14.000
you're saying there, Alex.

10:14.000 --> 10:14.960
No, a Betamax.

10:17.040 --> 10:18.560
That's before my time, I'll tell you what.

10:19.120 --> 10:20.800
So I was wondering, you got,

10:20.800 --> 10:22.000
cause there's different kinds, right?

10:22.000 --> 10:24.320
But the HD Home Run is pretty famous for their network one.

10:24.320 --> 10:26.320
And I'm really new to this whole area,

10:26.320 --> 10:28.560
but it seems like you could also get ones

10:28.560 --> 10:30.320
that like hook into the back of equipment.

10:30.320 --> 10:32.160
There's a whole different kind.

10:32.160 --> 10:34.720
I just got the one that has two tuners built into it

10:34.720 --> 10:37.040
and receives over the air broadcasts.

10:37.040 --> 10:39.360
I wanted a way to watch my local TV station

10:40.160 --> 10:43.680
for news when there's like a hurricane coming

10:43.680 --> 10:45.200
or, you know, stuff like that.

10:45.200 --> 10:47.760
Cause YouTube TV is kind of expensive.

10:47.760 --> 10:48.240
Yeah, it is.

10:48.800 --> 10:50.160
So can I just go through your setup?

10:50.160 --> 10:51.840
Do you have an antenna on the roof

10:51.840 --> 10:52.880
or what's that setup like?

10:53.440 --> 10:56.720
I went to Best Buy and spent $20 on a flat.

10:57.520 --> 11:00.080
It's about the size of a sheet of A4 paper

11:00.080 --> 11:03.760
and it sticks on the wall in the closet behind me.

11:03.760 --> 11:06.800
And that wall is an outside facing wall.

11:06.800 --> 11:09.040
So it's, you know, American houses are made of cardboard.

11:09.040 --> 11:14.160
So it's no problem to get the signal through that wall.

11:14.160 --> 11:16.960
I hope your home isn't made out of cardboard.

11:18.080 --> 11:20.400
Compared to the brick and slate of a British house

11:20.400 --> 11:21.440
is what I mean.

11:21.440 --> 11:22.080
Yeah.

11:22.080 --> 11:24.080
How far from the transmitter are you?

11:24.080 --> 11:24.880
Did you look that up?

11:25.760 --> 11:27.360
Yeah, it's on the south side of Raleigh

11:27.360 --> 11:28.080
and I'm on the north.

11:28.080 --> 11:31.040
So it's about 15 to 20 miles or so.

11:31.040 --> 11:32.080
So it's a decent throw.

11:32.080 --> 11:34.320
Now this thing, I was expecting to have to, you know,

11:34.320 --> 11:37.920
go into Plex and then find the IP address of the HD Home Run

11:37.920 --> 11:40.560
and then sign in and create an account

11:40.560 --> 11:41.600
and do all this kind of stuff.

11:42.640 --> 11:45.360
And so I plugged in the HD Home Run in the closet,

11:45.360 --> 11:46.960
plugged it into the Ethernet jack,

11:46.960 --> 11:49.200
downloaded the HD Home Run app on my phone.

11:50.000 --> 11:54.080
And the instant, and I mean the instant I opened the app,

11:54.080 --> 11:55.280
I was watching the NFL.

11:55.280 --> 11:57.120
No account creation or?

11:57.120 --> 11:58.400
I didn't have to configure.

11:58.400 --> 12:00.640
I didn't have to scan, nothing.

12:00.640 --> 12:02.160
It was wonderful.

12:02.160 --> 12:02.960
That is really nice.

12:02.960 --> 12:05.360
So it must be doing some sort of DNS magic there

12:05.360 --> 12:06.560
so it can discover it.

12:06.560 --> 12:08.320
Does Plex find it all right then too?

12:08.320 --> 12:12.640
Plex has a live TV and DVR section in your server settings.

12:13.200 --> 12:14.880
So you simply go into there,

12:14.880 --> 12:16.560
click the button that says Add Device,

12:17.120 --> 12:19.680
enter the IP address of the HD Home Run,

12:19.680 --> 12:21.520
and then you're done.

12:21.520 --> 12:23.200
It's unbelievably simple.

12:23.200 --> 12:24.960
One of my favorite things to do in the RV

12:24.960 --> 12:28.160
when I get to a new town is throw up the old antenna,

12:28.160 --> 12:31.760
just throw up the old antenna, do a scan of all the local HD,

12:31.760 --> 12:33.920
and just blast through the local television,

12:33.920 --> 12:35.360
get a flavor of the area.

12:35.360 --> 12:36.800
That's part of travel, isn't it?

12:36.800 --> 12:37.200
Yeah.

12:37.200 --> 12:39.360
We were in Wyoming this year at Yellowstone,

12:39.360 --> 12:42.640
and I quite enjoyed watching the coal miners complaining

12:42.640 --> 12:44.960
about how coal is a dying industry.

12:44.960 --> 12:46.720
And I'm like, yep, it probably is.

12:46.720 --> 12:49.280
Burning dead dinosaurs is not sustainable, go figure.

12:50.160 --> 12:51.920
And as somebody who's kind of into production stuff,

12:51.920 --> 12:54.000
I love watching the styles and all of that stuff.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.640
So I've always wondered maybe if I put one in there

12:56.640 --> 12:59.840
and, you know, just, I don't know, I love it.

12:59.840 --> 13:01.440
And there's always that little news bulletin

13:01.440 --> 13:02.960
about iguanas falling out of trees.

13:02.960 --> 13:04.640
Did you see that about in Miami this morning?

13:06.880 --> 13:08.880
It went down to like 40 or something overnight,

13:08.880 --> 13:10.560
so everyone in Florida is freaking out.

13:10.560 --> 13:11.760
That's the end of the world.

13:11.760 --> 13:13.840
Yeah, the iguanas don't like that, that's for sure.

13:14.720 --> 13:16.720
So first impressions, pretty good.

13:16.720 --> 13:18.240
How long have you been running this thing?

13:18.240 --> 13:19.840
A couple of weeks now, yeah.

13:19.840 --> 13:21.200
I mean, we don't use it a whole bunch.

13:21.200 --> 13:25.600
It's just there as a, oh, I want to watch the local NFL game

13:25.600 --> 13:27.520
just to, you know, see what's going on.

13:27.520 --> 13:28.960
I've got friends over or whatever.

13:28.960 --> 13:31.840
I really do feel like I am not getting the value

13:31.840 --> 13:33.520
from my YouTube TV subscription.

13:33.520 --> 13:36.640
It's nice right now with all of the news that's going on.

13:36.640 --> 13:38.400
So I've probably been using it more heavily

13:38.400 --> 13:40.160
than I ever have before.

13:40.160 --> 13:43.040
But for most of the year, once or twice a week,

13:43.040 --> 13:44.960
I turn it on just to check something.

13:44.960 --> 13:46.480
I can't stand live TV.

13:46.480 --> 13:47.760
Yeah, so awful.

13:47.760 --> 13:50.720
See, I got YouTube TV last year for the Formula One stuff

13:50.720 --> 13:54.160
that's on ESPN, but the Formula One TV,

13:54.160 --> 13:56.800
F1 TV stuff is getting a bit better.

13:56.800 --> 13:58.800
You know, MotoGP is the gold standard

13:58.800 --> 14:01.600
for that kind of thing, or the MLB one.

14:02.400 --> 14:04.880
And Formula One's still got some catching up to do,

14:04.880 --> 14:06.080
but it's getting there.

14:06.080 --> 14:08.240
And YouTube used to be like 30 bucks,

14:08.240 --> 14:10.480
and then it went to 40, and now it's like 50.

14:11.120 --> 14:12.800
Yes, that's too much.

14:13.360 --> 14:15.680
Well, Alex, congratulations.

14:15.680 --> 14:17.520
I'll check in a little bit and see how you like it.

14:17.520 --> 14:21.120
See how the DVR stuff works, all that kind of thing.

14:21.120 --> 14:23.440
What do you say we talk about something that I got stuck,

14:23.440 --> 14:25.840
I got stuck in like a time loop this week,

14:25.840 --> 14:28.640
installing WordPress over and over and over again.

14:28.640 --> 14:30.480
And it seems like you have spent some time

14:30.480 --> 14:32.400
since we last got together thinking about

14:32.400 --> 14:35.040
self-hosted blogging platforms like Ghost,

14:35.520 --> 14:37.760
which I am intensely interested in.

14:38.320 --> 14:40.960
I was deploying different WordPress scenarios

14:40.960 --> 14:43.520
to kind of just get a feel for my different options.

14:43.520 --> 14:45.520
So I just got out of this.

14:45.520 --> 14:47.120
So I'm really fresh on all this stuff.

14:47.120 --> 14:49.040
And I think I've walked away with a favorite,

14:49.040 --> 14:50.240
depending on your usage.

14:50.240 --> 14:53.440
I used to use WordPress quite a while ago.

14:53.440 --> 14:56.000
The beginning of my open source journey, so to speak,

14:56.000 --> 15:00.400
was writing down everything I was doing on my blog

15:00.400 --> 15:02.080
so that I could remember how I did it.

15:02.080 --> 15:04.160
So that next time I wouldn't have to go and Google,

15:04.160 --> 15:06.000
you know, 15 different stack exchange

15:06.000 --> 15:08.400
or stack overflow posts to figure out

15:08.400 --> 15:10.000
how to compile a kernel and that kind of thing.

15:10.720 --> 15:13.280
That then led into a few people noticing

15:13.280 --> 15:15.360
what I was doing on the unraid side of things,

15:15.360 --> 15:18.080
which led into the creation of linuxserver.io.

15:18.080 --> 15:21.360
So I moved my personal blog from WordPress

15:21.360 --> 15:22.880
to the linuxserver.io site.

15:23.680 --> 15:26.560
And then Ghost came along

15:26.560 --> 15:30.640
and I switched out the Linux server blog to Ghost,

15:31.200 --> 15:32.640
probably 2014 or so.

15:33.280 --> 15:36.080
And we imported all of the WordPress stuff back then

15:36.640 --> 15:38.800
that I'd accumulated from my personal blog.

15:38.800 --> 15:40.800
And there was a bunch of cruft in there,

15:40.800 --> 15:42.240
some of which has been deleted,

15:42.240 --> 15:43.360
some of which is still there.

15:43.360 --> 15:48.480
And I think my favorite for a long-term simple solution

15:48.480 --> 15:53.600
is Ghost because I've used it for probably five years,

15:53.600 --> 15:54.720
maybe more at this point.

15:55.760 --> 15:57.360
It's dead stupid simple.

15:57.360 --> 15:59.280
It uses almost no resources.

15:59.280 --> 16:01.760
They've constantly improved the product.

16:02.880 --> 16:03.600
It's free.

16:04.080 --> 16:08.720
They provide a Docker for me and it's just great.

16:08.720 --> 16:10.720
You know, the interface is clean and simple.

16:10.720 --> 16:12.080
The themes are pretty good.

16:12.080 --> 16:14.480
I can now do galleries of images.

16:14.480 --> 16:16.880
And it's a markdown editor.

16:16.880 --> 16:18.000
What more do you want?

16:18.000 --> 16:21.600
Yeah, that markdown aspect is what initially caught my attention.

16:21.600 --> 16:23.200
It also checks a few boxes.

16:23.200 --> 16:25.280
It's MIT licensed, so it's free.

16:25.280 --> 16:26.800
It's coded in Node.js,

16:27.600 --> 16:30.000
which is a server-side JavaScript engine.

16:30.000 --> 16:33.200
So it's all essentially one big running application

16:33.200 --> 16:34.880
on the server side, from my understanding.

16:36.240 --> 16:38.720
And it also uses Ember.js as the admin client.

16:38.720 --> 16:40.320
So there's the interface that's powered by that.

16:40.320 --> 16:43.200
You get analytics, it's got all of that in there.

16:44.400 --> 16:47.440
I was looking at WordPress simply because

16:47.440 --> 16:51.200
I'm thinking about doing side podcasting as a creative outlet

16:51.920 --> 16:54.560
and just want to have something that ties in really nicely

16:54.560 --> 16:56.240
with some of that infrastructure.

16:56.800 --> 17:00.640
And WordPress plugins are still the golden standard in that area

17:00.640 --> 17:03.120
when you're working with podcast hosting services and whatnot.

17:03.120 --> 17:04.960
It's all about the WordPress plugins.

17:04.960 --> 17:08.320
However, I wonder if it wouldn't be worth rolling it myself

17:08.320 --> 17:10.720
just to use something like Ghost.

17:10.720 --> 17:13.360
Isn't WordPress really insecure though?

17:14.160 --> 17:15.360
I think that's kind of unfair.

17:15.360 --> 17:18.960
I mean, I think any large open source project has vulnerabilities.

17:18.960 --> 17:22.960
I say, if you go WordPress, you go with a commitment to keep it current.

17:22.960 --> 17:26.160
And you got to build your system in a way that allows it to stay update.

17:26.160 --> 17:27.680
And if you can't keep it up to date,

17:28.320 --> 17:29.920
you probably shouldn't be using WordPress.

17:29.920 --> 17:32.080
Maybe you shouldn't be using Ghost either then, maybe.

17:32.080 --> 17:34.240
Or hosted WordPress, I suppose.

17:34.240 --> 17:36.320
I mean, let's be really frank about this.

17:36.320 --> 17:39.440
Before I tell you what my solution is, I think it's really important

17:39.440 --> 17:42.320
that we talk about the reality here.

17:42.320 --> 17:45.920
Not only do you need to keep your CMS up to date,

17:45.920 --> 17:47.760
but if you're hosting on a VPS,

17:47.760 --> 17:52.160
you've got to be committed to some security practices like updates,

17:52.720 --> 17:54.320
perhaps something like a firewall.

17:54.880 --> 17:57.760
I think DigitalOcean actually make this so simple

17:57.760 --> 18:01.760
that it's not any more complicated than doing a Squarespace, in my opinion.

18:03.040 --> 18:05.120
Obviously, you need to understand a little bit about

18:05.120 --> 18:07.120
Docker and maybe Docker Compose,

18:07.120 --> 18:09.920
and understanding how to create a container.

18:09.920 --> 18:14.720
But beyond that, if you can SSH and set up SSH keys and stuff like that,

18:14.720 --> 18:18.400
I think, generally speaking, there's a few features that DO offer,

18:18.400 --> 18:21.440
such as their firewall, their backups and snapshots,

18:21.440 --> 18:25.840
and that kind of thing that make it a pretty safe option.

18:26.560 --> 18:31.040
I've been hosting mine on DO since I started, so 2013, I think.

18:31.040 --> 18:36.960
And just on the $5 a month droplet, and it's just been pretty reliable.

18:36.960 --> 18:39.760
There's been a couple of minor outages, but it's been pretty good.

18:39.760 --> 18:41.600
This go-around, I tried Linode.

18:41.600 --> 18:44.080
I've always been following the company,

18:44.080 --> 18:46.720
but was really happy with DigitalOcean.

18:46.720 --> 18:47.680
This time around, I thought, you know,

18:47.680 --> 18:49.520
if I'm doing a side project, doing a hobby thing,

18:49.520 --> 18:54.240
I should make it totally separate, totally isolated from the JB stuff.

18:54.240 --> 18:57.120
So I used this as an opportunity to try out Linode.

18:57.120 --> 18:59.600
And I'm happy to say I was really happy with it.

18:59.600 --> 19:01.520
And I'm happy to say I was impressed.

19:02.240 --> 19:03.520
Performance is pretty good.

19:03.520 --> 19:05.520
They have a lot of the same snapshotting

19:05.520 --> 19:08.800
and automatic backup features that you'd come to expect.

19:09.680 --> 19:13.280
And they'll let you add an SSH key at the time of spin up,

19:13.280 --> 19:15.360
which I think is such a great feature.

19:15.360 --> 19:16.720
Very valuable, yep.

19:16.720 --> 19:18.240
It's the way to do this.

19:18.240 --> 19:19.760
It is really the way to do this.

19:21.120 --> 19:24.000
But they also have something else that DigitalOcean don't have.

19:24.000 --> 19:29.200
And that is these stack scripts that the community writes

19:29.200 --> 19:32.080
that then get voted on and you get a number of deployments.

19:32.720 --> 19:37.200
And one that I noticed was OpenLightSpeed's WordPress stack script.

19:37.200 --> 19:38.560
So I took a look at what they're doing here

19:38.560 --> 19:40.240
and I thought, well, what's this about?

19:40.240 --> 19:43.760
OpenLightSpeed is, I guess, at high level,

19:43.760 --> 19:46.720
it's a NGINX Apache alternative.

19:46.720 --> 19:51.120
And it is combined with a caching engine.

19:51.120 --> 19:54.880
So it's a web server that works in conjunction with a cache

19:54.880 --> 19:57.280
that runs in memory and they're aware of each other.

19:57.280 --> 20:00.720
And then it's also working in conjunction

20:00.720 --> 20:02.240
with a WordPress plugin.

20:02.240 --> 20:05.200
So WordPress is aware of this cache

20:05.200 --> 20:07.840
and uses that cache for its assets.

20:07.840 --> 20:10.880
And this little plugin generates a static version of WordPress

20:10.880 --> 20:13.600
and then puts the assets in the cache

20:13.600 --> 20:16.640
and it makes it very fast.

20:16.640 --> 20:18.480
It makes it so fast.

20:18.480 --> 20:22.320
And this stack sets up an 1804 Ubuntu LTS system.

20:22.880 --> 20:24.800
Statically hosted WordPress, huh?

20:24.800 --> 20:27.840
They claim it's 300 times faster

20:27.840 --> 20:29.360
than a standard WordPress install.

20:29.360 --> 20:31.920
I don't know if that's true, but it's noticeably faster.

20:32.640 --> 20:35.280
And the other thing that I really appreciate about this

20:35.280 --> 20:38.000
is that script is all laid out for you to go through

20:38.000 --> 20:39.520
because I also wanna make this point.

20:40.320 --> 20:41.920
The other thing that was a little disappointing to see

20:41.920 --> 20:43.760
is the most popular stack scripts

20:43.760 --> 20:48.240
are the ones that install these really awful control panels

20:48.240 --> 20:51.760
that are supposedly giving you one-click deployments.

20:51.760 --> 20:53.680
Yes, I realize I just advocated for a script.

20:53.680 --> 20:56.240
You have to just kind of take each with its own.

20:56.240 --> 20:58.960
It's all sort of an individual basis.

20:58.960 --> 21:01.600
But I wanna kind of caution against that.

21:01.600 --> 21:03.840
If you're gonna take the step of hosting it yourself,

21:03.840 --> 21:06.480
I strongly recommend you understand how to set it up.

21:06.480 --> 21:07.920
Earlier when Alex was saying

21:07.920 --> 21:09.600
you should probably know a little Docker compose

21:09.600 --> 21:11.200
and how to set up a container,

21:11.200 --> 21:13.040
that's his way of saying you should go

21:13.040 --> 21:15.360
all the way through the process of installing the OS

21:15.360 --> 21:16.720
and doing these in containers

21:16.720 --> 21:18.080
so that way you can properly manage them

21:18.080 --> 21:19.520
once you understand that.

21:19.520 --> 21:21.280
And if that feels overwhelming to you

21:21.280 --> 21:22.880
and there's nothing wrong with that,

21:22.880 --> 21:24.080
and there's nothing wrong with that

21:24.080 --> 21:25.360
because everybody's at a different level,

21:26.400 --> 21:28.240
you may wanna look at hosting options

21:28.240 --> 21:29.920
that manage some of that stuff for you

21:29.920 --> 21:32.480
because it will become a nightmare.

21:32.480 --> 21:34.800
It'll become something that you need to take care of

21:34.800 --> 21:36.960
when you're super busy and you've got other stuff going on.

21:38.240 --> 21:40.160
A family friend of mine

21:40.160 --> 21:42.960
just had their business website hijacked.

21:42.960 --> 21:45.920
It was on an old GoDaddy WordPress site

21:45.920 --> 21:47.840
that GoDaddy doesn't auto-update.

21:47.840 --> 21:49.360
They update the OS,

21:49.360 --> 21:53.040
but the application level updates are on the customers.

21:53.040 --> 21:55.440
And so their customers were getting sent

21:55.440 --> 21:58.560
to a bogus pharmacy website

21:58.560 --> 22:00.720
when they came to visit their website,

22:00.720 --> 22:03.120
which is in the restaurant industry.

22:03.120 --> 22:06.480
And it took them over a week to get it back

22:06.480 --> 22:10.480
and getting me involved to help them recover it.

22:12.400 --> 22:14.160
It's just updating their WordPress install

22:14.160 --> 22:16.400
doesn't come on their mind frequently.

22:16.400 --> 22:18.400
And I think it had been over nine, 10 months

22:18.400 --> 22:19.760
since they'd done an update.

22:19.760 --> 22:21.520
Yeah, if you're not that way inclined,

22:21.520 --> 22:23.600
it's very easy to let that thing get out of hand.

22:24.480 --> 22:28.080
Just think about the reality of what Chris just said.

22:28.080 --> 22:30.160
If you've put your heart and soul into a blog

22:30.160 --> 22:33.920
for six months, 12 months, years,

22:33.920 --> 22:35.200
and it suddenly went away

22:35.200 --> 22:37.360
and you didn't have a backup of that thing,

22:37.360 --> 22:38.560
how would you feel?

22:38.560 --> 22:41.760
And is that feeling worth a few bucks, maybe?

22:41.760 --> 22:43.600
Well, Alex, this just might turn into a corner

22:43.600 --> 22:44.960
because there's probably a lot of things

22:44.960 --> 22:46.800
we could talk about, a lot of tips,

22:46.800 --> 22:48.320
and the audience probably has a few ideas.

22:48.320 --> 22:51.040
So if this is an area you'd like us to explore more,

22:51.040 --> 22:53.040
they need to give us a nudge.

22:54.320 --> 22:56.960
We need to come up with some other blogging platforms as well

22:56.960 --> 22:58.240
because I know there's Jekyll,

22:58.240 --> 23:00.000
I mean, there's hundreds, hundreds.

23:00.000 --> 23:00.480
Yeah.

23:00.480 --> 23:02.240
I like Ghost, you like WordPress,

23:02.240 --> 23:03.440
but there are loads of others.

23:03.440 --> 23:04.640
And feel free to let us know

23:04.640 --> 23:07.520
because those are the two we have the most experience with,

23:07.520 --> 23:10.080
but it doesn't necessarily mean they are the best.

23:10.800 --> 23:13.280
I have a project off-grid update.

23:13.280 --> 23:16.240
This Sunday, we head down to the Eugene, Oregon area

23:16.240 --> 23:17.200
for the big install.

23:17.200 --> 23:18.800
I've decided to go ahead with it.

23:18.800 --> 23:22.240
Just a reminder, we're getting about 500 watts of solar installed.

23:22.240 --> 23:23.920
But ultimately, another thing we're doing

23:23.920 --> 23:26.480
is we're just redoing the entire factory setup

23:26.480 --> 23:27.920
of the electrical system,

23:27.920 --> 23:31.920
going from a modified sine wave to a pure sine inverter

23:31.920 --> 23:34.560
and converter and a new charge controller,

23:34.560 --> 23:35.840
upgrading the alternator,

23:36.560 --> 23:40.320
putting all of the plugs in the RV on the system

23:40.320 --> 23:42.640
instead of just about four or five of them.

23:42.640 --> 23:43.760
So it'll be a whole house.

23:43.760 --> 23:46.000
And then getting, I've been told,

23:46.000 --> 23:47.440
thanks to our awesome audience

23:47.440 --> 23:49.360
who's been sending me great information,

23:49.360 --> 23:51.040
that it is very likely there will be a way

23:51.040 --> 23:55.120
I can pull the data off of the Victron inverter unit

23:55.120 --> 23:57.600
and bring it into Home Assistant and Grafana.

23:57.600 --> 23:59.360
It seems like it's likely.

23:59.360 --> 24:00.640
I don't have a clear path yet,

24:00.640 --> 24:02.800
but the audience was all over it.

24:02.800 --> 24:03.440
It's very good.

24:03.440 --> 24:04.560
So you went for it, huh?

24:04.560 --> 24:05.680
Good for you.

24:05.680 --> 24:06.800
I'm very nervous.

24:06.800 --> 24:09.920
I'm very nervous because this is the largest work

24:09.920 --> 24:11.600
we've ever had done on the RV.

24:11.600 --> 24:15.280
I got them to agree to walk me through

24:15.280 --> 24:17.280
some of the work they're doing and explain it to me

24:17.280 --> 24:19.120
and let me interview them,

24:19.120 --> 24:21.360
which I might use for a future project,

24:22.400 --> 24:24.400
and help me understand some of it.

24:24.400 --> 24:29.920
So it's gonna be something like 15 to 20 hours of labor

24:29.920 --> 24:32.560
on their part, plus them explaining

24:33.120 --> 24:36.240
and letting me do interviews on top of that,

24:36.240 --> 24:37.680
which they're doing that for free.

24:37.680 --> 24:39.840
15 to 20 hours doesn't sound that bad.

24:39.840 --> 24:41.280
Is that multiple people?

24:41.280 --> 24:42.720
I assume.

24:42.720 --> 24:43.440
That's great though.

24:43.440 --> 24:44.720
That's gonna give you the capability

24:44.720 --> 24:47.120
to do everything we talked about last episode then.

24:47.120 --> 24:49.520
Yes, and the thing that, the risk I took

24:49.520 --> 24:52.320
is they advised that I put more than 500 watts of solar

24:52.320 --> 24:54.560
on there and I said to them, here's the thing.

24:54.560 --> 24:57.120
I'm in the Pacific Northwest most of the time.

24:57.120 --> 24:59.360
I've got a really big generator on board.

24:59.360 --> 25:00.480
What if I kind of balanced it

25:00.480 --> 25:01.840
and went a little more on the batteries

25:01.840 --> 25:03.040
but supplemented with the generator?

25:03.040 --> 25:03.440
We'll see.

25:04.000 --> 25:04.720
I could be wrong.

25:04.720 --> 25:06.160
So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna ask them

25:06.160 --> 25:08.320
to wire it for more panels in the future.

25:08.320 --> 25:10.240
So I can add them if I need to.

25:10.240 --> 25:11.040
Super cool, man.

25:11.040 --> 25:12.480
I'm so pleased with you for doing that.

25:12.480 --> 25:13.920
It's a big decision.

25:13.920 --> 25:14.640
Oh, stop.

25:15.280 --> 25:16.720
It was, it was.

25:16.720 --> 25:17.360
We'll see.

25:17.360 --> 25:18.240
It's a lot of money

25:18.240 --> 25:21.520
and it's your house going into the garage for how long?

25:22.160 --> 25:24.800
For a week, for five days, for five days.

25:25.600 --> 25:26.560
I have to live somewhere else.

25:26.560 --> 25:27.520
Gotta clean the fridge out

25:27.520 --> 25:28.800
because there's gonna be no power.

25:28.800 --> 25:30.080
So I can't stay in it.

25:30.080 --> 25:32.320
Gotta pack Levi up and I don't know,

25:32.320 --> 25:34.000
maybe I'll sleep on the floor in the studio.

25:36.400 --> 25:38.000
I think Levi would approve though

25:38.000 --> 25:39.920
because it means he can go on lots of cool road trips.

25:39.920 --> 25:41.920
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

25:41.920 --> 25:43.200
He loves that stuff.

25:43.200 --> 25:44.320
So how many times, Chris,

25:44.320 --> 25:47.040
have you had a smart bulb in your life

25:47.040 --> 25:49.840
and you've said to a guest in the studio or something,

25:50.640 --> 25:52.400
okay, I have these cool bulbs,

25:52.960 --> 25:54.480
don't use the light switch.

25:54.480 --> 25:57.520
All you have to do is X, Y, Z.

25:57.520 --> 26:00.160
Yeah, to the point where we even tried taping

26:00.160 --> 26:02.560
over the light switches and wrote on the tape, don't use.

26:04.000 --> 26:05.200
Yeah, we've all been there.

26:05.200 --> 26:07.360
So I think I have a solution to this issue

26:07.360 --> 26:11.840
and I wanna get to a bit of feedback from Primoj Kankar.

26:11.840 --> 26:14.320
I really apologize if that's incorrect.

26:14.320 --> 26:15.840
I think you nailed it.

26:15.840 --> 26:17.440
Yeah, okay, well, we'll see.

26:18.960 --> 26:22.160
Alan at jupiterbroadcasting.com if I'm wrong.

26:23.680 --> 26:24.320
A classic.

26:24.960 --> 26:26.960
The gist of the feedback is

26:26.960 --> 26:29.760
I'm looking to get into some simple home automation.

26:29.760 --> 26:31.200
Can you give me some pointers

26:31.200 --> 26:33.600
of what I might need to buy and set up?

26:33.600 --> 26:35.920
I want to do a smart light switch.

26:35.920 --> 26:37.360
Do I need some kind of hub?

26:38.000 --> 26:40.240
I've heard you talk about the Tekin plugs.

26:40.240 --> 26:41.680
What sort of stuff do I need to know?

26:42.320 --> 26:44.160
So I came across a really interesting device

26:44.160 --> 26:45.600
this week called the Shelly.

26:45.600 --> 26:48.000
The Shelly Cloud is the name of the company.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.880
The one that I purchased was the Shelly 2.5.

26:50.880 --> 26:53.680
Now this thing is about the size of an Oreo cookie.

26:54.240 --> 26:59.520
So it's pretty small and it has in it two little relays.

27:00.720 --> 27:03.760
This thing goes in the back of a light switch

27:03.760 --> 27:08.480
and you wire it up to your 110 volt or 220 volt or whatever.

27:08.480 --> 27:11.440
It goes on mains voltage, so be careful.

27:11.440 --> 27:13.120
Please don't electrocute yourself

27:13.120 --> 27:14.400
if you try and install this thing.

27:14.400 --> 27:16.880
If you're not sure, consult a licensed electrician.

27:17.440 --> 27:18.880
Okay, disclaimer out the way.

27:20.240 --> 27:24.000
Now this thing, you can flash TAS motor onto it.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.160
So I'm immediately in love with it.

27:26.160 --> 27:28.080
It has some little headers on it

27:28.080 --> 27:31.280
and the headers on it aren't the standard size

27:31.280 --> 27:33.520
that you would normally have for like a breadboard.

27:33.520 --> 27:34.640
A breadboard type device.

27:35.200 --> 27:37.680
So you need to like strip a network cable or something

27:37.680 --> 27:40.080
and then Jimmy rig that into your breadboard

27:40.080 --> 27:42.480
and flash it with the FTDI adapter that way.

27:43.280 --> 27:45.120
But once you've got TAS motor on this thing,

27:45.120 --> 27:47.040
it's a case of just wiring it up to the switch

27:47.840 --> 27:49.520
and then adding it in Home Assistant

27:49.520 --> 27:51.760
like you would any other TAS motor device.

27:51.760 --> 27:53.440
But where the real magic comes

27:53.440 --> 27:56.480
is this thing lets me use the existing light switch

27:56.480 --> 28:00.320
as well as having Wi-Fi control of the light bulbs.

28:00.880 --> 28:03.200
Okay, that's awesome.

28:03.200 --> 28:06.240
So you just pop open the light switch panel,

28:07.040 --> 28:09.920
what, unwire the switch, wire the sucker in,

28:09.920 --> 28:11.280
wire it all back and you're done?

28:11.280 --> 28:11.840
Pretty much, yeah.

28:11.840 --> 28:13.280
You gotta add a couple of extra wires

28:13.840 --> 28:17.600
because the way this works is it disconnects the light switch

28:17.600 --> 28:21.840
from the light itself, which sounds a bit counterintuitive.

28:21.840 --> 28:23.360
But the relay inside the Shelly

28:23.360 --> 28:25.440
is what does the switching on and off of the light.

28:25.440 --> 28:26.320
That makes sense.

28:26.320 --> 28:28.320
And there's some circuitry in this little thing

28:28.320 --> 28:31.200
that detects when you flip the light switch physically

28:31.200 --> 28:34.560
and then it also flips the relay inside the box

28:34.560 --> 28:36.080
automatically when that happens.

28:36.080 --> 28:38.160
But you could override it even with the switch down,

28:38.160 --> 28:39.840
say if that's the off position traditionally,

28:39.840 --> 28:42.240
you could still turn it on via Wi-Fi and Home Assistant.

28:42.240 --> 28:44.560
The light switch just becomes a physical toggle.

28:44.560 --> 28:46.640
It also works with three-way switches.

28:47.600 --> 28:50.320
I think we call them two-way in Europe and three-way here.

28:50.320 --> 28:52.560
But the other really great thing about this device,

28:52.560 --> 28:56.240
besides the fact it works on 110 through 240 volt AC

28:56.800 --> 28:59.760
is it works on 24 through 60 volt DC.

28:59.760 --> 29:03.680
Yeah, yeah, that I'm noticing and thinking

29:03.680 --> 29:06.480
this is how I could make my built-in lighting smart.

29:06.480 --> 29:09.280
And the 2.5 in particular has energy monitoring

29:09.280 --> 29:10.960
so you can feed that into your Grafana

29:10.960 --> 29:12.000
and Home Assistant that way.

29:12.800 --> 29:15.440
And I tell you what, it's a game changer.

29:15.440 --> 29:18.960
You know, this house has like, I haven't even counted,

29:18.960 --> 29:20.000
a lot of light switches.

29:20.640 --> 29:25.040
These things cost about 25-ish dollars each.

29:25.040 --> 29:28.240
And you know, what's the cost of a single smart bulb?

29:28.240 --> 29:30.320
It's gonna be at least 20.

29:30.320 --> 29:31.440
Oh, at least.

29:31.440 --> 29:33.040
And it doesn't solve the light switch,

29:33.040 --> 29:34.400
physical light switch problem.

29:35.200 --> 29:37.280
It was when my mother-in-law came to stay last year

29:37.280 --> 29:39.600
and I heard her saying, okay, Google,

29:39.600 --> 29:41.280
turn off the in lights.

29:41.920 --> 29:44.000
People don't know the names of your whatnots

29:44.000 --> 29:44.640
and all of that.

29:44.640 --> 29:46.400
And I've thought maybe I should put like a map

29:46.400 --> 29:47.600
on the wall that explains this stuff.

29:47.600 --> 29:50.400
But this just takes it completely out of the equation.

29:50.400 --> 29:53.360
This is so elegant, it's beautiful.

29:53.360 --> 29:55.200
I really wanna put this in the RV.

29:55.200 --> 29:56.960
Alex, you're gonna help me put this in the RV.

29:56.960 --> 29:59.600
We do like a project, pop them off, put them in there.

29:59.600 --> 30:01.200
Well, we'll do some stuff like this

30:01.200 --> 30:02.960
around Linux Fest Northwest, huh?

30:02.960 --> 30:04.160
Oh yeah, this is so cool.

30:04.160 --> 30:06.080
So it's the Shelly 2.5

30:06.080 --> 30:08.640
and we will have a link to that in the show notes

30:08.640 --> 30:10.640
and check out Alex's Twitter feed

30:11.280 --> 30:12.560
for a picture of his install

30:12.560 --> 30:13.920
if you wanna get an idea of what it looks like.

30:13.920 --> 30:15.520
Maybe drop a link to that in the notes too.

30:15.520 --> 30:17.600
At Ironic Badger on Twitter.

30:17.600 --> 30:19.440
Yeah, they have a whole range of products.

30:19.440 --> 30:20.480
I'm looking at this stuff.

30:20.480 --> 30:24.960
They have some really cool products at shelly.cloud.

30:24.960 --> 30:28.240
So, I mean, once this thing's been flashed,

30:28.960 --> 30:30.080
it's yours forever too.

30:30.080 --> 30:32.240
So you can just leave it in the wall forever.

30:32.240 --> 30:32.740
Correct.

30:34.640 --> 30:35.760
I love it.

30:35.760 --> 30:37.040
They make some really cool stuff.

30:37.040 --> 30:41.440
Energy monitoring, they make an RGBW Wi-Fi LED controller

30:41.440 --> 30:43.680
so you don't have to make your own custom one of those

30:43.680 --> 30:44.240
like I did.

30:45.120 --> 30:47.200
Temperature and humidity sensors,

30:47.200 --> 30:49.040
flood and temperature sensors.

30:49.040 --> 30:51.360
I mean, honestly, the list is pretty amazing

30:51.360 --> 30:54.720
and they've got a whole bunch of stuff coming out in the future.

30:54.720 --> 30:57.760
Dr. Z's, that guy in the home assistant community,

30:57.760 --> 31:00.560
the floating bald head dude, he loves these things

31:00.560 --> 31:02.080
as does Rob from the hookup.

31:02.080 --> 31:05.040
So there's a good community growing around it

31:05.040 --> 31:07.600
and if it can run Tasmota,

31:07.600 --> 31:09.760
I don't really care what Shelly do in five years.

31:09.760 --> 31:11.600
It's mine now.

31:11.600 --> 31:12.100
Thank you.

31:12.960 --> 31:14.480
I just, I love that.

31:14.480 --> 31:15.440
It's yours forever.

31:15.440 --> 31:18.960
Well, until the device dies of natural causes.

31:18.960 --> 31:21.920
Okay, so we got to do something a little different now.

31:21.920 --> 31:24.720
So just remind yourself hosted.show slash contact

31:25.360 --> 31:27.600
but we need to flip it around on the audience,

31:27.600 --> 31:28.560
don't we Alex?

31:28.560 --> 31:30.560
Yeah, it's a who wants to be a millionaire,

31:30.560 --> 31:33.040
million dollar question, ask the audience time.

31:33.040 --> 31:34.640
Yeah, let's see what they say.

31:34.640 --> 31:38.560
Yeah, so I got my drum kit out finally

31:38.560 --> 31:41.040
and I'm able to play drums in this new house

31:41.040 --> 31:43.040
for the first time in 13 years.

31:43.040 --> 31:45.440
So I'm super excited to be able to play drums again.

31:45.440 --> 31:49.360
And one thing I'm looking for that as a teenager,

31:49.360 --> 31:50.960
I really wanted my parents to be able to do

31:50.960 --> 31:53.120
was listen to the music that I was drumming along to.

31:53.120 --> 31:54.640
So they're not just hearing the blatting

31:54.640 --> 31:56.960
of a drum with no context.

31:57.840 --> 31:59.360
So one thing I'd like to try and do

31:59.360 --> 32:01.040
and I hope the audience can come up

32:01.040 --> 32:02.560
with a decent solution for this

32:02.560 --> 32:04.800
is to pipe the music that I'm currently playing

32:04.800 --> 32:08.800
from Spotify through the house whilst I'm drumming

32:08.800 --> 32:10.320
so my wife can listen to it

32:10.960 --> 32:13.360
and that can either go to a Chromecast audio.

32:13.360 --> 32:14.400
I mean, it has to be in sync.

32:14.400 --> 32:16.400
That's the thing, otherwise it's kind of pointless.

32:17.360 --> 32:19.840
Maybe the Google Home Minis would be nice.

32:19.840 --> 32:21.760
Again, sync might be tricky with that.

32:21.760 --> 32:23.920
What's the source that's coming to your headphones?

32:23.920 --> 32:24.960
What's the source of that?

32:24.960 --> 32:27.120
At the moment, it's a pair of Bluetooth headphones.

32:27.120 --> 32:28.240
You could solve the sync issue

32:28.240 --> 32:31.120
by having you both listen to the same source potentially.

32:31.120 --> 32:36.160
I would be willing, I think, to have a laptop next to me

32:36.160 --> 32:38.640
and play the music from the laptop instead of my phone

32:39.360 --> 32:42.480
and then use that to maybe route the audio

32:42.480 --> 32:44.000
because I've got Linux everywhere in this house.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.720
I can route audio through Pulse over the network, I think.

32:47.680 --> 32:50.000
There's lots of different ways that I could do it,

32:50.000 --> 32:51.360
but I'm just wondering if anybody else

32:51.360 --> 32:54.400
has solved a similar type of problem and could let us know.

32:54.400 --> 32:55.680
Yeah, that would be really cool.

32:56.480 --> 32:58.560
And while we're at it,

32:58.560 --> 33:00.000
I'd love to hear what people are using

33:00.000 --> 33:02.720
for self-hosted Wikis and Notes app,

33:02.720 --> 33:06.320
something that's nice to use with decent search,

33:06.320 --> 33:08.080
that fuzzy style search,

33:08.080 --> 33:10.800
and ideally, both Alex and I were thinking this one,

33:10.800 --> 33:12.640
no database, ideally.

33:12.640 --> 33:14.560
I really like my markdown system,

33:14.560 --> 33:18.080
but it's not really approachable by the spousal unit

33:18.080 --> 33:19.440
and she wants more search,

33:20.080 --> 33:21.680
where this was more of a documentation,

33:21.680 --> 33:24.800
and I realized she's using Evernote today

33:24.800 --> 33:26.800
and I thought, gosh, I know I could fix,

33:26.800 --> 33:28.400
I could solve that with something.

33:28.400 --> 33:29.760
I just don't know quite what.

33:29.760 --> 33:31.760
Yeah, I mean, I've tried Nextcloud Notes

33:31.760 --> 33:34.000
with QO Notes and a bunch of other stuff.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.720
I do like it, but I don't think it's perfect for her.

33:36.720 --> 33:38.800
I think Nextcloud has a lot of great solutions,

33:38.800 --> 33:40.720
but I would prefer not to have to run

33:40.720 --> 33:42.480
all of Nextcloud to solve this.

33:42.480 --> 33:43.520
Congratulations to them

33:43.520 --> 33:45.840
on their Nextcloud Hub announcement, by the way.

33:45.840 --> 33:48.560
It is one of the, it's like one of the classics

33:48.560 --> 33:50.160
of the self-hosted applications now.

33:50.160 --> 33:51.360
It's in that league.

33:52.080 --> 33:52.880
It is, yeah.

33:52.880 --> 33:54.720
Yeah, it's almost so big.

33:54.720 --> 33:55.760
It's too big to fail,

33:55.760 --> 33:57.120
so we almost don't mention it enough,

33:57.120 --> 33:59.840
but Nextcloud is great and I use it every day.

34:00.560 --> 34:03.040
Well, we've mentioned links and notes a lot,

34:03.040 --> 34:04.800
but we haven't said where you can find them,

34:04.800 --> 34:06.560
so we should probably do that real quick,

34:06.560 --> 34:09.200
selfhosted.show slash 11.

34:09.200 --> 34:10.800
And then what do you say we give a shout out

34:10.800 --> 34:12.640
to our buddy Brent,

34:12.640 --> 34:14.720
who's just cranking out these brunches.

34:14.720 --> 34:15.680
Man's busy.

34:15.680 --> 34:18.240
And they're delicious as well, those brunches.

34:18.240 --> 34:20.400
He recently did one, he sat down with Jim Salter

34:20.400 --> 34:22.800
of TechSnap and Ask Technica fame,

34:22.800 --> 34:25.920
so be sure to give that a listen on extras.show.

34:25.920 --> 34:28.240
And you did one with him on his wifi setup,

34:28.240 --> 34:29.840
like a self-hosted mini episode,

34:29.840 --> 34:31.440
so that's over on extras.show as well.

34:31.440 --> 34:32.560
It's worth checking out.

34:32.560 --> 34:34.240
He skipped the Ask SSHQ.

34:35.680 --> 34:37.600
And went right to the tech support line.

34:37.600 --> 34:39.920
And what I love about you two is let's hit record

34:39.920 --> 34:40.720
and make an episode.

34:40.720 --> 34:41.360
It was great.

34:41.360 --> 34:44.480
And now you get to learn about some wifi stuff,

34:44.480 --> 34:46.080
which I really enjoyed.

34:46.080 --> 34:48.080
Well, I think that's everything for today, Alex.

34:48.080 --> 34:49.520
As I said earlier in the show,

34:49.520 --> 34:51.440
I'm on Twitter at ironicbadger

34:51.440 --> 34:55.280
and you can find this fine podcast at self-hosted show.

34:55.280 --> 34:56.960
Yeah, I'm at Chris LAS

34:56.960 --> 35:00.080
and the whole network is at Jupiter signal.

35:00.080 --> 35:01.120
Thank you for joining us

35:01.120 --> 35:07.840
and we'll both see you in two weeks.
