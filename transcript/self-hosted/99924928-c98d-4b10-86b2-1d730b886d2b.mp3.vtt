WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.640
So the last episode, 69, we recorded on 420, and today, somehow, is Star Wars Day!

00:05.640 --> 00:07.440
Happy Star Wars Day, everybody!

00:07.440 --> 00:07.940
Yay!

00:07.940 --> 00:08.940
Yay!

00:09.940 --> 00:14.700
I mean, that joke was funny when I was about eight years old, and it's... still funny now?

00:14.700 --> 00:15.200
Is it?

00:16.200 --> 00:17.900
I've never been a big Star Wars guy.

00:17.900 --> 00:18.400
Oh...

00:18.400 --> 00:20.200
I'm not like an anti-Star Wars guy at all.

00:20.500 --> 00:27.100
I'll enjoy me a little Star Wars, but I just haven't really been into much, other than the Mandalorian, which is fantastic.

00:27.300 --> 00:28.900
But who shot first? That's the question.

00:28.900 --> 00:31.000
We all know who shot first. Han shot first. Come on.

00:32.200 --> 00:36.000
Well, of course, joining me today, we have Chris. Hello, Chris.

00:36.000 --> 00:36.900
Hello!

00:36.900 --> 00:37.700
Brent.

00:37.700 --> 00:38.400
Hello!

00:38.400 --> 00:39.800
Who you all know from Linux Unplugged.

00:39.800 --> 00:44.500
And we also have from our Discord, for our community spotlight this episode, Fuzzy Mistborn.

00:44.500 --> 00:45.200
Hello, Fuzzy.

00:45.200 --> 00:46.000
Hello!

00:46.200 --> 00:48.300
Nice to catch up with you again.

00:48.300 --> 00:49.600
We met you at the meetup, didn't we?

00:49.600 --> 00:50.500
Yes, you did.

00:50.500 --> 00:54.900
And you were the guy with the Steam Deck that we were all very jealous of, and the electric car, and...

00:54.900 --> 00:56.900
We'll get into all that business in just a little bit.

00:56.900 --> 00:59.900
But I think Chris has got an update about his new show festival.

00:59.900 --> 01:02.400
Oh, really? You're going to... Oh, thanks, Alex.

01:02.400 --> 01:10.300
Yeah, well, actually, I wanted to mention it here on the show because we are kicking off a total website rebuild project.

01:10.300 --> 01:14.900
And Alex, you joined me with Brent and Wes on the last episode,

01:14.900 --> 01:19.000
and we talked about what we want to do, and how we kind of want to build the new website,

01:19.000 --> 01:22.800
and we're taking in ideas, and we've launched some GitHub projects around it.

01:22.800 --> 01:25.900
And so all of the details are in Office Hours 3.

01:25.900 --> 01:29.300
So if you go to officehours.hair.com,

01:29.300 --> 01:33.900
then you can listen to that episode and hear what Alex and I had to say about what we want to do with the new JB website.

01:33.900 --> 01:37.700
And we're really looking for input because we have to have it done by the end of summer,

01:37.700 --> 01:42.000
because Scale Engine, who we've been with for like 12, 13 years, I was just looking,

01:42.000 --> 01:44.200
they are no longer in the WordPress biz.

01:44.200 --> 01:45.600
Nothing like a deadline, is there?

01:45.600 --> 01:47.700
Yeah, and so they're getting out of it by the end of summer.

01:47.700 --> 01:53.600
And so we got to get the website moved, and we want to rebuild it, and we want to self-host it, of course.

01:53.600 --> 01:57.900
So officehours.hair, help us figure it out, join the conversation.

01:57.900 --> 01:59.300
We'll figure it out together.

01:59.300 --> 02:03.600
There's a link in the show notes to a very active GitHub issue, actually,

02:03.600 --> 02:08.600
where there's lots of people throwing out lots of different ideas about how we can self-host different stacks,

02:08.600 --> 02:14.800
anything from Ghost to GitLab to Grav to Hugo, all those sorts of things.

02:14.800 --> 02:22.000
Like Chris says, there's an Office Hours episode where we all discuss the various requirements that we have, I suppose,

02:22.000 --> 02:27.500
and trying to build like a podcast network website, you know, where there are...

02:27.500 --> 02:30.500
How many shows do you have? Like six? Eight?

02:30.500 --> 02:34.900
Yeah, six shows, I guess. Five active shows, then you have extras, so six.

02:34.900 --> 02:39.000
Yeah, and then you've got a bunch of archive shows, too, which you want to present to people.

02:39.000 --> 02:45.600
And then there's about, I don't know, a million guests on all the shows that you need to update, all their various content.

02:45.600 --> 02:46.700
There's a lot.

02:46.700 --> 02:49.500
And you think, well, we could design a whole database around this.

02:49.500 --> 02:52.500
You could design a whole CMS, you know, if you're not careful.

02:52.500 --> 02:58.000
We're trying to be cognizant of the fact that people will be giving up their free time to help us and all the rest of that.

02:58.000 --> 03:03.300
If you've got any opinions, any thoughts, please head over to the Jupiter Broadcasting GitHub organization

03:03.300 --> 03:07.800
and give us your feedback in the issue number eight linked in the show notes.

03:07.800 --> 03:09.700
I'm excited about what we might build.

03:09.700 --> 03:12.800
We've gotten some really good ideas already, things we hadn't even considered,

03:12.800 --> 03:18.500
like maybe the ability for certain community members to update episode pages and show notes

03:18.500 --> 03:21.400
with things that were either missed or maybe links that die.

03:21.400 --> 03:23.200
There's all kinds of ideas that are floating around right there.

03:23.200 --> 03:26.300
So we're just kicking off the conversation, but we also need to move kind of quick.

03:26.300 --> 03:27.300
It's one of those things.

03:27.300 --> 03:31.100
I can't tell you the number of times as a listener of a various podcast, I go to the show notes.

03:31.100 --> 03:32.600
I'm like, what was that thing?

03:32.600 --> 03:33.800
And they didn't put it in the show notes.

03:33.800 --> 03:39.500
And I know that we are guilty of that, too, because I have listeners writing and tell me that we're guilty of it.

03:39.500 --> 03:43.000
And it would be great if they could, you know, submit their their feedback.

03:43.000 --> 03:47.300
Now, a few episodes ago, we had the orange one on for our very first community member spotlight.

03:47.300 --> 03:50.000
And today we're joined by Fuzzy Mistborn. Hello, Fuzzy.

03:50.000 --> 03:50.600
Hello.

03:50.600 --> 03:53.700
Yeah, so you're drinking a tasty beverage over there. What do you have?

03:53.700 --> 03:58.200
I have a beer from a local brewery that is a triple golden ale.

03:58.200 --> 04:00.200
I see both Brent and our guest have a beer.

04:00.200 --> 04:00.900
I don't have a beer.

04:00.900 --> 04:03.000
Actually, this is a hopped cider.

04:03.000 --> 04:03.600
Thank you very much.

04:03.600 --> 04:05.200
Oh, okay. Okay.

04:05.200 --> 04:09.800
So you and I have been talking for many months, probably over a year at this point in the Discord.

04:09.800 --> 04:11.400
I'd say we're pretty good friends in there.

04:11.400 --> 04:16.300
We've been talking about so many different projects and, you know, EVs, for example,

04:16.300 --> 04:20.200
so many things in common. I thought it'd be great to get you on and talk about various things.

04:20.200 --> 04:22.100
So let's start with that electric car, shall we?

04:22.100 --> 04:27.900
I know it's not self-hosted related, but I'm really curious about how your journey with the Ionic 5 is going.

04:27.900 --> 04:34.100
I've had it now for about a month and so far it's been fantastic.

04:34.100 --> 04:38.600
Of course, the first two weeks of it, I go up to my parents who live about four hours away

04:38.600 --> 04:41.800
and I drive down to Raleigh, which is about eight hours.

04:41.800 --> 04:46.800
So I put about 2,000 miles on the car in about two weeks.

04:46.800 --> 04:49.400
Is there any way to do it? Proper shakedown test.

04:49.400 --> 04:50.200
Yeah.

04:50.200 --> 04:53.500
Yeah, exactly. Exactly. That was definitely an experience.

04:53.500 --> 04:57.100
So I definitely got to try out, you know, the rapid charging and seeing how all that works.

04:57.100 --> 05:01.500
How was that? How was the charging? Because it was down, what, I-95?

05:01.500 --> 05:04.200
Yes, pretty much 95 most of the way.

05:04.200 --> 05:09.700
The first time I did it, by my way down, I was kind of ultra conservative and charged wherever I possibly could.

05:09.700 --> 05:13.700
But on the way back, it was only about two charges.

05:13.700 --> 05:15.400
A little bit more comfortable in what the car could do.

05:15.400 --> 05:20.600
And I knew kind of what the range of the vehicle would be when it was saying, you know, you've got 30% left.

05:20.600 --> 05:23.100
I knew I've got X number of miles.

05:23.100 --> 05:25.700
You were feeling a little more adventurous at that point, I see.

05:25.700 --> 05:30.500
Well, you know, whilst you were busy in that delicious old RV with Nixie Pixel, Chris,

05:30.500 --> 05:35.900
I was given a little spin around the block in the Ionic and Fuzzy put his foot down a couple of times.

05:35.900 --> 05:38.900
That was fun. I was pinned back in my seat for sure.

05:38.900 --> 05:42.900
Yes, that is definitely, that still brings a smile to my face every time I drive it.

05:42.900 --> 05:47.300
I throw it in sport mode for a couple of minutes just to accelerate and just like, pew!

05:47.300 --> 05:50.100
That's like the boost noise.

05:50.100 --> 05:51.900
Pew, pew!

05:51.900 --> 05:56.500
Now I want to know, like, are you collecting or do you see any possibilities to collect metrics?

05:56.500 --> 05:58.100
You know where I go with this kind of thing.

05:58.100 --> 06:00.900
I start thinking like, let's collect some data.

06:00.900 --> 06:07.100
There is a Home Assistant integration, but it's honestly not super great, but that's not a fault of the developers.

06:07.100 --> 06:09.700
I mean, there's some stuff missing that I want to see added,

06:09.700 --> 06:15.500
but the major issue just is that Hyundai limits you to about 30 API calls a day.

06:15.500 --> 06:16.700
That's not very many.

06:16.700 --> 06:21.300
No, so the developer actually has put in like there's blackout times at night where from like,

06:21.300 --> 06:26.100
you know, you can customize it, but I think the default is like 10 p.m. to 6 or 7 a.m.

06:26.100 --> 06:31.300
It doesn't make any calls whatsoever just to try and preserve them for you.

06:31.300 --> 06:34.400
But yeah, it's kind of limited in what you can do.

06:34.400 --> 06:38.600
So what I do use is I use a better route planner,

06:38.600 --> 06:41.500
which is great for planning trips because it shows you, you know,

06:41.500 --> 06:45.000
basically you type in, it's like Google Maps for electric vehicles.

06:45.000 --> 06:50.400
And you, you know, say I'm coming from here and I'm going to here, going down to Raleigh,

06:50.400 --> 06:53.400
and it'll say, okay, and you know, here's the car I have,

06:53.400 --> 06:57.500
and it'll basically figure out, okay, you know, you're starting at this percentage battery,

06:57.500 --> 07:00.800
you know, the weather's going to be this, you know, the wind's going to be this,

07:00.800 --> 07:05.200
so therefore it can figure out, okay, you need to stop here, here, and here and charge this amount

07:05.200 --> 07:06.600
to get where you're going.

07:06.600 --> 07:09.600
And as part of the, part of the, one of the ways I improve that is you can get little

07:09.600 --> 07:15.700
ODB2 Bluetooth low-energy devices and plug them into your ODB2 port in your car,

07:15.700 --> 07:20.500
and a better route planner can integrate with that and pull the state of charge off the car.

07:20.500 --> 07:23.000
So therefore it'll, it'll update in real time.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.800
So for example, like when I left to get down to Raleigh the first time,

07:25.800 --> 07:29.800
I said I was going to arrive, you know, my first destination with like 10% charge.

07:29.800 --> 07:34.000
I got there with like 30, and I could see it counting back up as it, you know,

07:34.000 --> 07:36.400
based on the real-time telemetry it was getting.

07:36.400 --> 07:37.700
That's a legit feature.

07:37.700 --> 07:39.700
I didn't actually, I didn't even think about it.

07:39.700 --> 07:43.300
I didn't even realize that electric cars had ODB2 ports.

07:43.300 --> 07:46.300
I suppose they have to by law, but it just never even crossed my mind.

07:46.300 --> 07:50.400
It just seems like such an old archaic, you know, the whole CAN bus thing just seems so old.

07:50.400 --> 07:53.500
You and I got burned by that automatic thing, do you remember?

07:53.500 --> 07:56.300
Oh, I loved automatic too, even though they were sloping up all my data,

07:56.300 --> 08:00.200
but they tracked every drive that I did in the RV for the first few years.

08:00.200 --> 08:03.100
So I had this brilliant heat map of everywhere we had been in the RV.

08:03.100 --> 08:07.800
It was, it was great, and it got all my fuel mileage info for me.

08:07.800 --> 08:08.800
I'd love to have that again.

08:08.800 --> 08:12.600
We've talked about that a little bit on the show, trying to recreate that.

08:12.600 --> 08:15.800
Yeah, there's an app called Torque that I've been trying to play with

08:15.800 --> 08:19.400
that might let thing, let me kind of upload it into Home Assistant.

08:19.400 --> 08:23.200
I couldn't quite get it to work and I haven't had a chance to go back to it,

08:23.200 --> 08:26.800
but that would supposedly let me upload that information directly into Home Assistant

08:26.800 --> 08:28.300
and have sensors and data that way.

08:28.300 --> 08:33.600
But honestly, I charge the car once a week, you know, on Sunday night,

08:33.600 --> 08:35.800
Sunday Home Assistant will ping me if the battery is below, you know,

08:35.800 --> 08:39.100
I think 50% and you know, I can go and plug it in.

08:39.100 --> 08:41.300
It'll charge up overnight in a couple hours.

08:41.300 --> 08:46.800
And honestly, I basically, you're only supposed to charge about 80% at any given,

08:46.800 --> 08:50.900
you know, you're only supposed to charge to 100 if you're actually going to be going somewhere long distance.

08:50.900 --> 08:54.000
So usually 80% is enough to get me through the entire week.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.400
That's so cool.

08:55.400 --> 08:59.000
So how about a seamless segue? Shall we switch gears?

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
Oh!

09:00.000 --> 09:01.300
That was questionable.

09:01.300 --> 09:01.700
Top Gear?

09:01.700 --> 09:03.700
Oh, yes, Top Gear. Where's Jeremy?

09:03.700 --> 09:07.600
I've been following your blog for a long time at blog.fuzzymissborn.com

09:07.600 --> 09:10.800
and there's so many posts on there that we could talk about,

09:10.800 --> 09:15.500
but there's one in particular which really has my interest peaked right now

09:15.500 --> 09:17.900
and that is the Renovate Bot one.

09:17.900 --> 09:21.700
I'm curious to ask you what you're using Renovate Bot for

09:21.700 --> 09:24.000
and what your experience has been with it.

09:24.000 --> 09:30.900
So Renovate Bot, I have run on my infrastructure Ansible GitHub repo.

09:30.900 --> 09:35.400
And basically what it will do is it will go through,

09:35.400 --> 09:39.500
I don't even, I don't even, honestly, you can self-host it, I don't.

09:39.500 --> 09:42.400
So I don't know how often the publicly hosted one goes through,

09:42.400 --> 09:46.200
but it's honestly pretty fast, like maybe in every hour or so it runs.

09:46.200 --> 09:49.800
And it basically runs through whatever I tell it to run through

09:49.800 --> 09:52.000
and will tell me, for example, for mine,

09:52.000 --> 09:54.900
it'll tell me if there's new Docker images available.

09:54.900 --> 09:56.300
You know, for all my Docker compose stuff,

09:56.300 --> 09:59.900
I'll, you know, state, you know, home assistant slash,

09:59.900 --> 10:05.300
you know, whatever slash, what does it say, 2022.05.01.

10:05.300 --> 10:08.300
And it'll go through and say, oh, well, there's.02 available

10:08.300 --> 10:12.100
and it'll create a pull request on the infrastructure repo

10:12.100 --> 10:15.500
that I can then go in and say, yes, you know, merge this

10:15.500 --> 10:19.600
or hang on, this is actually a beta or, oh no,

10:19.600 --> 10:21.000
I'm seeing there are some issues with it.

10:21.000 --> 10:25.400
So I don't actually have to merge it until I need to.

10:25.400 --> 10:27.000
So what exactly does it do?

10:27.000 --> 10:30.700
It's like a GitOps style way of working, right?

10:30.700 --> 10:33.500
It looks at the upstream images and says, you know,

10:33.500 --> 10:35.600
there's a new home assistant container

10:35.600 --> 10:39.600
and it creates a pull request, right, against your repo

10:39.600 --> 10:40.900
and then what?

10:40.900 --> 10:42.700
Basically that's it, it creates a pull request.

10:42.700 --> 10:45.900
I can see, you know, basically you can actually even,

10:45.900 --> 10:48.400
you can customize, I don't even honestly scratch the surface

10:48.400 --> 10:49.500
of what it can do.

10:49.500 --> 10:51.600
You can, you know, go ahead and auto merge, you know,

10:51.600 --> 10:55.000
minor updates, so if it's like, you know, a.01 release,

10:55.000 --> 10:58.100
you can tell it just to automatically merge that for you,

10:58.100 --> 11:01.000
you know, and save the major revisions for, you know,

11:01.000 --> 11:04.800
manual review or, I mean, honestly,

11:04.800 --> 11:06.900
I barely scratched the surface of what it can do.

11:06.900 --> 11:11.100
I know a lot of people use it for maintaining their dependencies

11:11.100 --> 11:12.500
for all the different, you know, projects.

11:12.500 --> 11:14.100
They'll use it for, and they'll have just renovate bot,

11:14.100 --> 11:16.200
go through and just automatically update

11:16.200 --> 11:19.400
and merge a lot of the dependency upgrades.

11:20.300 --> 11:22.300
Now, another post that you have on your blog

11:22.300 --> 11:26.300
is your love-hate relationship with drone.io.

11:26.300 --> 11:27.400
But before we get there,

11:27.400 --> 11:29.900
and because you mentioned Top Gear a moment ago,

11:29.900 --> 11:33.900
we do have the Top Gear style leaderboard storage question,

11:33.900 --> 11:36.900
which one of our amazing listeners has added

11:36.900 --> 11:38.700
to the self-hosted Wiki.

11:38.700 --> 11:41.300
So what we're gonna do is set some rules, right?

11:41.300 --> 11:43.100
It's raw storage.

11:43.100 --> 11:46.600
How much raw storage do you have on your LAN?

11:46.600 --> 11:48.700
Here's the, I'm gonna maybe cheat a little bit.

11:48.700 --> 11:51.700
So I have about 10 terabytes that I store offsite

11:51.700 --> 11:54.000
with the, you know, external hard drive

11:54.000 --> 11:56.600
that I leave in the office, you know, at work,

11:56.600 --> 11:58.700
so that way I have, you know, cold storage.

11:58.700 --> 12:02.200
So if we include that, it's about 80 terabytes.

12:02.200 --> 12:03.100
But we don't include that

12:03.100 --> 12:05.400
because we literally just said on your LAN.

12:05.400 --> 12:08.200
I know, but it's on my LAN for like, you know,

12:08.200 --> 12:10.000
a couple hours a month.

12:10.000 --> 12:13.400
Unless we count tail scale as the LAN these days.

12:13.400 --> 12:14.600
So who knows?

12:14.600 --> 12:15.500
Oh boy.

12:15.500 --> 12:16.500
What do we think, audience?

12:16.500 --> 12:17.800
70 or 80 terabytes?

12:17.800 --> 12:18.700
Let me know in the chat,

12:18.700 --> 12:22.000
and we'll submit a pull request to the repo

12:22.000 --> 12:23.700
before the end of the show, hopefully.

12:23.700 --> 12:25.400
I need to do a calculation on my end

12:25.400 --> 12:28.100
now that we have these new servers in-house, too.

12:28.100 --> 12:31.900
There's two boxes, and each have 48 terabytes of storage,

12:31.900 --> 12:36.900
and then we have 24 terabytes of storage in the old server.

12:36.900 --> 12:39.700
Not to mention the Bitcoin node has, what, two?

12:39.700 --> 12:40.800
Is it two we threw in there?

12:40.800 --> 12:43.000
Eight terabytes, eight terabytes.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.400
Yeah, in the Bitcoin node.

12:44.400 --> 12:46.200
Yeah, that was an easy store that you shucked.

12:46.200 --> 12:49.300
Yeah, and then hid in his drawer for a year or two.

12:49.300 --> 12:51.400
Right.

12:51.400 --> 12:52.700
So I should do the final calculation

12:52.700 --> 12:54.000
just so we have it up to date.

12:54.000 --> 12:57.900
All right, so we're going with 80 terabytes then, are we?

12:57.900 --> 12:59.200
Eight, zero.

12:59.200 --> 13:02.800
Oh, that's because everybody likes him in the Discord.

13:02.800 --> 13:04.200
That's what's up.

13:04.200 --> 13:06.000
Thank you, thank you, audience.

13:06.000 --> 13:09.400
Jeff Gehling has 84 terabytes.

13:09.400 --> 13:11.600
So that puts you in fourth spot, Fuzzy.

13:11.600 --> 13:12.300
Good job.

13:12.300 --> 13:15.100
Yeah, I've got some worsting in the back bin,

13:15.100 --> 13:16.500
but I won't conclude that.

13:16.500 --> 13:18.000
Well, what you do is when you get it online,

13:18.000 --> 13:20.600
you come back on the show, and then you can beat him.

13:20.600 --> 13:25.100
I actually have to get more room in my storage server.

13:25.100 --> 13:27.100
I am maxed out.

13:27.100 --> 13:28.200
That's just it.

13:28.200 --> 13:29.800
Density is a thing, people.

13:29.800 --> 13:31.100
Hey, man, it's not my problem.

13:31.100 --> 13:32.600
If you want to be on the winner board or not,

13:32.600 --> 13:34.000
I mean, it's just not my problem.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.600
You just got to do what you got to do.

13:35.600 --> 13:38.400
All right, so should we get back to the drone.io love-hate

13:38.400 --> 13:39.200
relationship thing?

13:39.200 --> 13:40.300
What's that all about?

13:40.300 --> 13:43.300
I'm actually not an engineer or any kind of technical field.

13:43.300 --> 13:44.400
I'm a lawyer by profession.

13:44.400 --> 13:47.000
So I sort of dabbled in all this for fun.

13:47.000 --> 13:50.500
And so I started looking at drone because there were some

13:50.500 --> 13:53.800
things that I wanted to automate in terms of building Docker

13:53.800 --> 13:56.500
images and some other stuff.

13:56.500 --> 13:58.600
And I know GitHub Actions was out there,

13:58.600 --> 13:59.800
but this is self-hosted.

13:59.800 --> 14:01.900
I want to learn how to do this all myself.

14:01.900 --> 14:07.200
So drone is a CI-CD system with continuous integration,

14:07.200 --> 14:09.600
continuous deployment, where basically you can,

14:09.600 --> 14:11.900
it's very similar to GitHub Actions or Jenkins or some of

14:11.900 --> 14:15.100
the other ones that are, I think Circle CI is another one.

14:15.100 --> 14:17.400
Basically, you can do anything you can do in a Bash script.

14:17.400 --> 14:19.600
Like I basically use it to do a bunch of Bash commands

14:19.600 --> 14:20.900
on some things.

14:20.900 --> 14:23.000
It builds a bunch of my Docker images for me.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.500
I built actually, one of the recent things I did was I

14:25.500 --> 14:29.800
actually started building an Ubuntu server image every week

14:29.800 --> 14:31.600
that gets deployed into a Nextcloud.

14:31.600 --> 14:34.300
So that way I just have a constantly up-to-date cloud

14:34.300 --> 14:36.200
and knitted ISO image.

14:36.200 --> 14:38.400
I've had a few issues with drone myself, actually.

14:38.400 --> 14:43.100
Like just for no apparent reason, a job that I've set up,

14:43.100 --> 14:45.400
the build will stop running automatically

14:45.400 --> 14:47.200
for no apparent reason.

14:47.200 --> 14:50.600
Like I will push something to my GitT instance.

14:50.600 --> 14:54.400
The build will detect that it's been pushed,

14:54.400 --> 14:56.000
but nothing happens.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.100
And I can't figure out exactly quite what's going on there.

14:58.100 --> 15:01.600
So I delete the build in drone and then I recreate it

15:01.600 --> 15:03.400
and it's fine for a couple of weeks.

15:03.400 --> 15:05.100
And then the same thing happens

15:05.100 --> 15:08.000
and it's infuriating, if I'm honest.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.300
Drone, so the issues I had with it,

15:10.300 --> 15:14.000
as I kind of laid out in the post, were, you know,

15:14.000 --> 15:15.400
it's really good,

15:15.400 --> 15:18.100
but the documentation was pretty poor in some ways.

15:18.100 --> 15:19.400
Like the one thing I remember,

15:19.400 --> 15:22.100
I was actually looking through the post again recently,

15:22.100 --> 15:23.700
cron, cron jobs.

15:23.700 --> 15:26.700
You couldn't tell it a time zone.

15:26.700 --> 15:31.000
So therefore it defaulted to, you know, GMT, you know,

15:31.000 --> 15:32.500
Greenwich Mean Time.

15:32.500 --> 15:34.400
And I couldn't figure out how to get it on my time zone,

15:34.400 --> 15:35.200
which was annoying.

15:35.200 --> 15:37.700
So I had to always think five hours difference.

15:37.700 --> 15:40.800
Hey man, I've made a career out of that.

15:40.800 --> 15:42.800
Ba-dum-bum.

15:42.800 --> 15:44.100
Actually, I'm just kind of curious

15:44.100 --> 15:46.800
because you did tease a little Home Assistant action there.

15:46.800 --> 15:48.500
Can you give us just kind of a rough idea

15:48.500 --> 15:50.300
of the Home Assistant setup, what it's running on

15:50.300 --> 15:52.400
and sort of the key things you have it doing for you?

15:52.400 --> 15:53.700
Just like a picture.

15:53.700 --> 15:55.500
I run Home Assistant in Docker.

15:55.500 --> 15:57.400
It's running on my Proxmox server downstairs

15:57.400 --> 15:58.600
in the basement.

15:58.600 --> 16:01.800
The main backbone of what I run here is Z-Wave.

16:01.800 --> 16:03.500
All my switches are Z-Wave.

16:03.500 --> 16:05.200
I have a bunch of sensors that are Z-Wave though.

16:05.200 --> 16:07.900
I've started using a lot more ZigBee sensors

16:07.900 --> 16:09.400
just because they're cheaper

16:09.400 --> 16:12.300
and I found they work a little bit better than the Z-Wave.

16:12.300 --> 16:13.800
Better in what way?

16:13.800 --> 16:16.300
So I got these Z-Wave sensors

16:16.300 --> 16:18.600
that were for a company called Dome.

16:18.600 --> 16:20.300
I think it was the name, Dome.

16:20.300 --> 16:22.700
And I think they've gone out of business

16:22.700 --> 16:24.700
since they made these.

16:24.700 --> 16:25.900
Uh-oh.

16:25.900 --> 16:28.700
Yeah, so they work, oh, they work pretty well,

16:28.700 --> 16:31.700
but they're also, I think they were about 35 or 40 bucks

16:31.700 --> 16:35.200
versus the ZigBee Aquara buttons are like 20.

16:36.100 --> 16:37.700
So I have them all over the house

16:37.700 --> 16:39.200
because one of the big things I have here

16:39.200 --> 16:42.200
is I have all the lights are on automation.

16:42.200 --> 16:43.800
So every time motion's detected,

16:43.800 --> 16:46.100
with certain current parameters are met,

16:46.100 --> 16:47.100
the lights will turn on

16:47.100 --> 16:49.400
and then after a set period of time, they'll turn off.

16:49.400 --> 16:50.500
Sure, nice.

16:50.500 --> 16:53.400
Did you then I assume go through the Z-Wave migration

16:53.400 --> 16:55.100
that I have been putting off?

16:55.100 --> 16:56.100
Yes, I did.

16:56.100 --> 16:58.300
I am on the Z-Wave JS.

16:58.300 --> 17:01.400
I've been on it for probably over a year now.

17:01.400 --> 17:02.600
Oh, rub it in.

17:03.500 --> 17:06.500
Originally, what I had done was I actually,

17:06.500 --> 17:08.300
I got to the Z-Wave network rebooting

17:08.300 --> 17:11.100
took like five, 10, 15, 20 minutes sometimes

17:11.100 --> 17:12.600
for me to reboot Home Assistant

17:12.600 --> 17:14.400
where it would just sit there spinning

17:14.400 --> 17:17.400
and it would take forever for the network to come back up.

17:17.400 --> 17:18.900
And so I actually got tired of that to the point

17:18.900 --> 17:21.900
where I actually created a separate Home Assistant instance

17:21.900 --> 17:23.200
that only ran Z-Wave.

17:23.200 --> 17:24.400
Huh, interesting idea.

17:24.400 --> 17:28.300
And I bridged it with MQTT to my main instance.

17:28.300 --> 17:30.400
And you're still doing it that way now?

17:30.400 --> 17:32.500
No, no, no, so I was doing that for a while

17:32.500 --> 17:35.100
and then the Open Z-Wave came out

17:35.100 --> 17:36.300
and I'm like, oh, let me give this a try

17:36.300 --> 17:38.000
and see if this is better and it was,

17:38.000 --> 17:40.200
but then obviously that got deprecated and moved on.

17:40.200 --> 17:42.700
So I'm like, well, I'm kind of on a dead end here

17:42.700 --> 17:44.100
and I've already done the pain once

17:44.100 --> 17:46.600
I might as well change it all.

17:46.600 --> 17:48.300
So I upgraded to the Z-Wave JS

17:48.300 --> 17:51.400
and honestly it's worked brilliantly.

17:51.400 --> 17:54.000
There's been a couple of things where like the lock I have,

17:54.000 --> 17:56.400
the Schlage lock, I had to create a couple of sensors

17:56.400 --> 17:57.900
to kind of get back some functionality

17:57.900 --> 18:00.800
that was default on Open Z-Wave

18:00.800 --> 18:03.500
for like what guest code and what door codes use.

18:03.500 --> 18:06.900
Cause one of the things I have is if a door code is used,

18:06.900 --> 18:10.100
like if I create a one-time guest code, if it's used,

18:10.100 --> 18:12.400
it'll actually delete that code after it's used.

18:12.400 --> 18:13.600
That's great.

18:13.600 --> 18:14.700
That is cool.

18:14.700 --> 18:16.100
So it recycles once a week.

18:16.100 --> 18:18.700
I get a telegram ping saying, here's the new guest code.

18:18.700 --> 18:20.400
I can give that out to people

18:20.400 --> 18:22.000
if they need to get into my house for whatever reason,

18:22.000 --> 18:23.400
then it'll delete itself.

18:23.400 --> 18:25.500
I would imagine you're probably in pretty good shape too

18:25.500 --> 18:28.600
because I thought I heard today on the live stream

18:28.600 --> 18:32.000
that the Z-Wave JS maintainer now works full time

18:32.000 --> 18:33.500
for Nebuchadnezzar.

18:33.500 --> 18:35.200
So they're gonna be probably keeping that

18:35.200 --> 18:36.600
in pretty good shape.

18:36.600 --> 18:37.700
Yes, I had heard that.

18:37.700 --> 18:39.400
I think I'd seen that as well.

18:39.400 --> 18:42.100
And I'm actually in the process of building a new house.

18:42.100 --> 18:44.500
And so I'm actually gonna keep using Z-Wave there

18:44.500 --> 18:47.000
for the switches just because I hadn't been able to find

18:47.000 --> 18:49.800
any kind of Zigbee equivalent that allows dimming

18:49.800 --> 18:52.200
and switches for a reasonable price.

18:52.200 --> 18:54.800
I know Inovelli just came out with their blue switches,

18:54.800 --> 18:57.600
but they're like $45 a switch.

18:57.600 --> 18:58.900
The brand I like is Zoos

18:58.900 --> 19:00.600
or I guess it's sold by the smartest home

19:00.600 --> 19:03.500
and they're about $25 a switch.

19:03.500 --> 19:07.600
Yeah, Z-O-O-Z is the brand.

19:07.600 --> 19:10.300
Now I know that you have some like whiz bang traffic

19:10.300 --> 19:13.200
like system to tell your kids it's okay

19:13.200 --> 19:14.200
to get up in the morning.

19:14.200 --> 19:17.300
Like as a new parent, I need to absorb this.

19:17.300 --> 19:19.600
Tell me, yeah, I wanna hear about this too.

19:19.600 --> 19:20.900
One of the things that I did

19:20.900 --> 19:22.400
that my wife absolutely loves

19:22.400 --> 19:26.900
is I have a Raspberry Pi that I installed Volumio on

19:26.900 --> 19:28.500
that acts as a sound machine.

19:28.500 --> 19:30.700
So it just plays white noise for the kids

19:30.700 --> 19:32.800
and there's a door sensor on the door

19:32.800 --> 19:34.800
that when it's closed and the light turns off,

19:34.800 --> 19:36.600
it turns on the sound machine.

19:36.600 --> 19:38.000
Now I've gone through different variations

19:38.000 --> 19:40.100
of how you turn the sound machine off in the morning,

19:40.100 --> 19:43.300
but it'll also automatically turn off in the morning.

19:43.300 --> 19:45.100
What I do is actually that's kind of in handy

19:45.100 --> 19:48.300
for doing things like the okay to wake clock,

19:48.300 --> 19:49.600
which are useful for toddlers

19:49.600 --> 19:52.300
because they obviously can't read a clock yet.

19:52.300 --> 19:54.900
But they can, they do know their colors.

19:54.900 --> 19:58.000
So my three-year-old for a long time,

19:58.000 --> 20:00.800
what I do is about, it used to be an hour,

20:00.800 --> 20:03.000
but then he started getting up earlier.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.400
So now I've pushed it to about a half hour

20:04.400 --> 20:06.100
before he's supposed to wake up.

20:06.100 --> 20:09.700
I have a Z-Wave bulb in his room that will turn on red

20:09.700 --> 20:12.200
and that's kind of, he knows if he wakes up,

20:12.200 --> 20:14.000
he's not allowed to get out of bed.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.600
He still does sometimes,

20:15.600 --> 20:17.700
but most of the time he knows if it's red,

20:17.700 --> 20:19.400
he's not supposed to get out of bed.

20:19.400 --> 20:20.900
Whenever the time actually strikes

20:20.900 --> 20:22.100
that he's allowed to wake up,

20:22.100 --> 20:23.500
it turns green.

20:23.500 --> 20:27.100
The other thing I've done is I have an ESP board

20:27.100 --> 20:29.400
running WLED under his bed

20:29.400 --> 20:30.900
that also if he gets out of bed

20:30.900 --> 20:32.600
in the middle of the night and the door opens,

20:32.600 --> 20:34.200
the light turns on red, pretty dims,

20:34.200 --> 20:36.500
that way he can see and not trip over his feet

20:36.500 --> 20:38.600
or actually get into bed at night.

20:38.600 --> 20:40.600
He finds that to be a lot of fun.

20:40.600 --> 20:41.800
That's really cool.

20:41.800 --> 20:43.400
I mean, it's pretty cruel of you to keep your kid

20:43.400 --> 20:45.300
in their bedroom until midday, but hey.

20:45.300 --> 20:47.500
I wish midday usually 5 a.m.

20:47.500 --> 20:49.500
I know, yeah.

20:49.500 --> 20:51.200
Speaking of quality of life improvements,

20:51.200 --> 20:54.300
like I could see how that would make the entire household

20:54.300 --> 20:58.300
just way better instead of this random time thing

20:58.300 --> 21:00.200
that many of us have experienced.

21:00.200 --> 21:02.100
It worked well for the first little bit.

21:02.100 --> 21:06.700
He's gotten, he goes in phases of obeying it and not

21:06.700 --> 21:08.000
because yet he's three.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.900
So I can't exactly fault him.

21:09.900 --> 21:13.100
Hey, maybe I need to get one of those from my wife.

21:13.100 --> 21:15.700
Actually, one of my all-time favorite automations I have

21:15.700 --> 21:18.000
is so I have it on my blog somewhere,

21:18.000 --> 21:21.700
but you basically I have two pieces of aluminum foil

21:21.700 --> 21:23.200
that's over a piece of cardboard

21:23.200 --> 21:26.500
and I have it underneath the bed tied to an ESP 32.

21:26.500 --> 21:29.900
And when I get into bed at night, the lights all turn off.

21:29.900 --> 21:30.800
That's great.

21:30.800 --> 21:31.500
That's hilarious.

21:31.500 --> 21:33.000
And if one of us gets out of bed at night,

21:33.000 --> 21:34.900
the light turns on, you know, again, reds,

21:34.900 --> 21:36.900
that way you can see and not trip over all the stuff

21:36.900 --> 21:38.000
that's on the floor.

21:38.000 --> 21:38.900
Is this motion?

21:38.900 --> 21:39.900
Is it pressure sensing?

21:39.900 --> 21:41.000
What's happening?

21:41.000 --> 21:41.800
It's pressure sensitive.

21:41.800 --> 21:44.100
So basically, it's when there's enough pressure

21:44.100 --> 21:46.600
on the cardboard, it basically pushes through.

21:46.600 --> 21:48.900
There's a capacitive, I don't know if it's capacitive

21:48.900 --> 21:51.200
or whatever it is, but there's enough of a connection.

21:51.200 --> 21:53.900
It changes the resistive load so that the ESP

21:53.900 --> 21:56.100
can pick up that slight difference

21:56.100 --> 21:58.400
and trigger based on that.

21:58.400 --> 22:00.300
You nerds.

22:00.300 --> 22:02.300
Honestly, I was shocked how well it worked.

22:02.300 --> 22:04.600
Again, there's like, you know, Sleep IQ sells

22:04.600 --> 22:07.100
like a $200 version of this kind of a thing.

22:07.100 --> 22:09.600
I think I put it together for like 50 bucks.

22:09.600 --> 22:11.100
Well, Fuzzy, thank you very much for coming on.

22:11.100 --> 22:12.100
I think you're going to stick around

22:12.100 --> 22:13.600
for the second half of the show.

22:13.600 --> 22:16.500
Is there anywhere that, whilst you've got the mic,

22:16.500 --> 22:17.800
you'd like to send people?

22:17.800 --> 22:19.800
Blog.FuzzyMissBorn.com.

22:19.800 --> 22:20.500
Very good.

22:20.500 --> 22:22.300
And of course, on the Discord as well.

22:22.300 --> 22:23.800
Yes, that's probably one of the best ways to get me

22:23.800 --> 22:26.600
if you want to talk to me.

22:26.600 --> 22:28.600
Linode.com slash SSH.

22:28.600 --> 22:31.900
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account

22:31.900 --> 22:34.900
and you go there to support this year's show.

22:34.900 --> 22:36.600
Linode is the tinker's cloud.

22:36.600 --> 22:37.300
You know what I'm saying?

22:37.300 --> 22:39.000
Like, you could just deploy everything with one click.

22:39.000 --> 22:42.500
Like, I was just looking today and they have a one click

22:42.500 --> 22:44.300
for PyHole on Linode.

22:44.300 --> 22:45.900
And I started thinking like, that could be great

22:45.900 --> 22:47.200
for my son's laptop.

22:47.200 --> 22:50.100
That could be excellent for mobile devices.

22:50.100 --> 22:51.600
So if you want to go that route, you can.

22:51.600 --> 22:53.400
But if you want to tinker, like I'm saying,

22:53.400 --> 22:55.000
like you want to go all the way down to the metal

22:55.000 --> 22:57.200
and then like deploy your own custom system,

22:57.200 --> 22:58.200
Linode lets you do that.

22:58.200 --> 23:00.700
They got guides, they got information on how to do that,

23:00.700 --> 23:02.700
and they've got the best support in the business.

23:02.700 --> 23:04.100
But if you like performance,

23:04.100 --> 23:06.100
they've also got something for you there too.

23:06.100 --> 23:11.200
NVME hard drives, AMD EPYC CPUs, dedicated GPU rigs

23:11.200 --> 23:13.900
if you want 40 gigabit connection to the hypervisors,

23:13.900 --> 23:16.300
11 data centers around the world in strategic places

23:16.300 --> 23:19.800
where they are their own ISP.

23:19.800 --> 23:20.600
You see what I'm saying?

23:20.600 --> 23:22.100
Nobody does it like Linode.

23:22.100 --> 23:24.500
And I love their object storage.

23:24.500 --> 23:29.200
Their S3 compatible object storage is like my superpower.

23:29.200 --> 23:30.500
I use it for all kinds of things.

23:30.500 --> 23:33.800
I needed to just test a new RSS format

23:33.800 --> 23:36.100
and I just needed to like have an XML file

23:36.100 --> 23:38.900
that was publicly available for like 30 minutes.

23:38.900 --> 23:40.600
Like, what was I going to do?

23:40.600 --> 23:42.700
Put that on a web server like an animal?

23:42.700 --> 23:45.300
No, I put it up on object storage like a gentleman.

23:45.300 --> 23:47.200
And of course their API is great.

23:47.200 --> 23:49.300
Their command line client is quick.

23:49.300 --> 23:50.600
There's so many things I love about it,

23:50.600 --> 23:52.300
but just go try it out for yourself.

23:52.300 --> 23:55.200
Best customer support, super fast networking,

23:55.200 --> 23:58.200
crazy fast rigs, and a Linux culture that runs deep.

23:58.200 --> 23:59.100
That's Linode right there.

23:59.100 --> 24:02.000
That's why I choose to use them for two and a half years now.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.100
Everything we've built in the last two and a half years,

24:04.100 --> 24:05.400
I put it up on Linode.

24:05.400 --> 24:08.000
Go try it out and get $100 while you support the show.

24:08.000 --> 24:12.300
Linode.com slash SSH.

24:12.300 --> 24:13.200
Now today for the show,

24:13.200 --> 24:16.800
I thought I'd spin up a Google Analytics alternative

24:16.800 --> 24:18.800
called Plausible.

24:18.800 --> 24:23.300
This is a lightweight open source web analytics engine.

24:23.300 --> 24:25.800
Hold on, I've got a Google,

24:25.800 --> 24:28.200
would you call it screen on my desk next to me?

24:28.200 --> 24:29.500
Oh yeah, the assistant.

24:29.500 --> 24:32.800
I think it's grumpy because it's literally just pulled up.

24:32.800 --> 24:36.100
It's time to ditch Google Analytics on the screen.

24:36.100 --> 24:38.000
It's listening.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.100
It knows now, now they've logged that.

24:40.100 --> 24:42.600
Absolutely, yeah, so I'm in trouble with the big G.

24:42.600 --> 24:44.200
But anyway, this Plausible thing

24:44.200 --> 24:47.200
doesn't require any user acceptable cookies.

24:47.200 --> 24:49.600
You know that annoying GDPR pop-up thing?

24:49.600 --> 24:50.900
It's fully compliant with that

24:50.900 --> 24:52.500
as well as several other things.

24:52.500 --> 24:54.500
It's made and hosted in the EU.

24:54.500 --> 24:57.200
So let me clarify, there is a hosted version.

24:57.200 --> 24:59.400
I'm talking about the self-hosted version,

24:59.400 --> 25:01.700
which is just something you can run in a container.

25:01.700 --> 25:03.600
I chose to put mine up on Linode,

25:03.600 --> 25:06.000
but you could run it at home, any way you like.

25:06.000 --> 25:11.000
I found the setup process was kind of a pain in the bum.

25:11.300 --> 25:12.140
Oh really?

25:12.140 --> 25:14.900
Took me about two or three hours to get through in the end.

25:14.900 --> 25:18.000
The reason for that is because to spin up this thing,

25:18.000 --> 25:21.500
it's about, I think it's four containers as a database.

25:21.500 --> 25:24.000
There is a, it's like a queuing engine,

25:24.000 --> 25:27.200
like a Redis style thing called ClickHouse.

25:27.200 --> 25:30.200
There's the app itself, and then there's an SMTP relay.

25:30.200 --> 25:33.400
So those four containers come together

25:33.400 --> 25:36.500
to form the app that is plausible.

25:36.500 --> 25:39.700
But of course, their documentation

25:39.700 --> 25:43.000
doesn't quite tell you all the little tricks you need to do

25:43.000 --> 25:44.900
and all the environment variables you need to specify

25:44.900 --> 25:46.200
to get it up and running properly,

25:46.200 --> 25:48.900
which is super annoying.

25:48.900 --> 25:50.700
The Docker compose script

25:50.700 --> 25:53.100
that they have actually linked in their documentation

25:53.100 --> 25:55.100
is about two years old.

25:55.100 --> 25:56.900
And so I was going through following this thing

25:56.900 --> 25:58.500
and looking at the version numbers, and then I thought,

25:58.500 --> 26:01.700
right, I'll just go and check the latest tag in Docker Hub.

26:01.700 --> 26:03.900
Yeah, two years old, completely out of date,

26:03.900 --> 26:04.700
hasn't been touched.

26:04.700 --> 26:07.200
So then I went to the real orange one's GitHub

26:07.200 --> 26:08.040
and looked at what he's doing,

26:08.040 --> 26:10.200
because I know he runs plausible too.

26:10.200 --> 26:13.800
And his GitHub repo combined with their documentation,

26:13.800 --> 26:15.800
I eventually got it up and running.

26:15.800 --> 26:18.600
And once I did, I was super duper happy with this thing.

26:18.600 --> 26:22.100
You know, I had to embed a little JavaScript header

26:22.100 --> 26:25.100
in each webpage that I wanted to track.

26:25.100 --> 26:26.200
And within a minute or two,

26:26.200 --> 26:27.800
I could see people showing up straight away.

26:27.800 --> 26:31.200
So my MKdocs website at perfectmediaserver.com,

26:31.200 --> 26:34.200
my ghost blog at blog.ktz.me,

26:34.200 --> 26:36.800
I even put selfhosted.show on there as well,

26:36.800 --> 26:38.200
just as a test.

26:38.200 --> 26:41.000
And I gotta say, it was pretty flawless.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.600
Are you getting real time numbers?

26:42.600 --> 26:43.440
Yep.

26:43.440 --> 26:45.000
Ah, I love that.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.200
Okay, so you took a couple hours to get up and running.

26:47.200 --> 26:48.300
And now once it's up,

26:48.300 --> 26:50.800
is it something that you're putting like on the public web?

26:50.800 --> 26:51.640
How is that working?

26:51.640 --> 26:54.500
Is it behind a firewall and can you give access to others?

26:54.500 --> 26:56.900
So there's a few different things you can do.

26:56.900 --> 26:59.900
By default, it's limited to authenticated users,

26:59.900 --> 27:01.600
you know, to the admin user that you create

27:01.600 --> 27:05.800
and any other users that you create in the app itself.

27:05.800 --> 27:07.700
But when you and I were talking before the show,

27:07.700 --> 27:09.900
I thought, oh, it'd be cool if I could just show Chris

27:09.900 --> 27:11.100
what I'm doing here.

27:11.100 --> 27:13.300
And so for the selfhosted.show thing,

27:13.300 --> 27:16.600
I went into the site settings for that specific site.

27:16.600 --> 27:19.200
And there's a whole list of things I can do.

27:19.200 --> 27:23.900
So I can not only make this publicly available,

27:23.900 --> 27:25.200
I've just switched this on.

27:25.200 --> 27:27.400
So I'm actually gonna put this in the chat room

27:27.400 --> 27:28.900
so the live stream can go and have a look

27:28.900 --> 27:32.300
at the analytics that we pulled up today on selfhosted.show.

27:32.300 --> 27:34.300
So that's a public version that we can do,

27:34.300 --> 27:36.800
but I can also give specific users

27:36.800 --> 27:39.500
like an obfuscated link.

27:39.500 --> 27:42.800
So I can say, right, I want to share this specific thing

27:42.800 --> 27:45.600
with this email address

27:45.600 --> 27:48.900
and I'm gonna give them a password

27:48.900 --> 27:51.600
and it expires after a certain length of time.

27:51.600 --> 27:54.100
Can you imagine doing that for like a sponsor or something?

27:54.100 --> 27:55.700
Right, that is a fantastic feature

27:55.700 --> 27:59.200
just from like working with somebody for a short period of time.

27:59.200 --> 28:01.600
The one thing that I found when you gave me the link

28:01.600 --> 28:03.200
and I kind of looked around in there

28:03.200 --> 28:06.600
is it doesn't seem like it goes as deep maybe

28:06.600 --> 28:08.400
as Google Analytics does.

28:08.400 --> 28:11.100
Like Google Analytics, you could just keep drilling down

28:11.100 --> 28:14.400
and down and down and getting more specifics.

28:14.400 --> 28:15.800
This is a little higher level.

28:15.800 --> 28:17.400
Like it tells you everything you need to know.

28:17.400 --> 28:19.800
Your unique visitors, your total page views,

28:19.800 --> 28:22.000
your bounce rate, and the average visit duration.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.800
And of course, your top sources and your top pages

28:24.800 --> 28:26.600
and the locations in which they come from

28:26.600 --> 28:28.100
and the types of devices they use.

28:28.100 --> 28:30.100
So it's all, it's all what you need.

28:30.100 --> 28:32.300
It's not, nothing's really missing

28:32.300 --> 28:34.500
and it'd be fine for what we use,

28:34.500 --> 28:37.400
but it did seem like maybe not quite as detailed

28:37.400 --> 28:39.400
as the Google stuff might be.

28:39.400 --> 28:40.600
Do you agree with that?

28:40.600 --> 28:41.900
That's the price you pay

28:41.900 --> 28:44.500
for not having surveillance capitalism

28:44.500 --> 28:45.800
be the driver of everything.

28:45.800 --> 28:46.300
Right.

28:46.300 --> 28:47.500
I'm not trying to get political,

28:47.500 --> 28:49.000
but I am gonna have a little bit of a rant

28:49.000 --> 28:51.900
about the death of democracy and social media

28:51.900 --> 28:54.300
and everything in the last six to ten years

28:54.300 --> 28:57.200
and I could go off the rails, but I'm not going to here.

28:57.200 --> 28:58.800
I'm gonna keep it on topic.

28:58.800 --> 29:00.600
And you know, that's one of the things I like

29:00.600 --> 29:03.900
about Plausible actually is that because it's so lightweight

29:03.900 --> 29:07.600
and because it's so privacy friendly and privacy focused,

29:07.600 --> 29:10.500
I turned off privacy badger to make it work

29:10.500 --> 29:12.600
on my web browser, but I didn't, you know,

29:12.600 --> 29:14.300
I had a look at the trackers and it was very minimal

29:14.300 --> 29:17.600
what it was doing compared to what Google Analytics does.

29:17.600 --> 29:18.500
I really liked that.

29:18.500 --> 29:20.100
I mean, for me, that's a feature.

29:20.100 --> 29:21.200
I completely agree.

29:21.200 --> 29:22.700
We stopped using Google Analytics

29:22.700 --> 29:24.700
just because I'm creeped out by Google, but you know,

29:24.700 --> 29:26.700
I didn't really replace it with anything.

29:26.700 --> 29:28.300
So something that we could run ourselves

29:28.300 --> 29:31.200
on our own infrastructure and you know,

29:31.200 --> 29:33.400
use that data just so we get an idea of maybe

29:33.400 --> 29:35.000
how our website's performing because you know,

29:35.000 --> 29:36.900
one of the things you can figure out is maybe

29:36.900 --> 29:38.300
there's something wrong with the site.

29:38.300 --> 29:39.400
Maybe there's a design issue.

29:39.400 --> 29:42.800
There's insights that you miss and you know,

29:42.800 --> 29:44.900
your web page for online businesses

29:44.900 --> 29:46.900
is the front of your store.

29:46.900 --> 29:48.700
So that's pretty great.

29:48.700 --> 29:51.200
And I guess they do have a pay version too as well, right?

29:51.200 --> 29:52.900
So if you wanted to, you could go all in

29:52.900 --> 29:54.100
on their hosted version.

29:54.100 --> 29:56.100
It doesn't look like it's that expensive

29:56.100 --> 29:57.500
unless you get like millions of views

29:57.500 --> 29:58.900
and it gets up to like 90 bucks a month

29:58.900 --> 30:00.400
if you get 2 million views.

30:00.400 --> 30:03.300
Yeah, I suppose compared to Google's low, low price of free,

30:03.300 --> 30:05.400
but you are the product, it's expensive,

30:05.400 --> 30:08.400
but I'd rather support companies that are willing

30:08.400 --> 30:12.500
to give their software away like this than Google sometimes.

30:12.500 --> 30:14.400
Now Fuzzy, I know that you use a different one.

30:14.400 --> 30:16.300
Was it called Umami or something?

30:16.300 --> 30:18.200
Yeah, I think it's pronounced Umami.

30:18.200 --> 30:20.400
I think the orange one on Discord was talking

30:20.400 --> 30:21.500
about plausible at one point.

30:21.500 --> 30:22.900
So I was like, oh, I kind of want to get away

30:22.900 --> 30:26.100
from Google too, like everybody does who self hosts.

30:26.100 --> 30:27.700
And so I went and tried to try to spin it up

30:27.700 --> 30:30.800
and I ran into the same exact problem you did where I'm,

30:30.800 --> 30:32.500
generally I try and avoid apps

30:32.500 --> 30:35.600
that require more than like two containers.

30:35.600 --> 30:37.600
I just don't like ones that are that complicated.

30:37.600 --> 30:39.900
I just feel like it's defeats the purpose of Docker.

30:39.900 --> 30:41.900
Like I remember one time I tried to spin up a Unify thing

30:41.900 --> 30:43.500
and it was literally like 10 containers.

30:43.500 --> 30:45.400
I'm like, no, no.

30:45.400 --> 30:47.300
So Umami is only two containers.

30:47.300 --> 30:49.600
There's the database portion of it

30:49.600 --> 30:51.100
that I can run in MariaDB.

30:51.100 --> 30:54.200
And then there's the actual Umami collection thing.

30:54.200 --> 30:56.300
And from looking at what you posted on Discord

30:56.300 --> 30:59.800
and the website, Umami looks pretty much exactly the same.

30:59.800 --> 31:01.600
I don't know in terms of like features

31:01.600 --> 31:03.500
and the dashboard and everything,

31:03.500 --> 31:05.500
but like I can see the same exact things

31:05.500 --> 31:07.600
where I can see what pages got hit,

31:07.600 --> 31:10.700
where the source was from, the country,

31:10.700 --> 31:14.500
you know, desktop versus laptop versus tablet, all that.

31:14.500 --> 31:15.500
I can see the same thing.

31:15.500 --> 31:17.600
So if you're looking for something a little bit simpler

31:17.600 --> 31:19.800
to set up, it might be a decent option.

31:19.800 --> 31:21.800
I'll put a link to Umami in the show notes.

31:21.800 --> 31:24.500
Now, Alex, when you were showing me earlier today,

31:24.500 --> 31:26.700
plausible in your excitedness,

31:26.700 --> 31:28.500
you were describing the different containers

31:28.500 --> 31:31.400
and how at first, maybe once you're getting into it,

31:31.400 --> 31:34.200
it's a little bit more complex to get set up.

31:34.200 --> 31:36.400
But you did say that that was actually

31:36.400 --> 31:39.400
a really nice engineering decision for scalability.

31:39.400 --> 31:40.600
Can you talk on that a little bit?

31:40.600 --> 31:41.300
Yeah, absolutely.

31:41.300 --> 31:44.300
So if you look at the way in which, say,

31:44.300 --> 31:46.300
GitLab is architected, right?

31:46.300 --> 31:51.300
They provide a big bastard container

31:51.300 --> 31:55.200
that is like six gigs of RAM, does eight million processes,

31:55.200 --> 32:00.200
and completely is antithetical to the entire purpose

32:00.200 --> 32:03.000
of containers and microservices, right?

32:03.000 --> 32:05.500
It's one big monolith that they deploy.

32:05.500 --> 32:07.300
And if you want to spin up an extra worker

32:07.300 --> 32:11.100
or anything like that, like, it's just a mess.

32:11.100 --> 32:12.700
And I really hate that way of doing things.

32:12.700 --> 32:16.200
And the Unify controller and Plex is kind of the same, right?

32:16.200 --> 32:18.400
It has a database built into it.

32:18.400 --> 32:19.900
And actually, if you're thinking about it,

32:19.900 --> 32:23.600
it would be nice if Plex had a separate database container

32:23.600 --> 32:25.100
that lives somewhere else that I could back up

32:25.100 --> 32:28.300
and version independently of Plex itself.

32:28.300 --> 32:30.000
And that's one of the things I liked about Plausible

32:30.000 --> 32:32.100
is that because it has so many containers,

32:32.100 --> 32:34.000
you've got that queuing engine,

32:34.000 --> 32:35.200
the click house thing I talked about

32:35.200 --> 32:38.400
that operates in a similar kind of space to Redis

32:38.400 --> 32:41.800
that basically takes all the requests in in real time.

32:41.800 --> 32:44.400
Its only job is to listen and receive stuff.

32:44.400 --> 32:46.600
And then Plausible has workers that goes

32:46.600 --> 32:48.900
and processes those requests in real time.

32:48.900 --> 32:52.100
Now, a poorly architected application

32:52.100 --> 32:54.200
would only have one container doing that.

32:54.200 --> 32:56.400
And it would ingest all of that stuff

32:56.400 --> 32:58.500
into the primary container.

32:58.500 --> 33:00.500
And then when that queue or that buffer

33:00.500 --> 33:02.500
or whatever it is gets full,

33:02.500 --> 33:04.200
the container would start to slow down,

33:04.200 --> 33:06.400
it might have a memory leak, it might crash,

33:06.400 --> 33:07.500
all that kind of stuff.

33:07.500 --> 33:10.400
But by having the queue somewhere else,

33:10.400 --> 33:14.700
you leave Plausible itself as this controlled environment

33:14.700 --> 33:16.800
and it's able to not fall into that same trap

33:16.800 --> 33:18.800
as a lot of other applications do.

33:18.800 --> 33:22.900
Also, the data store being an external Postgres database,

33:22.900 --> 33:24.100
I have no problem with that.

33:24.100 --> 33:25.100
Yeah, no, I don't have an issue

33:25.100 --> 33:28.000
with databases being separate, I just, I don't know.

33:28.000 --> 33:29.800
When I start seeing that many containers,

33:29.800 --> 33:32.300
it just becomes frustrating for me to have to manage and...

33:32.300 --> 33:34.600
No, I get it, it puts you off, doesn't it?

33:34.600 --> 33:37.100
You sort of look at this thing and you go,

33:37.100 --> 33:39.200
I can grok and understand this in three seconds

33:39.200 --> 33:40.400
if it's one or two containers,

33:40.400 --> 33:43.600
but if it starts to get to three or four or five or more,

33:43.600 --> 33:46.600
you're like, eh, I'll do it next time.

33:46.600 --> 33:48.500
Yeah, exactly, exactly.

33:48.500 --> 33:49.900
That's sort of my line too.

33:49.900 --> 33:52.500
My last question on it, Alex, really is,

33:52.500 --> 33:55.900
did you notice much in terms of load time difference

33:55.900 --> 33:57.600
on the sites after you put it on there?

33:57.600 --> 34:00.000
Because you toss a little bit of JavaScript

34:00.000 --> 34:01.100
in the header, essentially,

34:01.100 --> 34:02.900
and then you're off to the races.

34:02.900 --> 34:05.400
Did you try benchmarking or at least refresh

34:05.400 --> 34:06.500
and see if it seemed any slower?

34:06.500 --> 34:08.500
Because I've also experienced that.

34:08.500 --> 34:11.700
I used to use a locally hosted analytics software

34:11.700 --> 34:13.100
that actually slowed the website down,

34:13.100 --> 34:14.300
so we had to bail on it.

34:14.300 --> 34:16.700
I personally didn't notice any difference

34:16.700 --> 34:19.100
and that's totally anecdotal,

34:19.100 --> 34:21.300
but I run Privacy Badger anyway,

34:21.300 --> 34:24.400
so I don't have a lot of Google Analytics

34:24.400 --> 34:27.700
and a lot of JavaScript running anyway.

34:27.700 --> 34:30.000
What I will say is on the plausible website,

34:30.000 --> 34:31.200
take this with a grain of salt,

34:31.200 --> 34:33.700
they say that their script is 45 times smaller

34:33.700 --> 34:34.700
than Google Analytics.

34:34.700 --> 34:37.000
So... Smaller tends to be faster.

34:37.000 --> 34:40.400
Yeah, and they reckon that because it's so much smaller,

34:40.400 --> 34:43.000
a site with 10,000 monthly visitors

34:43.000 --> 34:46.400
will save four and a half kilos of CO2 emissions per year

34:46.400 --> 34:48.900
simply by switching to plausible.

34:48.900 --> 34:51.300
So, do your bit for the planet, people.

34:51.300 --> 34:54.500
Right. Drop Google to save the planet.

34:58.500 --> 35:00.900
Tailscale.com slash self-hosted.

35:00.900 --> 35:02.400
Go there to get a free personal account

35:02.400 --> 35:05.200
for up to 20 devices and you support the show.

35:05.200 --> 35:07.700
Tailscale is a zero-config VPN.

35:07.700 --> 35:10.800
It installs on any device, manages your firewall rules,

35:10.800 --> 35:14.500
gets you going in just seconds from anywhere.

35:14.500 --> 35:16.000
Devices connect directly to each other

35:16.000 --> 35:18.300
using WireGuard's noise protocol.

35:18.300 --> 35:19.400
So you build a mesh network

35:19.400 --> 35:22.800
using the best VPN security in the business.

35:22.800 --> 35:24.900
It really changes the game.

35:24.900 --> 35:27.400
I have to say, too, I was really excited this morning

35:27.400 --> 35:30.500
to see that they just raised $100 million

35:30.500 --> 35:32.100
in Series B funding.

35:32.100 --> 35:34.000
And here's what they said about it.

35:34.000 --> 35:34.800
Why'd they do this?

35:34.800 --> 35:36.800
Because they're paranoid, they say.

35:36.800 --> 35:37.900
This isn't their first rodeo

35:37.900 --> 35:40.400
and we don't know where the economy or the market might go.

35:40.400 --> 35:41.400
And we don't want to be pressured

35:41.400 --> 35:44.800
into juicing our growth numbers beyond where they belong.

35:44.800 --> 35:48.100
We don't want to put revenue ahead of quality.

35:48.100 --> 35:51.600
Man, it really shows in their product, too.

35:51.600 --> 35:53.100
You know, you have a flat network

35:53.100 --> 35:54.400
where you get a static IP address

35:54.400 --> 35:55.800
for every device you care about.

35:55.800 --> 35:58.100
You can assign them a DNS name.

35:58.100 --> 36:01.200
It's always connected. They're always encrypted.

36:01.200 --> 36:03.800
It even works with double carrier NAT.

36:03.800 --> 36:06.000
It is fantastic.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.500
And I opened a support ticket with them recently.

36:08.500 --> 36:11.800
I exceeded my number of subnet routers that I'm allowed.

36:11.800 --> 36:15.200
They have a soft limit of one per free account.

36:15.200 --> 36:16.800
I had three, so you know,

36:16.800 --> 36:18.700
three times what the soft limit is.

36:18.700 --> 36:21.800
And it says, you are encouraged to upgrade your account

36:21.800 --> 36:25.500
if you exceed for, you know, a length of time.

36:25.500 --> 36:27.000
These are only soft limits, don't worry.

36:27.000 --> 36:30.100
We won't enforce them, but you're encouraged to upgrade.

36:30.100 --> 36:31.800
So I sent in a support ticket saying,

36:31.800 --> 36:34.200
hey, which tier should I be on?

36:34.200 --> 36:36.400
You know, I kind of want to give you some money

36:36.400 --> 36:38.200
because I think you're awesome.

36:38.200 --> 36:40.800
And they wrote back and said, no, it's okay.

36:40.800 --> 36:42.600
Just tell people about us. It's cool.

36:42.600 --> 36:43.900
They've also written a blog post

36:43.900 --> 36:46.700
about how they've built a sustainable infrastructure.

36:46.700 --> 36:49.600
So listeners of our show might be really interested in that.

36:49.600 --> 36:51.900
And it goes into their whole philosophy

36:51.900 --> 36:54.100
about making this thing work for the long haul.

36:54.100 --> 36:56.700
And I am so grateful because it's changed the way I work

36:56.700 --> 36:59.300
and it changes the way I do tech support with my family.

36:59.300 --> 37:01.100
It makes it when I'm remote.

37:01.100 --> 37:03.300
It makes it so seamless now.

37:03.300 --> 37:04.600
Go check it out and support the show

37:04.600 --> 37:07.400
and get it for free for up to 20 devices.

37:07.400 --> 37:10.700
It's tailscale.com slash self-hosted.

37:12.600 --> 37:15.200
Alex, we've been having a few adventures.

37:15.200 --> 37:17.000
Why don't you tell us a story?

37:17.000 --> 37:20.600
Well, I took Brent down to my basement the other day.

37:20.600 --> 37:23.300
He still has all those limbs. It's okay.

37:23.300 --> 37:25.200
I think they're all still intact anyway,

37:25.200 --> 37:27.100
because one of my hard drives

37:27.100 --> 37:29.500
has been dropping off the SATA bus this week.

37:29.500 --> 37:31.300
I didn't know why.

37:31.300 --> 37:33.000
And so we went down and took a look at this thing.

37:33.000 --> 37:35.700
And I think I did this maybe two or three months ago.

37:35.700 --> 37:39.600
I took the cable out and then put the cable back in

37:39.600 --> 37:42.500
and it worked perfectly for another two to three months.

37:42.500 --> 37:44.300
Oh yeah, that's what I've been doing with my machine here.

37:44.300 --> 37:45.600
You guys are awful.

37:45.600 --> 37:46.600
Right.

37:46.600 --> 37:50.100
Well, hey, look, sometimes it ain't stupid if it works, Brent.

37:50.100 --> 37:52.200
Yeah, but it is almost guaranteed

37:52.200 --> 37:53.800
to only work for a short period of time.

37:53.800 --> 37:55.800
No, not at all. Not with cables.

37:55.800 --> 37:59.600
In my experience, cables can be finicky little buggers.

37:59.600 --> 38:00.700
You need better ones.

38:00.700 --> 38:03.200
Maybe there's a little vibration, something got loose.

38:03.200 --> 38:04.100
Exactly.

38:04.100 --> 38:06.900
I learned long ago to put SATA cables with a little clips on

38:06.900 --> 38:09.900
because the ones without clips do vibrate out.

38:09.900 --> 38:11.100
I think my issue is likely

38:11.100 --> 38:12.800
I'm not running out of hard drives.

38:12.800 --> 38:14.100
Yeah, yeah.

38:14.100 --> 38:16.300
I think there's about 10 spinning drives in this server.

38:16.300 --> 38:18.100
You know, it's quite a few. So there's a lot of vibration.

38:18.100 --> 38:21.300
So realistically, it could be a cable.

38:21.300 --> 38:22.800
It could be some crosstalk issue

38:22.800 --> 38:25.000
with all those SATA cables running together.

38:25.000 --> 38:28.700
They're plugged into an HBA card, which is a SAS cable.

38:28.700 --> 38:32.900
So it's four SATA cables going into one SAS plug on an HBA card.

38:32.900 --> 38:34.800
So I was thinking maybe it's a bad cable.

38:34.800 --> 38:38.200
So I ordered a new cable off Amazon, put it in, and then...

38:38.200 --> 38:39.300
You ordered the short one.

38:39.300 --> 38:41.200
...realized it was too short and thought,

38:41.200 --> 38:44.700
I'll just go and grab a SATA cable just to tie us over.

38:44.700 --> 38:46.000
And then found in the drawer

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
that I actually already had the correct cable.

38:48.000 --> 38:50.400
Oh, I've done that. Yep.

38:50.400 --> 38:52.100
I've done that for sure.

38:52.100 --> 38:54.200
So anyway, I connected up the drive

38:54.200 --> 38:55.800
and it wouldn't mount.

38:55.800 --> 38:58.900
Proxmox was going crazy with, you know, XFS errors.

38:58.900 --> 39:00.800
And I was like, uh-oh, here we go.

39:00.800 --> 39:03.600
Smart wasn't showing me anything, but I've seen this before.

39:03.600 --> 39:06.200
It usually means the end of the drive in my experience.

39:06.200 --> 39:08.800
So brought the drive upstairs, took it out of the server,

39:08.800 --> 39:12.300
brought it upstairs, connected it to my little diagnostic station

39:12.300 --> 39:16.200
I've got behind me over here, and ran...

39:16.200 --> 39:18.100
Was it XFS repair?

39:18.100 --> 39:19.100
Yes, it was. I think.

39:19.100 --> 39:22.800
And that rebuilt the log or the...

39:22.800 --> 39:24.200
I don't know, something like that.

39:24.200 --> 39:24.900
The journal?

39:24.900 --> 39:25.800
Yeah, that's it.

39:25.800 --> 39:28.000
It took a good five, 10 minutes to do that,

39:28.000 --> 39:30.200
which was a bit squeaky bum time.

39:30.200 --> 39:32.100
And then it just mounted perfectly.

39:32.100 --> 39:34.000
And, you know, I was listening to the drive the whole time

39:34.000 --> 39:36.300
it was on the table next to me for any audible noises.

39:36.300 --> 39:39.800
You know, I've heard a drive clicking before and it seemed fine.

39:39.800 --> 39:41.600
It was running cool to the touch.

39:41.600 --> 39:44.200
It was behaving properly with the testing that I was doing.

39:44.200 --> 39:48.500
So I thought, okay, let's put it back in the basement server.

39:48.500 --> 39:51.700
And so far, so good.

39:51.700 --> 39:54.500
Oh, I thought this was going somewhere completely different.

39:54.500 --> 39:55.300
I mean, it could.

39:55.300 --> 39:58.000
That'll be the next episode.

39:58.000 --> 39:59.200
RAID is not a backup, people.

39:59.200 --> 40:01.500
This is true.

40:01.500 --> 40:04.200
Alex, I'm curious what you think the issue was

40:04.200 --> 40:06.200
and what you think the issue might be considering

40:06.200 --> 40:10.900
it still seems a little kind of like it may happen again.

40:10.900 --> 40:11.900
Seems fine now.

40:11.900 --> 40:15.600
I actually ran a bajillion SnapRaid checks and fixes

40:15.600 --> 40:19.900
and syncs and rebuilds and everything I could throw at this drive

40:19.900 --> 40:23.000
to stress it without actually wiping it and doing like a bad blocks run

40:23.000 --> 40:27.000
or something just to try and poke the bee's nest a little bit.

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
And for me, I think it's going to be fine.

40:29.000 --> 40:32.400
But originally I suspect there was either an issue with the power supply cable

40:32.400 --> 40:35.700
and maybe it sort of the voltage dipped slightly and it dropped off the bus

40:35.700 --> 40:39.400
a little bit in the middle of a write transaction or something

40:39.400 --> 40:44.400
and that corrupted the log or the data cable was bad, which I have replaced now.

40:44.400 --> 40:47.200
So, you know, in terms of variables and stuff like that,

40:47.200 --> 40:50.500
if something goes wrong with it again, I will know it's not the cable.

40:50.500 --> 40:52.000
I will know it's the drive.

40:52.000 --> 40:55.500
Now, this is a shucked drive originally and it's still within warranty.

40:55.500 --> 41:00.800
So actually part of me is kind of curious just to send it into Western Digital

41:00.800 --> 41:02.500
and see what they say.

41:02.500 --> 41:04.900
Did you keep the shucked bits?

41:04.900 --> 41:07.100
No, there is some like forget the name of it.

41:07.100 --> 41:12.400
It's like Magnuson Moss Act or something that you can you can quote to them

41:12.400 --> 41:13.700
and they have to fix it either way.

41:13.700 --> 41:18.000
Yeah, because they can't prove that my shucking broke the, you know,

41:18.000 --> 41:20.200
the whatever it is inside the drive.

41:20.200 --> 41:22.000
That is shockingly pro-consumer.

41:22.000 --> 41:22.600
I know, right?

41:22.600 --> 41:24.200
It's almost like we're in Europe.

41:24.200 --> 41:25.500
Chris has a drive that he shucked,

41:25.500 --> 41:29.300
but he definitely modified the drive by breaking the pin off,

41:29.300 --> 41:30.500
which was quite clever.

41:30.500 --> 41:32.200
Well, now that is physical damage.

41:32.200 --> 41:32.900
I don't do that.

41:32.900 --> 41:37.600
I do the captain tape or I just snip the three-volt rail on the power supply cable.

41:37.600 --> 41:40.900
I wanted it fixed forever and let's be honest, I'm never sending it in.

41:40.900 --> 41:42.200
I'm never going to do that.

41:42.200 --> 41:43.600
We also didn't have any tape.

41:43.600 --> 41:48.800
Yeah, we did look for the tape and I'm like screw this break.

41:48.800 --> 41:50.000
Alex, I'm curious.

41:50.000 --> 41:51.800
What did you end up doing with the cable?

41:51.800 --> 41:53.500
Which one the faulty cable?

41:53.500 --> 41:54.300
Yes, the faulty one.

41:54.300 --> 41:56.600
Did you just put it back in your drawer with the others?

41:56.600 --> 41:57.700
I think I might have done.

41:57.700 --> 41:59.300
Alex.

41:59.300 --> 41:59.900
Who knows?

41:59.900 --> 42:01.200
It's a mystery box of fun.

42:01.200 --> 42:02.800
Next time there's a drive problem.

42:02.800 --> 42:04.100
Yeah, right.

42:04.100 --> 42:06.600
So here's my solution to the 3.3.

42:06.600 --> 42:08.300
I'm showing the live stream on camera.

42:08.300 --> 42:11.800
I just cut the three-volt cable in my SATA.

42:11.800 --> 42:20.000
Like I have these like you plug one SATA cable in here, power cable in and then you get four like power plugs here.

42:20.000 --> 42:26.000
And if you just cut the three-volt wire here, this one, then you don't have to worry about captain tape or you know,

42:26.000 --> 42:27.500
physically damaging your drives.

42:27.500 --> 42:28.900
You just run them all off these.

42:28.900 --> 42:31.300
There must be some voltage going through those.

42:31.300 --> 42:32.700
Could they like arc or something?

42:32.700 --> 42:33.700
Do you do anything to?

42:33.700 --> 42:36.500
There's some electrical tape on it, but I mean, it's three volts.

42:36.500 --> 42:37.300
Yeah, it's three volts.

42:37.300 --> 42:38.100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

42:38.100 --> 42:41.200
So it's at most it's going to be like a little tingle.

42:41.200 --> 42:41.800
I don't mean for you.

42:41.800 --> 42:45.100
I just wondered, you know, maybe I should try licking it next time.

42:45.100 --> 42:47.100
See what happened the old the old D cell test.

42:47.100 --> 42:47.500
Yeah.

42:47.500 --> 42:48.600
No, I think it's more fun.

42:48.600 --> 42:52.100
Just leave it uncapped and that way you next time you're rooting around in the case.

42:52.100 --> 42:55.300
Just a little a little, you know, like operation.

42:55.300 --> 42:58.000
I've got a question for you guys with wedding rings and stuff.

42:58.000 --> 43:09.500
Like when I run digging around in a PC that's on I will take my wedding ring off because there was one time at the Apple store where I didn't and I actually shorted out a customer's motherboard.

43:09.500 --> 43:11.200
It hurt quite a bit too.

43:11.200 --> 43:15.000
I have never taken my wedding ring off to do any hardware work the watch.

43:15.000 --> 43:23.500
Sometimes the watch sometimes I will if I'm like, you know rooting around deep inside the case and physically can't reach wherever I am, but I've never had to take that.

43:23.500 --> 43:25.400
I've never had an arcing from my ring.

43:25.400 --> 43:26.800
I have to take off the watch.

43:26.800 --> 43:38.600
I don't like the watch on the wrist when like, you know the edge of the case and I'm rooting around in there and I'm smacking the watch up against those sharp edges scratches it all up same when I'm like working on like a project in the RV.

43:38.600 --> 43:41.100
I have to take the watch off.

43:41.100 --> 43:42.800
I actually don't wear the ring though anymore.

43:42.800 --> 43:44.000
I just sort of gave up on that.

43:44.000 --> 43:47.200
My whole body size changes all the time.

43:47.200 --> 43:51.600
And so I'd go from like a ring that was too tight to a ring that was too loose.

43:51.600 --> 43:54.000
This is also why I became a suspenders guy.

43:54.000 --> 43:54.900
See, I learned my lesson.

43:54.900 --> 44:05.600
My parents used to have those old school Christmas lights and I was always one of putting up the Christmas lights and there were enough times I broke the bulb and was trying to get it out and I stupidly did not unplug the strand.

44:05.600 --> 44:08.500
And I shocked myself more times than I care to admit.

44:08.500 --> 44:11.700
Well, it's one of those things that once it happens you watch out for for the rest of your life.

44:11.700 --> 44:13.100
I imagine right?

44:13.100 --> 44:14.500
Yeah, it definitely is.

44:14.500 --> 44:26.100
I think the thing that zapped me was one of the MagSafe 19 volt things like a laptop and yeah, it's done quite a bit and actually there was a it took a little bit out of my wedding ring.

44:26.100 --> 44:27.600
Like it was there's a little notch in it.

44:27.600 --> 44:29.500
You can just see oh man.

44:29.500 --> 44:31.000
Yeah, that's here near miss.

44:31.000 --> 44:35.800
I had to fill out accident report forms and all they sent me home.

44:35.800 --> 44:41.400
And that's just like an awkward conversation when you come home to it's like a well kind of damaged my wedding ring, honey.

44:41.400 --> 44:42.000
Yeah.

44:42.000 --> 44:45.100
Oh, well, we got some boost into the show last week.

44:45.100 --> 44:48.900
We got some people boosting both good and bad things into the show.

44:48.900 --> 44:53.000
Rubik come in Ruby Ruby Kinman Ruby man, Rubik.

44:53.000 --> 44:54.100
All right, Rubik man.

44:54.100 --> 44:56.400
I think my wife and I are moving to a new apartment soon.

44:56.400 --> 45:00.300
We have permission from the landlord to install a camera pointed at the parking lot.

45:00.300 --> 45:04.200
Can you recommend one that works with home assistant for a decent price now?

45:04.200 --> 45:07.300
He doesn't tell us what his connectivity situation is.

45:07.300 --> 45:08.900
So what are your thoughts Alex?

45:08.900 --> 45:13.900
You could just get a dog and point that at the car park, you know, that would bark quite a bit.

45:13.900 --> 45:18.600
I mean the obvious choice despite all their flaws really the wisecams.

45:18.600 --> 45:20.400
Yeah, that's what I was probably going to say too.

45:20.400 --> 45:28.400
We're actually going to have our next boost here that kind of makes it that makes them even more appealing sexy pants boosted in for 210 sats.

45:28.400 --> 45:30.600
So this dropped on reddit yesterday.

45:30.600 --> 45:35.400
It supports USB Ethernet adapters tail scale and it runs an RTMP server.

45:35.400 --> 45:36.700
It'll even make you tacos.

45:36.700 --> 45:42.700
Well, maybe not that but it's essentially a series of wise hacks.

45:42.700 --> 45:47.700
That I think make these cameras even more compelling especially when you can when you combine it with something like wise bridge.

45:47.700 --> 45:54.000
So I have a link in the show notes to a github repo that lets you essentially root the devices and get more out of them.

45:54.000 --> 45:59.200
Can you imagine the possibilities of running tail scale on the camera itself?

45:59.200 --> 46:00.400
That's cool.

46:00.400 --> 46:05.400
That opens up a whole new kind of like, well, it's a whole new world as they say.

46:05.400 --> 46:14.400
The other cameras as far as like just connect them to Wi-Fi and they have decent apps that also work with home assistant is the logi circle.

46:14.400 --> 46:18.300
However, I've had mixed results with that, but that's also another option.

46:18.300 --> 46:25.500
If you have a recommendation for a cheap portable camera that's easy to power and easy to get connected, send us a boost and let us know.

46:25.500 --> 46:27.200
I actually have a good one.

46:27.200 --> 46:30.600
The eufy cams, I've actually been a huge fan of.

46:30.600 --> 46:33.700
They are basically the same price as the wise ones.

46:33.700 --> 46:36.100
They come built in with RTSP.

46:36.100 --> 46:37.300
They're running throughout my house.

46:37.300 --> 46:38.600
I have about six of them.

46:38.600 --> 46:41.300
I have the doorbell and they work just fine.

46:41.300 --> 46:45.500
And I also hear in the home kit community that they work really well with home kit setup as well.

46:45.500 --> 46:47.400
Haven't tried it, but that does sound good.

46:47.400 --> 46:50.500
Sir Lurks-a-Lot wrote in with two boosts.

46:50.500 --> 46:53.600
The first one reads, autonomous spinning blades?

46:53.600 --> 46:56.300
Oh, homeowner's liability insurance coverage or not.

46:56.300 --> 47:02.400
I would be uneasy about this Robomower running unsupervised, which is all too likely, I fear.

47:02.400 --> 47:07.700
PSA, lawnmowers are not toys and can cause serious harm to both critters and children.

47:07.700 --> 47:09.400
Nevermind stupid adults.

47:09.400 --> 47:11.000
This ain't a silly vacuum.

47:11.000 --> 47:15.500
Just think bloody toes and see how that sits before deploying.

47:15.500 --> 47:22.200
Situations vary, of course, just remain aware that unplanned lawn intrusions and obstacles do happen.

47:22.200 --> 47:23.400
I mean, it's actually a fair point.

47:23.400 --> 47:28.800
So last week we talked about a robot lawnmower and none of us actually mentioned the safety angle of it.

47:28.800 --> 47:33.000
However, I think it's just kind of an assumed that people would be careful with this kind of thing.

47:33.000 --> 47:36.400
But then Lurks-a-Lot had another boost for us too.

47:36.400 --> 47:37.500
They continue.

47:37.500 --> 47:40.500
Oh, so I finally saw the video of this OpenMore project.

47:40.500 --> 47:44.200
I imagine something much larger and dangerous from a DIY project.

47:44.200 --> 47:45.900
Well, I still believe in safety first.

47:45.900 --> 47:51.000
This does not conjure quite the nightmare scenarios I imagined when I hadn't seen the thing yet.

47:51.000 --> 47:53.300
Yeah, it's more like the size of a vacuum.

47:53.300 --> 47:59.200
There was a, speaking of the little robot vacuums, a local town here in Washington, Bellevue.

47:59.200 --> 48:02.500
A homeowner called the cops because they thought somebody had broken into their house.

48:02.500 --> 48:04.900
A burglar was in the house with them and they were panicked.

48:04.900 --> 48:08.300
Turned out robot vacuum wasn't actually a burglar.

48:08.300 --> 48:09.400
Oh, gosh.

48:09.400 --> 48:14.400
I'm actually thinking, as I said, getting a new house and it's going to have almost an acre of land.

48:14.400 --> 48:19.600
I'm actually looking at some of these robo-mowers just because I don't want to have to mow that much land.

48:19.600 --> 48:20.300
Seriously.

48:20.300 --> 48:23.700
You're just going to have to get a lawn tractor, dude, and just be done with it.

48:23.700 --> 48:24.800
Just admit it.

48:24.800 --> 48:27.700
I don't want one because they basically cost the same.

48:27.700 --> 48:33.700
Like, they're like $2,500 and the robo-mowers are like $2,500 and they'll install it for me for free.

48:33.700 --> 48:37.400
Has anyone told you that you get to sit on top of a giant engine and go,

48:37.400 --> 48:39.900
vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, as you go along?

48:39.900 --> 48:41.600
They're so much fun.

48:41.600 --> 48:43.700
Says the guy who has an EV.

48:43.700 --> 48:44.700
Yeah, no.

48:44.700 --> 48:45.500
Oh, okay.

48:45.500 --> 48:45.900
All right.

48:45.900 --> 48:47.800
Well, you can get electric ones too.

48:47.800 --> 48:49.200
Yeah, those are even more expensive.

48:49.200 --> 48:56.300
But yeah, no, I actually have been looking at these robo-mowers and I actually want one because they actually do have a safety thing where if you pick them up, they actually shuts off.

48:56.300 --> 48:57.300
Oh, sure.

48:57.300 --> 48:58.100
Okay.

48:58.100 --> 48:59.400
That's good to know too.

48:59.400 --> 49:01.800
Yeah, I'd be looking at one too.

49:01.800 --> 49:06.000
Crashmaster18 wrote in, said he really liked the live format we did last week.

49:06.000 --> 49:08.600
Having multiple people on too, hopes it sticks.

49:08.600 --> 49:10.400
And he also likes the idea of the open mower.

49:10.400 --> 49:15.000
He hopes that we'll give him an update if one of us picks one up.

49:15.000 --> 49:16.800
It'll turn off if you do that.

49:16.800 --> 49:17.600
Right.

49:17.600 --> 49:19.100
Don't pick one up.

49:19.100 --> 49:25.300
And the final bit of feedback for this week, Kars Pieland writes in with 3,690 SATs.

49:25.300 --> 49:26.200
Thanks for the show.

49:26.200 --> 49:27.100
Nice and simple.

49:27.100 --> 49:28.200
Well, thank you, Kars.

49:28.200 --> 49:29.300
Thank you very much.

49:29.300 --> 49:32.800
You think 3,690 SATs mean something?

49:32.800 --> 49:34.400
Because sometimes they mean something.

49:34.400 --> 49:36.100
There's a 69 in there.

49:36.100 --> 49:38.700
I think it's like 3 plus 3, 6 plus 3, 9.

49:38.700 --> 49:39.900
Oh, could be a math thing.

49:39.900 --> 49:43.400
To me, I was thinking like the GTX graphics, like a video card kind of thing.

49:43.400 --> 49:44.600
But, oh, could be.

49:44.600 --> 49:45.600
I don't know.

49:45.600 --> 49:47.300
Alright, we did get an email in JVP.

49:47.300 --> 49:52.800
Just wanted to give us a review on his end of Frigate, the NVR created by Bearded Tech in our community.

49:52.800 --> 49:54.800
And he said, I did hear about it here on the show.

49:54.800 --> 49:57.800
I have to say the Docker Compose setup was super easy.

49:57.800 --> 50:04.000
I have five PoE 4K cameras that come with an advertised on-camera person detection.

50:04.000 --> 50:08.000
I'm using this on an older laptop with a Core i7 and it actually runs quite well.

50:08.000 --> 50:13.200
Frigate not only outperforms the stupid phone home app that these cameras came with,

50:13.200 --> 50:15.700
but with the Home Assistant integration, it's really cool.

50:15.700 --> 50:19.200
And I'm looking forward to making some integrations with lights soon.

50:19.200 --> 50:24.600
Plus I can view my cameras through the HA app, Home Assistant app, outside my house

50:24.600 --> 50:28.100
without sharing another service or having to open another port.

50:28.100 --> 50:28.700
So there you go.

50:28.700 --> 50:30.500
He says I'm about to block these cameras from the internet.

50:30.500 --> 50:32.900
I'll just use it all with Frigate Plus.

50:32.900 --> 50:37.200
So Frigate NVR is a project our community member Bearded Tech is working on.

50:37.200 --> 50:40.200
And these cameras, well, JVP didn't give us the model.

50:40.200 --> 50:42.700
So JVP, you'll have to write back and tell us what the model is

50:42.700 --> 50:45.100
because maybe those are the ones Fuzzy is looking for.

50:45.100 --> 50:49.700
Now, as always, I want to give a big thanks to our site reliability engineers, our subscribers.

50:49.700 --> 50:54.000
You do make this show possible over at self-hosted.show slash SRE.

50:54.000 --> 50:59.400
We've also got a network-wide membership at Jupiter.party as well to support not only this show,

50:59.400 --> 51:04.500
but all the other JB fine shows like Linux Unplugged, Linux Action News, and Coder Radio.

51:04.500 --> 51:05.500
Absolutely.

51:05.500 --> 51:09.500
And of course, you can always send us a boost with a podcasting 2.0 app.

51:09.500 --> 51:12.400
Go get a new podcast app at newpodcastapps.com.

51:12.400 --> 51:19.500
Go get more Brentley at linuxunplugged.com and catch Fuzzy on our Discord at self-hosted.show slash Discord.

51:19.500 --> 51:21.900
And I'm at chrislas on the Twitter.

51:21.900 --> 51:24.400
I'm over there at ironicbadger for the time being,

51:24.400 --> 51:28.200
but who knows what that crazy spaceman is going to do with it.

51:28.200 --> 51:29.400
We'll have to see on that one.

51:29.400 --> 51:31.900
Maybe we'll finally get a Mastodon user out of you yet.

51:31.900 --> 51:32.400
Maybe?

51:32.400 --> 51:33.000
No, maybe, maybe.

51:33.000 --> 51:33.800
Probably not.

51:33.800 --> 51:35.500
Maybe, baby.

51:35.500 --> 51:38.300
One other plug that I meant to do, I almost forgot,

51:38.300 --> 51:43.700
is we're actually going to be starting a new initiative on the off-weeks of Self-Hosted.

51:43.700 --> 51:48.900
So this show is coming out on the 6th of May, so it will be the, what, the...

51:48.900 --> 51:50.400
6th plus 7th.

51:50.400 --> 51:51.800
What's 6 plus 7?

51:51.800 --> 51:52.500
13.

51:52.500 --> 51:54.900
That's my birthday.

51:54.900 --> 51:56.600
I'm not doing it on my birthday.

51:56.600 --> 51:57.600
Oh, damn it.

51:57.600 --> 51:58.400
Do it on the day before.

51:58.400 --> 51:59.300
Oh, well.

51:59.300 --> 52:00.300
Do it on the day we do it live.

52:00.300 --> 52:02.700
We do the show live on Wednesdays now every other week.

52:02.700 --> 52:06.200
Now, I wanted to talk about a new initiative that we're going to be doing

52:06.200 --> 52:09.600
in between the live shows that we've started doing now.

52:09.600 --> 52:13.900
So that is, we're going to take a look at the awesome Self-Hosted list as a community.

52:13.900 --> 52:16.800
I think we can help improve this thing, right?

52:16.800 --> 52:18.800
And we'll take a look at a specific category.

52:18.800 --> 52:21.100
We'll hang out on the live stream for an hour or two

52:21.100 --> 52:24.300
and just try out some of these apps as a group

52:24.300 --> 52:27.100
and figure out which ones work, which ones don't work,

52:27.100 --> 52:31.700
which links are dead, which applications aren't on that list that should be,

52:31.700 --> 52:32.700
that kind of stuff.

52:32.700 --> 52:36.900
And eventually try and make the awesome Self-Hosted list awesome again,

52:36.900 --> 52:37.400
you know?

52:37.400 --> 52:38.000
Awesome-er.

52:38.000 --> 52:41.400
Yeah, maybe we should get little hats with that on, little red hats with

52:41.400 --> 52:44.200
make Self-Hosted awesome list great again or something.

52:44.200 --> 52:45.000
I don't know.

52:45.000 --> 52:46.800
I don't know. I have some notes on that idea.

52:46.800 --> 52:48.200
Maybe we'll refine that.

52:48.200 --> 52:52.300
There's probably some merchandise in that somewhere, but we'll see.

52:52.300 --> 52:54.900
I think that'll probably do us for the show today.

52:54.900 --> 52:56.300
So thanks for listening everybody.

52:56.300 --> 52:58.900
That was selfhosted.show slash 70.
