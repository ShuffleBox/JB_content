1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,680
Well, welcome into episode 68 of self-hosted everybody. This is a big episode today. We've got

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,680
Chris with me in person sitting right here. I get, I get the desk too. I know I can look into the

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:16,080
whites of your eyes today. That's very strange. You've got a, if anybody has seen, is it Lewis

4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,160
Rossman, right? You look, you just need the cat. You look exactly like Lewis Rossman right now in

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,320
that a huge lounge chair with the microphone. I don't have the muscles and I'm a little bit,

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,600
the anger's down a little bit. Yeah. You're not quite as am.

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,880
I'd also like to welcome in today, Wes Payne.

8
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,520
Hello, hello. It's good to be back.

9
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,120
Hey Wes, how was the trip in? You got here just a little bit ago.

10
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,240
It was a little longer, a few extra flights that I didn't expect, but it was well, well worth it.

11
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,320
50% more flights if I, if I understand it right.

12
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,680
Unfortunately so.

13
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,640
Yeah. So these two fine gentlemen are joining me today at my house for the

14
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:59,440
big Jupiter broadcasting East coast meetup, which is on Saturday and looking like it's going to be

15
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,600
a hell of a party because not only do we have probably over a hundred people showing up,

16
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,200
but there's some town event going on too. So it's going to be, I mean,

17
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,520
we're going to, this is going to be one of those where we have stories for a while.

18
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:16,240
As this episode as the meetup will be the day after. So, you know, as on Friday,

19
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:21,200
so the meetups on the Saturday, those, I think this, this town event is like an Easter,

20
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:27,200
like spring fling thing. It's going to be food trucks and all sorts of crazy stuff. So

21
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,280
if you're in the rally area or even if you're not stopped by, say hi, it'd been amazing to see you.

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,760
It was nice for us though. So we got in a couple of days early so we could, you know, hang out and

23
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:41,120
pre-show a little bit as we do and do some barbecue and do some talking and catching up.

24
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:47,040
So Brent is actually in route right now too, as we record just, you know, and it's great to see

25
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,320
your new place. Well, it's probably not as new to you anymore, but it's new to all of us.

26
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:57,200
Oh yes. And it's like the size of a bed and breakfast, like, like it's an estate. So,

27
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,600
so it can fit all of us easily. I don't want people thinking I live in some McMansion,

28
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,920
like it's a pretty nice house, but it's just below McMansion. It's not ridiculous. It's not

29
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,120
ludicrous. We're comfortable. And you know what? It actually seems pretty reasonable when all of

30
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:13,920
us are in town. Right. Exactly. I mean, hosting people, because, you know, one of the reasons

31
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:19,200
we bought this place was we host family from England for three, four, five weeks at a time.

32
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,600
And when you've got four or five people in a house, like you don't want to be all on top of

33
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:29,200
each other for that long. So, and a baby and a baby now, of course. Yeah. I've got to have room

34
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:34,160
for the drums. Right. Of course the drums, the printer, the workshop, right. You know what I

35
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,760
wanted? Like, of course, you know, when somebody arrives, like, you know, they want the tour,

36
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,560
right. But I wanted, I wanted the tech tour when I arrived. I feel like we're in a real

37
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,760
life episode of MTV cribs today. Right. It's self-hosted cribs. Um, and so we thought we

38
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,160
should start with the very basics, like how Alex is getting power into his house, because

39
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:57,120
you got a pretty impressive solar setup. Oh yeah. There you go.

40
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,760
Oh, interesting. Did they put like a netting along the bottoms for, to keep out critter guard? Yeah.

41
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:13,680
Okay. So there you go. That's a kilowatt hours, eight kilowatt array.

42
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,000
So they're probably getting their main sun starting right about now.

43
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:26,160
In the summer, we get perfect sun from about 10 a.m. to about 3 p.m. Oh, nice. And then these guys

44
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:31,760
get in the way slowly. Yeah. You can look on the monitoring app for solar edge. Yeah. And it,

45
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,480
you can see the shadow moving across the roof. Like it does per panel breakdown.

46
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:44,160
Yeah. So that's the panels. Yeah. And then they brought, they brought the cables in through the

47
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,200
attic and down, down through the back. So that, that was the room we were sat in. That was the

48
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,840
bonus room. So they brought the power sort of through this metal conduit out the back and

49
00:03:51,840 --> 00:04:00,880
through the attic of the, of the house. So you can see the metal conduit coming down the side of the

50
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:06,640
drain pipe there and then into this solar edge inverter thingy that's here. That's it. Really?

51
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,120
There's a, it's really not that complicated until I suppose if you were to put a battery wall in

52
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,640
there, it would get more complicated. It would not probably go around here. This, this thing is a

53
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,920
wifi bridge. I used to have a Zigbee bridge, but it kept dropping out for some reason. And the

54
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:24,800
repeater was in the bonus room just up there. But this one now is in into the basement, into the

55
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:33,680
server area. And it's just based on just 2.4 gig wifi. It has its own SSID, just for some reason

56
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,640
talks, talks that way. And then I plug in an ethernet cable into their little solar edge,

57
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:43,200
little white box receiver thing. And then it connects out through to the internet that way.

58
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,800
And then they have a web portal for all the deets. And that's how they can monitor.

59
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,120
Yeah. Wow. And they have an app of course. Do they have an API? That's the question.

60
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,680
Yes. That's how Home Assistant gets it. Oh yeah, that's, that's great. Yeah.

61
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:01,360
I mean, I was actually looking at a Kickstarter the other day where they do smart, uh, breaker

62
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:07,520
panels and each breaker has the smarts built into it to read. Why are we not having this already?

63
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:12,800
There's also a group that'll analyze just your house power using machine learning and try to

64
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,880
give a best guess of what appliances are running and then assign the individual usage to those.

65
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,680
And just by looking at the load, the average load. Yeah. How do you tell between, well,

66
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,040
I was going to say a fridge and a server. Or how do you tell between a hairdryer and a toaster?

67
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:30,160
I don't know, but maybe they have ways. Subtle signs in the data they think they've had. Yeah.

68
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,440
Well, great. Thank you for showing this to us. I'm just waiting for that episode where we get

69
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,360
connected and you're like, okay, I'm ready to build the battery wall. I do want to do that.

70
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,240
And as you've seen, I think we could cuss. I know you're going to do some fancy and nice,

71
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,760
but I'm telling you, we could DIY that thing. We could. Yeah. I mean, as you've seen, just

72
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:50,080
before we were going to record, we get some lightning and some pretty big storms blow through

73
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,560
here. And sometimes they knock down trees and the power goes out for four or five hours,

74
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,120
just on a random Tuesday. And that can be quite annoying. So there's two options for me for a

75
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:05,280
power wall. Number one is to build a dedicated like UPS for my house, which sounds awesome.

76
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,520
Cause I mean, it just in this room, I think I have four UPS is just to make sure everything

77
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:14,000
stays on during those little Brown. I mean, what have I probably counted? Yeah. At least have I

78
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
counted six UPS? Well, there's one for my desktop right there. There's another one over there for

79
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,680
like my 3d printer. And then there's another one over there for all my guitar amp equipment and

80
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,040
stuff. And there's stuff where the servers are, taco stuff. And some of the other stuff in that

81
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:29,040
closet, the backup closet. Yeah. We didn't get to in a minute. Uh, there's another one in,

82
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:34,080
it's ridiculous. Screw the whole house. Vacuum. Yeah. Whole house. UPS. That sounds great.

83
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,760
I just got fed up of Brown outs. Yeah. I guess the goal should be is like,

84
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:41,360
as these UPSs get to the point where the batteries are aging out, that's when it's time to do the

85
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:46,880
power wall, right? That's what you do the power wall. Yeah, true. True enough. Yeah. So we also

86
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,240
got to see the server basement. I've been wanting to see this set up for a while.

87
00:06:54,640 --> 00:07:01,040
Nice. I'm loving it. So let's walk us through what we got here. We've got a nice wood built rack.

88
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,120
I mean, maybe not as nice as the one brand build. Maybe, maybe it is. That's custom order. Maybe,

89
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:13,520
maybe it isn't. Can't say. Well, tell me what you think we've got. Well, I'm seeing a, I'm seeing,

90
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:21,200
seeing a couple of APC UPSs. I'm seeing, uh, your carrier's modem or whatever it is over there.

91
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:26,880
Just in modem mode. Of course. We've got this big rack here. That's a system with how many disks?

92
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,760
I forget. I know you've told me, but I forget. Uh, and then what is this guy down here? This

93
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:37,440
little bitty machine that's open sense. Oh, okay. That's the firewall. I've seen a couple of switches

94
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:43,040
there. Yeah. You've got a POE switch. So with eight ports for POE running two cameras at least

95
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:47,840
and two acts, maybe three access points off that guy. Okay. So there's room for future expansion

96
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,400
on that. I think I've only used five out of the eight ports. So I do plan on running another couple

97
00:07:52,400 --> 00:08:00,160
of cameras. Oh, temperature sensor here. Yeah. So this isn't ESP 8266 hooked up to a DHT

98
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:06,000
22 temperature sensor. So it does temperature and humidity down here. I put it sort of behind the

99
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,320
server. Now I think about it. Maybe I should put it away from the server. So it doesn't, you know,

100
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:15,760
so the heat from the fans at the back doesn't affect the readings too much, but seeing a new

101
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:19,520
AO tag Z stick and I see it's plugged into the back of the machine there. Is that what I'm seeing?

102
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:25,040
Maybe actually that one's in a drawer upstairs. I ditched the Z wave stuff experiences with it.

103
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:30,640
Yeah. And I went the Zigbee route and got the Conbee Zigbee USB. Nice. Is that what I'm seeing

104
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:35,280
plugged in there? Yeah. There's a Conbee two in there as well as connections to the UPS. So this

105
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:38,800
must be the Proxmox box then. Yeah, that's it. That's the one that does everything. And so then

106
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,200
home assistance around on this. Home assistance on there. That's got the i5 8500 in there. It's

107
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:49,360
the ASRock mini ITX, no, a micro ATX board that I put in there last autumn.

108
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:57,920
What's this? 10 or 12 disks. Why does it say disk failed? I'm just kidding. He had me.

109
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,560
He had me. And then I've got this cool like little KVM switch. I don't know if it's...

110
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:09,840
Oh yeah. Great. Actually connected up because this is... Oh, there you go. H-top up on the screen.

111
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:15,680
So I've been running H-top for the last eight years maybe. And it does the keyboard too,

112
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:22,320
which is nice. That's super handy. So there you go. Yeah. Love this. And it just runs.

113
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,760
And it's not loud at all, really. Well, not really, but I do have the fans turned up because

114
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,440
it's in the basement. Yeah, why not? I don't care about it. You know, just keep the airflow going

115
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,200
through. And I figure actually in the basement environment, having a little bit of air movement

116
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,200
is probably a good thing. Yeah, probably a little bit of a dehumidifier. It's probably doing me a

117
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:46,720
solid. Nice. There it is. The famous setup. I do have some future projects for myself and Brent

118
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,880
because Brent's staying with me for the next week or two after you guys leave. So we're going to

119
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:56,320
rewire quite a lot of what's down there. And you redo all the ethernet into a patch panel,

120
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,920
wall mount a lot of the switches that are down there, probably run a couple more cameras,

121
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,320
pull some more ethernet. That's always easier with two people.

122
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:10,800
Yeah. And then the other thing we got a little peek at because Alex's place is so big, he can

123
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:18,080
have a closet that's basically like an offsite backup. I did think about this. So the server is

124
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:23,360
at one end of the house, the right hand end. And then the room we're in to record is my bonus room

125
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,800
above the garage, which is the left hand end of the house. As I think about it, maybe we should

126
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:31,280
call these wings. Yeah. So if there's going to be like a pipe bust or something like that. Well,

127
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:35,040
that's it. That's the insurance, isn't it? You know, if a tornado was to blow through or a

128
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:40,400
hurricane was to blow through and knock the house down, I am out of luck with both of these boxes

129
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,680
in the building. Maybe. I mean, you could still see one part of the structure could remain standing

130
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:48,640
maybe. And you're having them on opposite sides. So yeah, maybe. Or when the worst event happens,

131
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,400
you know, whichever side you're closer to, you can try to grab the box on your way out of the house.

132
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:57,200
Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Grab the baby in one hand, the server in the other. Come on wife,

133
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:02,400
you can carry yourself. Someone grab the dog. I'm pretty sure he can carry himself too.

134
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:09,040
So this is a bit of a like storage for like boxes and gear. And then I see some backup power

135
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:15,920
supplies. I see some switch gear. I see a patch panel. Yeah. Printer two switches. What is this

136
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,840
guy over here? Is this an HD tuner? HD hard run. Yeah. Are you getting, are you pulling it over

137
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:25,040
the air? Yeah. And it works in here like that? Yeah. I mean, it's just pointed towards the

138
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:30,400
antenna. Painting a picture for the listener. I just have an over the air kind of flat wall antenna

139
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:37,120
just resting dangling on a shelf pointed at the ceiling. And it just works well enough. And to be

140
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,760
honest with you, the only time I use over the air tuner is when we've got some weather coming through

141
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:47,120
and I want to watch the weather reports. Yeah. Yep. Me too. So you call this the backup closet?

142
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:52,880
Because down in the bottom right hand corner over there, there's a little Lian Li Q25B case with

143
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:58,640
three hard drives in it. And just above it is the... Oh, this is just a silent little machine

144
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:03,360
running here. That's the HP290 slim I keep talking about that runs my Blue Iris. I wouldn't even know

145
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:09,120
it was on. Nope. I can feel just a tiny bit of airflow, but that's it. The backup server's off.

146
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:14,400
I turn that on once a week, does its thing and then it turns off. I have a sense too that we

147
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,040
haven't even seen everything. Like I think as we'll be here for the next few days, you'll be

148
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:22,240
like, oh right, I wanted to show you this too. I do hope so. Yeah. Yeah. That's always how it goes.

149
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,920
Well, I think we're only just beginning to get a sense of all the automations at play, right? We've

150
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,280
sort of scrapped the surface, the big ticket items that we've, you know, we've heard about on the

151
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:33,200
show that we've been looking forward to, but you know, you see Alex over there, comfying his chair

152
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,360
and you can tell he's controlling pretty much everything. Yeah. Just before we were going to

153
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,520
record, Chris was like, can you turn off the AC? It's a bit noisy. And he went to walk over to do,

154
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:46,080
I was like, dude, sit down. Like an animal. I know. I know. And it was funny because

155
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,920
I've also noticed like, you know, there's little temperature sensors throughout.

156
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,520
There's some buttons here and there. What do you think of them? These are the little, uh,

157
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:57,440
Xiaomi Bluetooth low energy ones. Yeah. I like that they have the actual temperature display

158
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:02,160
on there and just on the wall behind you, uh, underneath the little red hat Bluetooth speaker,

159
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:07,440
there's a little ESP 32 3d printed with the yellow cable going into it. And that is what

160
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,920
he's talking on Bluetooth low energy to all these different temperature centers throughout this, uh,

161
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,160
half of the building. And then down the other end, I've got another one, which talks to the ones

162
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,720
down that end. And then they all feed through ESP home into home assistant. Nice.

163
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,560
Yes. Uh, also everything has sort of been augmented with, uh, you could see where Alex

164
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,800
has seen a problem and like, Oh, I can 3d print that solution. So definitely desk parts have been

165
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:35,040
augmented. Uh, things mounted to the wall have been augmented with a 3d print. Uh, there's just

166
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,920
little bits of 3d printing solutions here and there. You obviously are like, you see a problem

167
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,720
and you're like, Oh, I'm going to, I'm going to print the fix to that. Well, I didn't spend money

168
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:49,840
on a 3d printer to buy stuff. It's a replicator. Dang it. So I want you to turn around. I've given

169
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:56,000
you a hard time about raspberry pies in the past. There was a drawer marked to do. Yeah. And in that

170
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:03,920
drawer, I want you to kind of pie shame. These are all the projects I have in progress or to do.

171
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,640
Oh, they're each in a case too. Yeah. I don't know how you managed to come up with an idea

172
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:13,760
more haunting than a to do list, but a to do chore of physical objects. This is, this is going to be

173
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,840
about where I'm at. Do you like this? You've got four pies within arm's reach. Cause there's one

174
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:22,720
over here to a Cody box and there's one attached to the 3d printer as well. So there's five pies

175
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:30,160
within arm's reach of me, just within arm's reach of me and I'm using one of them. I like this case.

176
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,520
These got some good cases here. Of course you've got the flirt one, which I love too.

177
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:39,440
Got the flirt case. We've got the geek worm aluminum case. The geek worm one is particularly

178
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,880
good for the 3d printer because you take one half off and 3d print a specific bracket and

179
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:50,000
then screw the two together. And you've got some heat dissipation for the PI four and one half.

180
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,760
And then the custom bracket attaches to the 3d printer and it's good to go.

181
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,720
You got, you can't give me a hard time anymore. You've been outed now. I know.

182
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:03,520
I know. The thing is though, I buy stuff like, um, home automation gear. And then I think,

183
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:09,840
Oh, I'll, I'll install that later. And then don't open the second drawer on the right there

184
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:14,160
and look at all the Shelly gear. I've got shamefully, I've bought, I'm just haven't

185
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,560
got around to install. I have a, I have a basket full of that stuff right now, but I'll get to it.

186
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:23,040
One of these days, you know what? And I'm not even kidding in that basket are some wise cameras

187
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:28,560
who I've got to deploy. And that got sent into the show a couple of times this week. Wise took

188
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:34,480
it over the backend about security and people wrote in wanting to know what we thought about it,

189
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,560
including Eric Johnston. He wrote in and said, Hey guys, you know, you've talked about the ways

190
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,880
cameras quite a bit. They're actually wise, but you're talking about the wise cameras quite a bit.

191
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:47,760
And I thought you'd be interested to know this. Gizmodo wrote an article and the headline is

192
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:53,360
you should probably stop using your wise camera right now. The verge, the verge wrote a headline

193
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:58,800
that said, I'm done with wise. And I think the gist of what happened, I was traveling, but I

194
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:03,600
think the gist of what happened is it turns out, it turns out there's a pretty nasty vulnerability

195
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,240
in the V1 camera. They no longer sell. They had to be on your land first, but if they got on your

196
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,760
land and got some information off of your wise camera, which supposedly they could do if they

197
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:16,640
just had land access, then later on they could access your camera and including information

198
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:22,400
about your camera even remotely. So like Wes comes, comes to my house, gets onto my wise cameras,

199
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:27,440
then he's peeping on me from remote from then on out. I did make you guys a dedicated guest

200
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:33,600
network. That explains it. Just to be safe. So I mean, some of this is hyperbole, right? Some of

201
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,320
this is just journalism, clickbait stuff. You know, you should stop using your wise cameras

202
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:44,560
immediately. Okay, fine. Yes. I understand why they write that headline, but since the original

203
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:50,960
publication of the article, uh, wise themselves have released a response, you know, stating like

204
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:56,560
Chris said, um, we'd like to let our users know that these vulnerabilities required some form of

205
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:02,320
local network access. And that does really rule out most attack vectors. I mean, unless you have

206
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:07,440
a really crappy wifi password or you just leave an ethernet cable hanging out your mailbox by the

207
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:13,680
street. I mean, most people aren't going to get to your, uh, to your local network. And so for me,

208
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:20,400
yeah, fine. The V1s were vulnerable for a while, but what really actually bothers me is how wise

209
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:26,400
is a company handled this vulnerability. Yeah. That's the problem, right? Is they just essentially

210
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,560
swooped under the rug and discontinued the model. And I guess maybe the logic was is we're not

211
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:35,280
making any more of them. Yeah, I suppose so. We're not obligated to do anything better than just say,

212
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,880
well, we're not telling you to keep using them. Yeah. And if you updated the version two or

213
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,280
version three, you didn't have this problem. So they figured, well, I really got away from that

214
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:47,680
problem. But the reality is people have these deployed, right? Doctors offices, maybe even,

215
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:52,480
who knows, it is a little worse than that. So the V1, two and three were all vulnerable,

216
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:58,640
but they silently released an update a few months ago for the V2 and three only. So they've left the

217
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:04,160
V1s hung out to dry. Yeah. Yeah. Just leaves a bad taste in the mouth. Yeah. And then you combine

218
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:09,520
that with bad communication. This could be really bad for wise because wise has aspirations to become

219
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:16,960
the IOT of everything vendor from internet scales to door locks to everything. In fact,

220
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,200
if you open up the wise app now, they have a shop section in there. They're selling lights. They're

221
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:27,200
selling every single kind of IOT Wi-Fi connected device you can think of. They're selling it now.

222
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:33,120
And you have to have a brand that's trusted in order to do that. And if you don't have a trusted

223
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:39,360
brand, you're dead in the water. I agree completely. I'm a bit surprised by Bitdefender,

224
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:44,640
who are the security research company who uncovered this floor. They sat on it for nearly

225
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:50,720
three years before telling us about it. So, uh, not only is there the original vulnerability

226
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:55,680
that, you know, we're talking about here, there were other previously undisclosed vulnerabilities

227
00:18:55,680 --> 00:19:02,400
that have been, uh, bypassing the authentication as well as allowing remote code execution,

228
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:10,080
uh, reported in both 2019 and 2020. That's when they were patched. Sorry. But, uh, I mean,

229
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,080
I just feel like wise has to step their game up. This isn't good enough.

230
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:18,880
You know, when they discontinued the V1, they issued a vague, like, uh,

231
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,360
Hey, this has some enhanced security risks. So you probably don't want to use it anymore.

232
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,800
So knowing what we know about this, that you have to be on the land initially to exploit it.

233
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,880
And then when they discontinued the product, they said, Hey, by the way,

234
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,640
you should probably stop using it. I think their exact wording, I found it at one point,

235
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,720
the company issued a warning during the V1 retirement saying, quote, it has an increased

236
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:47,840
risk of attack increased risk because you do have to be on the land because it has to be this

237
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,200
particular one that they're not patching. And because it is a retired product,

238
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,560
where is the line here? I agree with the V2 and V3. They, there should have been patch notes.

239
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:02,160
The only reason that they're end of life thing, the product is because it says here in their blog

240
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:09,520
post, they can't support the necessary fixes in that product. And so for me, if it was only being

241
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:16,960
end of life as a consequence of that gesture, goodwill, give us 25% off a V2 or V3 camera

242
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:22,160
or something, you know, something. Yeah. Cause you know, they rolled the dice to make a $25

243
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:27,280
camera. They had to put really cheap parts in there. And that's why some of their AI stuff

244
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:32,560
until the V3, honestly, guys, the wise cams are not good until the V3. The V3 is a really

245
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:38,880
good camera for the price for 35 bucks or whatever, but V1 and two, they were rough.

246
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,440
We've been using the V3 as our baby monitor. Yeah. It's the night vision on that thing is,

247
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:49,600
is incredible. It is. I I'm, I'm gone right now. And half of, half of the way I'm monitoring the

248
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,840
RV is with wise V3s. Now for me, five minutes, he pulls out his fire and he's like, Oh, look,

249
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:58,800
there's Levi. I got to check on the dog. It's your own form of doom scrolling. It is. But for me,

250
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,760
and I think maybe for a lot of the people in our audience, when I deploy something like this,

251
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:10,480
a $25 or a $35 camera, I go in assuming it's going to be monetized in some other way that I

252
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:16,000
don't agree with. And so I, I blocked DNS requests from the camera. So the cameras can't properly

253
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,960
talk to the internet. I have to be on my land in order to use the cameras. And that's just

254
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,160
always the way I've, so they don't talk to, and that means they don't get firmware updates either.

255
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:28,560
I have actually restored the DNS access and done the firmware thing once, but then that's also

256
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:33,840
caused problems. So it's not ideal. And that's why I've kind of backed off. If people have noticed

257
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:38,240
on the show, I don't really talk about them as much anymore because it is a bit of a compromise

258
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:43,200
product, but for the price and for the functionality and for the ability to integrate it with home

259
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,360
assistant, using things like wise bridge, it's a compromise I'm willing to make still. And I'm not

260
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:52,880
going to stop using my wise cams because of this, but I'd already built kind of for this scenario.

261
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,600
Does it change any of your thoughts on adopting additional wise cams? You know, is this still a

262
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,800
reasonable trade off? Cause that seemed kind of how they got on the scene, right? Like, look,

263
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:05,040
it's not perfect, but it's cheap, it's workable, and it gets you started instead of maybe a,

264
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:10,960
you know, hundreds of dollar fancy IP camera. Yeah. I'm always on the fence. It's like the

265
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,360
wise, the great thing about the wise cams, USB powered Wi-Fi, they don't even have to be

266
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:20,240
wired. They can go outdoors. You can get them to work with home assistant with pretty much

267
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,880
minimal effort and you don't have to run wires or anything like that, right? It's just, those things

268
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:30,160
are so great, but they're also just not quite the right tool for the job. They're not quite the

269
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:36,240
right ones to run 24 seven, do 4k video. You really want it wired. You want POE and that kind

270
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,680
of stuff in my opinion. So that's always the, that's always the balance I'm trying to make.

271
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:44,320
Particularly as they're moving into the wider smart home ecosystem, like you were saying,

272
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:49,760
they have ambitions to, I think they make a doorbell now they make, probably making a 3d

273
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:56,960
printer before we know it. So I think that the long-term outlook for me and wise is, they're

274
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:04,480
just a cheap, convenient solution to non-essential problems. You know, if the webcam we're using for

275
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:09,760
as a baby monitor broke, I'd probably just buy another one because they're so cheap compared to

276
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:15,040
a dedicated baby monitor. Um, and we have the flexibility of pulling up the app anywhere on any

277
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:21,600
device and you know, they're very flexible, very cheap, but you do pay a price for that.

278
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,840
And sometimes they have a great sale. They have great sales sometimes too. I think it does say a

279
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,760
lot, you know, we just talking about all the things you have automated in your home, but that

280
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,040
flexibility really is, you know, you know, you could set all that up if you wanted to, but just,

281
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:41,760
just the point is that sometimes it's really nice not to have to Linode.com slash SSH. Go there to

282
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:46,480
get $100 in 60 day credit. And you go there to support the show. Go say hello to Linode and

283
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:51,520
support the show. Linode.com slash SSH is where we're running everything. And just before we left,

284
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:57,920
I wanted the matrix server to really hum like a top. We upgraded that thing to 96 gigs of RAM

285
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:05,600
and 48 epic CPU cores on Linode and two terabytes of SSD storage. We're cooking with gas now.

286
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:10,240
Is that enough to run matrix? Barely, barely, barely. But you know, what was great is

287
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:16,320
we've just slowly increased the size of that Linode. We started at, I mean, we might've started

288
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:20,640
at a $5 Linode cause it was just an experiment. And then we just kind of turned it up as time has

289
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,640
gone on. And this time we really cranked it up to 11, but you know what else I was thinking?

290
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:29,520
I wonder if there'd be a way to use Wisebridge on Linode to have like a remote Wisebridge,

291
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:34,240
like a connect, maybe like some, like a VPN back to my land. There's so many things you can

292
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:39,440
experiment because they have great price plans for big enterprise operations. If you're out there,

293
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,440
or for just, you know, individuals, they'll want to do something and experiment their

294
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:48,240
pricing's 30 to 50% less than the big hyperscalers out there. They have these crazy UIs. They've got

295
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,240
a great API. If that's the route you like to go, they've got a really nice command line tool. So

296
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,080
one of the things I've done is I just have a tab in my dropdown terminal. I'm almost,

297
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:00,480
I have like almost all of the Linode command line client commands that I use in my history on that

298
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:06,000
tab. I can throw stuff up on object storage in no time. And the great thing is if you ever run into

299
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,560
any trouble, have any problems getting something set up, Linode comes with amazing 24 seven

300
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:14,880
customer support by phone or by ticket. And they don't do that thing where they like escalate and

301
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:19,760
escalate and escalate. They stick with you. Each person is trained and ready to go.

302
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,280
They've got the best support. And I hear that over and over again from the self-hosted community.

303
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:29,760
That stuff matters. And what I love about Linode is they've built this in a way that really is fast.

304
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:36,400
40 gigabit connections, SSDs, MVME PCIe storage, AMD epic processors. They are their own ISP.

305
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:43,200
It just goes on and on. So go try it. Go build something. Go learn something. See why it meets

306
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:49,920
our bar of requirements. And no other provider has. Check them out. Get $100 and support the show.

307
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:56,000
Linode.com slash SSH. That's $100 for 60 days on a new account. And you support the show by going

308
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:05,600
to Linode.com slash SSH. Now, I'm really not sure how I feel about Plex's news this week. They've

309
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:13,280
added a universal watch list, which allows for search and discovery across all the streaming

310
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:18,720
services. We're talking Netflix, Disney Plus, HBO Max, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

311
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:23,920
And they've done all this client side. And we all took a look earlier before the show. And

312
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:29,200
I'm curious to get your thoughts. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. You know, I remember when we talked to the

313
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:35,040
CEO, I I remember then thinking this is the way they're going because this is probably the most

314
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:40,560
legitimate play they can make for this space. And they are also in a very unique position where they

315
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:47,760
have a huge established user base that has a large local library that has the shared function

316
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,960
where you can have friends. So like Alex and I, we share our Plex libraries with each other.

317
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:56,320
And so that last piece was kind of the online streaming. So now you can look for a movie

318
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,160
and you can see it across all of your friends, servers, your own server or the online streaming

319
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:05,520
services that it's on. Now, to facilitate this, Plex raised 50 million dollars in funding last

320
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:09,520
year. So we knew this was going somewhere. And then 20 million just landed even more recently.

321
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:17,040
Previously, and probably likely still, their primary revenue came from Plex Pass. Now they're

322
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:22,400
transitioning to this new model where in this mix, when you search for a movie, sometimes it's free.

323
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:26,480
And that's going to be ad supported and they're going to run a pre roll. And they believe that

324
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:34,800
in 2022 ad supported revenue is going to easily surpass the Plex Pass. And OK, so these I think

325
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:40,000
this is the general like, OK, I can see where they're going. I acknowledge it. Yet in the pit

326
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:46,000
of my stomach, I'm very concerned. They do make some concessions on the blog post to say,

327
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:52,880
categorically, we do not and do not have any plans to upload your data to our servers. You know,

328
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,560
we don't really care what's in your libraries, et cetera, et cetera. Maybe that's a good thing,

329
00:27:56,560 --> 00:28:00,240
since it does seem to be all happening client side, like your Plex server didn't get updated

330
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:06,480
to support this. No, I didn't change my my PMS version. I didn't change even the Android TV app

331
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:11,440
didn't get update. We went to check the history before just to see if if it was. But no, it's it's

332
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:18,240
all the client itself. The app obviously had some frameworks built into it to check Plex's service

333
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:23,280
to change what it's displaying to me at any given moment. And then just at the bottom left hand

334
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:31,200
corner, it now says discover brackets and beta. Yeah, these kinds of things, you know, being able

335
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:37,040
to search across all of the services. They live and die on these business relationships, and Roku

336
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:43,440
has tried this. Apple has tried this. And Plex, you know, this this was brought up to the team

337
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:49,440
over at Plex, and they said, quote, We are a little bit of a Switzerland in this regard. They

338
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:55,120
believe that they can be the Switzerland of streaming. And they're going to create deals

339
00:28:55,120 --> 00:29:00,480
directly with Samsung and LG to build in Plex that's that scans across all of these services.

340
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,920
On the back end, they're building deals out with all these different streaming platforms.

341
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:07,440
On the back end, they're building deals out with all these different streaming providers

342
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:11,600
and trying to leverage their public APIs where they can. But this has never worked.

343
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:16,400
Yeah, what's the business model? Like, I mean, we tried it, like I said before the show and

344
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:23,360
the experience was it's all miss, right? We often clicked into an app that I didn't have installed,

345
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:28,240
or the service linked me to I think was to YouTube in particular for a particular movie.

346
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,800
I clicked on the movie and nothing happened. All I really did was just pass a search parameter to

347
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:36,560
the YouTube app. But it was like a limited version of the YouTube app. Like even even when it did

348
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:41,280
work, it seemed like on net, it was kind of a worse experience than watching from your local

349
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:45,680
times. Yeah, I can imagine after you got every single streaming service app installed, and you

350
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:50,880
got every single streaming service app logged in, then you go back to Plex, I could see that being

351
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,720
a little smoother. But what would be even credible, and I understand they can't do this is if you

352
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:59,280
could just stream it all in Plex, because that's what you use Plex for, right? It's basically just

353
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:04,640
a shell forwarding you to where the content is. Yeah, and they're just trying to deep link to

354
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:12,000
the specific content in that app. I don't see Disney, or Netflix, or Amazon Prime, or HBO,

355
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:18,160
letting Plex do that, you know, bypass DRM, it would probably make the particular streaming

356
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:24,000
service app less sticky. So you know, that's just a lot of the friction of just changing apps for

357
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,440
a lot of people is enough to keep people in the Netflix app or in the app. Yeah, you you kind of

358
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:34,960
lose your moat effect, right? Disney wants you to have to go into the Disney app, they want you to

359
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:40,640
experience the Disney plus experience. Right. So even if Plex isn't competing in terms of being

360
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,720
the actual media dealer on that on being the dashboard and the interface, right, they are

361
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,560
all right, if you you know, if you launch the Disney plus app, they can feature their new movies,

362
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:52,240
they can put banners up for the for the content they're trying to drive traffic to and they don't

363
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:56,880
have that control over the Plex UI. Hey, didn't you know we sell toys for these two? Yeah,

364
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:04,080
so this is somewhat like some kind of a bastard child of tracked.tv. And just watch.com because

365
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:10,160
you can set up lists to add certain things to watch lists. And when a particular movies coming

366
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:14,640
out in the future, I can say, Oh, remind me when this movie comes out and where I'll be able to

367
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:23,280
watch it. What's really interesting, though, is, is that at the moment, it feels promising, yet

368
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:30,560
simultaneously not finished. Yeah. I like being able to search for a movie. And in the results,

369
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:36,400
I see what server it's available on immediately. That's really nice. It was more of a manual

370
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:40,480
process to find out if you had a movie or not with the quality there. So if I search for a movie,

371
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:45,280
it says HD 1080p on my server and yours, it might say 4K, for example. I'll be like, Oh,

372
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:50,640
I'll go watch it on Chris's right. And funny enough, that worked really well. That fires

373
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:55,440
right up. It's all inside the Plex app. That's the experience you want. It's just when you go off to

374
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:00,720
the other streaming apps that it's it's nice to know what services a piece of content is on and

375
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,240
if you can buy or rent it, because I have been in a situation where the family wanted to watch a

376
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:09,120
movie. We didn't own that movie. We didn't have that one online. And so I ended up doing that

377
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,960
thing where I went, I found some website that lets you search across multiple streaming services.

378
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:17,120
And then I fired that app up. And then, you know, so it fixes that process, right? There's always

379
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:20,240
three different versions of those sites. You're never quite sure. Are they actually up today?

380
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:26,480
That's true. So they fix that. And, you know, I mean, we've talked about this before on the show.

381
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,880
It's like, what else are they going to do, guys? They can't be like, hey, if you've got a really

382
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,640
big pirated collection, like we're the best app to play your pirated collection, like they can't go

383
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,840
that route, right? So they've got to find some legitimate way to do this. This isn't going to

384
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:43,440
get them crushed by the copyright lobbyists. It's been obvious for a while, just as a user

385
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:49,600
of Plex, that the core app, certainly as I see it, certainly what it started out as,

386
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:56,560
as a home media streaming solution that is probably synonymous with pirated content,

387
00:32:56,560 --> 00:33:03,040
if we're being honest, that is not their core business now. And the app itself and the performance

388
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:09,280
and the bugs and, you know, just the feature set that we're getting is proof of that. And this

389
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:15,120
finally is, in my opinion, Plex tipping their hand and saying, this is the future of Plex.

390
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:21,200
And so for me, I think Jellyfin is becoming more important than ever right now.

391
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:26,480
Yeah, I agree. In fact, that's why I've been kind of watching the new Jellyfin releases and a new

392
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:33,440
beta, 10.8.0, just shipped a few days ago. There's some nice stuff in here. A lot of transcode fixes,

393
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:39,360
some DLNA fixes are in here. It feels like they're entering that real sweet spot where they're

394
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:46,000
focused on this kind of stuff. You know, that's a lot of how these things work in tech. They,

395
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,800
you know, when they get big enough, they have to become some legitimate business.

396
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,800
Harvey Dent, right? If you live long enough, you see yourself become the villain.

397
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,160
Yeah, possibly.

398
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:58,320
But I mean, with Jellyfin, right, we have a viable alternative. The only real

399
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:03,360
major criticism I have is that it's in a language that I don't personally know how to contribute

400
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:09,040
to. It's based off of the MB history. So there's a lot of, you know, Windows.net style, I think it's

401
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,520
or it's maybe C sharp. I can't remember.

402
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:11,920
Yes.

403
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:15,520
Yeah, C sharp mono. I feel the same way. It's sort of, it's a foreign thing. I'd love to be

404
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,600
able to help, but it's not my bill house.

405
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,560
I would be in there.

406
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:25,280
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Dangus wrote in with some Plex free music self hosting tips is Hey guys,

407
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:29,280
love the show. I wanted to mention a few apps for those outside the Plex ecosystem or maybe

408
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:33,440
planning to migrate. I've been an avid Jellyfin user for a few years now and I've been getting

409
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:41,040
into my music and hosting it as well. Namely Sonic XD for the desktop and Symfomium, I think.

410
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:45,440
Symfomium for Android. Both of these are fantastic audio players that connect to both Jellyfin and

411
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:50,880
subsonic and Plex sample. It looks fantastic. It's a bit of an investment. If you're not already in

412
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:56,960
the Plex ecosystem, they wanted to pass these along. So it looks like Symfomium, Symfomium,

413
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:02,880
S Y M F O N I U M and Sonic's D S O N I X D for the desktop.

414
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,760
I can give you some real time feedback on my Plex amp experiment.

415
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,040
Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Let's do it.

416
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:13,040
Both the wife and I quit Spotify a couple of months ago and up until about a week ago,

417
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,800
it's been going really, really well until we actually, until I actually had a conversation

418
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:22,480
with my wife and said, how are you finding Plex amp? And she goes, well, it's missing this. And

419
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:26,240
now you mentioned it. It's missing that. And I don't, can you, can we download this and can we,

420
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:32,240
I'm like, I've just, I looked at my server and I've got like five or six terabytes of music now.

421
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,720
And I'm still missing a bunch of stuff. And Lidar, you know, we talked about the,

422
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:42,080
the Deezer script a while ago, just can't cope with that kind of volume. It's just spinning

423
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:49,680
its wheels and just gets lost in it. So, uh, I am really enjoying Plex amp on my side. I've got

424
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:55,120
pretty much all the music I regularly listen to. Um, but we have, we have resubscribed to Spotify.

425
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,480
I was tempted recently. I was tempted because it's really nice to have Spotify on the studio

426
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:04,240
equipment and on Linux. It's nice to have Spotify sometimes, but I haven't yet folded.

427
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:08,080
I have, I have, I have remained canceled Spotify free.

428
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,880
I'm using YouTube music over here. I'm a weirdo.

429
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:15,200
How is that? How's that going? It's okay. I used to use, uh, the Google play music

430
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,560
back when that still existed, partially because I could upload a bunch of my own

431
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:23,200
black files to it. And so I still have those. And yeah, I don't know. I like having a subscription.

432
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:26,560
It's very convenient for discovery for just random stuff. I don't care about,

433
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:30,400
but because I can no longer upload to it, I do find I'm more interested in some of these,

434
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:35,280
you know, Plex amp. Doesn't Apple music let you do that? Let you upload your own?

435
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:39,760
Yeah. We should get wears on our iPhone. I've been trying that for three years.

436
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,640
When he got me, I'm on one.

437
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:46,080
Yeah. Well, it's six. I got you to have a kid first. See, I took the long play on that one.

438
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:49,440
First I convinced you guys to have a kid. So then you would be felt, felt motivated

439
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:55,280
to get good camera optics. Hey, I'll tell you what, there was an example of streaming service

440
00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:00,320
entropy this week. Um, Snoop Dogg has decided to take hit one of his,

441
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:04,880
my, or a couple of his most famous albums, one of which is called doggy style. Uh,

442
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:08,960
and I listened to that album surprising amount actually. And I went on Spotify the other day

443
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:13,280
and it's, it's gone. Do you know why he's trying to sell it as an NFT?

444
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:22,240
So I fired up Plex amp boom straight away. You know, so I have a, I have doggy style in Plex amp

445
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,600
and all that money you saved on your Spotify subscription. You know,

446
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:32,240
now you can buy the NFT about, I don't know, man, I'm sitting here. It's a little bittersweet.

447
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:35,520
I don't really want to talk about this next story, but for some people out there,

448
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:39,760
maybe they care. New version of home assistant came out, but it doesn't matter. I'm not upgrading

449
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:44,240
because I can't, but come on. It's packed with amazing features. I knew they would do this to

450
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:48,400
me. I knew the version that, cause this is where they dropped my Z wave and I knew they would do

451
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:52,640
this tons of new stuff that I want, but it is really good. Yeah, it is. It is a few things

452
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:56,960
that stand out to me. The one, uh, there's a, there's a couple, let's start off with the,

453
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:02,720
uh, group stuff. So now you can create groups in the user interface directly. Previously,

454
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:07,360
you would have to drop to the YAML, uh, configuration to do that. It's a nice little

455
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:14,560
change, um, along with a new hide entities function, which lets you hide the constituent

456
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:20,080
lights say of a particular group. That's really nice. That is, I want that already.

457
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:27,040
Now, another one that got me pretty excited was switch as X. So in my home assistant YAML right

458
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:32,640
now, I have a bunch of, uh, I don't know what you call them, but they basically convert a switch

459
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:37,680
into a light or a cover, right? Or as from, in my case, a smart plug into a heater or something

460
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:44,960
like that. Right. Yep. And switch as X now lets me set directly in the configuration of that,

461
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:52,880
uh, smart plug. I can now show that as a light zones, the entire zone can now have a state.

462
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:57,840
That's really nice to see. So like my, my kitchen is a zone. My living room is a zone. My bedroom

463
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:05,280
is his own. Um, and they've done optimizing on both the front end and the backend side of home

464
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:09,760
assistant as well. So, and I love that. Of course, of course, I'm not going to get that version.

465
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:13,360
And now it's no longer called a Lovelace either. It's just called the dashboard. Now too,

466
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:17,920
that is a shame because obviously it was a tip of the hat to Ada Lovelace. One of the fathers of

467
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:23,200
or can you call her a father of computing, a mother of computing, one of the perennials.

468
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:28,640
We have a word for that. There was another feature in there that caught my fancy. And

469
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:33,680
this is particularly useful when writing automations. There's a little test button

470
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:38,320
up in the top of the automations thing, which lets you test the conditions to make sure they're

471
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:46,240
right. And yeah, it's a nice little one. Damn it. This really sucks. I want this version so bad.

472
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:51,440
So if this isn't enough, what is enough to make your upgrade time? It's a matter of having to

473
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:56,720
redo my entire Z wave. And you know, all of my, I mean my, my heaters, all my heating stuff,

474
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:02,720
all my, all my temperature sensors, my outdoor sensors, my motion sensors, they're all a UV

475
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:06,720
sensors, my humidity sensors. They're all Z wave. You're just putting off the inevitable though.

476
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:11,120
I know you're going to have to do it. Have you considered learning Python and starting to

477
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:15,600
maintain the old version yourself? Well, I'm doing just about as much work cause I'm first,

478
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,960
I got to learn, I got to learn Nick's OS upside and down. And then I got to figure out how to

479
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:23,520
deploy everything. I was deploying in a container in Nick's OS and I got to learn how to move

480
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:27,760
everything over to MQTT and do Z wave to MQTT. And then I'm going to have to figure out node

481
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:32,000
red if I go that route. So I might as well just learn Python and probably save myself some time.

482
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,760
They've really done this at their worst time too. Cause here we are traveling and all this stuff

483
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:39,680
and I'm just learning an entire new way. I want to build my system. So like now I don't want to

484
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:44,400
do it the old way and then be like, this is old and busted. It's just the worst. I should have,

485
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,320
I can't believe they didn't call me first and ask me.

486
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:51,440
Just to reiterate, the reason Chris is all butthurt is because they're deprecating

487
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:57,280
a Python two based integration, which has been coming for how many years? Two years,

488
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:03,280
maybe. I don't know. I just don't sympathize with you on this one. I don't. I know it's a pain in

489
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:07,120
the butt. Okay. Can I, can I plead my case set differently? Can I, I'll take a new approach.

490
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:10,560
You can try. If they'd only gotten that damn damn migration wizard to work properly,

491
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:13,920
I could have migrated to the supported stuff, but the migration wizard didn't work. So now

492
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:21,360
I'm still a victim, right? No, it's fine. I'll, I'll hang tight for a bit. And then you're probably

493
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:25,840
by summertime. I'll get, I'll get caught up. I'll still keep the home assistant, uh, install at the

494
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:33,040
studio. I'll keep that up to date. You're like a Will Smith level victim. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Yep.

495
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:33,520
That's true.

496
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:40,640
tailscale.com slash self-hosted to go there to get a free account for up to 20 devices.

497
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:46,320
And of course you support the show. TailScale is a zero config VPN. It installs on any device

498
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:51,200
in minutes. You can manage firewall rules for you or for, I don't know, maybe Wes over there.

499
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:54,640
And it's just a great way to work from just about anywhere. So of course, as you know,

500
00:41:54,640 --> 00:42:00,800
right now we're on the road. And as you can imagine, tail scale is saving the day.

501
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:06,000
I have different devices, even my VMs connected to my flat tail scale network,

502
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:12,480
and all of it is using WireGuard's noise encryption. It's beautiful, secure, and simple.

503
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:16,640
You'd be shocked how fast you can get this thing set up. You install the client, it generates a

504
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:21,120
URL. You associate that with your account and you're good to go. I've even got it on my iPad

505
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:25,040
so I can pull up the feedback and I can read through all the emails on my iPad to get it

506
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:30,480
ready for the show. And even in situations where I've got carrier grade NAT, I'm behind a firewall,

507
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:37,440
I'm on like some limited guest Wi-Fi that Alex has set up, it still works. Tail scale just works.

508
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:41,200
It's how I'm also keeping connected to my kids' computers so when they have problems,

509
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:45,280
they're just on my flat tail scale network. And yeah, you can even divide things up if you need

510
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:48,960
to worry about that kind of stuff. And if you want to throw a DNS server on the network,

511
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:53,920
tail scale works with that like magic. So I've got it run on everything from Arch x86 boxes

512
00:42:53,920 --> 00:43:00,400
to Tumbleweed Raspberry Pis to iPads and Android devices. And it's just great. The best thing is

513
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:05,920
it's like every device gets a network IP that is assigned to it and remains consistent no matter

514
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:11,120
where I'm at, no matter where I'm at in the country, all of my bookmarks still work. And

515
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:15,840
tail scale works with whatever your single sign on provider is. So if you want to use a single sign

516
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:20,880
on provider you already have with two factor authentication, that's going to work too. You're

517
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:25,360
going to be really impressed. You'll probably get it going in a matter of minutes regardless of your

518
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:31,120
device or operating system. So go try it for yourself. Protect your data with wire guard

519
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:38,240
scale encryption and build a flat mesh network in seconds for free up to 20 devices. And you support

520
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:45,120
the show when you go to tailscale.com slash self hosted. Go see why I love it so much. It's going

521
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:49,120
to change how you think about networking. It's going to change how you can get access to your

522
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:56,800
data and it's going to help keep you private and secure. Tailscale.com slash self hosted.

523
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:00,400
I'm still finding it weird that I'm in the same room as you two gentlemen. This is uh,

524
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:03,760
this is nice. I could get used to this. We should, we need to get like, uh,

525
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:07,840
six more sponsors on every episode and we just do every episode like this. Yeah.

526
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:12,000
Just pay for the flights. Turn it into an LTT video. Probably need a time machine too

527
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,840
to make that five hour flight each way work. Well think about the automations we could do in the

528
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:21,920
JP private jet. Right? Oh, that's where we go. We need a jet. We need one. We keep flying west.

529
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:25,600
If we always fly west, then it will be fine. We can make that work, right? Oh yeah. I think

530
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:30,080
cause it's a glove. That's how it works. Yeah. Or is it east? I don't know. I mean you just

531
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:36,080
go one direction long enough. It doesn't matter. True. So we have some feedback from Josh today.

532
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:40,080
Hi Chris and Alex. Thank you for the podcast. I've recently been starting out in the world

533
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:44,960
of self hosting and I've listened to every episode. I am fortunate enough to be able to

534
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:49,200
keep something small at my dad's house. Now, given the chat on a previous episode,

535
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:54,960
I've been looking towards an SBC single board computer based NAS. Hopefully this will consume

536
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:59,360
very little power and should be able to cope with semi-regular incremental backups. I'm thinking

537
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:04,640
about something, uh, maybe in the weekly backup range. There seems to be mixed advice about this

538
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:09,600
online, including a lot of feedback suggesting that using an SBC is flawed as these disks will

539
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:15,120
be hanging off the USB bus. Uh, do you feel this is something to be concerned about or is this an

540
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:19,360
acceptable compromise to reach the low power and small form factor solution I'm looking for?

541
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:24,400
I'm hearing low power a couple of times in here. So it sounds like that is a,

542
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:29,520
that is a primary concern for Josh here. And so you probably are going down the right path Josh,

543
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:35,280
but I wonder, have you considered the magnificent world of the compute module four? Because there

544
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:43,040
are carrier boards where you can get PCI slots, you can get a SATA, you can have an EMMC, which

545
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:48,720
is much superior to an SD card for a boot drive. And so, uh, you know, if I were going to build a

546
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:55,360
NAS today based around some sort of SBC, it would take a really, really, really strong argument for

547
00:45:55,360 --> 00:46:01,920
me to consider anything else but the CM4 simply because nothing else has the network effect,

548
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:05,520
the community effect, the software support. And when you're building something that you want to

549
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:11,280
run solid and run for a while, that matters. You know, there may be faster SBCs out there with

550
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:17,120
ones that already have PCI slots, for example, but the CM4, the compute module four combined with a

551
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:21,600
carrier board that can accommodate you in my experience is such a solid setup. It's really

552
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:27,440
hard to argue against that. What do you think Alex? It's just a backup, right? Yeah, true.

553
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:33,760
If you have something hanging off the USB bus and it fails, it shouldn't matter. It is your backup.

554
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:39,040
As long as you have monitoring in place to let you know that something's gone south,

555
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:44,480
you know, the backup is the perfect place to experiment and do something that's slightly more

556
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:53,280
risky. Uh, so long as maybe, I don't know, like maybe have two, uh, you know, three, two, one.

557
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:57,520
Yeah, the prices, you probably could too, right? I mean, the most expensive thing here is going to

558
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:01,600
be the storage. That's going to be the most expensive thing. So let us know what you do,

559
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:04,800
Josh. Cause you know, sometimes we get these questions, but we don't always get the followups.

560
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:10,640
So we'd love to know. Kevin writes in, I have five or so VPS servers on Linode.

561
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:15,760
I have one domain name at my DNS provider with subdomains pointing to each server.

562
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:21,520
It's great for SSH access. I want to run a web server from each one of them. I've obtained a

563
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:27,840
wildcard TLS certificate from Let's Encrypt on the first server using Lego. I've confirmed the

564
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:33,520
wildcard cert works on the first server where Lego is installed. It serves a new page with HTTPS on

565
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:39,760
the subdomain with that cert. I then set a cron job to run Lego and renew that cert monthly.

566
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:45,840
What is the safest way though, to propagate that wildcard cert from one server to all four other

567
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:51,760
servers automatically each month? I've got wire guard, I've got SSH, just not keys. I've got

568
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:57,600
Ansible vault I could potentially use. I've thought about doing these with cron jobs that

569
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:01,840
copy these over SSH, but how do I automate communicating between the servers? How do I

570
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:06,320
protect the SSH keys, the SSH certificate and other connection credentials and move all of

571
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:11,440
this around? This feels like one of those where there's like a thousand ways you could solve this

572
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:19,360
problem. You could do it the proper way, the established way and move the certificates around

573
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:24,800
between the servers, but we were talking about this as a group before we recorded and Wes,

574
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:29,120
you came up with an interesting idea. Yeah, it's kind of sounding like maybe the, you know,

575
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:33,840
handling of the secrets, distributing that to multiple machines. That workflow hasn't really

576
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:39,360
been worked out yet in this case. That's a fine thing to experiment with, but if that's not an

577
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:42,560
essential, you know, if that's just going to be an implementation detail to the actual point of

578
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:48,960
getting this done, you don't need to be the one handling that part of it. What about just something

579
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:54,560
like S3? You know, I mean, you can, you can secure that. You can also set a time expiring links. That

580
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:59,440
was the kind of thing you were worried about and you don't have to host it. Exactly right. Yeah. I

581
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:07,120
mean, you can do, like you say, authentication on an S3 request. It's easily accessible over the

582
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:12,560
internet safely, securely. People do it all the time. I'm sure you've all seen the, uh, web URL

583
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:20,640
of an S3 item in your URL bar at some point. Uh, you know, it's a chicken and egg problem with SSH

584
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:25,120
that you come across all the time, right? I want to automate this thing, but I need my SSH key over

585
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:31,520
there already before I do the thing. Yep. Yep. That's three solves that particular problem or

586
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:36,880
any kind of object storage really. Uh, but the reason I think that we talked about S3 in particular

587
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:40,800
is that it's authenticated. And if you're putting a secret up there, like a certificate,

588
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:46,640
it's, uh, you need to have some kind of authentication in front of it. And you could

589
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:51,680
just use object storage at Linode already because that's S3 compatible. Good to go. So nobody's

590
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:56,000
going to suggest sync thing. Okay. So don't use sync thing. We did mention it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

591
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:01,280
I don't know. Like it's, uh, uh, how secure is it with third party bounce service and stuff like

592
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:05,680
that? I mean, it's probably fine. Yeah. It just doesn't seem like the right tool. Does it? I mean,

593
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:08,560
it seems like you could do it, but it doesn't seem like the right way to do it.

594
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:12,480
Go old school and use BitTorrent. Yeah. There you go. Or BitTorrent sync. You could do that.

595
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:18,800
I think you mean Resilio. Resilio sync. I mean, the thing is with the S3 solution,

596
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:22,800
it would work in much a similar way as sync thing, right? I guess with sync thing you could,

597
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:28,080
and this is just solutionizing off the top of my head, which I hate doing, but anyway,

598
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:33,280
you could, uh, encrypt the secret on whatever box is running Lego

599
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:38,880
and then sync the encrypted thing with sync thing and then have the logic to decrypt it

600
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:43,280
at the remote site that way. And that would be kind of secure as it's going over the wire,

601
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:46,720
but I bet you that's how I would do it. If I, if I were to solve this problem,

602
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:50,080
that's probably what I would do. Here's the downside on each of those other four remote

603
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:54,640
systems. You still need the decryption password. Yeah. Probably stored in plain text,

604
00:50:54,640 --> 00:51:00,960
probably on disc. So are you in any better solution than just doing it with a sync thing

605
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:06,560
naked? I don't know. Probably not. But if anybody has an idea, let us know. Self hosted.show

606
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:11,600
slash contact or send us a boost like Optimus Gray did. Optimus boosted in and he said,

607
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:16,880
I hope to see you next week. If gas prices aren't too high, that is, but don't work Brent too much.

608
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:22,240
I want to see Brent. He sent us 500 sats to say that if you want to give us a boost,

609
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:27,280
it's like the bat line into the show. You go get a new podcast app at newpodcastapps.com,

610
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:31,200
load that wallet up and send us a boost and we'll get it here on the show.

611
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:36,480
I want to say a big thank you to our SRE site reliability engineer subscribers.

612
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:42,080
You make this show possible over at self-hosted.show slash SRE and they could join the party,

613
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:46,720
Jupiter.party if they want to support the entire network and get access to all the

614
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:51,840
special features of the shows. Yeah. I wonder, you know, I wonder if we'll have some extras.

615
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:55,680
We should probably plug the extras just in case we get any extra content that we record here with

616
00:51:55,680 --> 00:52:00,160
the group of us extras.show. Wes, thanks for hanging out with us. Thanks for having me.

617
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:04,320
We, I, we really didn't give him a chance to stretch his wings. You know, we could get into

618
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:09,040
some topic on the road that Wes could probably really dig into. You should think about that.

619
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:12,000
So Wes, you're just going to have to come back so that way we can do it again.

620
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:16,800
Oh, I think we can come up with something. I think we can indeed. Go find our contact page,

621
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:19,440
send us in your thoughts. Let us know what you think. Maybe you got a solution for one of the

622
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:23,920
things we've talked about today. Self-hosted.show slash contact is the place to get in touch.

623
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:27,840
You can find me on Twitter. I'm at Chris LAS. I thought we weren't doing the Twitter thing anymore.

624
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:33,760
I decided to do it this week. Okay. Okay. It's cause Elon's on board now. Okay. I'm on Twitter

625
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:37,920
also at ironic badger. I'm also, and this is something that the listener wrote in and let

626
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:42,720
me know about, we need to plug the discord more heavily. So apparently we don't say enough about

627
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:47,200
it. So we got a discord. Here we go. We have a discord self-hosted.show slash discord. I'm over

628
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:52,000
there at Alex KTZ. Are you on the Twitter? Is there anything you want to plug Wes?

629
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:56,960
I am at Wes Payne and Hey, maybe check out that podcast. You and I do Linux action news.

630
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:02,640
Hey, Hey, Hey. Also there's a self-hosted matrix. Our matrix service colony.jupiterbroadcasting.com.

631
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:06,800
If you want to get into some trouble over there, we'd love to have you and get in there. There is,

632
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:13,600
I think a growing to self-hosted room community over there. Isn't it ironic that the self-hosted

633
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:19,280
podcast has a discord server and luck and JB as a whole have the matrix server. And I'm just not,

634
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:22,800
well, we kind of have came first. The discord server, I think came first.

635
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:26,560
All these problems that you talked about in last week's love about hosting a chat server

636
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:30,160
are exactly why I didn't want to do it. We should mention, if you want to hear some

637
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:33,680
horror stories about self-hosting matrix, we just did that in Linux unplugged the

638
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:37,440
most recent episode, which I should probably have the number for since we're talking about it. But

639
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:41,120
you know, let's just say when, you know, if you're, I just want to, I'll just say this part,

640
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:45,520
if you're doing it for five or 10 people, maybe even a hundred people, it's fine. Don't worry

641
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:49,600
about it. If you want to do for more than a hundred people or maybe 2000 people, there's

642
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:53,680
some things that go, they go a little wrong. They go a little sideways with the default config.

643
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:57,040
And we covered that at Linux unplugged.com slash four five two.

644
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:03,920
And if you have any other questions about which episode did Chris talk about this particular

645
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:09,360
thing in Coda radio, we have a show notes website over at notes.jupitabroadcasting.com.

646
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,440
All the episodes are in there and that's actually a fully self-hosted website.

647
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:18,720
Now, as always, thanks for listening, everybody. That was self-hosted.show slash 68.
