WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.400
We're doing something fun for episode 69

00:02.400 --> 00:08.140
We're doing our first self hosted live stream and we have a whole bunch of people hanging out with us live while we do the show

00:08.140 --> 00:15.520
This is your crazy idea Alex. I know right SSH 69 and we've bumped up the recording date by one day to make it on

00:15.960 --> 00:22.820
420 I mean we couldn't pass up that opportunity could we so joining me today? Obviously we have mr. Fisher. Hello Chris. Hey there

00:22.820 --> 00:29.740
Also in the room with me is Brent. Hello. Hello, and we have cheese bacon from Denver. Hello there

00:30.580 --> 00:36.440
Hello bacon. Welcome back to the show cheesy. Thanks, man. And we have 40 plus crazy people watching us on the live stream

00:36.440 --> 00:41.700
Hello live stream. Hello. Jitsi room, although they're all muted Alex. So they're all not gonna chime in

00:42.060 --> 00:46.220
Well, that's that's a technical hurdle. I need to understand still

00:46.580 --> 00:49.180
If you are watching live and you want to suggest a title

00:49.180 --> 00:53.860
We're doing a whole lot style thing. You can bang suggest in the IRC room today

00:54.460 --> 00:56.860
That's right, and we'll pick something. That's fun

00:56.860 --> 00:58.580
We thought I don't know we've never done this before

00:58.580 --> 01:02.860
But every now that it'd be kind of neat it also I think it'd be a lot of fun to do a live stream

01:02.860 --> 01:04.100
Maybe on like a project day

01:04.100 --> 01:07.200
We work on something and then we do an episode and talk about it

01:07.200 --> 01:11.700
And maybe we do part of the build or the configuration on the live stream. We got ideas

01:11.900 --> 01:15.480
We got all kinds of ideas. I have a drawer full of ideas behind me

01:15.480 --> 01:17.480
I

01:17.640 --> 01:23.040
Have been collecting my ideas in a box that I store in my closet in the RV so

01:23.760 --> 01:28.820
We both have like to-do boxes of stuff, but you literally have a nice light out drawer

01:29.560 --> 01:33.100
Box or drawer of shame, whatever you want to call it. I just can't get to it

01:33.100 --> 01:38.480
I've been I've been creating new shows. I've launched office hours dot hair. It's a new podcast

01:39.000 --> 01:42.040
sort of a podcast for the Jupiter broadcasting community and

01:42.040 --> 01:46.000
One where I can kind of talk about things going on with JB the shows

01:46.800 --> 01:50.280
Community events podcasting in general. So I started a new show

01:50.280 --> 01:54.000
It's but now that I've got that out of the way, I'm planning to get back to some of my projects

01:54.000 --> 01:55.200
But go check it out

01:55.200 --> 01:57.200
It's office hours dot hair

01:58.480 --> 01:59.200
Now of course

01:59.200 --> 02:05.440
This is the first episode since our big East Coast rally meetup rally thing that we did a couple of weeks ago

02:05.680 --> 02:10.760
We had about a hundred people show up. So great job and hello to anybody that we said hi to on that day

02:10.760 --> 02:17.040
Yeah, we had fun. We had some feedback from five who wrote in. Thanks Alex for conjuring the meetup

02:17.040 --> 02:22.200
I had a really great time and I would definitely come out to the East Coast from Minnesota again

02:22.560 --> 02:26.280
The barbecue the brew pub and the park were all superb

02:26.280 --> 02:29.680
I was curious about what drew you to North Carolina in the first place

02:29.680 --> 02:34.540
But after meeting the friendly people and enjoying the beautiful trails of Raleigh, I get it. Oh

02:34.540 --> 02:41.700
Oh, that's nice Brent. You've been living there for a hot minute. How do you feel about that live in the East Coast life?

02:41.700 --> 02:43.700
I feel as though

02:44.180 --> 02:50.580
It's maybe a month ahead of the season where I'm used to so this is like a vacation super great and Alex and I have been

02:50.820 --> 02:56.260
Doing projects galore which has kept me very interested very busy and learning a bunch of new stuff

02:57.220 --> 02:59.980
Yesterday he turned up with a pickup truck bed full of

02:59.980 --> 03:06.300
Materials we're gonna build a roof under my deck tomorrow to store my lawn tractor and all sorts of stuff. We're having a good time

03:07.020 --> 03:10.740
Your lawn tractor. You're so American now. It's a terrible

03:11.420 --> 03:15.300
you know when in Rome darling when in Rome before we were even like

03:16.260 --> 03:23.100
24 hours after the meetup the folks in Raleigh were already talking about holding their own just because there is such a crowd there

03:23.100 --> 03:26.780
There's more tech there than I realized that's what the meetup really showed me

03:26.780 --> 03:31.340
Is that there's a lot more tech in Raleigh than I then I even probably

03:32.700 --> 03:37.340
Appreciated and they're really motivated to keep going. That's something I not to plug the show game

03:37.340 --> 03:41.560
but that's actually one of the reasons I'm launching that new shows to help organize community meetups because I think

03:41.780 --> 03:46.580
people could just start doing these on their own even if we can't make it and maybe from time to time we drop by because

03:46.580 --> 03:50.460
We had we had over a hundred folks show up at this one and it was cold

03:50.820 --> 03:55.180
The weather wasn't really cooperating with us and it was kind of vague where to even find us

03:55.180 --> 03:57.180
Right, and we still had over a hundred people show up

03:57.460 --> 04:01.140
We actually covered in full detail in lup full 53

04:01.140 --> 04:04.780
We had a bunch of interviews with the folks that we met on the day and stuff like that

04:05.540 --> 04:12.260
So if you want more information about the meetup and you know our initial reactions because we recorded it the day after the meetup

04:12.860 --> 04:15.940
Linux unplug.com slash 453

04:16.780 --> 04:22.380
Now tell me about the open mower thing here because I'm picturing you building a robot that mows your lawn

04:22.380 --> 04:25.220
I mean, that's pretty much what we're talking about here

04:25.220 --> 04:30.380
I mean, so I was looking at I have a push mower and I have like about half an acre to mow

04:30.380 --> 04:34.660
It's not too big but it's big enough that in the North Carolina heat in the summer that I'm just like

04:35.060 --> 04:40.380
Nah, this is this is too much like an hour sweating late in the evening. No, thank you

04:40.440 --> 04:44.580
So I bought the lawn tractor in the end, but what I really wanted to buy was one of these autonomous

04:45.300 --> 04:47.300
Mowers, but they're too expensive for the moment

04:47.300 --> 04:55.020
Then came along this open mower project, which I just think is the coolest thing in the world. It uses like open-source software

04:55.700 --> 05:00.300
to do like GPS traces of the mower in your yard and

05:01.300 --> 05:05.380
for those in the jit see room Chris is playing at the video from the github page and

05:06.020 --> 05:08.020
essentially this thing is

05:08.020 --> 05:10.180
It's like it's like the autonomous mower

05:10.180 --> 05:16.020
But actually smart the old ones like the kind of I say old like the current generation ones

05:16.020 --> 05:19.440
Just sort of bop around the lawn in a random pattern until they're done

05:19.820 --> 05:26.100
This thing actually uses GPS traces to figure out the most efficient pattern and then zips ups back across the lawn

05:26.900 --> 05:33.780
Of course, my question is does it work with home assistant? It really is. It looks like a Roomba for your lawn

05:34.460 --> 05:41.080
It looks like while training it. He's walking it manually with almost like an RC controller that's wired to it

05:41.080 --> 05:46.460
That's teaching it the the way he would mow the lawn. So it's essentially repeating

05:47.300 --> 05:48.460
his

05:48.460 --> 05:54.640
Lawn mowing technique right? It's just memorizing it. I mean he's basically saying to his lawn mower. This is the way

05:55.980 --> 05:57.980
Right. This is the way

05:58.660 --> 06:00.660
Previously other lawn mowers, right?

06:00.860 --> 06:05.260
The automated lawn mowers would have like a wire or something that you would like embed in the ground

06:05.260 --> 06:13.020
Which would then say hey stop here. So to see this open and the fact that it operates on GPS is pretty rad

06:13.700 --> 06:17.300
Yeah, this one specifically calls out in the github page. No

06:17.960 --> 06:19.960
No perimeter wire needed

06:21.280 --> 06:27.220
Hmm I like that you could I mean with the walking it technique while that means one time you have to walk this thing around

06:27.500 --> 06:29.700
You could also give it really specific routes

06:29.700 --> 06:35.460
So if you have like a patch of gravel somewhere you'd want it to avoid or stumps and roots and stuff like that

06:35.540 --> 06:39.140
This is a really simple way to just avoid the thing from screwing itself up

06:39.140 --> 06:43.340
And then of course I go to like well, could I then get metrics?

06:43.340 --> 06:47.260
What kind of metrics can I get out of this and what could that tell me about the state of my yard?

06:48.060 --> 06:51.260
Well, and maybe maybe you could you know learn how?

06:51.900 --> 06:57.340
More efficiently you could mow your yard if it was operated in different patterns, right?

06:57.340 --> 07:00.820
like the kind of like Google gives you the recommendation of

07:01.220 --> 07:06.900
The most economic or eco-friendly path to your destination versus the shortest route and stuff

07:06.940 --> 07:12.020
Well, you know what actually thinking about I could give you an example is the things monitoring when it's raining or not

07:12.020 --> 07:14.660
So that way it doesn't run during rain

07:15.460 --> 07:21.620
It would be actually now I think about it. I'd really like something that specifically told me for my yard

07:22.180 --> 07:25.700
When it rained how long it rained when it stopped raining all of that

07:25.700 --> 07:29.820
So if anybody has a recommendation something that I could pull into home assistant

07:29.940 --> 07:35.900
Send a boost into the show or email me Chris at Jupiter broadcasting comm because that actually I could geek out on you need a weather

07:35.900 --> 07:41.700
Station right, but which one aha Alex I'm interested in the hardware that's running this thing

07:41.940 --> 07:47.620
Is it like a do-it-yourself kid or are you taking something off the shelf and reflashing it or something?

07:47.620 --> 07:51.900
well, unfortunately this project has been shared a bit too much and

07:52.380 --> 07:54.620
several of the components in the

07:54.620 --> 08:00.980
Hardware bill of materials have sold out. I mean, we're all used to that at this time of the

08:01.860 --> 08:06.500
Pandemic right, but the trouble is the specific stepper motors that is using are

08:07.780 --> 08:13.820
Out of production or out of stock. They're not even sure if they're still going to make them like he bought maybe the end of

08:13.820 --> 08:15.820
the batch or something

08:15.900 --> 08:20.940
Coincidentally, so unfortunately he's saying to people make sure you look up before you invest in this project

08:20.940 --> 08:23.380
You can actually find all the parts because it's not a given

08:23.380 --> 08:27.260
another thing he said that's really interesting though, is that it looks like

08:28.300 --> 08:33.400
in terms of the robot mowers that are already on the market, there's a bunch that may

08:34.140 --> 08:38.180
Share a similar main board across rebranded different manufacturers. So

08:38.940 --> 08:40.980
he's gonna try and target that one and

08:42.100 --> 08:45.020
hopefully make that one open and then you could just buy a

08:46.060 --> 08:50.940
Clone of this mower and then flash it with his firmware. It's like the pixel of a lawnmowers

08:50.940 --> 08:52.940
It sounds pretty awesome

08:53.780 --> 08:58.100
Hmm. Well, I guess we'll stay tuned and if anybody tries this let us know

08:58.340 --> 09:03.460
So this week we had we had one of these stories that was kind of the inspiration for the podcast

09:03.540 --> 09:07.860
And it's just a shameful story. You may have heard of insti on well

09:07.860 --> 09:14.740
It looks like they're gone and the entire company seems to have just abruptly shut down before the weekend as we record here and

09:15.060 --> 09:19.500
That broke users cloud dependent smart home setups with no warning

09:19.500 --> 09:24.980
there was no official word ahead of the shutdown no advanced warning to users and

09:26.580 --> 09:29.940
It's sort of like salt in the wound style. They have a

09:31.020 --> 09:36.180
Craptastic status page that's obviously manually updated because when you go to it, it says all services online

09:36.700 --> 09:38.100
Right. Yeah

09:38.100 --> 09:43.460
Clearly that monitoring doesn't do jack. I hate that. I hate that so much

09:43.460 --> 09:50.940
Yeah, so instant is or more likely was a smart home company that produced a variety of smart home devices

09:51.740 --> 09:57.540
They did something along the lines of Zed wave or Zigbee with their own proprietary protocol

09:57.740 --> 10:02.860
Which has thankfully been reverse engineered. So we're not completely up the creek without a paddle just mostly

10:03.780 --> 10:05.860
And yeah, like Chris says they went out of business

10:05.860 --> 10:12.780
some point over the weekend and their CEO has scrubbed all mentions of the company from his LinkedIn page and

10:14.180 --> 10:18.140
Basically all of the devices belonging to insti on are now paperweights

10:18.700 --> 10:23.740
With the exception of their wall switches, which are electrically connected as part of the circuit

10:23.740 --> 10:30.240
So that the worst case scenario that happens with those is they're still mechanical switches that will operate the the lights at least so

10:30.660 --> 10:33.560
There is some silver lining. It's a small one

10:33.560 --> 10:35.560
But it's there

10:35.840 --> 10:37.640
This is horrible

10:37.640 --> 10:45.000
and whatever you do do not factory reset your hub, apparently it has to contact their servers as part of its setup and

10:46.360 --> 10:49.240
That's gonna fail now home assistant have actually

10:50.120 --> 10:55.480
Updated a documentation since yesterday to say it's now possible. You don't have to worry about that anymore

10:56.080 --> 11:00.520
So if you do actually factory reset it they now have a workaround

11:00.520 --> 11:07.200
This is really a shame to see and they also had their own proprietary networking protocol, which actually looks like it was kind of neat

11:07.200 --> 11:09.800
I mean, it's 900 megahertz, which is usually pretty good

11:09.800 --> 11:16.920
It also could coexist with power line networking, which is kind of neat and it supported local control, but it was

11:17.960 --> 11:22.360
Proprietary and patented and you know unique to them. So that's just sort of gone now

11:23.000 --> 11:28.640
See not only are your cloud services gone, but the whole protocol that has been created is essentially now invalid

11:28.640 --> 11:31.320
It's still usable, but nobody's they're maintaining supporting

11:32.320 --> 11:34.320
Shepherding it

11:34.320 --> 11:36.160
We just see this happen over and over again

11:36.160 --> 11:40.720
and it's these kinds of stories that really got Alex and I thinking we should we should do a show about this because

11:41.720 --> 11:43.720
When you take this kind of stuff over

11:44.560 --> 11:50.320
Like if you go to cloud free dot shop or you reflash something or you just get it working locally and you get all working

11:50.320 --> 11:53.960
Home assistant, you no longer need an account or you know a cloud login

11:53.960 --> 11:59.800
There is a so there is a sensation of self-sovereignty that you get it feels really good to have

12:00.080 --> 12:03.360
control over this stuff like it feels better than you'd expect and

12:04.000 --> 12:06.640
I think it's because we keep seeing these rug pulls

12:06.920 --> 12:10.760
Essentially from these companies and you buy these things and there's sort of this implicit

12:11.080 --> 12:14.000
promise that they're gonna keep the service running, but they never actually

12:14.680 --> 12:18.400
Commit to it. And there's no warning to the average consumer

12:19.200 --> 12:20.320
that

12:20.320 --> 12:27.400
The discontinuation of the online services invalidates the product, right? They don't understand that they don't get that our audience understands that but

12:27.920 --> 12:31.640
People that are buying these things from like Home Depot or whatever. They don't understand that. I

12:32.800 --> 12:36.640
Mean the obvious answer is to just use home assistant and never worry about it again

12:36.640 --> 12:42.280
You know use devices with open firmware like TAS motor, you know, not the ones from cloud free dot-shop

12:43.960 --> 12:48.440
There are some other options, of course, you know, there's a home kit compatible stuff

12:48.440 --> 12:50.600
Which is all local only

12:51.640 --> 12:54.880
It's not quite as good as like a fully open firmware, but it's it's close

12:55.680 --> 13:01.080
Open hab and what's the other one Dom a titch? I'm never quite sure how to say that one because in tight. I

13:02.960 --> 13:05.600
Mean it's just a shit situation, isn't it?

13:05.960 --> 13:10.360
It is because I feel like you're kind of giving the typical answer of oh

13:10.360 --> 13:16.520
You don't like what the carrier flashed your Android device with well, you can always put lineage on it. Yeah. Okay. Well, I'm

13:16.520 --> 13:23.600
Maybe but probably nobody else in my family, right? It's I mean the reality is they have just created a

13:24.600 --> 13:26.600
huge amount of e-waste

13:26.600 --> 13:30.040
In yeah weekend. I was just about to touch on that exactly

13:30.840 --> 13:35.320
100% yeah, I'd like to see some kind of legislation from

13:36.240 --> 13:42.960
governments from the EU from these bureaucratic bodies to say you have a duty of care on the

13:42.960 --> 13:49.520
life cycle of these devices whether that extends to how people sunset devices and say right we're going to

13:50.080 --> 13:55.120
The Sonos that we talked about last year at some point the v1 hub or bridge or whatever it was

13:56.120 --> 13:59.440
Why didn't they rather than just saying you've got to buy the new one?

14:00.080 --> 14:04.240
Why didn't they provide a firmware to say for the v1 devices?

14:04.240 --> 14:08.080
Hey, you can put this open firmware and I can do what you like with it, you know

14:08.080 --> 14:13.200
Make it this open device and give it another life. We've been doing that with laptops for

14:13.760 --> 14:15.920
Two three decades now, you know

14:15.920 --> 14:19.920
We take old crusty Windows laptops and throw Linux on there and give them a new lease of life

14:20.400 --> 14:23.760
All I'm proposing is we do the same thing with embedded hardware

14:24.800 --> 14:27.120
Yeah, absolutely. That's it. That's a great idea

14:27.840 --> 14:33.520
So, you know you had kind of mentioned Chris about Home Depot and you know possibly picking these off the shelf and and I don't

14:33.520 --> 14:35.520
know, you know where

14:35.520 --> 14:41.120
These were sold at retail, right? And then, you know, Alex mentions about the e-waste which I think is a very significant problem

14:41.840 --> 14:45.600
but how many of these devices do you think are still on the shelves and

14:46.240 --> 14:52.400
Retail, you know at retailers and consumers are just buying with the intent that they're going to work as soon as they get them home

14:52.640 --> 14:56.480
Maybe this is their first smart device ever right as soon as they get them home

14:57.120 --> 14:59.600
Now it doesn't work. It doesn't connect to the cloud server

15:00.160 --> 15:03.120
Here I am trying to go through some work around something. I don't know

15:03.120 --> 15:08.240
Here I am trying to go through some work around something. I'm not technically inclined. How do I get this flashed?

15:08.240 --> 15:10.240
How do I get this to work with something else?

15:10.400 --> 15:15.760
You know, imagine being that teenager that's finally convinced your dad to buy a piece of smart home gear, right?

15:15.840 --> 15:19.360
He gets it home and this happens. Yeah, exactly bad luck

15:19.900 --> 15:21.360
exactly

15:21.360 --> 15:25.920
You know, it's not an isolated case either. Um, my father's dealing with this right now

15:26.000 --> 15:29.760
He bought a few d-link cameras and water sensors

15:29.760 --> 15:33.920
For a few rental properties that he has in his home as well. He gets some flooding there

15:34.400 --> 15:40.240
Just as a security blanket and this is a perfect example of a really great use case for these devices, right?

15:41.440 --> 15:46.560
Um, luckily he got an email maybe at the beginning of the year in january saying oh d-link

15:46.560 --> 15:54.560
We're gonna stop supporting our protocols and all devices will stop working at the end of the year or in september or something like that

15:54.560 --> 15:59.840
But it's I think what's troublesome and I chris, I think why you suggested that

16:00.160 --> 16:05.620
The whole premise of this show started was that this is not an uncommon situation

16:06.160 --> 16:11.280
We see it, you know time and time again multiple times a year with various devices and it's just really saddening

16:11.840 --> 16:17.600
Luckily, I looked it up and of course they're compatible with home assistant. So i'll be doing some homework there

16:18.240 --> 16:20.640
Now for those of you that are already home assistant users

16:20.640 --> 16:26.080
They just put out a blog post for insteon users detailing all the little ins and outs of how you can get the most out of

16:26.080 --> 16:29.200
Those devices moving forward. We'll put a link to that in the show notes

16:31.520 --> 16:32.560
Linode.com

16:32.560 --> 16:38.080
Slash ssh go there to get one hundred dollars in 60-day credit on a new account and you go there to support the show

16:38.080 --> 16:43.700
Now this is a way for you to host things under your control on linode's incredible infrastructure

16:43.920 --> 16:46.000
They have 11 data centers around the world

16:46.000 --> 16:51.120
They have super fast systems with amd epic processors if you want to go with a crazy fast cpu system

16:51.360 --> 16:56.720
They have pci mvme storage if you want some really fast storage. And of course they have systems that are just

16:57.360 --> 17:01.040
Real budget focused if you just want something for you a friend

17:01.360 --> 17:05.040
maybe a real basic gaming server the whole whole gamut and

17:05.680 --> 17:12.240
Unlike the hyperscalers that want to lock you into their esoteric complicated platforms with their own language and their whole

17:12.800 --> 17:14.800
entire own ecosystem

17:14.800 --> 17:20.020
Linode is real old-school servers built with a modern infrastructure

17:20.320 --> 17:26.160
And people that really know what they're doing and of course you could do a one-click application deployment if that is your bag

17:26.160 --> 17:28.960
You just want to hit a button and spin a server up they got you

17:29.200 --> 17:32.240
But if you want to build something from the ground up you can do that as well

17:32.400 --> 17:38.100
And that's why I think it's perfect for our audience and with pricing 30 to 50 cheaper than those major hyperscalers

17:39.120 --> 17:43.760
It's going to work for a personal project or for your business and everything we've built in the last couple of years

17:43.760 --> 17:46.800
We've built on linode. It scales up to demand

17:47.520 --> 17:50.480
They have s3 compatible object storage, which I use all the time

17:51.120 --> 17:54.640
ddos protection vlan support a powerful dns manager

17:55.040 --> 18:00.720
Kubernetes and terraform support if you want to integrate it in with your overall infrastructure and so much more and at the end of the day

18:01.360 --> 18:06.720
The audience tells me over and over again. They have the best support they've ever experienced

18:06.800 --> 18:11.040
that's the number one thing I hear from the audience is whenever they run into trouble with their site or

18:11.040 --> 18:16.560
They hit the wrong button or they just don't feel right about something. Linode has answered their questions

18:16.560 --> 18:23.440
They haven't escalated them to a different tier. They've remained on the line and got it solved 365 even during the holidays

18:24.320 --> 18:26.880
And that gives me the confidence to use them for my business

18:27.360 --> 18:31.760
Even though I've never had to I love knowing that they just have the best support in the business

18:32.480 --> 18:37.940
So go check it out build something try something learn something take advantage of that 100 go to linode.com

18:37.940 --> 18:41.080
dollars go to linode.com slash ssh

18:43.860 --> 18:46.980
Now I've still got brent staying with me after the meetup and

18:47.540 --> 18:52.820
He is quite the phos advocate. I tell myself. I'm a phos advocate, but this guy lives and breathes it

18:53.300 --> 18:58.660
And so we watching something on plex the other night and it was just an offhand comment about plex. I can't remember what it was

18:59.460 --> 19:02.900
And it made me think well, I should probably try out jellyfin again. It's been a few months

19:02.900 --> 19:09.460
And so I thought well i've got a bunch of watched status in plex. I'd rather not lose

19:09.940 --> 19:15.140
And so I started investigating how I could sync the watched status between plex and jellyfin

19:15.460 --> 19:21.540
And I came across this plex tracked sync plugin. So t r a k t for tracked

19:22.260 --> 19:27.220
And this thing is awesome. Essentially it scans your media in plex

19:27.220 --> 19:33.620
And adds it to a tracked collection. It will do things like sync the ratings and the watch status as well between

19:34.180 --> 19:36.660
Different plex servers that you run this thing against

19:37.540 --> 19:42.340
There's a config file that you can edit which will let you know which things you can and cannot sync

19:42.740 --> 19:46.340
You know, you could exclude certain libraries like home movies, for example

19:46.900 --> 19:53.460
It doesn't require a plex pass or a tracked vip membership though. Of course if you're going to be hitting the tracked api a lot

19:53.460 --> 19:58.980
Consider supporting those guys. They do a great job over there. Um, the downside though is it was

19:59.380 --> 20:05.300
It wasn't difficult to set up but it wasn't easy either. Um, so I ended up running this thing in a container

20:06.260 --> 20:08.260
Just a one-liner docker run file

20:08.660 --> 20:14.340
Uh docker run command and then I set it to run on a cron job every four hours or something like that

20:15.060 --> 20:20.420
Um, I mean it worked fine. Uh, there was a couple of um gotchas with a pin you had to enter between

20:20.420 --> 20:24.500
Tracked and the command line in the correct order to get things to link up correctly

20:25.060 --> 20:27.060
But overall worked as advertised

20:27.780 --> 20:34.420
well, this is you're doing the lord's work here alex because uh, this is this is powerful stuff here because the other thing that this

20:34.500 --> 20:36.500
clearly would be useful for is

20:37.060 --> 20:42.500
If you have a couple of locations and you have some of the same plex media content, right?

20:42.580 --> 20:46.580
And you watch them in separate spots like sometimes cd and I will watch something here at the studio

20:46.580 --> 20:51.460
And then i'll go home and watch something and I have to like manually mark things red like a damn caveman

20:51.860 --> 20:54.340
And this could solve that problem. This is huge for that

20:55.060 --> 21:00.900
And i'll tell you what I felt during this whole process that the next stage was to was for me to load up jellyfin

21:01.380 --> 21:05.620
I still had my config directory. So I just had to redownload the container and set it up again

21:06.260 --> 21:08.260
Which took all of 30 seconds

21:09.140 --> 21:10.660
Don't you love docker for that?

21:10.660 --> 21:16.580
Uh, so once I got uh, jellyfin up and running the first thing that struck me it remembered my library

21:16.580 --> 21:22.260
It was like a time capsule of four months ago when I last tried it, but the first thing that struck me was how quickly?

21:22.980 --> 21:30.420
Everything loaded because there was no cloud communication going on. I was logged in instantly my media loaded instantly

21:30.980 --> 21:34.580
It was so refreshing. Yeah, and i'll note

21:34.980 --> 21:35.780
It's real nice

21:35.780 --> 21:40.900
If for just some reason you're trying to watch tv and you don't have an internet connection that night jellyfin just you know

21:40.980 --> 21:46.020
It doesn't mind at all. Um before you go too much further. Can I ask you you're not having to like

21:46.580 --> 21:52.260
Modify the plex container or put this put any software like a plugin into plex or jellyfin

21:52.260 --> 21:54.660
It's just all running as separate containers that are

21:55.300 --> 22:01.460
Speaking via api or what plex speaks via the api I think and uh, it runs on your local system

22:01.460 --> 22:08.980
And you authenticate against the plex website with your username and password. It also supports 2fa, which is pretty cool on the plex side

22:09.780 --> 22:15.780
Uh, but on the jellyfin side, it's even easier. There's a plugin right there in the store built into jellyfin

22:16.020 --> 22:20.500
You know three or four clicks. It's all done in the user interface. No wacky container stuff

22:20.980 --> 22:26.340
And it adds itself into the scheduled task section of jellyfin itself

22:27.060 --> 22:30.420
This is perfect. I do have a question on the initial

22:30.420 --> 22:37.300
Setup to sync between how long do you think since it was local? How long do you think it took to to sync these watch status?

22:38.020 --> 22:41.140
And the the stars and stuff like that. It's a good question

22:41.140 --> 22:46.580
The first run of uploading it from my plex library to tracked took about 16 minutes

22:47.220 --> 22:54.340
I've got about a thousand movies and I don't know 150 tv shows or so about 60 terabytes worth of stuff. That's really reasonable

22:55.540 --> 22:59.060
But jellyfin on the other hand pulling it down was about half that time

22:59.060 --> 23:04.820
About eight minutes or so. So it's pretty quick process really and honestly once it's running as a scheduled task in the background

23:05.140 --> 23:08.180
As long as it doesn't take three days. I don't care how long it takes

23:09.940 --> 23:16.660
Well, this is uh, absolutely a will do after the show, uh thing for me, I love it when you have these ones that's great

23:16.980 --> 23:21.780
I love that that's I've thought I've thought how am I going to solve this problem because it's not a huge

23:22.260 --> 23:25.460
It's not a huge issue, but I also like you

23:25.460 --> 23:29.380
Have contemplated moving to jellyfin and I know this seems stupid

23:29.940 --> 23:34.500
But one of the things that brings me back to plex is we're in the middle of watching a couple of series

23:35.300 --> 23:39.380
And or the kids and I are watching like a movie. That's like a trilogy or something like that

23:40.420 --> 23:42.420
And we just want our watch status

23:42.580 --> 23:45.860
It's silly, but it's been a real problem. So this sounds like a real way

23:45.860 --> 23:51.060
I could sync to track it and then sync track it to jellyfin and I could just start there

23:51.060 --> 23:56.740
And this also could solve the problem between watching things at home and watching things at the studio alex. You're solving problems for me today

23:57.220 --> 23:58.580
I'm here to serve

23:58.580 --> 24:03.540
Now the only thing that still has me pausing about jellyfin is the android tv client

24:03.700 --> 24:08.180
It's still not quite as reliable as I want it to be. It's pretty close

24:08.180 --> 24:12.580
It's really getting there, but there's just some nice things now, particularly plex have added this

24:12.660 --> 24:13.780
Uh, what do we call it?

24:13.780 --> 24:18.420
Like the discover feature where you get some extra little ratings and some extra little things about which sort of

24:18.420 --> 24:22.980
Some extra little ratings and some extra little things about which servers it's on and qualities and stuff like that

24:23.300 --> 24:26.420
That plex have done that. I think jellyfin could probably add as well

24:26.980 --> 24:30.500
Um that would you know, just take the interface just to that next level

24:31.540 --> 24:38.580
The the search aspect of that discover feature where it shows you all of your friends servers is is actually really nice

24:39.060 --> 24:45.220
Yeah, but the beauty is you know, you could switch between plex and jellyfin at your heart's content now and everything will stay in sync

24:45.220 --> 24:51.300
That's a good point. You could also just get rid of android tv and use a good tv platform like apple tv and run infuse

24:51.380 --> 24:53.380
Which works great with jellyfin?

24:53.940 --> 24:59.620
Oh you now I also wanted to have a look and see uh, if I was going to drop plex completely

25:00.020 --> 25:01.860
Um, it needs to do a couple of things for me

25:01.860 --> 25:07.060
I use prologue on ios to do audiobooks and I actually shared this with your good lady while she was here chris

25:07.700 --> 25:11.220
Uh, so I can see she's been listening to a lot of my audiobooks since then

25:11.220 --> 25:18.580
and that's one of my favorite things of the trip alex is we exchanged audiobooks once again, she exchanged some of her audiobooks and

25:19.300 --> 25:20.820
uh, she's like

25:20.820 --> 25:22.820
she she I think is probably

25:23.620 --> 25:29.380
In heaven right now because she's kind of been on a bit of a dry streak with audiobooks and i'll be honest

25:29.460 --> 25:31.460
I have not been super happy

25:31.860 --> 25:38.180
With how I was doing my audiobooks prologue helps a lot though that that's been nice, but it's really only best on the phone

25:38.180 --> 25:44.020
The downside to that is there isn't really a good solution to audiobooks and plex on android

25:44.580 --> 25:49.060
And so with brent staying with us, you know, we've been talking about books and stuff and we thought well

25:49.060 --> 25:53.220
There's got to be a better way. My wife has been using book sonic for many many years

25:53.780 --> 25:58.820
Which is a java based application based on top of the old subsonic base

25:59.540 --> 26:05.780
It's fine, I guess I mean it it's pretty reliable until it breaks because it's a java app

26:05.780 --> 26:10.180
You know, there's some memory leak somewhere or something just doesn't quite work and it crashes

26:10.660 --> 26:13.860
so I actually have a job to restart book sonic every day because it's

26:14.500 --> 26:16.500
Not the most reliable application

26:16.900 --> 26:21.700
So I saw on reddit the other day. There was an application called audio bookshelf had been released

26:22.020 --> 26:27.860
And this is a self-hosted audiobook server for managing and playing your audiobooks still early days

26:28.340 --> 26:34.580
The first commit the first release actually, sorry was only in september 2021. So it's not even a year old yet

26:34.580 --> 26:39.060
Uh, and I don't know if you remember the old ios like ibooks application

26:39.060 --> 26:44.100
That was like skeuomorphic with like the wooden bookshelves and all that. This is what this thing looks like

26:44.180 --> 26:48.820
Yeah, the best version you mean? Yeah, I remember that I loved it. Were you and scott forstall good buddies back then?

26:49.700 --> 26:55.140
Nice callback, dude. Yes. I like the skeuomorphism. Why not? You got that high resolution screen. Let's make it look good

26:55.220 --> 26:59.220
Yeah, it's got the wood shelves. It's got nice big bold book covers

26:59.780 --> 27:01.300
This is great

27:01.300 --> 27:07.460
Well, it looks great and I think it's got a lot of potential but it's sadly not quite ready for prime time yet

27:08.100 --> 27:13.140
So I tried out the ios app which I had to install that test flight thing because it's not properly in the app store yet

27:13.220 --> 27:15.540
It's like like the application is is in beta

27:16.100 --> 27:20.340
And let me tell you it's most definitely in probably alpha stage right now

27:20.980 --> 27:23.940
I had two versions across the last two days where I was testing it

27:24.180 --> 27:27.860
The first version didn't load any of the audiobooks from my library at all

27:27.860 --> 27:31.780
So even though I had a few hundred books in the library, it just said library empty

27:32.420 --> 27:35.940
Okay, that's a bit that's a bit of a problem. Luckily. There was an update available

27:36.020 --> 27:39.140
So I pulled down that update and installed it from the test flight app

27:39.700 --> 27:43.540
Um, and then I tried to do it found the books this time

27:43.700 --> 27:49.700
But I tried to test the syncing of playback positions between the browser on my laptop and my phone in my hand

27:50.500 --> 27:52.500
And it worked ish

27:52.660 --> 27:56.340
So if I started playing the the book on my phone and skipped to a certain chapter

27:56.340 --> 28:01.380
The browser would update in real time as to where I was and it would save that status if I close the browser and come

28:01.460 --> 28:04.260
Back, it would remember it if I close the ios app

28:04.980 --> 28:06.980
It would just start at the beginning every time

28:07.300 --> 28:12.820
So there's obviously some work to do. It's not it's not quite there yet, but it's extremely promising

28:13.300 --> 28:14.740
Hmm. Okay

28:14.740 --> 28:20.420
Yeah, i'd like something that I could use reliably on the desktop and on mobile because sometimes I want to sit down

28:20.500 --> 28:22.500
I want to listen on my desktop speakers

28:22.580 --> 28:24.580
um, and I need something that's really

28:24.580 --> 28:32.200
Really usable by the wife and she likes prologue quite a bit. I also set it up for my son dylan and I used plex collections

28:32.740 --> 28:38.660
to create just a collection of books for dylan and then um, you know when he signs on on prologue

28:38.980 --> 28:42.660
He just sees he goes to the collections tab and he just sees all the books that I've already picked for him

28:43.300 --> 28:48.820
And so over lunch we were talking with brent about how to get him access to my book sonic because it's behind my firewall

28:48.900 --> 28:51.940
Typically, I just give my wife my uh wire guard access

28:51.940 --> 28:53.380
access

28:53.380 --> 28:57.060
I love brent, but I don't want to give him full access to my lan. You know, I can't trust his phone

28:57.140 --> 28:59.140
That's literally about to catch fire

28:59.540 --> 29:02.500
You know the one i'm talking about. It's literally the battery's popping out the thing

29:02.980 --> 29:07.380
I can't believe you're letting him bring that in the house. You have a family now. You got to get that out of there

29:09.540 --> 29:14.820
And so I was looking at tailscale and they actually offer a way to share a specific server as an exit node

29:15.220 --> 29:20.260
With someone else with a tailscale account. So what i'm thinking of doing is sharing just my

29:20.260 --> 29:25.940
Uh media server with brent as an exit node and then he should be able to access book sonic that way. Oh

29:26.740 --> 29:28.740
Now this is excellent

29:29.600 --> 29:36.340
Tailscale.com slash self-hosted, you know alex what we ought to consider is playing around with that for helipads

29:36.420 --> 29:38.420
So you guys can see the boosts?

29:38.420 --> 29:42.740
because I have my uh bitcoin node on tailscale

29:43.380 --> 29:49.780
And that's how I read the boost that people send in from anywhere i'm at on my phone whenever whenever I need to pick me up

29:49.780 --> 29:52.740
I'm not even kidding whenever I need a pick me up. I pull up the boost page

29:52.900 --> 29:54.820
And it just always puts a smile on my face

29:54.820 --> 29:57.940
So if we could figure out a way for you to read those I'd probably do the same for you

29:58.340 --> 30:04.500
Now if you don't know tailscale is a zero config vpn you can install on just about any dang device you've got I mean

30:05.220 --> 30:12.040
any device a mobile device an arm device a raspberry pi an x86 server to help you manage your firewalls

30:12.500 --> 30:17.220
And it works from anywhere. I found the coolest thing today in the feature request section

30:17.220 --> 30:21.880
They're adding android tv support. Can you believe this i'm so excited

30:23.060 --> 30:27.380
This is going to make me keep a shield. I have one shield left and this is going to make me keep it

30:27.380 --> 30:31.620
Think about this for a second think about how amazing this could be when you're traveling

30:32.020 --> 30:36.740
And then you reconnect to your home network and it just discovers your media server like you're right there on your land

30:36.900 --> 30:44.820
Or you have family members or maybe there's some content you want to get access to this is next level stuff and tailscale is in this beautiful

30:44.820 --> 30:48.580
Beautiful sweet space where they're just created this amazing tool

30:48.900 --> 30:55.460
With just enough infrastructure to make it work like you need and they use wireguards noise protocol for the security of it

30:55.460 --> 31:00.180
Which you know is great and they support your single sign-on provider

31:00.500 --> 31:03.460
If you're a corporate user like you could use whatever you want and for me

31:03.460 --> 31:07.700
I'm using my google account with two-factor authentication, which just gives me a little bit extra peace of mind

31:08.340 --> 31:11.540
And the best part is wherever i'm at if i'm at alex's house

31:11.540 --> 31:14.740
If i'm on the road if i'm back here at the studio

31:14.740 --> 31:18.180
I just use the same ip for the devices. I need to visit all the time

31:18.180 --> 31:23.800
It's one flat wireguard network and you can put a dns server in there and you got name resolution

31:24.100 --> 31:28.180
There's acl support. There's exit node support like alex was talking about

31:28.660 --> 31:34.260
It's such a like take my work to the next level kind of tool. I am thrilled

31:34.260 --> 31:40.580
They are sponsoring this show because I can completely enthusiastically endorse this because this is making house

31:40.580 --> 31:45.620
This is making how I do my job better. And I think it would really be a great tool for you, too

31:45.620 --> 31:47.460
So go check it out. Try it out

31:47.460 --> 31:52.440

Self-hosted that's tailscale.com slash self-hosted

32:00.420 --> 32:04.580
Now I want to take a moment to say thank you to our site reliability engineer subscribers

32:04.740 --> 32:08.500
You make this show possible over at self-hosted.com slash sre

32:08.500 --> 32:12.500
Now as many of you know and you love to write in and tell us we're wrong

32:12.740 --> 32:17.380
We'll get to the feedback shortly, but you can write in at self-hosted.com slash contact

32:18.100 --> 32:19.300
and also

32:19.300 --> 32:20.980
this week

32:20.980 --> 32:26.580
And also we have a discord server over at self-hosted.com slash discord loads of great conversations

32:26.580 --> 32:29.460
But this week there was one that really took the sandwich

32:30.980 --> 32:36.820
This week we found out the origin of the pseudo logo. This thing is so cool. Have you seen it?

32:36.820 --> 32:43.940
No, I waited. I saved it right now for this. Um, the have you seen the xkcd comic of sudo make me a sandwich?

32:43.940 --> 32:45.940
Make me a sandwich

32:46.180 --> 32:48.180
Well, the logo for sudo is

32:49.220 --> 32:51.220
a sandwich

32:52.260 --> 32:54.260
That's great, I love it

32:55.300 --> 32:59.220
Is it though? No, it is it's great. It is great. It is

33:00.420 --> 33:06.260
Well, I think it's great because if you look in the corner of the actual logo, it says influenced by xkcd 148

33:06.260 --> 33:07.860
149

33:07.860 --> 33:14.900
That's pretty impressive. That is pretty great real world change being affected right there right there. That's that's fantastic

33:15.620 --> 33:17.620
Um, all right. We I know we have a couple of quick tips

33:17.620 --> 33:20.660
We wanted to bust out is this a thing we do now we do quick tips on the show

33:21.300 --> 33:25.380
Uh, it is this week because i've been using the crap out of docker stats, which is

33:25.940 --> 33:27.940
It's like a top for your containers

33:28.020 --> 33:31.620
So if you if you ssh into a box right now and just type docker stats

33:31.620 --> 33:39.540
you'll get like a live print out of the cpu memory disk io network io usage of each container one by one broken out and it's

33:40.260 --> 33:46.820
It's legit pretty cool. That is oh, you know, I think i've seen this tool before but I think I completely forgot about it

33:47.380 --> 33:48.740
So, thank you

33:48.740 --> 33:50.740
All right. I think it's time to get into feedback. Don't you?

33:51.780 --> 33:58.580
Yeah, we got a boost coming in from remaking eden one week ago 2000 sats. This is hello from manchester, england

33:58.580 --> 34:03.860
Hey, that's where I met my wife. Hey as a listener since episode one

34:04.020 --> 34:07.860
I wanted to tell you that self-hosted has changed my entire home

34:08.500 --> 34:13.620
And helped shape my it career. So thanks so much. That's awesome. I have three wise style cameras

34:14.020 --> 34:19.140
I think they're actually rebranded yaomei cameras. Um, oh, okay interesting. I didn't know why he sold them

34:19.300 --> 34:23.220
He says in the uk the most popular seller seems to be neos. I immediately

34:23.220 --> 34:28.260
Um reflashed mine with the dfang hacks firmware

34:28.580 --> 34:34.020
I use the rtsp feed straight in home assistant and frig it and they've been flawless for years

34:34.260 --> 34:39.780
I was wondering if you looked at this as an option seems like they're not yet working on a v3 camera though

34:40.180 --> 34:43.700
I didn't even know these were essentially rebranded wise cameras

34:44.580 --> 34:46.260
That's fascinating

34:46.260 --> 34:48.260
Remaking eden. Thank you

34:48.260 --> 34:49.940
Alex go buy some

34:49.940 --> 34:54.660
Brenda if you still got that credit card, you should go pick a couple up. I think I know where he keeps it

34:56.580 --> 34:58.580
I know where you sleep at night. Is that

34:59.060 --> 35:00.500
That's creepy

35:00.500 --> 35:06.580
Yeah, so I actually tried this to fang hacks firmware on my original wise v2s

35:06.660 --> 35:08.660
It was probably two or three years ago now

35:08.980 --> 35:13.220
And honestly, it was a pain in the ass, uh trying to get it flashed on there with the sd cards

35:13.540 --> 35:19.300
I had a real time getting it on there, but thankfully they released the official rtsp firmware some time ago now

35:19.300 --> 35:24.020
So for me the use case for the defying hack firmware has kind of been diminished somewhat

35:25.460 --> 35:27.460
Yeah, and also with wise bridge

35:27.540 --> 35:28.660
um

35:28.660 --> 35:34.980
It's even kind of simpler now to just use the default firmware get all the security updates and still capture the video locally

35:35.300 --> 35:39.540
So that's kind of the route that I think i've been suggesting people go anonymous boosted in

35:39.540 --> 35:42.420
He says I meant to get the name. I apologize for a thousand stats

35:42.820 --> 35:47.860
I found you guys through the fountain app, which is a fountain.fm a new podcast app

35:47.860 --> 35:51.140
Because you have the podcasting 2.0 tag set up

35:51.460 --> 35:55.940
So I want to take a second and just break this down because you may be seeing this if you're in our community more and more

35:56.580 --> 35:59.480
So podcasting 2.0 is a set of new specifications

36:01.060 --> 36:07.540
For podcasts to give them more features like chapter images well chapters to begin with

36:08.640 --> 36:09.940
transcriptions

36:09.940 --> 36:11.540
links that are

36:11.540 --> 36:18.820
At a particular time code all kinds of other features including a value for value tag, which includes the boost that you hear us talk about

36:19.380 --> 36:23.160
And you can grab one of these new podcast apps that supports these new standards at newpodcastapps.com

36:24.500 --> 36:26.340
And we'll have a link in the show notes

36:26.340 --> 36:29.220
That takes you to the ones that specifically support the boosts

36:29.220 --> 36:32.340
But alex, I know we also just got a whole bunch of traditional emails this week, too

36:32.980 --> 36:35.940
We did and i'm gonna make use of having brent sit next to me and read the long one

36:36.180 --> 36:39.540
You just want to hear my voice, don't you? I do baby. We all do we all do

36:39.540 --> 36:43.860
It reads. Hey chris and ironically named badger

36:44.420 --> 36:50.340
I was listening to your segment about what to do with syncing certificates to multiple servers using something like s3

36:50.740 --> 36:54.500
And I have some comments, please for the love of god, don't do this

36:54.980 --> 36:57.780
Firstly because the certificates are the keys to your kingdom

36:58.500 --> 37:04.660
A leak of those removes all security on your services and lets anyone in the middle snoop on whatever it is you're doing

37:04.660 --> 37:12.520
Self-hosted or otherwise certificates are massively important and shouldn't be stored anywhere. Other than where they're absolutely needed

37:13.540 --> 37:15.880
Secondly because it's just not necessary

37:16.200 --> 37:18.200
If you're not using wildcard certificates

37:18.360 --> 37:21.240
Then just creating certificates for each domain is totally fine

37:21.400 --> 37:26.040
And they can be stored and managed wherever the domain needs to be served from if you are using wildcards

37:26.120 --> 37:28.760
There's nothing which says only one can exist in the world

37:28.760 --> 37:34.280
My servers each have their own wildcard automatically managed and renewed by trafic

37:34.840 --> 37:43.000
This way there's neither a need to store their certificates anywhere other than the servers nor to set up some secure storage or communication method

37:43.800 --> 37:48.360
I don't even bother backing out my certificates anymore. That seems crazy to me

37:49.400 --> 37:55.800
Let's encrypt or more specifically acme makes provisioning certs insanely simple

37:55.800 --> 38:00.760
Let them deal with the security side of things. We can just use their tools to create all the certificates. We want

38:01.320 --> 38:05.880
Wherever we want. Thanks for reading and keep up the great work your friendly neighbor orange

38:06.680 --> 38:12.680
Thanks for writing in jake. Now. This is jake of episode 42 fame who came in on our first community spotlight

38:13.640 --> 38:19.880
Also, we had kevin write in who told us that we're actually trying to over complicate the management of ssl certificate management

38:19.880 --> 38:27.000
He says I get the desire to use a wildcard cert, but it would be much easier to generate machine-specific certificates on each vm instead

38:27.000 --> 38:33.160
I manage a few dozen servers and use dehydrated to generate let's encrypt certificates on each host

38:33.800 --> 38:38.760
That way the private key and the certificate don't need to be distributed and they never leave the vm

38:39.560 --> 38:46.040
It uses a plain text file to configure the host names and generate certificates and it makes it very easy to add extra names that way

38:46.040 --> 38:51.000
Thanks for writing in kevin. You raise a very good point. And uh, yeah, I don't know why we missed that

38:51.880 --> 38:53.880
It's a really obvious thing. Just run

38:53.880 --> 38:59.800
Just run acme or cert bot on each machine problem solved. Well, I do this is of course

39:00.360 --> 39:04.440
easy for me to say now, but I remember specifically on the pre-show that we were

39:05.080 --> 39:10.440
Not streaming. We we thought this guy isn't doing this, right and we did start talking about this

39:10.440 --> 39:13.880
But then we did we just dropped it and we got to the business of actually recording the show

39:13.880 --> 39:18.520
We have this thing don't we where we're always having a pre-show conversation and all the best versions

39:19.080 --> 39:24.120
Of our problem solving comes out then and we're like save it for the show and I guess we just forgot to save that nugget

39:24.920 --> 39:27.480
Yeah, and it is absolutely our bad

39:27.480 --> 39:33.560
So, um, thankfully we have an awesome audience who helps us with that kind of stuff and we have no qualms at all about making

39:33.640 --> 39:36.920
Corrections and fixing that sort of stuff because it's all about just getting the best info out there

39:38.200 --> 39:42.200
Now I was hoping to solicit some feedback from the audience on my next next video

39:42.200 --> 39:47.480
Back from the audience on my next networking upgrade. I've currently got a gigabit network everywhere

39:47.560 --> 39:53.160
Which like most people I did because it's cheap, you know, I can buy a five port switch for 15 bucks at best buy

39:54.280 --> 39:56.280
And every time i've looked at going

39:56.520 --> 40:00.120
More than gigabit so, you know 10 gigs probably the next logical step

40:00.840 --> 40:05.560
I'd look at the switch prices and they're like two three hundred dollars per switch and I think oh

40:06.360 --> 40:09.480
I'll just wait for the prices to come down a little bit and they never seem to

40:09.480 --> 40:17.480
And jeff geerling, you know who was also on the show previously just did a video on a microtik switch the crs

40:18.260 --> 40:21.960
309 1g 8s plus in

40:22.520 --> 40:26.040
That name rolls off the tongue doesn't it flippin. Yeah, nice smooth

40:27.480 --> 40:33.000
So we basically questions for the audience if you've done 10 gig i'm really curious to know how you did it

40:33.000 --> 40:36.600
Did you run fiber in your house? Did you do it with cat 6a?

40:36.600 --> 40:40.680
Thankfully, I ran cat 6a on the trunks in my house when I moved in three years ago

40:41.400 --> 40:46.520
Or am I shooting for the stars with 10 gig is 2.5 enough for my needs right now

40:47.480 --> 40:54.440
That's a fair question. I'm curious what you're doing right now. That makes even gigabit insufficient. Well, i've got gigabit

40:54.760 --> 40:59.640
WAN so sometimes if i'm pulling something down from the internet and then trying to stream something to

40:59.640 --> 41:06.040
Plex, uh, you know a high bitrate movie or moving some files around from my desktop to my nas, for example

41:06.600 --> 41:11.800
Uh that can sometimes cause issues. Sure. Yeah, especially when you're you're you're you know

41:11.800 --> 41:14.680
Not working with like cisco switches there at your house, right?

41:14.680 --> 41:20.440
So that also makes a difference that makes I mean i'm i'm never going to stop a guy from going as much performance as possible

41:20.440 --> 41:25.800
I'm, all about it. Uh, I I think that's a great question is two and a half gigabit enough

41:26.520 --> 41:27.960
and

41:27.960 --> 41:32.920
And is it worth the leap to 10 gigabit? I have to tell you alex

41:33.640 --> 41:39.560
I feel like you're the kind of guy that appreciates the value of doing it once and just doing it, right?

41:40.040 --> 41:44.840
You know, like you could do 2.5 gigabits and you could probably get away with it for a couple of years

41:44.920 --> 41:46.360
Probably even five years

41:46.360 --> 41:50.920
But there's gonna be a point where you're gonna wish it was faster because you're just that kind of guy

41:51.080 --> 41:53.720
And so and you know, it could be better too. That's the other thing

41:53.720 --> 41:59.400
You are totally spot on now lucas writes in in the live chat

41:59.880 --> 42:05.800
I impulse signed up for two gig google fiber and realized almost nothing. I have can distribute it across the land

42:06.600 --> 42:08.360
Oh, no

42:08.360 --> 42:12.280
Who thought we'd have wan connections that were faster than gigabit, huh? Yeah

42:12.440 --> 42:16.920
I mean, I would love to have that problem. I'm still stuck with 300 megabits here at the studio

42:16.920 --> 42:18.840
That's what i'm with you chris. Yeah

42:18.840 --> 42:25.320
They're i'm not even joking. There are days when the starlink in the rv performs better than the comcast here at the studio

42:25.560 --> 42:27.560
Yikes, I know although

42:27.880 --> 42:29.320
although

42:29.320 --> 42:33.720
We did get a letter saying that fiber was in the area and would be available soon

42:33.800 --> 42:38.280
So things could be looking up boys. Things could be looking up. Oh brent will attest to this

42:38.280 --> 42:42.920
We're driving around my area at the moment and there are just trucks rolling running fiber

42:43.540 --> 42:46.140
Everywhere around me but not in my neighborhood

42:46.140 --> 42:47.820
Good

42:47.820 --> 42:51.020
That does sting very it's very frustrating and it's

42:51.660 --> 42:54.860
They're also hard to miss their giant rolls of orange

42:55.580 --> 42:59.580
Beauty so alex every time we're out driving. He's like there's another one fiber

43:00.300 --> 43:03.660
Yeah, yeah, I will say that I agree with chris here on that though that

43:04.540 --> 43:09.980
You might as well go ahead and do 10 gigabit and you know, we were on the topic of e-waste earlier

43:09.980 --> 43:15.580
Right. What is it going to be like 2.5 for five years until then you upgrade to 10?

43:15.900 --> 43:19.260
It just seems like save yourself the time and the effort do it once and do it, right?

43:19.740 --> 43:25.500
I agree completely and that was why I ran cat 6a when I moved in was because I had one eye on that in the future

43:26.140 --> 43:32.540
But I was talking to abstract vector who is matt adventurous way who was also on the show a few episodes ago building the house

43:33.260 --> 43:37.260
He's running fiber in a conduit from the road to his house

43:37.260 --> 43:40.300
Which is like a three four hundred foot driveway or something

43:41.180 --> 43:46.140
Uh, but then he's also running fiber between all the buildings. He's building on his land

43:46.700 --> 43:51.820
And so he's looking at all the different switching gear. He's going to need for that kind of stuff. So you would too

43:52.780 --> 43:55.280
Right. I mean wouldn't you at this point? I mean, absolutely

43:55.980 --> 44:00.060
I would love to do that. Yeah, we should have him on at some point and see how it goes how it's all working

44:00.860 --> 44:04.060
