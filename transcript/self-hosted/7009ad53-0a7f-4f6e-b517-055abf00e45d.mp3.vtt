WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.640
Well, it was road trip time yesterday, Chris.

00:01.640 --> 00:03.360
Sure, that was a heck of a road trip.

00:03.360 --> 00:05.400
Yeah, we drove up from Raleigh, North Carolina,

00:05.400 --> 00:08.160
and here we are in Lexington this morning, Kentucky.

00:08.160 --> 00:11.240
Yeah, and we discovered something called the Snake.

00:11.240 --> 00:12.080
The Snake.

00:12.080 --> 00:15.500
It was the very, very windy, twisty,

00:15.500 --> 00:16.880
was it Tennessee Mountain Road?

00:16.880 --> 00:18.120
I think it was Tennessee.

00:18.120 --> 00:19.900
It was the perfect road for us

00:19.900 --> 00:21.680
that we just accidentally stumbled across.

00:21.680 --> 00:22.520
Yeah.

00:22.520 --> 00:25.560
Alex's tires are designed to stick to the road.

00:25.560 --> 00:26.400
Let's just say that.

00:26.400 --> 00:29.660
I mean, you just described all tires ever, but.

00:29.660 --> 00:32.040
I know, I'm not a tire guy.

00:32.040 --> 00:34.440
Anyway, the reason that we took this road trip,

00:34.440 --> 00:36.080
a nine, 10 hour drive from Raleigh,

00:36.080 --> 00:38.600
was to spend a bit of time with Wendell, who joins us today.

00:38.600 --> 00:39.520
Hello, Wendell.

00:39.520 --> 00:40.600
How's it going?

00:40.600 --> 00:41.800
Pretty good, how are you doing?

00:41.800 --> 00:42.620
Oh, not too bad.

00:42.620 --> 00:43.960
Although it is a little weird, I mean, like,

00:43.960 --> 00:45.880
podcast technology, I would think with, you know,

00:45.880 --> 00:47.120
since Alexander Graham Bell,

00:47.120 --> 00:49.440
you guys would not have to come here, but I'm glad you did.

00:49.440 --> 00:50.680
That's true.

00:50.680 --> 00:53.440
I had that realization on about hour three of the flight.

00:53.440 --> 00:56.420
I said, well, you know, we could have done Skype,

00:56.420 --> 00:57.700
but this is a lot more fun.

00:57.700 --> 00:59.280
I mean, then we got to see the Grand Tour.

00:59.280 --> 01:00.120
Yeah, you get to see,

01:00.120 --> 01:01.640
we're going to do an office tour at some point

01:01.640 --> 01:03.080
on the Level One channel very soon,

01:03.080 --> 01:05.600
because the renovation is basically done.

01:05.600 --> 01:07.560
Like, there's a few rough things we got to work on,

01:07.560 --> 01:09.280
but basically the renovation's done.

01:09.280 --> 01:10.480
That's pretty presentable.

01:10.480 --> 01:12.800
There is something special about

01:12.800 --> 01:14.680
actually connecting in meat space.

01:14.680 --> 01:15.640
Yeah.

01:15.640 --> 01:16.800
Which you just don't get over.

01:16.800 --> 01:18.300
I mean, I've watched Chris,

01:18.300 --> 01:19.560
I've watched your channel for a while,

01:19.560 --> 01:22.980
and Wendell, I've watched yours probably for just as long,

01:22.980 --> 01:24.040
going way, way back.

01:24.040 --> 01:27.640
And I know you cover all sorts of technology

01:27.640 --> 01:28.560
and stuff like that,

01:28.560 --> 01:30.840
but you generally tend to focus on

01:30.840 --> 01:32.000
the nerdier side of things.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.600
I think it's fair to say.

01:33.600 --> 01:34.440
So-

01:34.440 --> 01:36.600
Look at this thing that I gave a large part of my life

01:36.600 --> 01:37.720
into figuring out.

01:37.720 --> 01:39.560
This was a terrible, terrible experience.

01:39.560 --> 01:41.080
Suffer along with me.

01:41.080 --> 01:42.520
I think that's an accurate statement

01:42.520 --> 01:44.480
for a lot of what we're trying to do with this show, right?

01:44.480 --> 01:45.320
Right, yeah.

01:45.320 --> 01:47.000
Is, yeah, I've put some blood, sweat,

01:47.000 --> 01:48.840
and a lot of alcohol into this project.

01:48.840 --> 01:51.960
And I want you to come along for that ride with me.

01:51.960 --> 01:53.440
So, yeah.

01:53.440 --> 01:55.040
We thought it would be a good topic for our,

01:55.040 --> 01:56.880
this is our second episode as we record.

01:56.880 --> 01:59.560
We thought just the discussion of why self-host

01:59.560 --> 02:00.680
is sort of a meta conversation.

02:00.680 --> 02:02.520
And that's why the tour of your space here

02:02.520 --> 02:03.360
was pretty perfect,

02:03.360 --> 02:06.120
because there is clearly some stuff you've chosen

02:06.120 --> 02:09.500
to spend the extra time to build local infrastructure,

02:09.500 --> 02:13.040
put high-speed networking in, lots of disk.

02:13.040 --> 02:14.000
And then there's some things,

02:14.000 --> 02:15.140
which we don't know about yet,

02:15.140 --> 02:18.980
that you alluded to that you've chosen to host in the cloud.

02:18.980 --> 02:21.260
So I'm kind of curious what the Wendell take is

02:21.260 --> 02:23.080
on why self-hosting is important.

02:23.080 --> 02:27.920
I think that for the individual, self-hosting is

02:27.920 --> 02:30.540
never more accessible than it's ever been.

02:30.540 --> 02:33.400
And I think that going forward,

02:33.400 --> 02:36.000
self-hosting makes a lot of sense,

02:36.000 --> 02:38.980
because the reason that you don't want to self-host,

02:38.980 --> 02:41.000
I think, is one of convenience.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.120
So you look at Google and Gmail,

02:43.120 --> 02:44.520
it's like Gmail is super convenient.

02:44.520 --> 02:46.880
You just load a browser and there it is.

02:46.880 --> 02:49.480
But the technology has moved on to the point

02:49.480 --> 02:52.080
that that's basically become a commodity.

02:52.080 --> 02:53.120
And we could talk,

02:53.120 --> 02:54.760
I don't want to get super into the weeds here,

02:54.760 --> 02:57.080
but things like containerization technologies mean

02:57.080 --> 03:01.520
that individuals are better able to access Google levels

03:01.520 --> 03:04.480
of technology running on a Raspberry Pi.

03:04.480 --> 03:05.880
And so, well, running on a Raspberry Pi

03:05.880 --> 03:08.120
might not be the best user experience,

03:08.120 --> 03:11.100
but it's possible to have an even better user experience

03:11.100 --> 03:12.920
than, quote unquote, the cloud,

03:12.920 --> 03:15.120
even if you're rolling your own cloud

03:15.120 --> 03:16.440
or doing a private cloud.

03:16.440 --> 03:19.760
And because you're giving somebody money for the service,

03:19.760 --> 03:21.300
they're not having to mine your data

03:21.300 --> 03:22.480
in order to earn money.

03:22.480 --> 03:23.320
Right.

03:23.320 --> 03:24.900
Now, I did notice a lot of disk,

03:24.900 --> 03:26.120
but you said some of that disk

03:26.120 --> 03:27.840
was to actually backup the stuff

03:27.840 --> 03:29.100
that you do keep in the cloud.

03:29.100 --> 03:30.600
Yeah, so I'm always paranoid

03:30.600 --> 03:32.160
that something's going to go wrong in the cloud.

03:32.160 --> 03:36.080
Like, Microsoft had that major DNS outage in Azure.

03:36.080 --> 03:38.080
And so it's like, is that going to happen?

03:38.080 --> 03:41.360
There's a backup provider for dental,

03:41.360 --> 03:43.680
like their specialization is like dental offices.

03:43.680 --> 03:45.000
So you've got HIPAA and things like that.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.440
And this was just last week.

03:46.440 --> 03:49.240
And the organization that provides the backups in the cloud

03:49.240 --> 03:50.680
was hit by ransomware.

03:50.680 --> 03:51.760
It's like, oh, we all laugh.

03:51.760 --> 03:53.960
It's like, oh, this is, you know, blah, blah, blah.

03:53.960 --> 03:55.760
That's incompetence.

03:55.760 --> 03:56.900
But- Happens though.

03:56.900 --> 04:00.000
Yeah, well, I mean, when you have things like the OPM hack,

04:00.000 --> 04:03.500
like the hardware was defective from the beginning.

04:03.500 --> 04:05.900
So you know how you make sure it's safe

04:05.900 --> 04:09.380
is you have an offline backup that's inaccessible.

04:09.380 --> 04:11.440
Yeah, and there's something to being a smaller target.

04:11.440 --> 04:13.400
If it's, you know, on your LAN,

04:13.400 --> 04:16.580
you are one person amongst millions of nodes

04:16.580 --> 04:17.420
on the internet.

04:17.420 --> 04:19.920
But if you're Azure in this case,

04:19.920 --> 04:22.280
or another large provider,

04:22.280 --> 04:23.840
you've got a pretty big target on your back too.

04:23.840 --> 04:25.540
So there's a different risk profile.

04:25.540 --> 04:26.800
There's like a different set of risks.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.920
Like you still have to keep your system secure

04:28.920 --> 04:31.160
and make sure your firewall's, you know, set up right.

04:31.160 --> 04:32.600
And you're not just letting anybody in,

04:32.600 --> 04:35.000
but in a way you're also kind of just one of many.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.320
You're sort of lost in the noise.

04:36.320 --> 04:38.200
That's one of the things I like about containerization

04:38.200 --> 04:40.760
is because it offers the possibility of somebody

04:40.760 --> 04:43.100
to set up an automation system,

04:43.100 --> 04:46.240
like just a very basic Docker, you know,

04:46.240 --> 04:48.960
scrape and rebuild on a timer

04:48.960 --> 04:51.280
would let you keep the patches and security

04:51.280 --> 04:52.680
and still do local hosting

04:52.680 --> 04:54.940
and probably be pretty safe

04:54.940 --> 04:57.120
as long as the container that you're using

04:57.120 --> 04:59.320
is maintained by people that know what they're doing.

04:59.320 --> 05:01.680
Of course, like depending if the container

05:01.680 --> 05:02.640
is not well-maintained

05:02.640 --> 05:05.200
or there's like an open source supply chain attack,

05:05.200 --> 05:07.800
then that's a whole other risk profile as well.

05:07.800 --> 05:11.380
So what containers do you use like for backup?

05:11.380 --> 05:14.200
Well, like we would have a replication

05:14.200 --> 05:15.680
of like whatever the thing is.

05:15.680 --> 05:17.560
So like if there was a very important website

05:17.560 --> 05:19.160
that we were hosting,

05:19.160 --> 05:21.600
we've actually been doing a lot of work lately

05:21.600 --> 05:24.960
in taking traditional CMSs and making them headless.

05:24.960 --> 05:27.000
So like with Drupal, for example,

05:27.000 --> 05:29.120
it is very easy, not very easy,

05:29.120 --> 05:34.120
but we can fairly easily add an interface to the JSON API.

05:34.280 --> 05:36.000
So that Drupal, a traditional CMS,

05:36.000 --> 05:38.080
which is actually kind of slow and kind of clunky,

05:38.080 --> 05:39.440
especially version eight,

05:39.440 --> 05:41.500
but we can take the content from that,

05:41.500 --> 05:43.420
export it as flat files,

05:43.420 --> 05:46.120
and then everything is perfectly fine to run

05:46.120 --> 05:48.000
on like Amazon S3 and CloudFront.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.480
And then when somebody has a content update,

05:49.480 --> 05:51.320
it just regenerates the flat files.

05:51.320 --> 05:52.960
And I think this kind of thing

05:52.960 --> 05:55.120
with a service layer on top of it

05:55.120 --> 05:57.120
is probably the future of websites.

05:57.120 --> 05:58.440
So if you have a very large website

05:58.440 --> 06:00.560
that needs to be very, very resilient,

06:00.560 --> 06:02.140
you can have your traditional hosting thing,

06:02.140 --> 06:05.160
but like your backup plan can be the series of flat files

06:05.160 --> 06:07.160
or the main hosting can be a series of flat files.

06:07.160 --> 06:09.360
And then it's like, oh, something went horribly wrong.

06:09.360 --> 06:11.160
It's like, okay, well, let's just make the change in DNS.

06:11.160 --> 06:12.800
And like Amazon could be on fire.

06:12.800 --> 06:14.040
We don't care.

06:14.040 --> 06:15.160
We could roll it out at Akamai.

06:15.160 --> 06:17.040
We could roll it out at Linode.

06:17.040 --> 06:18.520
We could roll it out, you know,

06:18.520 --> 06:20.760
CloudFlare could provide services.

06:20.760 --> 06:23.860
It's really, when you're dealing with it at that level,

06:23.860 --> 06:26.520
the service provider no longer matters.

06:26.520 --> 06:29.400
Are you not tempted to do like this new,

06:29.400 --> 06:32.160
cause you just have a video come out about DevOps,

06:32.160 --> 06:33.480
a DevOps workstation.

06:33.480 --> 06:35.760
Are you not tempted to do stuff in Lambda?

06:35.760 --> 06:37.120
You know, have these functions

06:37.120 --> 06:38.840
that are just very single purpose or?

06:38.840 --> 06:41.080
Yeah, no, you totally could.

06:41.080 --> 06:41.900
It's funny.

06:41.900 --> 06:43.440
We actually do have some things

06:43.440 --> 06:45.000
that are running in Lambda.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.800
So like a customer comes along and wants to do a job

06:47.800 --> 06:50.600
and it'll just spin up in Lambda, do its thing.

06:50.600 --> 06:53.000
And then the output is added to the collective.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.640
And that's totally fine.

06:54.640 --> 06:58.400
Like that's a perfectly reasonable way to design things

06:58.400 --> 06:59.880
that functionally, I mean,

06:59.880 --> 07:01.640
it's way different under the hood,

07:01.640 --> 07:03.680
but functionally that's where a lot of DevOps is going

07:03.680 --> 07:05.880
because like our local DevOps server,

07:05.880 --> 07:08.240
Kubernetes is doing a lot of stuff.

07:08.240 --> 07:10.560
So like a developer checks in a bunch of stuff,

07:10.560 --> 07:13.400
a VM has stood up and a whole bunch of things happen

07:13.400 --> 07:17.440
in Kubernetes and then all of that goes away

07:17.440 --> 07:18.280
when they're done.

07:18.280 --> 07:19.360
Well, actually it sticks around for like a week,

07:19.360 --> 07:20.520
just in case we need it.

07:20.520 --> 07:21.360
But then after a week,

07:21.360 --> 07:24.880
like whatever that temporal thing was gone.

07:24.880 --> 07:26.320
And this actually has worked out really well.

07:26.320 --> 07:27.600
There's a particular project in mind

07:27.600 --> 07:31.520
where the client is very hard to work with

07:31.520 --> 07:35.480
and they've got their own like chef automation.

07:35.480 --> 07:38.200
And so like, even if we just add an SSH key

07:38.200 --> 07:43.200
to the very, like the two vCPU instances on Amazon,

07:43.200 --> 07:46.040
which is not really enough for what they wanna do,

07:46.040 --> 07:48.800
chef comes along and just clobbers that periodically.

07:48.800 --> 07:51.800
And so we've set up continuous integration

07:51.800 --> 07:55.160
and a Kubernetes thing so that it actually will spin up

07:55.160 --> 07:59.400
something that works kind of like the Amazon EC2 instance,

07:59.400 --> 08:02.200
but it has a way more CPU and memory horsepower.

08:02.200 --> 08:03.840
It does all of the work that it needs to

08:03.840 --> 08:06.240
in that temporal VM.

08:06.240 --> 08:08.720
And really it's just a container in Kubernetes.

08:08.720 --> 08:11.320
And then it pushes from that Kubernetes container

08:11.320 --> 08:14.520
to that really just awful, terrible EC2 instance.

08:14.520 --> 08:16.800
And so it doesn't matter if they come along

08:16.800 --> 08:17.640
and clobber it later.

08:17.640 --> 08:20.400
It doesn't matter if they come and delete the SSH keys.

08:20.400 --> 08:21.880
It just doesn't matter.

08:21.880 --> 08:25.640
So how do you decide which services get that treatment

08:25.640 --> 08:28.800
and which services end up in your closet downstairs?

08:28.800 --> 08:31.160
Well, a lot of, see,

08:31.160 --> 08:34.240
I would say that that exists in both places.

08:34.240 --> 08:37.680
Like it would not work without the closet

08:37.680 --> 08:39.760
and it would not work without the cloud services.

08:39.760 --> 08:41.720
You get sort of the best of both worlds.

08:41.720 --> 08:43.680
If the cloud service goes away,

08:43.680 --> 08:46.520
it's really easy for us to redeploy somewhere else.

08:46.520 --> 08:48.160
And if the closet goes away,

08:48.160 --> 08:50.440
we've got time to restore from offsite backups

08:50.440 --> 08:51.560
and do whatever we need to do

08:51.560 --> 08:53.120
without anybody that's in production

08:53.120 --> 08:54.600
really realizing what's happened.

08:54.600 --> 08:57.160
I think we need to rename the show, Chris, Closet Hosting.

08:57.160 --> 09:00.320
It is, you know what, there's something to it there

09:00.320 --> 09:02.760
because it's a nice, perfect sweet spot.

09:02.760 --> 09:03.600
I really like that.

09:03.600 --> 09:06.040
Cause you're not dependent on any one cloud provider.

09:06.040 --> 09:08.640
And you're not absolutely dependent on your office space

09:08.640 --> 09:09.880
being online 24 seven,

09:09.880 --> 09:10.880
if you have to take something down

09:10.880 --> 09:13.800
to install something new in the rack or move it.

09:13.800 --> 09:15.480
Cause let's face it,

09:15.480 --> 09:18.480
as experienced as you clearly are,

09:18.480 --> 09:19.600
you're not a data center.

09:19.600 --> 09:21.880
You don't have techs here 24 seven.

09:21.880 --> 09:23.920
You don't have all the monitoring that they do,

09:23.920 --> 09:27.640
the security protocols that they do to even get on the floor.

09:27.640 --> 09:28.800
Although when you deal with people

09:28.800 --> 09:31.800
actually in the data center, it's less than impressive.

09:31.800 --> 09:32.640
True.

09:32.640 --> 09:33.520
I've got a failed hard drive.

09:33.520 --> 09:34.360
I need that replaced.

09:34.360 --> 09:35.320
Do what now?

09:35.320 --> 09:38.440
I can hammer the front of the server with a hammer.

09:38.440 --> 09:42.360
Yeah, it's very frustrating experience.

09:42.360 --> 09:44.960
So we're here at your space.

09:44.960 --> 09:46.040
What about like your home set up?

09:46.040 --> 09:47.280
You have storage systems at home.

09:47.280 --> 09:48.920
Do you have a big like home server set up

09:48.920 --> 09:50.960
or do you keep it lean at home tech wise?

09:50.960 --> 09:53.360
Our home is very lean.

09:53.360 --> 09:55.600
It's a similar philosophy,

09:55.600 --> 10:00.600
but I have an ITX system that is in the fractal node 304.

10:00.760 --> 10:03.400
And it's a four processor eight thread system right now,

10:03.400 --> 10:05.600
but it's very soon going to be the,

10:05.600 --> 10:08.560
as soon as I get a 3950X from AMD,

10:08.560 --> 10:10.960
it's going to be a 16 core AM4 system.

10:10.960 --> 10:12.320
Thought about replacing it with Threadripper,

10:12.320 --> 10:15.120
but it's really overkill for what I do at home.

10:15.120 --> 10:18.600
But the home system runs a number of VMs.

10:18.600 --> 10:21.280
There's an IOT gateway because all the IOT devices

10:21.280 --> 10:23.560
are on a completely separate network.

10:23.560 --> 10:28.480
And the IOT devices, I run more homegrown IOT devices

10:28.480 --> 10:30.960
than real like third party IOT devices.

10:30.960 --> 10:32.680
What's an example of that?

10:32.680 --> 10:35.920
The system for opening the garage door

10:36.960 --> 10:38.760
is hooked into the lights.

10:38.760 --> 10:40.200
So like where my house is,

10:40.200 --> 10:42.360
there's a light that's like right at the road

10:42.360 --> 10:43.960
cause there's a little bit of a driveway.

10:43.960 --> 10:46.000
And then there are lights on the garage

10:46.000 --> 10:47.520
and there are lights on the house.

10:47.520 --> 10:51.360
And so there's a receiver at the light post

10:51.360 --> 10:53.080
when you first entered the driveway

10:53.080 --> 10:56.760
that picks up the Bluetooth Mac address of my phone.

10:56.760 --> 10:59.040
And so when I drive by the light post,

10:59.040 --> 11:01.720
it will turn the lights on if it's after dark

11:01.720 --> 11:05.680
at the garage and a house.

11:05.680 --> 11:10.280
So the IOT gateway for that cannot get on the internet.

11:10.280 --> 11:13.160
Chris just for the listeners looked at me and winked

11:13.160 --> 11:16.000
cause that's a phenomenal piece of engineering.

11:16.000 --> 11:16.840
Yeah, it's great.

11:16.840 --> 11:18.040
It's just an idea I wouldn't have thought of.

11:18.040 --> 11:19.840
And are you battery powering that thing out there

11:19.840 --> 11:21.760
or did you run power out to the remote?

11:21.760 --> 11:25.720
It's a Raspberry Pi Zero in epoxy.

11:25.720 --> 11:28.720
And so it literally is just doing its thing out there

11:28.720 --> 11:30.760
with Bluetooth and the wifi from the house

11:30.760 --> 11:32.040
is strong enough to make it out there.

11:32.040 --> 11:32.880
That's great.

11:32.880 --> 11:33.720
I mean, it's only like one megabit

11:33.720 --> 11:34.960
but that's enough to send the packet

11:34.960 --> 11:36.880
to be like, turn the lights on, it's dark.

11:36.880 --> 11:37.880
It's all you need really.

11:37.880 --> 11:38.840
That's a great solution.

11:38.840 --> 11:41.040
And so you do have some level of presence awareness.

11:41.040 --> 11:42.640
So the system knows specifically it's you.

11:42.640 --> 11:43.480
Yeah.

11:43.480 --> 11:44.320
That's really nice.

11:44.320 --> 11:46.120
Did I hear you mention home assistant?

11:46.120 --> 11:49.800
Yeah, I've been, so the home assistant conversation

11:49.800 --> 11:50.640
is complicated.

11:50.640 --> 11:54.680
It's broken right now, but historically I've had

11:54.680 --> 11:56.480
the home assistant doing fun things

11:56.480 --> 11:58.600
like scouring the internet for certain things

11:58.600 --> 12:01.360
that I might be interested in that are temporal.

12:01.360 --> 12:03.320
There's a Plex server that's a part of that.

12:03.320 --> 12:06.640
So, you know, like Plex and historically,

12:06.640 --> 12:11.080
although not currently, I've had an impact to capture box

12:11.080 --> 12:15.320
that was hooked into the listings for cable TV.

12:15.320 --> 12:18.160
And so like historically it's like, okay,

12:18.160 --> 12:19.280
probably interested in Star Trek,

12:19.280 --> 12:20.640
probably interested in all these things.

12:20.640 --> 12:22.360
And I could get to that from my phone

12:22.360 --> 12:24.520
and just tag shows that I might be interested in.

12:24.520 --> 12:28.160
So like for Game of Thrones, it would DVR it for me.

12:28.160 --> 12:29.760
But then that goes into Plex.

12:29.760 --> 12:32.320
And so that's another like kind of cloud,

12:32.320 --> 12:33.400
kind of not really thing.

12:33.400 --> 12:35.920
Like Plex's model has changed over the years.

12:35.920 --> 12:39.120
I'm not really super happy with their subscription model.

12:39.120 --> 12:40.640
It's still probably worth it,

12:40.640 --> 12:43.840
but it's super easy to run all of your media center at home

12:43.840 --> 12:44.840
and actually stream it yourself

12:44.840 --> 12:45.920
over your internet connection.

12:45.920 --> 12:47.400
A lot of the internet connections here in America

12:47.400 --> 12:49.480
are gimped in really weird ways,

12:49.480 --> 12:52.080
but like upload is one of them.

12:52.080 --> 12:55.400
And so it can be problematic to stream from,

12:55.400 --> 12:56.320
like if you're traveling,

12:56.320 --> 12:58.320
like stream your home media collection.

12:58.320 --> 13:00.240
But Plex actually makes that really easy.

13:00.240 --> 13:03.200
And I think that like movie studios and rights holders

13:03.200 --> 13:05.920
are really nervous about that kind of functionality.

13:05.920 --> 13:07.840
And I hope that it doesn't go away,

13:07.840 --> 13:10.800
but being able to record those kinds of things

13:10.800 --> 13:12.400
from traditional mediums,

13:12.400 --> 13:14.560
like time and format shift it basically

13:14.560 --> 13:16.160
has been really awesome.

13:16.160 --> 13:18.560
But I don't really have a lot of time

13:18.560 --> 13:20.560
to enjoy that kind of stuff anymore.

13:20.560 --> 13:24.360
And Netflix is good enough that it has broken.

13:24.360 --> 13:25.200
And it's like, okay,

13:25.200 --> 13:26.560
I need to probably figure out why it's broken

13:26.560 --> 13:27.680
or updated or whatever.

13:27.680 --> 13:28.880
And I just haven't bothered.

13:28.880 --> 13:31.600
But the thing about all of these streaming services

13:31.600 --> 13:33.600
is, you know, Disney's coming out with a new one this year,

13:33.600 --> 13:36.400
Apple, what's the one for Star Trek, CBS.

13:36.400 --> 13:38.240
Yep, and Warner's got one coming out.

13:38.240 --> 13:41.200
Yeah, I'm getting a bit fatigued by all this stuff.

13:41.200 --> 13:42.240
I don't really like the idea

13:42.240 --> 13:44.880
of not being able to get back to that either,

13:44.880 --> 13:48.320
because like I have archived copies of Next Gen,

13:48.320 --> 13:52.680
but I also have like the resampled whatever thing

13:52.680 --> 13:53.960
of Star Trek Next Gen.

13:53.960 --> 13:56.960
And I really like the idea of format shifting

13:56.960 --> 13:58.280
from the newer formats

13:58.280 --> 14:00.040
onto something that I can watch on Plex all the time.

14:00.040 --> 14:02.000
Because like, what's on Netflix is not,

14:02.000 --> 14:03.960
I don't think it's the resampled version.

14:03.960 --> 14:06.000
It doesn't seem like it's the resampled version.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.640
And, you know, things could disappear off of Netflix

14:08.640 --> 14:10.480
at any given moment, like,

14:10.480 --> 14:13.000
oh, House is here today, now it's gone.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.920
Yeah, there was talk of them removing Friends

14:14.920 --> 14:17.000
and people went crazy about that.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
It's really all about the rights.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
You know, each different one of these streaming services

14:20.000 --> 14:21.680
wants to have that exclusive content.

14:21.680 --> 14:24.200
And so if, for some reason, CBS did the calculation

14:24.200 --> 14:25.640
and said, you know, we make more money,

14:25.640 --> 14:27.960
if we take Star Trek off of Netflix, they could do it.

14:27.960 --> 14:29.840
I don't know why culturally this has become okay.

14:29.840 --> 14:33.240
It's like, oh, Catcher in the Rye is no longer available.

14:33.240 --> 14:34.680
What?

14:34.680 --> 14:36.880
Yeah, it's a weird, like it makes the product inconsistent.

14:36.880 --> 14:39.120
And it seems like it's going to drive piracy.

14:39.120 --> 14:39.960
Yeah.

14:39.960 --> 14:41.200
It's a worse situation

14:41.200 --> 14:43.600
than we were in with discs 10 years ago.

14:43.600 --> 14:44.440
Yeah.

14:44.440 --> 14:45.400
You know, because if I have a disc on my shelf,

14:45.400 --> 14:48.040
I know that I'm gonna have that disc on my shelf.

14:48.040 --> 14:48.880
Well, I now don't,

14:48.880 --> 14:50.440
because I've ripped them all and put them in Plex.

14:50.440 --> 14:52.040
Well, that's the person who does that

14:52.040 --> 14:53.960
is the person who is the most advantaged now.

14:53.960 --> 14:56.160
People who have pirated and created a huge content

14:56.160 --> 14:59.160
or like me, I bought like all of the Star Trek stuff

14:59.160 --> 15:00.640
on Blu-ray when it came out on Blu-ray,

15:00.640 --> 15:02.520
bought it all on DVD and each time I've ripped it

15:02.520 --> 15:04.600
and I'm just sort of done doing that too.

15:04.600 --> 15:05.720
And just getting exhausted by it.

15:05.720 --> 15:06.560
Yeah.

15:06.560 --> 15:07.400
So you got a plague server.

15:07.400 --> 15:08.880
How much storage is that on?

15:08.880 --> 15:11.560
I think it's only about 20 terabytes, give or take.

15:11.560 --> 15:13.880
So it's not, you know, exorbitant,

15:13.880 --> 15:17.600
but there's also like production VM backups

15:17.600 --> 15:19.000
and some other things there.

15:19.000 --> 15:24.000
We need a leaderboard of different guests, Plex storage.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.400
You know, like the top gear lap board.

15:25.400 --> 15:26.240
Yeah.

15:26.240 --> 15:27.080
We should have that with that.

15:27.080 --> 15:27.920
That would be.

15:27.920 --> 15:29.400
Well, if you don't mind software defined storage,

15:29.400 --> 15:30.560
I could allocate a pool here.

15:30.560 --> 15:33.640
I mean, we could probably go like up into the petabyte range.

15:33.640 --> 15:34.480
Ooh.

15:34.480 --> 15:35.720
That'd be pretty high quality board.

15:35.720 --> 15:36.560
Okay.

15:36.560 --> 15:39.360
Windows just shut straight to the top.

15:39.360 --> 15:40.200
I love it.

15:40.200 --> 15:42.600
It's gonna be hard to beat that for a while.

15:42.600 --> 15:44.000
Just coming back to your Home Assistant,

15:44.000 --> 15:45.120
when I say Home Assistant,

15:45.120 --> 15:47.840
I mean the Python project that's all about home automation.

15:47.840 --> 15:48.680
Oh yeah.

15:48.680 --> 15:50.440
But you clearly mean something different.

15:50.440 --> 15:51.280
Yeah, no.

15:51.280 --> 15:54.920
Well, I wanna tie all of that in

15:54.920 --> 15:57.360
because the Python Personal Assistant

15:57.360 --> 15:59.920
is also about things like, you know,

15:59.920 --> 16:02.080
for a while I had a scanner by the door.

16:02.080 --> 16:04.560
And so like I could, like I got mail

16:04.560 --> 16:06.440
and I could just feed it through the scanner

16:06.440 --> 16:07.560
and it looks at the image.

16:07.560 --> 16:08.960
Like I don't have to tell it what it is.

16:08.960 --> 16:11.320
It knows, like it knows the time of day

16:11.320 --> 16:13.520
and it knows this looks like an electric bill

16:13.520 --> 16:15.000
and OCR is good enough

16:15.000 --> 16:17.160
that it'll just categorize that online.

16:17.160 --> 16:19.680
So like if you've ever used OneNote or Evernote

16:19.680 --> 16:21.120
or something like that online

16:21.120 --> 16:23.320
and you organize everything temporally,

16:23.320 --> 16:24.280
you can just put that there,

16:24.280 --> 16:26.160
tag it electric bill, whatever.

16:26.160 --> 16:27.800
And then I don't have to think about organizing it.

16:27.800 --> 16:29.080
It just does it for me.

16:29.080 --> 16:29.960
Those kinds of things,

16:29.960 --> 16:31.720
like a lot of people put a lot of work

16:31.720 --> 16:34.480
into organizing those aspects of their lives.

16:34.480 --> 16:35.520
Technology can do it,

16:35.520 --> 16:38.480
but nobody's really doing it in terms of like a product.

16:39.600 --> 16:41.760
I can see that being super valuable for you as an RVer

16:41.760 --> 16:45.920
to have a PO box or something with an AI system

16:45.920 --> 16:47.760
or machine learning system sorting this mail.

16:47.760 --> 16:48.680
That's something I've thought about.

16:48.680 --> 16:50.480
Cause there's some services where humans will do it,

16:50.480 --> 16:52.000
but it's quite a bit.

16:52.000 --> 16:52.840
It's quite a bit.

16:52.840 --> 16:55.320
Yeah, my mother-in-law in England sorts my British mail.

16:55.320 --> 16:57.560
See, I need one of those.

16:57.560 --> 16:58.400
Yeah.

16:58.400 --> 16:59.840
Just scan it, get it in the computer.

16:59.840 --> 17:02.880
And that kind of stuff is really easy to automate

17:02.880 --> 17:03.720
at the command line.

17:03.720 --> 17:05.040
I mean, just a little bit of Python

17:05.040 --> 17:06.760
and a little bit of image recognition

17:06.760 --> 17:08.520
and even like the barcode recognition,

17:08.520 --> 17:10.760
there's some really good optical barcode recognition

17:10.760 --> 17:11.920
libraries out there.

17:11.920 --> 17:14.400
You'd be surprised what you can bang out in a weekend.

17:14.400 --> 17:15.480
Really?

17:15.480 --> 17:17.640
And some of that though,

17:17.640 --> 17:19.760
does sound like it relies on some service.

17:19.760 --> 17:21.560
Like at some point you have to have something

17:21.560 --> 17:24.160
that's intelligent enough to sort and store this stuff.

17:24.160 --> 17:26.000
Well, you can still do all of that locally

17:26.000 --> 17:28.200
because you can sort of tag it yourself.

17:28.200 --> 17:30.880
I mean, it's one of the reasons why I have the Tesla V100s

17:30.880 --> 17:34.280
is I wanna do that also with like the video component.

17:34.280 --> 17:36.840
And I think that they're like OpenCV

17:36.840 --> 17:39.520
and some of the open source libraries now are good enough

17:39.520 --> 17:41.680
that you can train your own neural network

17:41.680 --> 17:42.640
to do these things.

17:42.640 --> 17:44.480
And I've got the old data set

17:44.480 --> 17:45.680
so that I can just be like,

17:45.680 --> 17:48.640
here is the last three years of electric bills.

17:48.640 --> 17:51.680
This is what an electric bill looks like, just do it.

17:51.680 --> 17:52.520
That is like that.

17:52.520 --> 17:55.040
So there's compelling reasons in that argument.

17:55.040 --> 17:56.760
There's compelling reasons to start capturing now

17:56.760 --> 17:59.320
even if you don't have the recognition system in place yet.

17:59.320 --> 18:02.240
Yeah, and Python is also really easy to automate.

18:02.240 --> 18:04.360
And so like some of the same web technologies

18:04.360 --> 18:07.120
we use for QA and QC, things like,

18:07.120 --> 18:08.360
it's not Phantom JS anymore

18:08.360 --> 18:10.040
because Phantom JS is on its way out,

18:10.040 --> 18:13.040
but you can do browser automation and look for things.

18:13.040 --> 18:15.840
And so you can like automate the login thing

18:15.840 --> 18:16.920
for the electric company

18:16.920 --> 18:19.040
because like you can get an electronic version

18:19.040 --> 18:21.160
of your bill now, but it changes a little bit.

18:21.160 --> 18:22.840
And sometimes the system is inaccessible

18:22.840 --> 18:25.120
and sometimes you can't get more than six months of bills

18:25.120 --> 18:26.480
and blah, blah, blah.

18:26.480 --> 18:28.840
You can just automate that and have it log in and do stuff.

18:28.840 --> 18:29.760
And then if it can't log in

18:29.760 --> 18:31.000
cause they changed the website or whatever,

18:31.000 --> 18:32.400
then you can have it notify you to be like,

18:32.400 --> 18:35.080
hey, I couldn't download the bill or whatever.

18:35.080 --> 18:36.560
Or I couldn't find the amount that was due

18:36.560 --> 18:39.600
cause they changed the name of the div or whatever it is.

18:39.600 --> 18:40.640
And that's not even AI.

18:40.640 --> 18:44.560
That's just your good old fashioned

18:44.560 --> 18:47.520
web dev quality control workflow.

18:47.520 --> 18:48.520
Sure.

18:48.520 --> 18:50.800
So you said, when I started asking you

18:50.800 --> 18:52.640
about your home setup, you said you do keep it kind of lean.

18:52.640 --> 18:54.720
Is that almost a philosophical thing?

18:54.720 --> 18:57.040
Yeah, I don't really like data storage.

18:57.040 --> 18:59.440
Like the data storage that I have,

18:59.440 --> 19:02.080
I have files that go back to like the nineties,

19:02.080 --> 19:05.920
but other than storage and replicas,

19:05.920 --> 19:09.120
I used to have one full rack at home,

19:09.120 --> 19:13.000
but by and large between virtual machine consolidation

19:13.000 --> 19:15.720
and just not wanting to do the maintenance for it,

19:15.720 --> 19:18.840
it's really become super, super consolidated.

19:18.840 --> 19:20.240
Like all these little experiments

19:20.240 --> 19:22.640
and all these other little things, they run in containers.

19:22.640 --> 19:24.640
And right now my home setup is using Docker,

19:24.640 --> 19:28.720
but everything at work pretty much is,

19:28.720 --> 19:31.120
almost everything has moved to Kubernetes

19:31.120 --> 19:33.280
cause Kubernetes on bare metal has also gotten a lot better

19:33.280 --> 19:35.160
in the last six months or so.

19:35.160 --> 19:37.880
And so because everything is containerized,

19:37.880 --> 19:40.200
I have much better separation of the stuff that's mine

19:40.200 --> 19:41.840
that I want to hang on to and stuff

19:41.840 --> 19:44.200
that's just a transient thing that I put together

19:44.200 --> 19:46.120
to try to deal with whatever it is.

19:46.120 --> 19:47.000
Are you the sort of guy,

19:47.000 --> 19:48.760
cause you mentioned a few of your servers

19:48.760 --> 19:52.480
have Proxmox on them and a few of them have ESXi at home.

19:52.480 --> 19:53.320
What do you do?

19:53.320 --> 19:55.440
Are you bare metal at home with just containers on there

19:55.440 --> 19:56.360
or VMs or?

19:56.360 --> 19:58.520
At home, it's actually Beehive.

19:58.520 --> 20:00.560
So yeah, I mean.

20:00.560 --> 20:01.600
Okay, tell us why.

20:01.600 --> 20:04.720
Cause Chris just did a double take on that one.

20:04.720 --> 20:06.480
I wanted to experiment with it,

20:06.480 --> 20:08.360
but I didn't trust it with production workloads yet.

20:08.360 --> 20:09.280
Fair enough.

20:09.280 --> 20:10.720
So.

20:10.720 --> 20:11.560
Good way to do that.

20:11.560 --> 20:14.100
Yeah, I mean, it's like, okay, will this actually run?

20:14.100 --> 20:15.720
And I think that's part of why some of the things

20:15.720 --> 20:19.000
are broken I think is cause it was like,

20:19.000 --> 20:21.440
oh, I probably, I don't know if this was ready for that.

20:21.440 --> 20:22.720
I don't know if maybe.

20:22.720 --> 20:26.200
So Beehive is what the KVM equivalent for BSD?

20:26.200 --> 20:27.040
Yep.

20:27.040 --> 20:27.860
From, yeah, okay.

20:27.860 --> 20:29.600
So that answers the OS you're running then.

20:29.600 --> 20:31.800
Yeah, that was an actually that started out

20:31.800 --> 20:34.240
as a free BSD installation that,

20:34.240 --> 20:37.360
or I mean a free NAS installation that became free BSD.

20:37.360 --> 20:39.560
And so that one became free BSD unwillingly.

20:39.560 --> 20:42.760
Like it was free BSD or it was free NAS.

20:42.760 --> 20:45.960
And then they did that upgrade that had like the web GUI.

20:45.960 --> 20:48.640
That actually like, I feel really bad for that developer

20:48.640 --> 20:50.880
because that was actually a brilliant interface

20:50.880 --> 20:51.720
and it was great.

20:51.720 --> 20:52.560
And it was exactly the right idea.

20:52.560 --> 20:54.320
It was necessary too, but boy.

20:54.320 --> 20:57.560
But the inertia of everything else, it was just impossible.

20:57.560 --> 20:58.400
Yeah.

20:58.400 --> 20:59.240
And I hope they bring that back

20:59.240 --> 21:01.440
cause that was actually a good idea, but.

21:01.440 --> 21:03.680
I do believe actually they are working on a new one.

21:03.680 --> 21:05.240
That went wrong for me.

21:05.240 --> 21:07.640
And then so then it became free BSD.

21:07.640 --> 21:08.480
It's funny.

21:08.480 --> 21:10.920
My free NAS systems are no longer free NAS systems either.

21:10.920 --> 21:12.120
I went a little more extreme.

21:12.120 --> 21:15.360
I moved them to Fedora, which was much more of a process.

21:15.360 --> 21:17.040
The level one server, that's what we did.

21:17.040 --> 21:17.880
Really?

21:17.880 --> 21:18.700
Yeah.

21:18.700 --> 21:20.800
I mean, once it's ZFS, the data is safe

21:20.800 --> 21:23.240
and then you just got to get it working on Fedora.

21:23.240 --> 21:24.620
I thought that's what you were going to say, by the way.

21:24.620 --> 21:26.480
I thought you were going to say you had Fedora at home.

21:26.480 --> 21:30.400
In some cases, ZFS on Linux is now ahead of the BSD fork.

21:30.400 --> 21:31.240
Yeah.

21:31.240 --> 21:32.480
Hasn't that been something to watch?

21:32.480 --> 21:33.440
It has, yeah.

21:33.440 --> 21:34.360
It's been a lot of fun.

21:34.360 --> 21:35.600
Have we got memory compression yet?

21:35.600 --> 21:37.160
That's the thing I'm waiting for.

21:37.160 --> 21:40.000
If they do, it's not in any of my systems.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.640
Well, Chris has a direct line to Alan Jude.

21:41.640 --> 21:43.280
We can find that.

21:43.280 --> 21:44.360
Alan, add that.

21:44.360 --> 21:45.280
No, he's, yeah.

21:45.280 --> 21:47.520
He is actually really involved with it these days.

21:47.520 --> 21:49.160
I think that is a feature that he added.

21:49.160 --> 21:51.800
I just don't know where it's available yet.

21:51.800 --> 21:56.760
But the memory arc compression, data set compression thing,

21:56.760 --> 21:58.880
that is going to be a game changer.

21:58.880 --> 22:00.400
So you're all ZFS at home as well?

22:00.400 --> 22:01.280
Yeah.

22:01.280 --> 22:02.600
It's the only file system I trust.

22:02.600 --> 22:03.160
Really?

22:03.160 --> 22:03.640
Yeah.

22:03.640 --> 22:05.320
So how do you square off?

22:05.320 --> 22:07.600
Because at home, a lot of people, I mean,

22:07.600 --> 22:10.360
I'm looking around this room full of hard drives.

22:10.360 --> 22:12.120
And to paint a picture for people,

22:12.120 --> 22:14.920
we're in Wendell's office today.

22:14.920 --> 22:18.800
And it's just, it's Willy Wonka for nerds, this place.

22:18.800 --> 22:20.960
It's like, it's amazing.

22:20.960 --> 22:22.280
But for a lot of people, they want

22:22.280 --> 22:24.840
to add one or two hard drives a year to their system

22:24.840 --> 22:26.080
and stuff like that.

22:26.080 --> 22:28.200
One of the biggest issues I face at home,

22:28.200 --> 22:31.480
certainly with using ZFS, is that expansion,

22:31.480 --> 22:33.120
the lack of flexibility.

22:33.120 --> 22:34.600
What do you think about that?

22:34.600 --> 22:38.040
So I ran up against that myself.

22:38.040 --> 22:39.880
I mean, you remember, my home server

22:39.880 --> 22:42.240
is an ITX system that's only got six three and a half inch

22:42.240 --> 22:42.920
hard drive bays.

22:42.920 --> 22:44.880
It's the Fractal Node 304.

22:44.880 --> 22:50.120
And so I started out with, I think, three terabyte drives.

22:50.120 --> 22:52.780
And then I bought three eight terabyte drives.

22:52.780 --> 22:56.920
So it was two VDEVs of RAID Z1.

22:56.920 --> 22:58.740
So one drive could die.

22:58.740 --> 23:05.400
But I realized that when I was putting the eight terabyte

23:05.400 --> 23:07.620
drives in, and that was when eight terabyte drives were

23:07.620 --> 23:08.780
new and kind of expensive.

23:08.780 --> 23:11.200
And it's like, I don't want to buy just one drive,

23:11.200 --> 23:14.360
because losing eight terabytes of information

23:14.360 --> 23:16.000
would be a huge pain.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.680
And RAID 1 is not economical enough,

23:18.680 --> 23:21.980
because I have to buy twice as much to have the redundancy.

23:21.980 --> 23:24.480
But if I get three drives, it literally

23:24.480 --> 23:27.860
splits the middle of cost and risk.

23:27.860 --> 23:28.920
And so it's like, all right, I'll

23:28.920 --> 23:30.360
get three eight terabyte drives.

23:30.360 --> 23:32.000
So I got three eight terabyte drives.

23:32.000 --> 23:33.680
And I was just going to add it as a VDEV

23:33.680 --> 23:36.800
so that I could have six plus 16.

23:36.800 --> 23:38.080
And that would be pretty good.

23:38.080 --> 23:40.240
But then as I was doing that, I was like, well, wait.

23:40.240 --> 23:44.720
I could probably just set up another zpool

23:44.720 --> 23:46.880
and move everything off of the old one

23:46.880 --> 23:49.760
and then have the free slots and just keep doing this three

23:49.760 --> 23:50.640
drive square dance.

23:50.640 --> 23:53.840
Because at home, at most, I would

23:53.840 --> 23:55.880
have like four or five hard drives.

23:55.880 --> 23:58.360
And so is it unreasonable economically for me

23:58.360 --> 24:00.280
to buy four or five hard drives at a time

24:00.280 --> 24:02.960
for doubling my storage every time?

24:02.960 --> 24:05.200
And it's like, as long as the march of technology

24:05.200 --> 24:07.080
continues, probably not.

24:07.080 --> 24:09.800
I think that is the exact calculation I make with CFS.

24:09.800 --> 24:12.480
If I'm willing to buy two or three drives at a time,

24:12.480 --> 24:15.120
then it's a perfect fit for me for expansion.

24:15.120 --> 24:17.720
And I think you've just got to make that math calculation.

24:17.720 --> 24:19.000
And you've decided because of the rate

24:19.000 --> 24:21.240
you want to add drives, it might be just too much.

24:21.240 --> 24:23.120
And you also want to do mismatched drives,

24:23.120 --> 24:24.500
don't you, like ones you take out of production

24:24.500 --> 24:25.160
and put in there?

24:25.160 --> 24:26.700
Well, that's an important consideration.

24:26.700 --> 24:28.960
With the VDEV calculations and things like that,

24:28.960 --> 24:31.760
you have to pretty much run the same size,

24:31.760 --> 24:34.680
same make, same brand, ideally, performance-wise,

24:34.680 --> 24:36.480
of drives in each VDEV.

24:36.480 --> 24:38.520
So I use a merger FS.

24:38.520 --> 24:41.920
And basically, it's JBOD plus SnapRaid for parity.

24:41.920 --> 24:43.720
Because a lot of my data sets are just

24:43.720 --> 24:48.160
very large static files that you write once, read a few times.

24:48.160 --> 24:50.320
But I can imagine if you're doing bursty workloads,

24:50.320 --> 24:54.800
like VM storage or any kind of database work,

24:54.800 --> 24:57.200
you might run up against some limits.

24:57.200 --> 25:00.240
Because you mentioned something about Optane today

25:00.240 --> 25:01.680
whilst we were talking.

25:01.680 --> 25:03.900
I mean, I've heard Linus Tech Tips talk about this.

25:03.900 --> 25:07.240
And I just don't really know what it does.

25:07.240 --> 25:09.120
Eventually, it should be cheaper than Flash.

25:09.120 --> 25:11.640
It's one of those technologies that is really good.

25:11.640 --> 25:13.600
It seems like it's less complicated than Flash.

25:13.600 --> 25:15.220
But we're entering an era where you've

25:15.220 --> 25:17.520
got like five or six bits per cell with Flash.

25:17.520 --> 25:20.060
And so the density is going to be hard to compete with there.

25:20.060 --> 25:24.640
But as I understand the manufacturing for Optane,

25:24.640 --> 25:28.880
it's basically a 3D phase change thing.

25:28.880 --> 25:31.120
It's just a couple of sheets of silicon

25:31.120 --> 25:33.000
with a phase change layer between them.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.920
I'm grossly oversimplifying.

25:34.920 --> 25:37.440
But that type of manufacturing seems

25:37.440 --> 25:40.000
like it would be orders of magnitude simpler

25:40.000 --> 25:42.400
than NAND Flash manufacturing.

25:42.400 --> 25:44.860
And then you add in the fact that the throughput is not

25:44.860 --> 25:45.400
there yet.

25:45.400 --> 25:47.560
Well, you can fix that by adding more devices.

25:47.560 --> 25:51.520
But the latency is about halfway between NAND Flash and DRAM.

25:51.520 --> 25:53.120
And so that's one of the reasons I

25:53.120 --> 25:57.080
think Intel is pushing Optane as a DRAM alternative.

25:57.080 --> 25:58.800
But the fly in the ointment for them

25:58.800 --> 26:02.700
there is that AMD has shown up and said, we don't really care.

26:02.700 --> 26:04.680
You want to run non-volatile memory?

26:04.680 --> 26:05.200
No problem.

26:05.200 --> 26:07.760
You want to run 8 terabytes of memory on a two-socket system?

26:07.760 --> 26:08.280
No problem.

26:08.280 --> 26:08.680
We don't care.

26:08.680 --> 26:09.720
Whatever you want to do.

26:09.720 --> 26:11.320
And so Intel's like, oh, man, we've

26:11.320 --> 26:13.960
got these separate SKUs for more memory.

26:13.960 --> 26:15.920
Darn, I mean, oh, we were going to try

26:15.920 --> 26:18.560
to do some market segmentation there or something like that.

26:18.560 --> 26:20.160
Because some of those large databases,

26:20.160 --> 26:22.840
these companies will pay any amount of money

26:22.840 --> 26:24.640
to make their database run faster,

26:24.640 --> 26:27.520
because it literally translates into more money for them.

26:27.520 --> 26:29.660
And so having the database run from Optane,

26:29.660 --> 26:31.680
whether implemented as memory as DRAM

26:31.680 --> 26:35.120
or implemented as a storage device,

26:35.120 --> 26:40.120
enables those kinds of workloads in a way that the DRAM can't.

26:40.120 --> 26:42.820
But Samsung and other companies have

26:42.820 --> 26:45.400
done a lot of work on their NAND devices

26:45.400 --> 26:47.880
to hide a lot of the latency, very efficient caching

26:47.880 --> 26:51.420
algorithms, mixing flash types on a particular device,

26:51.420 --> 26:56.000
and those kinds of things really solve

26:56.000 --> 26:58.120
the problem for a lot of workloads,

26:58.120 --> 27:01.320
but not the workloads where the companies are willing to pay

27:01.320 --> 27:04.080
just obscene amounts of money.

27:04.080 --> 27:06.760
And so I think that is one place where ZFS could improve

27:06.760 --> 27:09.900
a whole lot is much more intelligent caching

27:09.900 --> 27:11.080
for some of those workloads.

27:11.080 --> 27:14.280
I mean, you get the ZIL and the L2 arc,

27:14.280 --> 27:16.600
but it's still the case that just adding

27:16.600 --> 27:18.760
a whole bunch more memory is generally

27:18.760 --> 27:23.280
better than more L2 arc.

27:23.280 --> 27:27.600
And so we're in a situation now where you can get Optane

27:27.600 --> 27:29.740
or as a DIMM.

27:29.740 --> 27:32.520
So you're literally, quote unquote, adding more RAM.

27:32.520 --> 27:34.920
Or you can get Optane as a storage device,

27:34.920 --> 27:38.160
and then you're adding RAM on disk.

27:38.160 --> 27:41.880
I'm seeing videos where people are building entirely

27:41.880 --> 27:44.000
flash-based servers now.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.440
So the actual storage array is as fast now

27:46.440 --> 27:48.040
as the caches used to be.

27:48.040 --> 27:49.040
Yeah.

27:49.040 --> 27:50.160
Which is insane.

27:50.160 --> 27:52.160
Yeah, some of that, especially for video editing,

27:52.160 --> 27:54.640
the random scrub ability is really good.

27:54.640 --> 27:59.320
Although my little setup with its scrappy NAND flash

27:59.320 --> 28:02.440
and 128 gigs of memory and spinning rust

28:02.440 --> 28:05.720
with an intelligent and tiering cache policy,

28:05.720 --> 28:08.440
I would put up against a lot of those flash servers.

28:08.440 --> 28:10.960
A lot of the flash servers, especially the DIY servers,

28:10.960 --> 28:14.160
like the jellyfish all flash server, for example,

28:14.160 --> 28:17.280
I think that the software is just too dumb.

28:17.280 --> 28:20.120
Because my old school NetApp disk

28:20.120 --> 28:23.280
shelves with an intelligent tiering system for video

28:23.280 --> 28:26.960
editing will match the performance of an all flash

28:26.960 --> 28:30.040
storage while being orders of magnitude less expensive

28:30.040 --> 28:31.120
for bulk storage.

28:31.120 --> 28:33.800
Is that custom software they designed to figure that out?

28:33.800 --> 28:37.080
No, I think a lot of the enterprise software

28:37.080 --> 28:38.880
for tiered storage has already solved this problem

28:38.880 --> 28:39.520
a long time ago.

28:39.520 --> 28:42.680
We just haven't seen anybody apply it in this space.

28:42.680 --> 28:45.360
I'm working with the Inmodus guys

28:45.360 --> 28:47.880
to try to figure out a way we can demonstrate it.

28:47.880 --> 28:50.840
Because the Inmodus product on Linux is actually quite good.

28:50.840 --> 28:52.920
You can go in and tag files and be like,

28:52.920 --> 28:54.960
this is part of the fast tier, this is part of the fast tier,

28:54.960 --> 28:56.560
this is part of the fast tier.

28:56.560 --> 28:57.680
And it'll do it.

28:57.680 --> 28:59.640
So if you combine, like for a video editor,

28:59.640 --> 29:01.960
if you combine your video ingest workload

29:01.960 --> 29:06.040
with a little bit shell scripting, basically.

29:06.040 --> 29:07.920
So I'm going to ingest videos from the camera.

29:07.920 --> 29:09.360
It's like, oh, we probably need those

29:09.360 --> 29:10.840
to be part of the fast tier.

29:10.840 --> 29:13.200
And then you look at A time, and it's like, oh,

29:13.200 --> 29:15.800
those probably should definitely be part of the fast tier.

29:15.800 --> 29:17.200
Or you just give an editor control.

29:17.200 --> 29:20.560
Like an editor can go create an empty text file in a folder

29:20.560 --> 29:23.000
to be like, make this project hot.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.760
And then you do that on a Friday, and you come in Monday,

29:25.760 --> 29:27.480
and the system will have automatically,

29:27.480 --> 29:29.680
it's like, oh, I need to make everything in this folder part

29:29.680 --> 29:31.280
of the fast tier, and just do it.

29:31.280 --> 29:33.560
That's like five lines of shell scripting.

29:33.560 --> 29:36.800
But I'm 100% sure that that is going

29:36.800 --> 29:40.080
to be as fast as a quote unquote all flash storage solution.

29:40.080 --> 29:41.200
Interesting.

29:41.200 --> 29:43.160
That makes a huge difference, it sounds like.

29:43.160 --> 29:44.560
That is really cool.

29:44.560 --> 29:46.440
So I've seen stuff like that.

29:46.440 --> 29:49.800
My day job is working with OpenShift, a Kubernetes

29:49.800 --> 29:52.160
enterprise distro.

29:52.160 --> 29:54.680
And I see a lot of stuff in there around storage classes,

29:54.680 --> 29:58.440
about how you can specify a flash array for this workload

29:58.440 --> 29:59.720
and a spinning.

29:59.720 --> 30:02.760
So this sounds like a really poor man's version.

30:02.760 --> 30:05.720
Well, not necessarily poor man's, but yeah,

30:05.720 --> 30:07.760
if it works, great.

30:07.760 --> 30:10.360
Yeah, you can do it at the individual folder level, too,

30:10.360 --> 30:11.280
which is really cool.

30:11.280 --> 30:13.240
I want to implement some of this stuff for my Proxmox setup

30:13.240 --> 30:17.760
now, so we'll have to share a Git repo or something.

30:17.760 --> 30:19.320
It would be a lot of fun, yeah.

30:19.320 --> 30:20.960
So I wanted to shift gears a little bit

30:20.960 --> 30:23.000
and talk maybe a bit more about younger Wendell,

30:23.000 --> 30:24.840
if that's OK.

30:24.840 --> 30:27.680
I'm interested to know a little bit about what

30:27.680 --> 30:30.640
got you interested in technology in the first place.

30:30.640 --> 30:32.440
What was your first, can you remember,

30:32.440 --> 30:35.200
what was your first computer?

30:35.200 --> 30:41.120
It was probably a LaserPow 8086, or possibly

30:41.120 --> 30:42.280
a Tandy 286.

30:42.280 --> 30:44.960
So the LaserPow was like a Luggable,

30:44.960 --> 30:51.000
and the Tandy was like a business machine,

30:51.000 --> 30:52.600
but it had problems.

30:52.600 --> 30:53.920
It needed to be repaired.

30:53.920 --> 30:56.760
And so the thing that you have to understand

30:56.760 --> 31:02.280
is where I grew up was super poor and 10 years in the past.

31:02.280 --> 31:05.800
So a lot of the technology, I have fond memories

31:05.800 --> 31:12.240
of the IBM XT, and the PC6300, and the AT&T PC6300,

31:12.240 --> 31:16.840
which is really amazing, and the Tandy TL2, and even the TRS-80.

31:16.840 --> 31:18.440
But a lot of these computers were not

31:18.440 --> 31:22.920
current when I was using them, because a lot of businesses

31:22.920 --> 31:25.760
would donate the, there were still tax loopholes.

31:25.760 --> 31:27.560
And so it's like their garbage computers

31:27.560 --> 31:30.480
would end up in poor schools and in the poorer

31:30.480 --> 31:31.760
parts of the country.

31:31.760 --> 31:34.520
And so I got to play with a lot of that stuff,

31:34.520 --> 31:36.600
but also because it was garbage, I

31:36.600 --> 31:40.160
wasn't afraid to tinker with it and break it worse.

31:40.160 --> 31:42.880
But more often than not, I could actually fix it.

31:42.880 --> 31:46.560
So there was a guy that ran a junk store,

31:46.560 --> 31:49.000
and he knew that I had a knack for fixing things.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
Not just computers, but other stuff.

31:51.000 --> 31:54.880
And so he had somebody come and pick me up every weekend

31:54.880 --> 31:57.520
and in summers and would bring me to the junk store.

31:57.520 --> 32:00.080
And so I would work on fixing stuff at the junk store.

32:00.080 --> 32:03.760
So he would buy the return truck from Sears.

32:03.760 --> 32:05.640
You know the thing on Amazon now that's really popular?

32:05.640 --> 32:06.920
It's like, oh, I bought $1,000.

32:06.920 --> 32:08.640
They're just random returns from Amazon.

32:08.640 --> 32:13.240
So you used to do that in the late 80s, early 90s.

32:13.240 --> 32:16.560
You would do that tractor trailer at a time with Sears,

32:16.560 --> 32:17.800
and you'd bid on it.

32:17.800 --> 32:19.560
And so he would do that, and then there

32:19.560 --> 32:21.800
would invariably be random technology on there.

32:21.800 --> 32:23.800
And it's like, oh, look, I fixed this fax machine.

32:23.800 --> 32:25.800
And he's like, great, let's sell it at the junk store.

32:25.800 --> 32:27.200
He's like, oh, look, I fixed this other thing.

32:27.200 --> 32:29.500
And it's like, oh, yeah, let's sell it at the junk store.

32:29.500 --> 32:34.320
So between that and the school stuff, it was a lot of fun,

32:34.320 --> 32:36.240
learning how to fix the stuff and put it together

32:36.240 --> 32:37.560
and that kind of thing.

32:37.560 --> 32:39.680
I got that there was a Tandy that

32:39.680 --> 32:41.520
had bad sectors on the hard drive.

32:41.520 --> 32:43.840
And so if you just did a regular DOS install,

32:43.840 --> 32:46.920
the DOS install would fail because it

32:46.920 --> 32:48.360
was near the beginning of the disk,

32:48.360 --> 32:50.920
but it wasn't at the very beginning of the disk.

32:50.920 --> 32:53.720
And so I had to figure out how to low level format the thing,

32:53.720 --> 32:55.440
and there was no manual for it.

32:55.440 --> 33:00.160
And it was just completely our local library had a book

33:00.160 --> 33:03.600
called The Wyn Roche Hardware Bible, which had like,

33:03.600 --> 33:06.080
I mean, I get a feel for the photographers.

33:06.080 --> 33:08.280
It's like, you get the photographer for the book,

33:08.280 --> 33:09.800
and this guy shows up.

33:09.800 --> 33:11.840
And it's like, we need a super technical book

33:11.840 --> 33:16.180
about component level repair, like the IBM PC XT.

33:16.180 --> 33:19.120
And it's just like some old balding guy.

33:19.120 --> 33:20.760
And it's like, OK, well, let's just

33:20.760 --> 33:23.400
put a keyboard in their lap and take a picture of it.

33:23.400 --> 33:25.520
And so that is the Wyn Roche Hardware Bible.

33:25.520 --> 33:28.000
And so I carted that thing around for years.

33:28.000 --> 33:29.960
Well, you'd love to get your hands on a copy of that again.

33:29.960 --> 33:30.840
Still have it here somewhere.

33:30.840 --> 33:31.360
Do you?

33:31.360 --> 33:31.860
Yeah.

33:31.860 --> 33:32.360
Good.

33:32.360 --> 33:33.160
Good for you.

33:33.160 --> 33:35.920
That's great, holding on to that kind of stuff.

33:35.920 --> 33:37.920
That guy was clever to snatch you up.

33:37.920 --> 33:40.160
Sounds like he made a good chunk of change off of you.

33:40.160 --> 33:41.160
Yeah.

33:41.160 --> 33:41.720
Yeah.

33:41.720 --> 33:43.400
That was a lot of fun.

33:43.400 --> 33:46.680
Later, I went to work for the company that fixed computers

33:46.680 --> 33:48.840
for the school system.

33:48.840 --> 33:50.120
So that was fun.

33:50.120 --> 33:52.200
The thing that got their attention,

33:52.200 --> 33:55.360
so IBM Model M keyboards, if you're really hard on them,

33:55.360 --> 33:58.240
will develop a short in the cable.

33:58.240 --> 34:00.200
So it's like foil wrapped.

34:00.200 --> 34:02.200
I mean, typical IBM engineering, it's

34:02.200 --> 34:07.760
like the rubberized plastic and then a hard plastic,

34:07.760 --> 34:09.960
almost like a plastic bag plastic,

34:09.960 --> 34:12.960
but the hard cellophane, and then foil,

34:12.960 --> 34:14.680
and then individual wires.

34:14.680 --> 34:19.160
And if you yank the cord, it will break the insulation

34:19.160 --> 34:21.120
on the wires inside the foil.

34:21.120 --> 34:23.280
And then they'll touch the foil and short out.

34:23.280 --> 34:26.720
There's a green through-hole fuse

34:26.720 --> 34:30.000
on the motherboard that will blow whenever

34:30.000 --> 34:32.320
you have a keyboard that has that type of a short.

34:32.320 --> 34:33.740
And so at a school, it's like, we

34:33.740 --> 34:34.680
don't want to replace the keyboard.

34:34.680 --> 34:35.880
This keyboard almost works.

34:35.880 --> 34:37.040
And the keyboard will work as long

34:37.040 --> 34:38.720
as the keyboard is in the right spot.

34:38.720 --> 34:40.000
And then it mysteriously stops working.

34:40.000 --> 34:41.000
And it's like, that's weird.

34:41.000 --> 34:42.840
Let me try this keyboard on another computer.

34:42.840 --> 34:44.920
It's like, oh, it's not working on this one either.

34:44.920 --> 34:46.880
Now, both of those have a blown fuse.

34:46.880 --> 34:50.920
So the replacement cost for a school that could not afford it

34:50.920 --> 34:53.200
was like $900 for the motherboard.

34:53.200 --> 34:53.840
Oh, my goodness.

34:53.840 --> 34:56.080
And it was like, dude, we can just replace the fuse.

34:56.080 --> 34:59.880
And they're like, one, if you're a student, what are you doing?

34:59.880 --> 35:03.800
Two, OMG, WTF, BBQ.

35:03.800 --> 35:05.600
And I was like, all right, well, just hire me.

35:05.600 --> 35:06.680
Why can't I work for you?

35:06.680 --> 35:09.640
And it was like lots of angry adults yelling at one another

35:09.640 --> 35:11.600
and then like, all right, we're going to hire you.

35:11.600 --> 35:14.000
Had a very similar experience in my school years.

35:14.000 --> 35:15.000
Very similar to that.

35:15.000 --> 35:16.680
That's great.

35:16.680 --> 35:18.800
The adults were very uncomfortable with it at first.

35:18.800 --> 35:20.300
They didn't know what to do about this kid that

35:20.300 --> 35:21.560
was coming around fixing stuff.

35:21.560 --> 35:23.680
Very, very uncomfortable.

35:23.680 --> 35:26.360
There were two of us at the school, so I had a cohort.

35:26.360 --> 35:29.000
And he's doing really well and all the stuff that he's doing.

35:29.000 --> 35:34.000
But the really amazing thing with that is we deployed Linux.

35:34.000 --> 35:37.440
By the time I was a senior in high school, Linux was just bare.

35:37.440 --> 35:39.680
It was like 0.92.

35:39.680 --> 35:41.920
What was the job it was doing?

35:41.920 --> 35:43.200
Network address translation.

35:43.200 --> 35:46.280
That's what I had my Linux blacks do, and also a proxy server.

35:46.280 --> 35:48.160
So the school had a token ring.

35:48.160 --> 35:51.560
And the new computers that were coming in were Ethernet.

35:51.560 --> 35:56.600
And so there was just no internet access on the school with Ethernet.

35:56.600 --> 35:59.380
Yeah, I mean, Ethernet was, well, it was kind of dumb

35:59.380 --> 36:01.680
because they were like, well, 16 meg is faster on paper.

36:01.680 --> 36:03.640
So that's got to be better than 10 meg Ethernet.

36:03.640 --> 36:05.760
And I was just like, what?

36:05.760 --> 36:06.400
What?

36:06.400 --> 36:07.560
No.

36:07.560 --> 36:09.720
Me and the other student, between the two of us,

36:09.720 --> 36:13.840
we sort of figured out how we could do IP translation between a network.

36:13.840 --> 36:15.960
It was called IP masquerading at the time.

36:15.960 --> 36:21.440
And so the Ethernet computers could get on the token ring network

36:21.440 --> 36:23.840
through NAT, basically.

36:23.840 --> 36:26.800
And that was a lot of fun.

36:26.800 --> 36:28.440
That was a crazy amount of fun.

36:28.440 --> 36:32.560
And the guy that was in charge of all of the technology for the entire state

36:32.560 --> 36:34.800
came, and he's like, this is good.

36:34.800 --> 36:38.200
What you've done, it's fine, but without annoyance.

36:38.200 --> 36:42.720
But we can't have an unsupportable solution in schools.

36:42.720 --> 36:44.760
It'll cost too much money.

36:44.760 --> 36:47.520
No one here has any idea how this works except for you.

36:47.520 --> 36:49.360
And we can't do this.

36:49.360 --> 36:51.080
We have to buy the proper equipment.

36:51.080 --> 36:53.240
And it's like, all right, well, we can have a bake sale or something.

36:53.240 --> 36:55.000
What is the proper equipment to do this?

36:55.000 --> 36:55.960
And he explained what it was.

36:55.960 --> 36:57.080
And I was like, all right, how much is that?

36:57.080 --> 37:00.400
And he's like, well, I think the state has a contract for that for like $10,000.

37:00.400 --> 37:01.960
And I was like, $10,000?

37:01.960 --> 37:05.320
And I was like, if a couple of kids can do this with junk computers,

37:05.320 --> 37:07.860
don't you think it's worth your time to learn how to do this?

37:07.860 --> 37:12.280
Because you'd save $10,000 to school, and you've got a lot of schools.

37:12.280 --> 37:13.520
His ears turned red.

37:13.520 --> 37:14.440
Yeah, it's so funny.

37:14.440 --> 37:18.520
And so we had a situation where the schools were very, very excited

37:18.520 --> 37:21.560
to implement 802.11b, I think it was.

37:21.560 --> 37:22.680
It was two megabits.

37:22.680 --> 37:25.000
And that's how they did all of the interlinks between the schools.

37:25.000 --> 37:27.600
Because otherwise, they have to pay for lines from the telcos,

37:27.600 --> 37:28.960
which were just ridiculous.

37:28.960 --> 37:30.520
And when they put the whole wireless network in,

37:30.520 --> 37:33.080
nobody thought to segment up the different schools.

37:33.080 --> 37:35.280
So it was one flat network.

37:35.280 --> 37:35.780
Oh my god.

37:35.780 --> 37:36.720
What could go wrong?

37:36.720 --> 37:39.080
So like print jobs were routing through the central district building

37:39.080 --> 37:41.160
and back out to the schools over a two meg link.

37:41.160 --> 37:46.320
And so we built a series of Debian-based servers

37:46.320 --> 37:47.960
to essentially solve the problem.

37:47.960 --> 37:49.760
And Microsoft found out.

37:49.760 --> 37:53.680
This is back in the days of Monopoly.

37:53.680 --> 37:56.120
So they were rough players.

37:56.120 --> 37:58.620
And they assembled a meeting with the adults.

37:58.620 --> 38:00.520
And they came in playing hardball and said,

38:00.520 --> 38:01.560
we want you to use this thing.

38:01.560 --> 38:02.520
It's called NT5.

38:02.520 --> 38:03.920
It's in development right now.

38:03.920 --> 38:06.840
And it can do exactly what that Linux box is doing.

38:06.840 --> 38:10.320
You want us to put a beta in when this is working just fine?

38:10.320 --> 38:11.240
Yeah.

38:11.240 --> 38:12.840
It was a really interesting time.

38:12.840 --> 38:13.600
It was so early.

38:13.600 --> 38:14.560
It was the same story.

38:14.560 --> 38:16.640
It's an unsupportable product.

38:16.640 --> 38:19.200
And now it would be just totally normal.

38:19.200 --> 38:22.820
What's really funny is that all of those computers are IBM computers.

38:22.820 --> 38:26.680
And IBM has literally become the poster child of Linux support.

38:26.680 --> 38:29.960
Yeah, oh boy, there's some irony there too, huh?

38:29.960 --> 38:32.600
Something, something, red hat.

38:32.600 --> 38:36.800
Alex will say nothing for this segment of the show.

38:36.800 --> 38:37.560
Jeez.

38:37.560 --> 38:39.920
Yeah, really, when you look back at it like that,

38:39.920 --> 38:41.920
you did have to kind of fight some misconception.

38:41.920 --> 38:43.400
I don't know misconceptions is the right word.

38:43.400 --> 38:44.800
But you had to push through some of that.

38:44.800 --> 38:47.080
Yeah, they did eventually replace that system

38:47.080 --> 38:51.960
with a solution based on Microsoft proxy server.

38:51.960 --> 38:53.880
Was that on NT4 at the time?

38:53.880 --> 38:54.400
Probably.

38:54.400 --> 38:55.480
And it was garbage.

38:55.480 --> 38:56.800
It was unadulterated garbage.

38:56.800 --> 38:58.320
That's what they wanted us to use at first.

38:58.320 --> 38:59.980
And we said, no, it's too much garbage.

38:59.980 --> 39:01.700
We tried NT4 first.

39:01.700 --> 39:03.760
And then they're, OK, we'll use the beta, use NT5,

39:03.760 --> 39:05.080
which ended up being Windows 2000.

39:05.080 --> 39:06.200
They never even called it NT5.

39:06.200 --> 39:07.960
But back then, that's what they were calling it.

39:07.960 --> 39:09.880
The people, like the state level people,

39:09.880 --> 39:12.200
even came in to test it and oversee it

39:12.200 --> 39:14.560
and make sure everything went smooth with the replacement.

39:14.560 --> 39:17.080
And they had test systems set up side by side.

39:17.080 --> 39:18.680
And it was like, here's the old system.

39:18.680 --> 39:20.880
Look how much faster and better the new system is.

39:20.880 --> 39:24.120
And just loading web pages was dramatically slower.

39:24.120 --> 39:25.960
It was astonishingly slower.

39:25.960 --> 39:27.120
Yeah.

39:27.120 --> 39:29.320
Could you picture doing what you do now

39:29.320 --> 39:31.120
in that era of the internet?

39:31.120 --> 39:32.240
No.

39:32.240 --> 39:33.880
I would have probably gone to like,

39:33.880 --> 39:35.400
they would have had to put me away for homicide

39:35.400 --> 39:37.480
because it was just like, this is like the dumbest

39:37.480 --> 39:38.400
thing I've ever seen.

39:38.400 --> 39:39.080
Yeah.

39:39.080 --> 39:39.640
Yeah.

39:39.640 --> 39:41.600
We've lost our ability to think clearly.

39:41.600 --> 39:42.080
Yeah.

39:42.080 --> 39:45.800
It's pretty incredible that the internet enables you

39:45.800 --> 39:48.800
in quote unquote rural Kentucky to operate

39:48.800 --> 39:51.040
an internet-based business that you have,

39:51.040 --> 39:53.160
was it quarter of a million subscribers or something

39:53.160 --> 39:56.160
on YouTube these days?

39:56.160 --> 39:58.480
The technology really has changed the world.

39:58.480 --> 40:01.400
And I think humanity is only really just beginning

40:01.400 --> 40:05.520
to grasp what the internet's capable of with remote work.

40:05.520 --> 40:08.880
Well, Arthur C. Clarke said that, and not in this generation,

40:08.880 --> 40:11.720
but next generation, referring to us, I think,

40:11.720 --> 40:14.120
that probably in our lifetime, we

40:14.120 --> 40:18.120
will see a sea change reversal in the value of property.

40:18.120 --> 40:21.040
City property will become worth less than rural property

40:21.040 --> 40:23.440
because you could work anywhere.

40:23.440 --> 40:24.760
As long as you have a good link.

40:24.760 --> 40:26.320
Yeah.

40:26.320 --> 40:29.040
And I feel like that is also, that meta story

40:29.040 --> 40:31.560
is what is driving us to do this show now,

40:31.560 --> 40:33.600
is the home solutions, like you touched on,

40:33.600 --> 40:36.200
are as good as what Google can run in their data centers now.

40:36.200 --> 40:36.840
Yeah.

40:36.840 --> 40:38.120
That's mind blowing.

40:38.120 --> 40:40.280
Well, I mean, it's a question of resources.

40:40.280 --> 40:43.840
Like Google wants you to have the tiniest slice ever.

40:43.840 --> 40:45.520
I mean, like even a serverless slice.

40:45.520 --> 40:47.440
Like Amazon wants you to come up with a way

40:47.440 --> 40:49.880
to do everything serverlessly because their margin

40:49.880 --> 40:52.640
on the serverless thing is better even than EC2.

40:52.640 --> 40:55.120
And their margins are 100% on EC2.

40:55.120 --> 40:57.560
I mean, I've worked on some very large projects.

40:57.560 --> 41:03.120
And trying to figure out the Amazon cost to the business,

41:03.120 --> 41:05.480
when you've always got a background hum of customers,

41:05.480 --> 41:07.080
and then you have like the burstiness,

41:07.080 --> 41:09.640
and you're going to rely on Amazon for the burstiness,

41:09.640 --> 41:13.040
your costs on Amazon is 100% of what you would

41:13.040 --> 41:15.360
pay for bare metal hardware.

41:15.360 --> 41:17.480
The question is just optimizing the curve

41:17.480 --> 41:21.120
so that you're going to have a little bit overbuilt

41:21.120 --> 41:23.760
in for your local infrastructure.

41:23.760 --> 41:29.320
But for those things that are like two standard deviations

41:29.320 --> 41:32.160
away from average, then you can rely on Amazon.

41:32.160 --> 41:33.760
And it makes economic sense.

41:33.760 --> 41:37.240
And yeah, you're paying Amazon money hand over fist.

41:37.240 --> 41:39.880
But you didn't have to do the capital investment

41:39.880 --> 41:40.680
for the other part.

41:40.680 --> 41:42.280
So it probably makes sense.

41:42.280 --> 41:43.840
And I think that's Amazon's, or I think

41:43.840 --> 41:45.240
that's even Netflix's model.

41:45.240 --> 41:46.000
That is the thing.

41:46.000 --> 41:46.880
It's a CapEx.

41:46.880 --> 41:47.840
It's not CapEx.

41:47.840 --> 41:48.800
It's OpEx.

41:48.800 --> 41:50.760
So people can write it off every quarter instead

41:50.760 --> 41:53.280
of one big chunk up front.

41:53.280 --> 41:55.780
And I've actually managed to get quite a lot of traction

41:55.780 --> 41:58.840
with C-level people with that kind of math

41:58.840 --> 42:01.080
and say to them, look, it's going to save you money.

42:01.080 --> 42:02.960
You can write this off every quarter instead.

42:02.960 --> 42:06.080
So just before we sat down, Wendell,

42:06.080 --> 42:08.520
you mentioned something about Eric S. Raymond having

42:08.520 --> 42:12.440
an invitation-only basement that he can do hacker projects in.

42:12.440 --> 42:15.680
Yeah, this is always something that's really fascinating.

42:15.680 --> 42:18.800
And something I've been on the lookout for real estate-wise

42:18.800 --> 42:21.600
is I'm not in a position to do it now.

42:21.600 --> 42:25.160
But he always tells us stories about people

42:25.160 --> 42:28.640
that have come to stay with him and not really exactly

42:28.640 --> 42:31.240
mentors, but people that would be

42:31.240 --> 42:34.760
able to work on their projects in his basement.

42:34.760 --> 42:37.560
So his basement is basically a separate apartment.

42:37.560 --> 42:40.200
But you have access to Eric Raymond upstairs.

42:40.200 --> 42:42.240
So it's like, I want to work on this thing,

42:42.240 --> 42:45.160
or I want to learn about this thing, or I want to do whatever.

42:45.160 --> 42:48.680
So it's a really sort of fascinating situation.

42:48.680 --> 42:50.360
It's like a little mini maker's lab

42:50.360 --> 42:52.080
with Eric Raymond upstairs.

42:52.080 --> 42:53.080
Yeah, yeah.

42:53.080 --> 42:56.680
I mean, that kind of thing is just fascinating.

42:56.680 --> 43:01.480
So that kind of thing might work really well in terms

43:01.480 --> 43:03.760
of doing some other stuff.

43:03.760 --> 43:05.340
Well, before we go, Wendell, we should

43:05.340 --> 43:06.640
do the obligatory pluggy plugs.

43:06.640 --> 43:08.000
I bet everybody knows where to find you,

43:08.000 --> 43:10.360
but where should we send people?

43:10.360 --> 43:12.520
Level in the number one text.com.

43:12.520 --> 43:14.680
And then you can get to Twitter or the YouTube channel

43:14.680 --> 43:15.720
or wherever from there.

43:15.720 --> 43:16.880
I mean, it doesn't really matter.

43:16.880 --> 43:19.440
You can just Google level one Wendell, and it's fine.

43:19.440 --> 43:20.240
It works.

43:20.240 --> 43:21.800
I've tested that.

43:21.800 --> 43:23.520
That's Tech Wendell on Twitter, I believe.

43:23.520 --> 43:24.280
Yes, yes.

43:24.280 --> 43:25.920
We'll put a link to that in the show notes as well.

43:25.920 --> 43:26.560
Yeah.

43:26.560 --> 43:28.360
Wendell, thanks not only for joining us,

43:28.360 --> 43:29.440
but thanks for hosting us, too.

43:29.440 --> 43:30.480
It's been a great tour.

43:30.480 --> 43:30.880
Oh, no worries.

43:30.880 --> 43:31.520
It's been interesting.

43:31.520 --> 43:33.160
I hope it was worth the eight-hour drive.

43:33.160 --> 43:34.080
I mean, ehh.

43:34.080 --> 43:35.760
Well, thanks to the snake, it was.

43:35.760 --> 43:36.440
The snake was.

43:36.440 --> 43:37.400
The snake made it all.

43:37.400 --> 43:37.960
Yeah.

43:37.960 --> 43:39.520
Oh, you haven't seen Rule.

43:39.520 --> 43:41.560
We could go about three hours off the beaten path,

43:41.560 --> 43:43.200
and then you'll be like, holy smokes.

43:43.200 --> 43:43.720
Really?

43:43.720 --> 43:44.000
Yeah.

43:44.000 --> 43:44.640
Could that be something?

43:44.640 --> 43:45.360
It's scary.

43:45.360 --> 43:49.680
