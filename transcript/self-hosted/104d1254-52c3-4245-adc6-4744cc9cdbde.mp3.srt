00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,720
Coming up on Self-Hosted 11, we might have found the perfect light switch for home automators,

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,080
we jump into the hardware corner and talk about shuckin' drives,

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:13,120
and we give you our favorite self-hosting blogging platforms, plus we answer some of your questions.

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm Chris.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,880
And I'm Alex.

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,320
And this is Self-Hosted.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,440
Welcome back to Self-Hosted.

8
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,400
There's so much we could talk about today, Alex,

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,800
but I think we'll start with what you love to do, and that's shuckin' and jivin'.

10
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,640
So our very own Joe Ressington reached out to me this week asking about hard drives.

11
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,440
Which should he buy?

12
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,320
Is shucking a hard drive good?

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,600
Is it dangerous?

14
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,720
Is he going to lose data?

15
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,480
Is it an inferior quality product?

16
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,600
I don't know, Chris, you have some experience with this, don't you?

17
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,880
I do, thanks to you.

18
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:48,080
I actually was a shuck-avoider for quite a while because I thought,

19
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:51,760
maybe they're like slammin' their lower grade discs in these cases

20
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,040
and sellin' them to suckers at the average consumer box store.

21
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,000
And that kind of crossed my mind, and the other thing was is,

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,680
until I understood a little bit better,

23
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,400
I thought there was some sort of flashing or even soldering required

24
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,680
to get these things to work in my actual PC.

25
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,960
Which is still kind of the case, at least when it comes to modification,

26
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,720
but it's not as dramatic as I thought.

27
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,840
Nowhere near, no.

28
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,720
So I actually have 14 of these things down in my basement.

29
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,640
I bought 14 of these drives because I had a budget for drives,

30
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,000
and then the Easy Stores came out and they were half the price.

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,360
So I was gonna buy seven, so I just spent the same amount of money

32
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,120
and got twice the amount.

33
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,360
So for those of you that aren't familiar,

34
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:36,480
Western Digital make a series of hard drives called the My Book,

35
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,520
the Easy Store, there's a couple of other different names for them.

36
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,440
But essentially what they are is just a standard SATA hard drive

37
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:50,400
in a USB external enclosure that they sell for anywhere from

38
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:57,760
120 pounds for eight terabytes to 14 terabytes for $200 in the States.

39
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,320
You can get them in Europe on Amazon and stuff like that.

40
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,280
So it's not just a US only deal, this one, which is great.

41
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,360
The thing that I really like about these drives is they're just a great value.

42
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,160
The price per terabyte is as low as you're gonna get

43
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,520
without going to a shingled storage drive,

44
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,840
like one of the Seagate Barracudas or something.

45
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,880
I got a trick for you and I'll put a link in the show notes to this sucker.

46
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:25,040
I subscribed to a Telegram hard drive sales channel that just broadcasts,

47
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:30,080
it's just a read only channel that just broadcasts crazy great deals in storage.

48
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,840
Here's a great one, eight terabytes for 114 US greenbacks.

49
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,400
Wow.

50
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,360
Yeah, that's not bad.

51
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,160
That's great.

52
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,600
And so I'll put a link to this in the show notes

53
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,960
because you can watch this and then strategically order.

54
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,960
And I think that's a great way to go about with storage

55
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,120
is order before you need it and just be strategic.

56
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,000
But the one thing we didn't touch on, well, there's two things really.

57
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,120
But the one thing that I think maybe it's just worth your opinion on

58
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,520
is what do you think about the quality of these disks

59
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:59,040
versus buying something that's bare, maybe it costs a little bit more,

60
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,640
but it's just that product, it's not inside some sort of enclosure.

61
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,240
Hard drive brand loyalty is definitely a thing.

62
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:13,680
I've had drives from Seagate, from HGST Hitachi, from Western Digital.

63
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,600
Samsung back in the day used to make hard drives before that got swallowed up.

64
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,560
And honestly, I've had them all fail.

65
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,800
I've had all different manufacturers, I've all had a failure on all of them.

66
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,640
And I've purchased maybe 25 or 30 drives over the last decade.

67
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,560
So I don't actually have a huge amount of brand loyalty.

68
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,360
The only one that really stands out for me as being much poorer than the rest is Seagate.

69
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,920
Now, if you were to go to Backblaze and look at their quarterly hard drive stats,

70
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,920
they have some really interesting data because over the last decade or so,

71
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,840
they've actually published a series of statistics

72
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,640
from all the consumer grade hard drives they've been buying.

73
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,560
So their backup service is actually running on top of consumer grade hard drives,

74
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,360
or it certainly was.

75
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,840
I think that's slowly moving into the enterprise type drives

76
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,440
now that their business is expanding.

77
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,040
But it's really the only major data point on the internet that we have besides

78
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:14,960
people on Reddit going, oh yes, my Western Digital drives died three times in six months.

79
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,760
I'm with you though on the brand loyalty thing.

80
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,520
I've had them all die on me.

81
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:24,640
And a lot of times I've found the ones to be in these enclosures to be fairly reliable.

82
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,880
I think the manufacturer may expect them for it.

83
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,000
So I actually don't think there's much of an issue of quality.

84
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,480
Is he going to have to solder though?

85
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,520
No, definitely not.

86
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,360
I say definitely not.

87
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,440
And I really hope I'm not proved wrong by the time it arrives.

88
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,120
My experience has been with all of the easy stores that I've purchased

89
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,800
is you need a couple of guitar picks and a couple of credit cards to pop the case open.

90
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,960
No damage, takes maybe five minutes for the first time

91
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,400
and then a couple of minutes once you learn where the clips are.

92
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,240
And inside there's a small board about the size of a credit card again

93
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:04,720
that has a USB 3 to SATA conversion chip on it and you unplug that.

94
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,800
And then you have a normal SATA hard drive.

95
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,520
Now there is one thing to be aware of.

96
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:17,280
These drives respect the 3.3 volt pin reset in the SATA power standard.

97
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:23,040
Now a lot of people have said that this is a way for Western Digital to quote unquote,

98
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,480
gimp the drives, but it's actually part of the SATA spec.

99
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,640
So in the data center, when you have racks and racks of these things,

100
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,440
you don't want to have to go and pull a drive physically.

101
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,400
You want to be able to reset that drive remotely.

102
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,160
And the way that these drives do that is as soon as they detect some power

103
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,000
on the 3.3 volt rail is they power cycle.

104
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,080
The drive itself basically reboots.

105
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,680
Now most consumer power supplies have a 3.3 volt rail on them.

106
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:57,360
Thus, if you try and connect a consumer power supply to this drive,

107
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,920
it will think it's constantly trying to be rebooted.

108
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,880
Therefore, your BIOS won't see the drive.

109
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,040
There's a very, very simple fix.

110
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:11,200
Get a tiny, tiny piece of captain tape, maybe two, three, four millimeters across.

111
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,240
Put that over the leftmost pins on the power port of the hard drive and it will just work.

112
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:24,960
Now I actually made custom power cables and omitted the 3.3 volt cable completely from mine.

113
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:30,320
I bought some Cable Matters SATA power splitters off Amazon and just did it that way.

114
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,760
It took me half an hour.

115
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,840
But there's a great video from the Bite My Bits YouTube channel,

116
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,680
which we'll have a link to in the show notes,

117
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:43,600
about how to put captain tape over the power pins of your EasyStore hard drive.

118
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,840
One thing to note with these is you don't always know exactly

119
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,640
what type of disk you're getting in the enclosure.

120
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,880
I mean, you might know if you get a Western Digital enclosure

121
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,960
that it's going to be a Western Digital drive or a Seagate or whatever,

122
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,720
but you don't necessarily know what type.

123
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:02,320
Western Digital like to sell you lots of very similar products

124
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,960
with lots of different colored stickers on the front.

125
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,320
So they have green for energy efficient drives.

126
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,560
They have blue for standard desktop.

127
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:16,800
Red is NAS and then they have red pro, which is for NAS pros uses.

128
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,080
I don't really understand that one.

129
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,480
Yeah, not just regular NASs, but serious NASs.

130
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:28,400
Well, the difference is standard red is 5,400 RPM and red pros are 7,200 RPM.

131
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,000
Those red drives apparently have special firmware

132
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,440
that deals with TLER resets better for RAID users.

133
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,240
Give me a break, that sounds like marketing to me.

134
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,520
I mean, maybe.

135
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,960
Sometimes they lack features intentionally

136
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,960
just to make you buy something different.

137
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,960
I mean, that's not uncommon in the industry.

138
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,560
No shock, that's not like marketing, is it?

139
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,400
And there's purple for surveillance as well.

140
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,440
So obviously you need a different type of hard drive for surveillance

141
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,160
than you do for just storing movies or whatever.

142
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,800
Now, the drives that come inside these easy stores,

143
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,320
there's an awful lot of conjecture online as to what's in there.

144
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,840
The only thing we can be absolutely certain of

145
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,480
is that they're what are called white label drives.

146
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,840
Now, most people say that they are probably rebadged reds

147
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,120
or drives that were supposed to be a larger capacity

148
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,600
that didn't meet QC control.

149
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,400
And so they just, let's say it was gonna be a 14 terabyte drive

150
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,400
and only 11 terabytes was usable.

151
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,720
So they slapped a 10 terabyte sticker on the front of it.

152
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,920
And we have no real way of knowing, honestly,

153
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,000
but there's an awful lot of good information

154
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,240
over on the data hoarder subreddit

155
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,080
if you're curious about this sort of stuff.

156
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,600
Oh, that's a great resource.

157
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,960
I forget about that subreddit.

158
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,760
My thought was they wouldn't necessarily

159
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,920
wanna put low quality components in there

160
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,080
because that just is gonna create a support

161
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,520
and brand nightmare.

162
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,800
And a lot of people use these as backups,

163
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,840
have them just connect to the PC running 24 seven.

164
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,040
So they must take that into consideration.

165
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,320
Who really knows?

166
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,440
Right, and that's it.

167
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,560
You know, I don't really worry too much

168
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,880
about an individual hard drive failing anymore

169
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,920
because for me, an individual hard drive failing

170
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,880
is just an annoyance

171
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,720
because I have stuff backed up everywhere else.

172
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,080
Because I've been through that pain

173
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,400
of having a drive actually fail and losing stuff.

174
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,240
It's not something you wanna happen twice.

175
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:16,800
Yeah, I agree.

176
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,960
That's tricky though when budgets are tight

177
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,080
and the amount of data is a lot, it's tricky.

178
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,000
It's tricky when you wanna duplicate it.

179
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,320
So I can understand wanting to measure twice

180
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,000
and cut once.

181
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,760
While we're talking about hardware though,

182
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,000
I understand you got a device

183
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,920
that I have toyed with the idea of getting over the years

184
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,760
and it's the HD Home Run,

185
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,360
which I think is a pretty slick little device,

186
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,960
but I'm curious what your thoughts are.

187
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,280
Yeah, it's really interesting.

188
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,680
It's a network based TV tuner.

189
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,640
So effectively it has a TV tuner

190
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,320
and an ethernet jack on it.

191
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,000
It's about the size of maybe a deck of cards and a half.

192
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,520
That's a terrible way to measure something,

193
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,960
but it's not very big anyway.

194
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,840
I'm an old man.

195
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,880
Maybe a couple of CD cases stacked

196
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,320
on top of each other or something.

197
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,440
Now I'm really an old man

198
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,080
because I'm talking about optical media.

199
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:08,580
Yeah.

200
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,640
You know, it's about the size of a VHS,

201
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,000
you're saying there, Alex.

202
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,960
No, a Betamax.

203
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,560
That's before my time, I'll tell you what.

204
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,800
So I was wondering, you got,

205
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,000
cause there's different kinds, right?

206
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,320
But the HD Home Run is pretty famous for their network one.

207
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,320
And I'm really new to this whole area,

208
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,560
but it seems like you could also get ones

209
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,320
that like hook into the back of equipment.

210
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,160
There's a whole different kind.

211
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,720
I just got the one that has two tuners built into it

212
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,040
and receives over the air broadcasts.

213
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,360
I wanted a way to watch my local TV station

214
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,680
for news when there's like a hurricane coming

215
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,200
or, you know, stuff like that.

216
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,760
Cause YouTube TV is kind of expensive.

217
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,240
Yeah, it is.

218
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,160
So can I just go through your setup?

219
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,840
Do you have an antenna on the roof

220
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,880
or what's that setup like?

221
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,720
I went to Best Buy and spent $20 on a flat.

222
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,080
It's about the size of a sheet of A4 paper

223
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:03,760
and it sticks on the wall in the closet behind me.

224
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,800
And that wall is an outside facing wall.

225
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,040
So it's, you know, American houses are made of cardboard.

226
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:14,160
So it's no problem to get the signal through that wall.

227
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,960
I hope your home isn't made out of cardboard.

228
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,400
Compared to the brick and slate of a British house

229
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,440
is what I mean.

230
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,080
Yeah.

231
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,080
How far from the transmitter are you?

232
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:24,880
Did you look that up?

233
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,360
Yeah, it's on the south side of Raleigh

234
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,080
and I'm on the north.

235
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:31,040
So it's about 15 to 20 miles or so.

236
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,080
So it's a decent throw.

237
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,320
Now this thing, I was expecting to have to, you know,

238
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,920
go into Plex and then find the IP address of the HD Home Run

239
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,560
and then sign in and create an account

240
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,600
and do all this kind of stuff.

241
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,360
And so I plugged in the HD Home Run in the closet,

242
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,960
plugged it into the Ethernet jack,

243
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,200
downloaded the HD Home Run app on my phone.

244
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,080
And the instant, and I mean the instant I opened the app,

245
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,280
I was watching the NFL.

246
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,120
No account creation or?

247
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,400
I didn't have to configure.

248
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,640
I didn't have to scan, nothing.

249
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,160
It was wonderful.

250
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:02,960
That is really nice.

251
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,360
So it must be doing some sort of DNS magic there

252
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,560
so it can discover it.

253
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,320
Does Plex find it all right then too?

254
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,640
Plex has a live TV and DVR section in your server settings.

255
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,880
So you simply go into there,

256
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,560
click the button that says Add Device,

257
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,680
enter the IP address of the HD Home Run,

258
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,520
and then you're done.

259
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,200
It's unbelievably simple.

260
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,960
One of my favorite things to do in the RV

261
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:28,160
when I get to a new town is throw up the old antenna,

262
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,760
just throw up the old antenna, do a scan of all the local HD,

263
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,920
and just blast through the local television,

264
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,360
get a flavor of the area.

265
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,800
That's part of travel, isn't it?

266
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,200
Yeah.

267
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,360
We were in Wyoming this year at Yellowstone,

268
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,640
and I quite enjoyed watching the coal miners complaining

269
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,960
about how coal is a dying industry.

270
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,720
And I'm like, yep, it probably is.

271
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,280
Burning dead dinosaurs is not sustainable, go figure.

272
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,920
And as somebody who's kind of into production stuff,

273
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,000
I love watching the styles and all of that stuff.

274
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,640
So I've always wondered maybe if I put one in there

275
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,840
and, you know, just, I don't know, I love it.

276
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,440
And there's always that little news bulletin

277
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,960
about iguanas falling out of trees.

278
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,640
Did you see that about in Miami this morning?

279
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,880
It went down to like 40 or something overnight,

280
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,560
so everyone in Florida is freaking out.

281
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,760
That's the end of the world.

282
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,840
Yeah, the iguanas don't like that, that's for sure.

283
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,720
So first impressions, pretty good.

284
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,240
How long have you been running this thing?

285
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,840
A couple of weeks now, yeah.

286
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,200
I mean, we don't use it a whole bunch.

287
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,600
It's just there as a, oh, I want to watch the local NFL game

288
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,520
just to, you know, see what's going on.

289
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,960
I've got friends over or whatever.

290
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,840
I really do feel like I am not getting the value

291
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,520
from my YouTube TV subscription.

292
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,640
It's nice right now with all of the news that's going on.

293
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,400
So I've probably been using it more heavily

294
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,160
than I ever have before.

295
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,040
But for most of the year, once or twice a week,

296
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,960
I turn it on just to check something.

297
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,480
I can't stand live TV.

298
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,760
Yeah, so awful.

299
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,720
See, I got YouTube TV last year for the Formula One stuff

300
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,160
that's on ESPN, but the Formula One TV,

301
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,800
F1 TV stuff is getting a bit better.

302
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,800
You know, MotoGP is the gold standard

303
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,600
for that kind of thing, or the MLB one.

304
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,880
And Formula One's still got some catching up to do,

305
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,080
but it's getting there.

306
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,240
And YouTube used to be like 30 bucks,

307
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,480
and then it went to 40, and now it's like 50.

308
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,800
Yes, that's too much.

309
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,680
Well, Alex, congratulations.

310
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,520
I'll check in a little bit and see how you like it.

311
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:21,120
See how the DVR stuff works, all that kind of thing.

312
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,440
What do you say we talk about something that I got stuck,

313
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,840
I got stuck in like a time loop this week,

314
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,640
installing WordPress over and over and over again.

315
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,480
And it seems like you have spent some time

316
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,400
since we last got together thinking about

317
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,040
self-hosted blogging platforms like Ghost,

318
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,760
which I am intensely interested in.

319
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,960
I was deploying different WordPress scenarios

320
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,520
to kind of just get a feel for my different options.

321
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,520
So I just got out of this.

322
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,120
So I'm really fresh on all this stuff.

323
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,040
And I think I've walked away with a favorite,

324
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,240
depending on your usage.

325
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,440
I used to use WordPress quite a while ago.

326
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,000
The beginning of my open source journey, so to speak,

327
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,400
was writing down everything I was doing on my blog

328
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,080
so that I could remember how I did it.

329
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,160
So that next time I wouldn't have to go and Google,

330
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,000
you know, 15 different stack exchange

331
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,400
or stack overflow posts to figure out

332
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,000
how to compile a kernel and that kind of thing.

333
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,280
That then led into a few people noticing

334
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,360
what I was doing on the unraid side of things,

335
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,080
which led into the creation of linuxserver.io.

336
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,360
So I moved my personal blog from WordPress

337
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,880
to the linuxserver.io site.

338
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,560
And then Ghost came along

339
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,640
and I switched out the Linux server blog to Ghost,

340
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,640
probably 2014 or so.

341
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,080
And we imported all of the WordPress stuff back then

342
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,800
that I'd accumulated from my personal blog.

343
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,800
And there was a bunch of cruft in there,

344
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,240
some of which has been deleted,

345
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,360
some of which is still there.

346
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:48,480
And I think my favorite for a long-term simple solution

347
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:53,600
is Ghost because I've used it for probably five years,

348
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,720
maybe more at this point.

349
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,360
It's dead stupid simple.

350
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,280
It uses almost no resources.

351
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,760
They've constantly improved the product.

352
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,600
It's free.

353
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:08,720
They provide a Docker for me and it's just great.

354
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,720
You know, the interface is clean and simple.

355
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,080
The themes are pretty good.

356
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,480
I can now do galleries of images.

357
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,880
And it's a markdown editor.

358
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,000
What more do you want?

359
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,600
Yeah, that markdown aspect is what initially caught my attention.

360
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,200
It also checks a few boxes.

361
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,280
It's MIT licensed, so it's free.

362
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,800
It's coded in Node.js,

363
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,000
which is a server-side JavaScript engine.

364
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,200
So it's all essentially one big running application

365
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,880
on the server side, from my understanding.

366
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,720
And it also uses Ember.js as the admin client.

367
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,320
So there's the interface that's powered by that.

368
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,200
You get analytics, it's got all of that in there.

369
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,440
I was looking at WordPress simply because

370
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,200
I'm thinking about doing side podcasting as a creative outlet

371
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,560
and just want to have something that ties in really nicely

372
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,240
with some of that infrastructure.

373
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,640
And WordPress plugins are still the golden standard in that area

374
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,120
when you're working with podcast hosting services and whatnot.

375
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,960
It's all about the WordPress plugins.

376
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:08,320
However, I wonder if it wouldn't be worth rolling it myself

377
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,720
just to use something like Ghost.

378
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,360
Isn't WordPress really insecure though?

379
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,360
I think that's kind of unfair.

380
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,960
I mean, I think any large open source project has vulnerabilities.

381
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:22,960
I say, if you go WordPress, you go with a commitment to keep it current.

382
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:26,160
And you got to build your system in a way that allows it to stay update.

383
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,680
And if you can't keep it up to date,

384
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,920
you probably shouldn't be using WordPress.

385
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,080
Maybe you shouldn't be using Ghost either then, maybe.

386
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,240
Or hosted WordPress, I suppose.

387
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,320
I mean, let's be really frank about this.

388
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,440
Before I tell you what my solution is, I think it's really important

389
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,320
that we talk about the reality here.

390
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,920
Not only do you need to keep your CMS up to date,

391
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,760
but if you're hosting on a VPS,

392
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:52,160
you've got to be committed to some security practices like updates,

393
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,320
perhaps something like a firewall.

394
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,760
I think DigitalOcean actually make this so simple

395
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,760
that it's not any more complicated than doing a Squarespace, in my opinion.

396
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,120
Obviously, you need to understand a little bit about

397
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,120
Docker and maybe Docker Compose,

398
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,920
and understanding how to create a container.

399
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:14,720
But beyond that, if you can SSH and set up SSH keys and stuff like that,

400
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,400
I think, generally speaking, there's a few features that DO offer,

401
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,440
such as their firewall, their backups and snapshots,

402
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,840
and that kind of thing that make it a pretty safe option.

403
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:31,040
I've been hosting mine on DO since I started, so 2013, I think.

404
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:36,960
And just on the $5 a month droplet, and it's just been pretty reliable.

405
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,760
There's been a couple of minor outages, but it's been pretty good.

406
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,600
This go-around, I tried Linode.

407
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,080
I've always been following the company,

408
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,720
but was really happy with DigitalOcean.

409
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,680
This time around, I thought, you know,

410
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,520
if I'm doing a side project, doing a hobby thing,

411
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:54,240
I should make it totally separate, totally isolated from the JB stuff.

412
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,120
So I used this as an opportunity to try out Linode.

413
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,600
And I'm happy to say I was really happy with it.

414
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,520
And I'm happy to say I was impressed.

415
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,520
Performance is pretty good.

416
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,520
They have a lot of the same snapshotting

417
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,800
and automatic backup features that you'd come to expect.

418
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:13,280
And they'll let you add an SSH key at the time of spin up,

419
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,360
which I think is such a great feature.

420
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,720
Very valuable, yep.

421
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,240
It's the way to do this.

422
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,760
It is really the way to do this.

423
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,000
But they also have something else that DigitalOcean don't have.

424
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,200
And that is these stack scripts that the community writes

425
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,080
that then get voted on and you get a number of deployments.

426
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:37,200
And one that I noticed was OpenLightSpeed's WordPress stack script.

427
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,560
So I took a look at what they're doing here

428
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,240
and I thought, well, what's this about?

429
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,760
OpenLightSpeed is, I guess, at high level,

430
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,720
it's a NGINX Apache alternative.

431
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,120
And it is combined with a caching engine.

432
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,880
So it's a web server that works in conjunction with a cache

433
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,280
that runs in memory and they're aware of each other.

434
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,720
And then it's also working in conjunction

435
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,240
with a WordPress plugin.

436
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,200
So WordPress is aware of this cache

437
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,840
and uses that cache for its assets.

438
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,880
And this little plugin generates a static version of WordPress

439
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,600
and then puts the assets in the cache

440
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,640
and it makes it very fast.

441
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,480
It makes it so fast.

442
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,320
And this stack sets up an 1804 Ubuntu LTS system.

443
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,800
Statically hosted WordPress, huh?

444
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,840
They claim it's 300 times faster

445
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,360
than a standard WordPress install.

446
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,920
I don't know if that's true, but it's noticeably faster.

447
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,280
And the other thing that I really appreciate about this

448
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,000
is that script is all laid out for you to go through

449
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,520
because I also wanna make this point.

450
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,920
The other thing that was a little disappointing to see

451
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,760
is the most popular stack scripts

452
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:48,240
are the ones that install these really awful control panels

453
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,760
that are supposedly giving you one-click deployments.

454
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,680
Yes, I realize I just advocated for a script.

455
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,240
You have to just kind of take each with its own.

456
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,960
It's all sort of an individual basis.

457
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,600
But I wanna kind of caution against that.

458
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,840
If you're gonna take the step of hosting it yourself,

459
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,480
I strongly recommend you understand how to set it up.

460
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,920
Earlier when Alex was saying

461
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,600
you should probably know a little Docker compose

462
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,200
and how to set up a container,

463
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,040
that's his way of saying you should go

464
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,360
all the way through the process of installing the OS

465
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,720
and doing these in containers

466
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,080
so that way you can properly manage them

467
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,520
once you understand that.

468
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,280
And if that feels overwhelming to you

469
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,880
and there's nothing wrong with that,

470
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,080
and there's nothing wrong with that

471
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,360
because everybody's at a different level,

472
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,240
you may wanna look at hosting options

473
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,920
that manage some of that stuff for you

474
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,480
because it will become a nightmare.

475
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,800
It'll become something that you need to take care of

476
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,960
when you're super busy and you've got other stuff going on.

477
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,160
A family friend of mine

478
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,960
just had their business website hijacked.

479
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,920
It was on an old GoDaddy WordPress site

480
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,840
that GoDaddy doesn't auto-update.

481
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,360
They update the OS,

482
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,040
but the application level updates are on the customers.

483
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,440
And so their customers were getting sent

484
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,560
to a bogus pharmacy website

485
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,720
when they came to visit their website,

486
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,120
which is in the restaurant industry.

487
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,480
And it took them over a week to get it back

488
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,480
and getting me involved to help them recover it.

489
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,160
It's just updating their WordPress install

490
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,400
doesn't come on their mind frequently.

491
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,400
And I think it had been over nine, 10 months

492
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,760
since they'd done an update.

493
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,520
Yeah, if you're not that way inclined,

494
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,600
it's very easy to let that thing get out of hand.

495
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,080
Just think about the reality of what Chris just said.

496
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,160
If you've put your heart and soul into a blog

497
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:33,920
for six months, 12 months, years,

498
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,200
and it suddenly went away

499
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,360
and you didn't have a backup of that thing,

500
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,560
how would you feel?

501
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,760
And is that feeling worth a few bucks, maybe?

502
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,600
Well, Alex, this just might turn into a corner

503
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,960
because there's probably a lot of things

504
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,800
we could talk about, a lot of tips,

505
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,320
and the audience probably has a few ideas.

506
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,040
So if this is an area you'd like us to explore more,

507
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,040
they need to give us a nudge.

508
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,960
We need to come up with some other blogging platforms as well

509
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,240
because I know there's Jekyll,

510
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,000
I mean, there's hundreds, hundreds.

511
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,480
Yeah.

512
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,240
I like Ghost, you like WordPress,

513
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,440
but there are loads of others.

514
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,640
And feel free to let us know

515
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,520
because those are the two we have the most experience with,

516
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,080
but it doesn't necessarily mean they are the best.

517
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,280
I have a project off-grid update.

518
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,240
This Sunday, we head down to the Eugene, Oregon area

519
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,200
for the big install.

520
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,800
I've decided to go ahead with it.

521
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:22,240
Just a reminder, we're getting about 500 watts of solar installed.

522
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,920
But ultimately, another thing we're doing

523
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,480
is we're just redoing the entire factory setup

524
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,920
of the electrical system,

525
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:31,920
going from a modified sine wave to a pure sine inverter

526
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,560
and converter and a new charge controller,

527
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,840
upgrading the alternator,

528
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:40,320
putting all of the plugs in the RV on the system

529
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,640
instead of just about four or five of them.

530
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,760
So it'll be a whole house.

531
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,000
And then getting, I've been told,

532
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,440
thanks to our awesome audience

533
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,360
who's been sending me great information,

534
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,040
that it is very likely there will be a way

535
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:55,120
I can pull the data off of the Victron inverter unit

536
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,600
and bring it into Home Assistant and Grafana.

537
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,360
It seems like it's likely.

538
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,640
I don't have a clear path yet,

539
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,800
but the audience was all over it.

540
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,440
It's very good.

541
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,560
So you went for it, huh?

542
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,680
Good for you.

543
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,800
I'm very nervous.

544
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,920
I'm very nervous because this is the largest work

545
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,600
we've ever had done on the RV.

546
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,280
I got them to agree to walk me through

547
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,280
some of the work they're doing and explain it to me

548
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,120
and let me interview them,

549
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,360
which I might use for a future project,

550
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,400
and help me understand some of it.

551
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:29,920
So it's gonna be something like 15 to 20 hours of labor

552
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:32,560
on their part, plus them explaining

553
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,240
and letting me do interviews on top of that,

554
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,680
which they're doing that for free.

555
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,840
15 to 20 hours doesn't sound that bad.

556
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,280
Is that multiple people?

557
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,720
I assume.

558
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,440
That's great though.

559
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,720
That's gonna give you the capability

560
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,120
to do everything we talked about last episode then.

561
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,520
Yes, and the thing that, the risk I took

562
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,320
is they advised that I put more than 500 watts of solar

563
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,560
on there and I said to them, here's the thing.

564
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:57,120
I'm in the Pacific Northwest most of the time.

565
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,360
I've got a really big generator on board.

566
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,480
What if I kind of balanced it

567
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,840
and went a little more on the batteries

568
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,040
but supplemented with the generator?

569
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:03,440
We'll see.

570
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,720
I could be wrong.

571
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,160
So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna ask them

572
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,320
to wire it for more panels in the future.

573
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,240
So I can add them if I need to.

574
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,040
Super cool, man.

575
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,480
I'm so pleased with you for doing that.

576
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,920
It's a big decision.

577
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,640
Oh, stop.

578
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,720
It was, it was.

579
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,360
We'll see.

580
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,240
It's a lot of money

581
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,520
and it's your house going into the garage for how long?

582
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,800
For a week, for five days, for five days.

583
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,560
I have to live somewhere else.

584
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,520
Gotta clean the fridge out

585
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,800
because there's gonna be no power.

586
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,080
So I can't stay in it.

587
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,320
Gotta pack Levi up and I don't know,

588
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,000
maybe I'll sleep on the floor in the studio.

589
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,000
I think Levi would approve though

590
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,920
because it means he can go on lots of cool road trips.

591
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,920
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

592
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,200
He loves that stuff.

593
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,320
So how many times, Chris,

594
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,040
have you had a smart bulb in your life

595
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,840
and you've said to a guest in the studio or something,

596
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,400
okay, I have these cool bulbs,

597
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,480
don't use the light switch.

598
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,520
All you have to do is X, Y, Z.

599
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,160
Yeah, to the point where we even tried taping

600
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,560
over the light switches and wrote on the tape, don't use.

601
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,200
Yeah, we've all been there.

602
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,360
So I think I have a solution to this issue

603
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:11,840
and I wanna get to a bit of feedback from Primoj Kankar.

604
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,320
I really apologize if that's incorrect.

605
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,840
I think you nailed it.

606
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,440
Yeah, okay, well, we'll see.

607
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,160
Alan at jupiterbroadcasting.com if I'm wrong.

608
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,320
A classic.

609
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,960
The gist of the feedback is

610
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,760
I'm looking to get into some simple home automation.

611
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,200
Can you give me some pointers

612
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,600
of what I might need to buy and set up?

613
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,920
I want to do a smart light switch.

614
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,360
Do I need some kind of hub?

615
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,240
I've heard you talk about the Tekin plugs.

616
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,680
What sort of stuff do I need to know?

617
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,160
So I came across a really interesting device

618
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,600
this week called the Shelly.

619
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,000
The Shelly Cloud is the name of the company.

620
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,880
The one that I purchased was the Shelly 2.5.

621
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,680
Now this thing is about the size of an Oreo cookie.

622
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:59,520
So it's pretty small and it has in it two little relays.

623
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,760
This thing goes in the back of a light switch

624
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:08,480
and you wire it up to your 110 volt or 220 volt or whatever.

625
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,440
It goes on mains voltage, so be careful.

626
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,120
Please don't electrocute yourself

627
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,400
if you try and install this thing.

628
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,880
If you're not sure, consult a licensed electrician.

629
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,880
Okay, disclaimer out the way.

630
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,000
Now this thing, you can flash TAS motor onto it.

631
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,160
So I'm immediately in love with it.

632
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,080
It has some little headers on it

633
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,280
and the headers on it aren't the standard size

634
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,520
that you would normally have for like a breadboard.

635
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,640
A breadboard type device.

636
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,680
So you need to like strip a network cable or something

637
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,080
and then Jimmy rig that into your breadboard

638
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,480
and flash it with the FTDI adapter that way.

639
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,120
But once you've got TAS motor on this thing,

640
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,040
it's a case of just wiring it up to the switch

641
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,520
and then adding it in Home Assistant

642
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,760
like you would any other TAS motor device.

643
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,440
But where the real magic comes

644
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,480
is this thing lets me use the existing light switch

645
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:00,320
as well as having Wi-Fi control of the light bulbs.

646
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,200
Okay, that's awesome.

647
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,240
So you just pop open the light switch panel,

648
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,920
what, unwire the switch, wire the sucker in,

649
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,280
wire it all back and you're done?

650
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:11,840
Pretty much, yeah.

651
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,280
You gotta add a couple of extra wires

652
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:17,600
because the way this works is it disconnects the light switch

653
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:21,840
from the light itself, which sounds a bit counterintuitive.

654
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,360
But the relay inside the Shelly

655
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,440
is what does the switching on and off of the light.

656
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,320
That makes sense.

657
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,320
And there's some circuitry in this little thing

658
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,200
that detects when you flip the light switch physically

659
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,560
and then it also flips the relay inside the box

660
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,080
automatically when that happens.

661
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,160
But you could override it even with the switch down,

662
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,840
say if that's the off position traditionally,

663
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,240
you could still turn it on via Wi-Fi and Home Assistant.

664
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,560
The light switch just becomes a physical toggle.

665
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,640
It also works with three-way switches.

666
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,320
I think we call them two-way in Europe and three-way here.

667
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,560
But the other really great thing about this device,

668
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:56,240
besides the fact it works on 110 through 240 volt AC

669
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,760
is it works on 24 through 60 volt DC.

670
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:03,680
Yeah, yeah, that I'm noticing and thinking

671
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:06,480
this is how I could make my built-in lighting smart.

672
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,280
And the 2.5 in particular has energy monitoring

673
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,960
so you can feed that into your Grafana

674
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,000
and Home Assistant that way.

675
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,440
And I tell you what, it's a game changer.

676
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,960
You know, this house has like, I haven't even counted,

677
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,000
a lot of light switches.

678
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:25,040
These things cost about 25-ish dollars each.

679
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:28,240
And you know, what's the cost of a single smart bulb?

680
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,320
It's gonna be at least 20.

681
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,440
Oh, at least.

682
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,040
And it doesn't solve the light switch,

683
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,400
physical light switch problem.

684
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,280
It was when my mother-in-law came to stay last year

685
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,600
and I heard her saying, okay, Google,

686
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,280
turn off the in lights.

687
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,000
People don't know the names of your whatnots

688
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:44,640
and all of that.

689
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,400
And I've thought maybe I should put like a map

690
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,600
on the wall that explains this stuff.

691
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,400
But this just takes it completely out of the equation.

692
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:53,360
This is so elegant, it's beautiful.

693
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,200
I really wanna put this in the RV.

694
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,960
Alex, you're gonna help me put this in the RV.

695
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,600
We do like a project, pop them off, put them in there.

696
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,200
Well, we'll do some stuff like this

697
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,960
around Linux Fest Northwest, huh?

698
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,160
Oh yeah, this is so cool.

699
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,080
So it's the Shelly 2.5

700
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,640
and we will have a link to that in the show notes

701
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,640
and check out Alex's Twitter feed

702
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,560
for a picture of his install

703
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,920
if you wanna get an idea of what it looks like.

704
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,520
Maybe drop a link to that in the notes too.

705
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,600
At Ironic Badger on Twitter.

706
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,440
Yeah, they have a whole range of products.

707
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,480
I'm looking at this stuff.

708
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:24,960
They have some really cool products at shelly.cloud.

709
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,240
So, I mean, once this thing's been flashed,

710
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,080
it's yours forever too.

711
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,240
So you can just leave it in the wall forever.

712
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:32,740
Correct.

713
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,760
I love it.

714
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,040
They make some really cool stuff.

715
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:41,440
Energy monitoring, they make an RGBW Wi-Fi LED controller

716
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,680
so you don't have to make your own custom one of those

717
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,240
like I did.

718
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,200
Temperature and humidity sensors,

719
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,040
flood and temperature sensors.

720
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,360
I mean, honestly, the list is pretty amazing

721
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,720
and they've got a whole bunch of stuff coming out in the future.

722
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,760
Dr. Z's, that guy in the home assistant community,

723
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,560
the floating bald head dude, he loves these things

724
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,080
as does Rob from the hookup.

725
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,040
So there's a good community growing around it

726
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,600
and if it can run Tasmota,

727
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,760
I don't really care what Shelly do in five years.

728
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,600
It's mine now.

729
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,100
Thank you.

730
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,480
I just, I love that.

731
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,440
It's yours forever.

732
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,960
Well, until the device dies of natural causes.

733
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,920
Okay, so we got to do something a little different now.

734
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:24,720
So just remind yourself hosted.show slash contact

735
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,600
but we need to flip it around on the audience,

736
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,560
don't we Alex?

737
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,560
Yeah, it's a who wants to be a millionaire,

738
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,040
million dollar question, ask the audience time.

739
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,640
Yeah, let's see what they say.

740
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,560
Yeah, so I got my drum kit out finally

741
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:41,040
and I'm able to play drums in this new house

742
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,040
for the first time in 13 years.

743
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,440
So I'm super excited to be able to play drums again.

744
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:49,360
And one thing I'm looking for that as a teenager,

745
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,960
I really wanted my parents to be able to do

746
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,120
was listen to the music that I was drumming along to.

747
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,640
So they're not just hearing the blatting

748
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,960
of a drum with no context.

749
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,360
So one thing I'd like to try and do

750
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,040
and I hope the audience can come up

751
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,560
with a decent solution for this

752
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,800
is to pipe the music that I'm currently playing

753
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:08,800
from Spotify through the house whilst I'm drumming

754
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,320
so my wife can listen to it

755
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,360
and that can either go to a Chromecast audio.

756
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,400
I mean, it has to be in sync.

757
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,400
That's the thing, otherwise it's kind of pointless.

758
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,840
Maybe the Google Home Minis would be nice.

759
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,760
Again, sync might be tricky with that.

760
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,920
What's the source that's coming to your headphones?

761
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:24,960
What's the source of that?

762
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,120
At the moment, it's a pair of Bluetooth headphones.

763
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,240
You could solve the sync issue

764
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,120
by having you both listen to the same source potentially.

765
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:36,160
I would be willing, I think, to have a laptop next to me

766
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,640
and play the music from the laptop instead of my phone

767
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,480
and then use that to maybe route the audio

768
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,000
because I've got Linux everywhere in this house.

769
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,720
I can route audio through Pulse over the network, I think.

770
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:50,000
There's lots of different ways that I could do it,

771
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,360
but I'm just wondering if anybody else

772
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,400
has solved a similar type of problem and could let us know.

773
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,680
Yeah, that would be really cool.

774
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,560
And while we're at it,

775
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,000
I'd love to hear what people are using

776
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,720
for self-hosted Wikis and Notes app,

777
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,320
something that's nice to use with decent search,

778
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,080
that fuzzy style search,

779
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,800
and ideally, both Alex and I were thinking this one,

780
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,640
no database, ideally.

781
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,560
I really like my markdown system,

782
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:18,080
but it's not really approachable by the spousal unit

783
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,440
and she wants more search,

784
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,680
where this was more of a documentation,

785
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:24,800
and I realized she's using Evernote today

786
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,800
and I thought, gosh, I know I could fix,

787
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,400
I could solve that with something.

788
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,760
I just don't know quite what.

789
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,760
Yeah, I mean, I've tried Nextcloud Notes

790
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,000
with QO Notes and a bunch of other stuff.

791
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,720
I do like it, but I don't think it's perfect for her.

792
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,800
I think Nextcloud has a lot of great solutions,

793
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,720
but I would prefer not to have to run

794
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,480
all of Nextcloud to solve this.

795
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,520
Congratulations to them

796
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,840
on their Nextcloud Hub announcement, by the way.

797
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,560
It is one of the, it's like one of the classics

798
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,160
of the self-hosted applications now.

799
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,360
It's in that league.

800
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:52,880
It is, yeah.

801
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,720
Yeah, it's almost so big.

802
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,760
It's too big to fail,

803
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,120
so we almost don't mention it enough,

804
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,840
but Nextcloud is great and I use it every day.

805
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:03,040
Well, we've mentioned links and notes a lot,

806
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,800
but we haven't said where you can find them,

807
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,560
so we should probably do that real quick,

808
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:09,200
selfhosted.show slash 11.

809
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,800
And then what do you say we give a shout out

810
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,640
to our buddy Brent,

811
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,720
who's just cranking out these brunches.

812
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:15,680
Man's busy.

813
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:18,240
And they're delicious as well, those brunches.

814
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,400
He recently did one, he sat down with Jim Salter

815
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,800
of TechSnap and Ask Technica fame,

816
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,920
so be sure to give that a listen on extras.show.

817
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,240
And you did one with him on his wifi setup,

818
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,840
like a self-hosted mini episode,

819
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,440
so that's over on extras.show as well.

820
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,560
It's worth checking out.

821
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,240
He skipped the Ask SSHQ.

822
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,600
And went right to the tech support line.

823
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,920
And what I love about you two is let's hit record

824
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:40,720
and make an episode.

825
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:41,360
It was great.

826
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:44,480
And now you get to learn about some wifi stuff,

827
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,080
which I really enjoyed.

828
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,080
Well, I think that's everything for today, Alex.

829
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,520
As I said earlier in the show,

830
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,440
I'm on Twitter at ironicbadger

831
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:55,280
and you can find this fine podcast at self-hosted show.

832
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,960
Yeah, I'm at Chris LAS

833
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,080
and the whole network is at Jupiter signal.

834
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,120
Thank you for joining us

835
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:07,840
and we'll both see you in two weeks.
