WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.960
No Brent this week, he's finally left the building.

00:02.960 --> 00:06.080
That must feel a little like empty nest over there.

00:06.080 --> 00:09.600
Yeah, a little bit. We do miss our little baby Brent bird.

00:09.600 --> 00:16.480
Yeah, it's like having a pet Canadian around that, you know, cleans up after himself, makes food.

00:16.480 --> 00:21.280
Mostly, apart from his perennially dirty egg pan that's on the stove.

00:21.280 --> 00:24.640
Yeah, he'll have that and like a plate and a cup.

00:24.640 --> 00:27.920
It's impossible to explain to anybody that's never lived with a Brent.

00:27.920 --> 00:29.840
But the guy eats constantly.

00:29.840 --> 00:33.360
This is his vegan lifestyle because he doesn't have any serious protein in him.

00:33.360 --> 00:40.800
But to his credit, and I think you'd agree with me, this bastard can make a meal out of anything.

00:40.800 --> 00:44.000
Like I'll look in the fridge and I'll be like, we've got nothing to eat.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.800
And Brent will look out there and go, oh, we've got three days worth of food in here.

00:46.800 --> 00:49.440
And he'll put a bunch of stuff together that you'd never think would work.

00:50.160 --> 00:52.320
And it works. That's like his superpower.

00:52.320 --> 00:56.720
In his honor today, I am drinking a beverage which is new to me.

00:56.720 --> 00:59.520
This is the Canada dry ginger ale.

00:59.520 --> 01:00.800
It's actually very tasty.

01:00.800 --> 01:02.640
Maybe they know what they're doing up there.

01:02.640 --> 01:07.440
So I know while he was at your place, he was deep diving into Plex.

01:07.440 --> 01:11.600
And he was also watching some content off of my Plex server while it was still up.

01:12.480 --> 01:17.600
Kind of ironically, today, as we're starting the show, we look at the headlines and we see

01:18.480 --> 01:25.520
Plex has suffered a massive compromise, exposing usernames, emails, and passwords.

01:25.520 --> 01:27.360
And passwords, Alex.

01:27.360 --> 01:28.960
Yeah, this is not a good look, is it?

01:28.960 --> 01:36.320
For an app which is, well, was primarily designed for local media playback

01:37.040 --> 01:44.720
to suffer a compromise like this, where they say that yesterday we discovered suspicious

01:44.720 --> 01:47.360
activity on one of our databases.

01:47.360 --> 01:52.080
We immediately began an investigation and it does appear that a third party was able

01:52.080 --> 01:54.160
to access a limited subset of data.

01:54.160 --> 01:58.640
That includes emails, usernames, and encrypted passwords.

01:59.600 --> 02:05.520
Now, what I find interesting about this statement is that there are conflicting reports online

02:05.520 --> 02:10.320
as to whether the passwords themselves were encrypted or whether they were just hashed

02:10.320 --> 02:11.360
with assault.

02:11.360 --> 02:12.400
I think you touched on it there.

02:12.400 --> 02:17.200
I think why it stings so much is some of us have been using Plex and some of us have been

02:17.200 --> 02:20.000
a lifetime subscriber for a very, very, very long time.

02:20.000 --> 02:25.360
And it didn't necessarily have all of these hooks into the online Plex back end.

02:25.360 --> 02:30.400
In fact, I don't even recall it requiring logging into the Plex service to just access

02:30.400 --> 02:31.760
my local Plex library.

02:31.760 --> 02:33.760
I seem to recall that was something that came along later.

02:33.760 --> 02:37.280
And so they've sort of built and baked in this stuff as time has gone on.

02:38.320 --> 02:45.360
And it was something that initially started as kind of my off the radar stash of stuff.

02:45.360 --> 02:48.160
And now it's sort of integrated in with this whole service.

02:48.160 --> 02:52.560
And now my information's been leaked because, of course, my stuff's in there.

02:53.040 --> 02:54.080
It really stings.

02:54.080 --> 02:54.880
We know better.

02:54.880 --> 02:58.160
And I think that's going to be the theme of this episode is that we know better.

02:58.160 --> 03:03.120
These companies that store our data in the cloud, be it Plex, be it Google, as we will

03:03.120 --> 03:03.920
touch on later.

03:05.760 --> 03:09.920
At some point, that information is going to become public domain.

03:09.920 --> 03:15.840
And I think no matter whether it's an encrypted library of some description of information,

03:15.840 --> 03:21.360
like say, what's in your password manager, or whether it's a database of hashed password

03:21.360 --> 03:29.760
salts, or whatever it may well be, at some point, it is fair to say that that information

03:29.760 --> 03:32.160
will end up in the wrong hands somehow.

03:33.760 --> 03:36.640
It's just a fact of life these days, unfortunately.

03:36.640 --> 03:40.800
So all of this, and I think, again, this will be a theme of this episode, has me questioning

03:40.800 --> 03:48.800
yet again, why I'm relying on a closed source application, which requires third party authentication

03:48.800 --> 03:53.200
outside my LAN to watch a file, which is sat in my basement.

03:54.240 --> 03:55.680
Jellyfin is the obvious choice.

03:55.680 --> 04:01.840
But I wondered, do you have any opinions on, I don't want to say Plex versus Jellyfin,

04:01.840 --> 04:07.680
but like the ecosystem of the two apps?

04:07.680 --> 04:14.080
Yeah, this is going to be tricky, because maybe you and I, with our set top boxes, could

04:14.080 --> 04:16.560
kind of make anything work.

04:16.560 --> 04:21.360
But there's also like listeners out there who are using Plex because it's built into

04:21.360 --> 04:22.560
their smart TV.

04:22.560 --> 04:23.600
They've got an app for it.

04:24.320 --> 04:28.080
And that is not necessarily the case with Jellyfin.

04:28.080 --> 04:31.360
You can get it on Android, you can get it on Apple TV, you can get it on the Roku, a

04:31.360 --> 04:32.080
Jellyfin app.

04:32.720 --> 04:36.160
So I imagine you can also sideload it or get it maybe from the store directly on the fire

04:36.160 --> 04:36.480
stick.

04:36.480 --> 04:37.840
I haven't checked in forever.

04:37.840 --> 04:38.560
But that's about it.

04:39.280 --> 04:40.800
That's where it drops off, right?

04:40.800 --> 04:43.280
And there's a lot of other devices out there.

04:43.280 --> 04:44.480
That's tricky.

04:44.480 --> 04:48.880
I know also I hear from the audience a lot, there's a UI, you know, a UI gap between

04:48.880 --> 04:50.480
Jellyfin and Plex.

04:50.480 --> 04:54.480
And I also will, I know we're going to hear from people that will say, but hey, you know,

04:55.200 --> 05:01.200
Chris, hey, Alex, you could actually, for the most part, use Plex with only local network

05:01.200 --> 05:02.320
authentication.

05:02.320 --> 05:04.480
But here you hit the same issue you have with Jellyfin.

05:05.440 --> 05:11.040
When you go with only local authentication with Plex, you break about 80% of the Plex

05:11.040 --> 05:11.520
clients.

05:11.520 --> 05:12.560
They just don't work.

05:12.560 --> 05:18.160
And if you want to test, just disconnect your internet for an afternoon and see what devices

05:18.160 --> 05:20.560
in your house will play Plex and which ones won't.

05:20.560 --> 05:22.160
I think you'll be quite disappointed.

05:22.160 --> 05:23.280
Yeah, not many.

05:23.280 --> 05:27.280
And the thing is, like when I was on the plane coming back from England just last week, even

05:27.280 --> 05:36.240
my iPad, which I had deliberately cached terabytes worth of media to an external drive, decided

05:36.240 --> 05:40.080
when I loaded up the Plex app that it was going to sit there and spin for a minute or

05:40.080 --> 05:43.840
two trying to connect, even though there was no network connection.

05:44.640 --> 05:46.320
And I'm like, what are you doing?

05:46.320 --> 05:48.640
I just want to play these local files.

05:48.640 --> 05:49.840
Please let me in.

05:50.560 --> 05:56.480
And it straws slowly one by one by one, breaking the camel's back here with Plex.

05:56.480 --> 06:03.840
But I have a few apps that I rely on, I say rely, I use, okay, it's maybe not rely is

06:03.840 --> 06:06.160
too strong of a word, but things like Tautuli.

06:06.160 --> 06:11.600
And I don't know if I've said that name correctly, but essentially it's Plex server playback

06:11.600 --> 06:13.280
stats application.

06:13.920 --> 06:18.400
So it can track, you know, what my users have been watching when they played, paused and

06:18.400 --> 06:23.760
stopped and started and whether they transcoded and all these useful things which I can look

06:23.760 --> 06:27.920
back and trends and say, well, which shows, because nobody watched for three years, well,

06:27.920 --> 06:29.200
I can go ahead and delete those.

06:29.840 --> 06:30.640
That kind of thing.

06:30.640 --> 06:31.760
Oh, that's an interesting idea.

06:31.760 --> 06:35.600
I'd never thought about actually using it for cleaning up library items you're no longer

06:35.600 --> 06:36.240
using.

06:36.240 --> 06:41.200
Did you happen to check and just, I don't know, review what Brent binged while you were

06:41.200 --> 06:41.440
gone?

06:42.240 --> 06:44.720
I think he was on a Better Call Saul binge whilst I was gone.

06:45.760 --> 06:48.960
Mostly because we were, which, by the way, I'm not going to spoil the ending, but it

06:48.960 --> 06:50.000
was fantastic.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.320
This is part of the ecosystem you're talking about, though.

06:52.320 --> 06:53.680
Yeah, absolutely.

06:53.680 --> 06:55.600
So Tautuli is one of them.

06:55.600 --> 06:57.920
There's a new one this week, which I just came across.

06:57.920 --> 07:01.920
I think you've been using it for a while from what you told me called Overseer.

07:01.920 --> 07:06.640
Overseer is a class of application we don't talk a lot about on the show, sort of touching

07:06.640 --> 07:12.320
the third rail, but it is the ultimate evolution of that type of application.

07:12.320 --> 07:18.000
And these are those apps where you just say, hey, computer, I want this movie or this show

07:18.000 --> 07:18.800
and it goes and gets it.

07:18.800 --> 07:23.920
But this takes it to the next level in helping you discover stuff that's trending and popular

07:23.920 --> 07:25.200
or well-rated.

07:25.200 --> 07:27.280
And it wraps it all up with such a great UI.

07:27.280 --> 07:28.800
That's what I absolutely love about it.

07:28.800 --> 07:34.160
So the thing that really seals the deal is it has a full Plex library integration.

07:34.160 --> 07:41.280
So if I'm saying to my family, well, let's say my mom was a big Elvis fan and that new

07:41.280 --> 07:42.480
Elvis movie just came out.

07:42.480 --> 07:45.440
She's like, could you add it to Plex for me?

07:45.440 --> 07:48.880
And I'm like, well, I could, but you could do it yourself.

07:49.920 --> 07:52.800
And then shared the link with her Three Tail Scale, which is awesome.

07:53.600 --> 07:57.600
So there's nothing exposed on the internet, but it has a library integration with Plex.

07:58.160 --> 08:02.720
And so if I already had that movie in my library and she went to go and request it, for example,

08:03.920 --> 08:06.320
it would say, hey, dummy, this already exists.

08:06.320 --> 08:06.960
Go watch it.

08:06.960 --> 08:10.560
And it gives you a direct link right the way through to Plex's UI.

08:10.560 --> 08:14.800
And there's nothing I would say that stops these kind of apps integrating with Jellyfin

08:14.800 --> 08:15.760
directly.

08:15.760 --> 08:19.920
It's just that Plex has been the tallest nail for a very long time now.

08:19.920 --> 08:25.040
And so if you are a developer targeting this space, it's only natural that you would target

08:25.040 --> 08:26.080
Plex first.

08:26.080 --> 08:27.120
Yeah, I suppose so.

08:27.120 --> 08:32.560
Plus, you know, Plex has the company you can interface with if you're another business.

08:32.560 --> 08:36.800
I think the other thing that they have going for them obviously is they have a really well

08:36.800 --> 08:41.040
established API, really well documented, and then they have that big user base.

08:41.040 --> 08:42.240
You just add all that stuff up.

08:42.240 --> 08:44.880
And I understand why people are building for it first.

08:44.880 --> 08:53.120
Overseer, though, which Overseer, by the way, is spelled Overseer, is that what it is?

08:53.120 --> 08:53.600
Let me look.

08:53.600 --> 08:55.120
There'll be a link in the show notes, people.

08:55.120 --> 09:01.440
Yeah, yeah, Overseer.dev, if you want to check it out.

09:01.440 --> 09:06.480
It does support local accounts, but then you lose one of the nice things that Overseer

09:06.480 --> 09:12.640
supports, which is it will integrate with your Plex user accounts and it supports restricting

09:12.640 --> 09:16.080
media to certain users, which is really handy when you have kids.

09:17.520 --> 09:19.360
Again, it's part of that damn ecosystem.

09:19.360 --> 09:24.720
And I've been using this for several months and it's just so easy to pull it up.

09:24.720 --> 09:28.400
So again, they're not a sponsor on the show, but tail scale on my phone, right?

09:28.400 --> 09:30.240
So I connect tail scale.

09:30.240 --> 09:33.120
I pull this up in a web browser on my phone.

09:33.120 --> 09:34.800
It's perfectly formatted.

09:34.800 --> 09:38.480
I can hand it to my wife, she can type in what she wants, she can do her browsing,

09:38.480 --> 09:39.680
get it all set up.

09:39.680 --> 09:40.960
It's a real winner.

09:40.960 --> 09:45.200
And I mean, it's not impossible to use it with Jellyfin, but it just wouldn't have

09:45.200 --> 09:46.560
that level of integration.

09:46.560 --> 09:47.040
Right.

09:47.040 --> 09:50.400
And we touched briefly on the third rail at the beginning of this.

09:50.400 --> 09:52.960
You don't have to use it in that context either.

09:52.960 --> 09:58.000
You could literally just use it as a wish list or a watch trending list as to what's

09:58.000 --> 10:00.400
available on various different services as well.

10:00.400 --> 10:06.640
So it's not limited to only people who wear pirate hats.

10:06.640 --> 10:08.960
Yeah, although I mean, I think that is its core functionality.

10:08.960 --> 10:09.760
I'm not going to lie.

10:09.760 --> 10:10.480
Yeah, possibly.

10:12.080 --> 10:13.120
But you're right.

10:13.120 --> 10:16.880
You could also build a wish list and it will help with some of those tracking services

10:16.880 --> 10:17.600
as well.

10:17.600 --> 10:20.640
And as you would expect, it's just like a container away.

10:20.640 --> 10:23.840
I didn't check the license on it, but I do think it's open source as well.

10:23.840 --> 10:24.800
Yeah, it's up on GitHub.

10:24.800 --> 10:26.160
Check it out over there.

10:26.160 --> 10:27.600
Overseer is a really good one.

10:27.600 --> 10:31.920
It's a Node.js app and the source code is all on GitHub.

10:33.440 --> 10:35.760
Linode.com slash SSH.

10:35.760 --> 10:39.120
That's where you go to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account.

10:39.120 --> 10:40.720
It's just a great way to support the show.

10:40.720 --> 10:44.560
So it's Linode.com slash SSH.

10:44.560 --> 10:46.080
Linode is simple cloud hosting.

10:46.080 --> 10:49.680
When you want to put something up in the cloud, you want infrastructure you have under your

10:49.680 --> 10:54.000
control with root access that is super fast and affordable.

10:54.000 --> 10:58.480
Well, Linode is 30% to 50% cheaper than the major hyperscalers out there.

10:58.480 --> 11:01.280
And Linode can also be a fantastic platform to learn.

11:01.280 --> 11:04.960
I know I tell you guys about how we use it as our own lab and it's also where we deploy

11:04.960 --> 11:08.320
all our stuff in production, like our new websites being built out and we'll run from

11:08.320 --> 11:08.880
there.

11:08.880 --> 11:11.040
Just about anything we've built in the last two and a half, three years.

11:11.840 --> 11:13.600
But it's also where I go to learn.

11:13.600 --> 11:18.160
You know, they have Kali Linux on there right now and cybersecurity is a huge field.

11:18.160 --> 11:21.760
And if you're going to get familiar with cybersecurity at all, you're going to be worth

11:21.760 --> 11:23.200
your salt at all.

11:23.200 --> 11:25.920
You got to get Linux skills.

11:25.920 --> 11:27.040
You got to train up.

11:27.040 --> 11:31.280
You just you have to understand how these systems are built from the ground up.

11:31.280 --> 11:35.840
And why not just tear something down over and over again, break and fix, break and fix

11:35.840 --> 11:36.880
on Linode.

11:36.880 --> 11:37.760
It's so fast.

11:37.760 --> 11:39.280
You can get started in just seconds.

11:40.000 --> 11:44.240
And, you know, sure, you could like spin up a VM on your box, but there's no substitute

11:44.240 --> 11:48.640
for learning on an actual Linux machine that has really good performance that installs

11:48.640 --> 11:52.720
packages in seconds, has a fantastic Internet connection.

11:52.720 --> 11:56.720
Linode allows you to spin up and work with Linux servers with a distribution of your

11:56.720 --> 11:56.960
choice.

11:56.960 --> 12:01.680
They got all the good ones, real compute power in a real data center.

12:01.680 --> 12:05.040
They regularly keep their software and their hardware as up to date as possible.

12:05.040 --> 12:10.160
Run out MVME storage, 11 data centers around the world, AMD epic processors.

12:11.280 --> 12:12.720
And they have so many other great features, too.

12:13.600 --> 12:16.080
I use the crap out of the S3 compatible object storage.

12:16.640 --> 12:19.680
Alex loves the fact that it's no problem to use things like Ansible.

12:19.680 --> 12:22.240
Of course, Terraform and Kubernetes support it as well.

12:22.240 --> 12:24.000
And they have the best support in the business.

12:24.720 --> 12:28.000
Sometimes that's really nice if you, your friends, your family or your business depend

12:28.000 --> 12:28.240
on it.

12:28.880 --> 12:33.120
It's nice to know you've got support 24 7 365 with a real human being.

12:33.920 --> 12:37.360
So go get $100 and support the show and try out Linode.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
Linode is just our hosting provider of choice.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.040
They're a great place to go.

12:41.040 --> 12:43.360
My friends have been there for a decade.

12:44.240 --> 12:47.680
I'm a newbie compared to them and I'm coming on three years and I'm still extremely

12:47.680 --> 12:48.000
happy.

12:48.560 --> 12:49.760
So go try it out.

12:49.760 --> 12:50.880
Go see what you can do.

12:50.880 --> 12:52.560
Go see what you can learn.

12:52.560 --> 12:54.000
Go deploy something.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.560
Linode.com slash SSH.

12:58.400 --> 13:02.800
Now, picking back up on the theme of this episode of perhaps we should know better and

13:02.800 --> 13:08.960
not be surprised when big companies get hacked or do things with our data that we don't

13:08.960 --> 13:11.680
particularly like or agree with.

13:12.400 --> 13:17.200
There was an article in the New York Times this week about a gentleman whose young child

13:17.200 --> 13:20.320
toddler, I think, had some kind of a medical issue.

13:20.320 --> 13:27.120
And as part of the telemedicine procedure that this father worried parent was doing,

13:27.760 --> 13:36.240
he uploaded some pictures of genitalia of his child's genitalia to his Android phone's

13:36.240 --> 13:39.040
Google automatic photos backup.

13:39.040 --> 13:46.960
And as a consequence, he ended up being flagged not only by Google, but by the police and

13:46.960 --> 13:48.080
law enforcement.

13:48.080 --> 13:50.960
Well, Google notified them automatically so conveniently.

13:50.960 --> 13:56.720
Also sent them his entire Google account history, every search, all his location history, all

13:56.720 --> 13:57.760
of his text messages.

13:58.480 --> 14:01.120
They sent everything that he put in there since the early aughts.

14:01.760 --> 14:03.440
Sent it all over to the cops automatically.

14:04.080 --> 14:06.560
You know, the details of this are kind of interesting.

14:06.560 --> 14:08.800
So the wife took the pictures on her iPhone.

14:10.160 --> 14:13.600
She texted them to her husband because he was the one interfacing with the doctor.

14:13.600 --> 14:17.760
His Android automatically backed them up to Google Photos.

14:18.800 --> 14:26.080
Then Google's system detected these photos, flagged their child abuse team, they reviewed

14:26.080 --> 14:31.200
this guy's kid's crotch's pictures, crotch pictures, and then they sent it all off to

14:31.200 --> 14:32.480
the cops automatically.

14:33.360 --> 14:38.400
They at that point then disabled his Google account, which also disabled his Google Fi

14:38.400 --> 14:39.360
cell phone service.

14:39.360 --> 14:44.880
So then the police could no longer get a hold of him, which became an issue later, and they

14:44.880 --> 14:46.080
just presumed he was guilty.

14:47.040 --> 14:51.520
And I think the thing that I find disturbing about this is these are not pictures that

14:51.520 --> 14:55.840
are in an existing CSAM model database of known child pornography.

14:56.640 --> 15:02.640
These are brand new bespoke pictures that Google identified as child porn in this guy's

15:02.640 --> 15:07.200
Google Photo database, and then initiated this entire auto flag service.

15:07.200 --> 15:11.920
And this Mark, we only have his first name, he's not the only one.

15:11.920 --> 15:15.840
The New York Times article, which we'll link to in the show notes, talks about another

15:15.840 --> 15:21.120
dad that this happened to around the same time, because of course more people are using

15:21.120 --> 15:24.320
telemedicine now, and so it's happening more and more.

15:25.040 --> 15:28.800
And the other little detail in this story that's horrible, besides the fact that this

15:28.800 --> 15:34.160
guy's cell phone service was turned off, the police have notified Google that they've

15:34.160 --> 15:38.720
cleared him, and Google refuses to turn his account back on.

15:38.720 --> 15:40.560
And this is true for the other ones as well.

15:40.560 --> 15:43.760
This is really what gets me going about this particular story.

15:44.720 --> 15:53.680
At what point did we as a society decide that Google were now the law, right?

15:55.280 --> 16:01.200
This guy, you know, the people that we have chosen as society to say, you are the one

16:01.200 --> 16:07.840
who decides whether someone has committed a crime or not, the police, detective, whatever

16:07.840 --> 16:14.800
it might be, FBI, whoever, at some point, Google, without really realizing it, probably

16:14.800 --> 16:19.360
have more power over you than that individual does, because not only are you locked out

16:19.360 --> 16:25.600
of your cell service, you're also locked out of, was it 15 plus years worth of correspondence

16:25.600 --> 16:31.600
and PDF receipts and all the other stuff that ends up in everybody's Gmail inboxes.

16:31.600 --> 16:36.960
Yeah, and the other dad who also got flagged was in the middle of a mortgage deal and was

16:36.960 --> 16:42.080
trying to get papers to sign to buy his house, and they were in his Gmail inbox, and because

16:42.080 --> 16:48.000
Gmail did this, because Gmail got turned off, he had to ask the broker to switch to a new

16:48.000 --> 16:52.480
email account, which then flagged him for fraud, and they thought that was suspicious,

16:52.480 --> 16:58.000
which then threw his entire mortgage back into review, because his Gmail account got

16:58.000 --> 16:58.560
disabled.

16:58.560 --> 17:05.120
I think the saddest thing for me about this, and by this I mean sort of modern tech, Google,

17:05.120 --> 17:11.360
Apple, Facebook, all this kind of surveillance culture, is that we've ended up spiraling

17:11.360 --> 17:19.200
into this user manipulation, user surveillance space without, honestly, in autopilot, without

17:19.200 --> 17:24.640
really realizing that we were doing it, piece by piece, little by little, all these little

17:24.640 --> 17:31.440
apps have eroded into our little worlds, and now Google Photos is a fundamental part of

17:31.440 --> 17:34.000
my personal photo backup strategy.

17:34.000 --> 17:40.800
I have a young child, and I take pictures of her in the bath. At what point do I run

17:40.800 --> 17:46.800
the risk of Google flagging my images and having my stuff locked out? It's not unlikely

17:46.800 --> 17:49.520
at this point.

17:49.520 --> 17:54.080
We also know that these classifiers and these models don't always get it right. Computer

17:54.080 --> 17:58.800
vision is still early, and everybody listening to this show knows that's a fact.

17:58.800 --> 18:00.560
Hot dog, not a hot dog.

18:01.280 --> 18:09.920
Right, and the reality is these things could get it wrong, and the best case scenario in

18:09.920 --> 18:14.320
that situation is that a team of people at Google are looking at whatever private pictures

18:14.320 --> 18:19.440
you have, and you never even know anything happened. But back in Google's headquarters,

18:19.440 --> 18:23.760
a group of human beings are looking at your private pictures because they've been flagged.

18:23.760 --> 18:28.560
That's the best case scenario, right? And the worst case scenario is what's happened

18:28.560 --> 18:34.960
to Mark here, where everything got shut off, and then his entire account was downloaded

18:34.960 --> 18:41.840
and sent to the cops to review, where if Mark, at any point in the last 15 years, had done

18:41.840 --> 18:48.480
something else illegal, it would be in there. Emails, text messages, photos, all of his

18:48.480 --> 18:52.880
location information, every place he ever went on Google Maps, every search request

18:52.880 --> 18:57.920
he's ever made into Google, every single Google doc, every spreadsheet he's ever created,

18:57.920 --> 19:02.640
everything got sent to the cops. They could review that, and you know, I mean, maybe some

19:02.640 --> 19:06.640
people will come out squeaky clean, and maybe others, there'd be something else in there.

19:06.640 --> 19:10.640
And I don't know what happens there, but I doubt it just gets deleted. You know, it's

19:10.640 --> 19:12.480
just, the precedent here is horrible.

19:12.480 --> 19:17.920
Around the time of Brexit, I remember having a discussion with a family member about, well,

19:17.920 --> 19:23.520
I've got nothing to hide, so I've got nothing to fear, right? And I think this is the insidious

19:24.480 --> 19:29.200
conclusion of that, I've got nothing to hide. You know, this is a perfectly innocent,

19:29.200 --> 19:34.400
legitimate use case of taking a photograph like that, and it's landed this guy in a lot

19:34.400 --> 19:39.600
of trouble. I'm not totally familiar with wiretapping laws on this side of the pond,

19:39.600 --> 19:46.160
but I do wonder if legislation needs to catch up with this kind of thing, because as far

19:46.160 --> 19:51.440
as I'm aware, at least, it's a federal crime to wiretap somebody without their permission

19:51.440 --> 19:57.360
or consent, without some kind of a court order. And I don't know if a EULA would really

19:57.360 --> 20:03.680
constitute a genuine admission of my consent to do this. Google will probably argue the

20:03.680 --> 20:08.320
opposite, but without some kind of a court order, this feels like a stretch to me.

20:08.320 --> 20:10.240
Nat Malkus Yeah, so I know that the Fourth Amendment

20:10.240 --> 20:14.000
and those protections apply to anything the state does. The state would not be able to

20:14.000 --> 20:19.120
just do this, but we've privatized this now with Google, and of course, with all these

20:19.120 --> 20:24.880
other tech companies, and I do know that the lines there are a lot less clear. And so,

20:24.880 --> 20:29.760
the beauty thing is, is there's this just not-my-problem legal situation that Google's

20:29.760 --> 20:33.920
in and that the state is in, where Google can collect all the information and use it

20:33.920 --> 20:39.600
infinitum for their own value, and then they also have all the incentives in the world

20:40.240 --> 20:44.880
to share that data with law enforcement at the lowest friction way possible in the most

20:44.880 --> 20:50.560
efficient way possible. That's their incentive structure, for obvious reasons. And I don't

20:50.560 --> 20:56.080
think that's going to change, because both parties involved, both the business and the

20:56.080 --> 21:01.920
state, are very satisfied with this arrangement. Alex, it's been a long time since I have seen

21:01.920 --> 21:07.840
a tech story that actually genuinely gave me chills, right? I mean, I've been like,

21:07.840 --> 21:16.320
oh, I've been outraged or whatever, but actually, like, oh no. Uh-oh. We are already, all of

21:16.320 --> 21:20.240
us that are dads that have ever taken pictures of our kids in the bath or anything like that,

21:20.240 --> 21:25.840
we are all now at risk. All of us. And we just walked right into it, even though we've

21:25.840 --> 21:30.480
been talking about the risk for years. I've thought a lot about this, and I've realized

21:30.480 --> 21:38.560
the truth is, these services have a lot of upside. They have a lot of reach. They have

21:38.560 --> 21:44.400
a lot of features. There's just a lot of upside to them. Google Photos is very, very tempting,

21:44.400 --> 21:49.040
because they manage the storage. They manage the replication in their servers and their

21:49.040 --> 21:54.880
data centers. They manage the bandwidth. And they're kind of just doing it automatically,

21:54.880 --> 21:58.800
so you don't even have to think about it. And as a parent, the last thing you ever want

21:58.800 --> 22:02.480
to lose is your pictures. If your whole house burned down, but you saved nothing but your

22:02.480 --> 22:06.800
pictures, you'd say, well, at least I still have my pictures, right? They're critical.

22:06.800 --> 22:11.840
You kind of just get pushed into it, because it's the default, both on iOS and on Android,

22:11.840 --> 22:16.160
because this is eventually going to be happening on iOS as well. You just set up the phone

22:16.160 --> 22:20.480
by default, and all these things are on. And they're just kind of like, well, why not leave

22:20.480 --> 22:25.600
them on? Because my photos, they're important. One of the worst aspects of this, which we

22:25.600 --> 22:30.720
kind of already touched on, though, is that even though law enforcement said this chap

22:30.720 --> 22:35.520
was not guilty of committing a crime, he still doesn't have his Gmail account back. Google

22:35.520 --> 22:40.320
have told the New York Times they stand by these decisions, and this guy will be locked

22:40.320 --> 22:44.960
out, I presume, forever. That's it. He's done. Yeah, the response was just like, well, we

22:44.960 --> 22:48.640
find child porn to be abhorrent. And who can argue with that? That's a perfectly rational

22:48.640 --> 22:54.640
statement. Won't somebody think of the children? That's how it always starts, though. I think

22:54.640 --> 22:59.920
my baseline advice now is, if you're going to use Google services, if you're going to

22:59.920 --> 23:06.320
be dependent on Google services, you have got to have a valid backup. Valid backup for anything

23:06.320 --> 23:13.680
that's important. Email, calendar, you got to have it. And I guess that's the bare minimum.

23:13.680 --> 23:21.200
But both in the case of Plex and in the case of Google Photos and all that, I feel like

23:21.200 --> 23:25.440
the math has just changed for me. I think it's time to give Photo Prism another try.

23:25.440 --> 23:29.760
I think it's time to really try to not use Google Photos at all. I took a break for a

23:29.760 --> 23:33.120
while, and then I got back on. And then I took a break for a while, and then I got back on.

23:33.760 --> 23:39.920
But this is too far for me. If I don't pay attention to this red flag, and then something

23:39.920 --> 23:44.880
happens to me, what kind of an idiot am I going to feel like? What kind of an ultimate

23:44.880 --> 23:49.840
idiot? This is like, I've got to pay attention to these warning signs, because the thing that

23:49.840 --> 23:54.880
seems to be clear, and I'm curious to know if you agree, and I'm not happy to say this,

23:54.880 --> 24:00.800
but it's getting worse. And the longer you participate, and the more data you give it,

24:01.840 --> 24:08.560
the worse you make it. Like in the case of my Google account, I got a Gmail account within

24:08.560 --> 24:16.640
nine months of Gmail launching beta. I have Gmail chats with my ex-wife, Angela, when we

24:16.640 --> 24:25.600
were still just meeting. I have an entire relationships worth of history in that Google

24:25.600 --> 24:33.520
chat. And I feel like I got to purge everything. I'm starting to feel a little more like Richard

24:33.520 --> 24:41.680
Stallman, like I need to go off grid almost. Because the other risk with Plex, Alex, and I

24:41.680 --> 24:46.880
think the real risk with Plex, they're going to get sold. They're going to get sold to a major

24:46.880 --> 24:51.280
entertainment company, and then they're going to have all our metadata about what's on our servers,

24:51.280 --> 24:54.560
about what we're watching, about what our watch habits are, because you know they're collecting

24:54.560 --> 25:00.080
all of that. And then with Google, the risk is that they're just going to get more invasive,

25:00.080 --> 25:04.000
they're going to do more things in your life, and then they just have that automatic pipeline

25:04.000 --> 25:11.440
to your local friendly authorities. And both are becoming more and more real, tangible risks

25:11.440 --> 25:12.800
to everyday people.

25:12.800 --> 25:18.080
Couldn't agree with you more. And it's got me looking for ways to back up my Gmail in the last

25:18.080 --> 25:24.640
few days. I actually put a thread in the self-hosted subreddit today. As we record, it's

25:24.640 --> 25:29.520
Wednesday, the day before, or two days before this episode airs. So maybe there'll be some more

25:29.520 --> 25:33.600
answers to that thread in the meantime. I'll put a link to it in the show notes, of course.

25:34.320 --> 25:40.160
Lots of people suggest using Thunderbird as a backup. I'm not sure if I agree with that as a

25:40.160 --> 25:47.040
backup per se, because it still requires some kind of a desktop environment in order for

25:47.040 --> 25:48.720
Thunderbird to run, as far as I'm aware.

25:48.720 --> 25:50.160
Yeah, you'd have to fire it up, right?

25:50.160 --> 25:50.800
And keep it going.

25:50.800 --> 25:56.400
Yeah, exactly. There are other options, apparently offline IMAP plus Dovecot is another one,

25:56.400 --> 26:01.680
and that will be usable with any mail software that uses SMTP. There's lots of other people

26:01.680 --> 26:06.000
talking about different ways to sync IMAP. Apparently there is a Docker Thunderbird image,

26:06.000 --> 26:10.640
I'm told, in the chat as an option. So that will work quietly in the background. But one

26:10.640 --> 26:16.240
that a listener recommended to me in Discord this afternoon was one called Got Your Back

26:16.240 --> 26:22.720
from the GAM Team, G-Y-B. Again, link in the show notes. This is a command line tool for

26:22.720 --> 26:28.560
backing up your Gmail messages to your computer using Gmail's API over HTTPS.

26:28.560 --> 26:33.520
So I had a quick spin of this before the show, just on my laptop, which is a MacBook.

26:33.520 --> 26:37.280
And it was a little fiddly to get set up, you know, if you've ever set up an API key

26:37.280 --> 26:41.520
for like Google Maps or anything like that, and created a no auth application with a client

26:41.520 --> 26:45.520
secret and a client token and what have you. It was a little bit fiddly, probably took

26:45.520 --> 26:50.400
about 10 minutes to get it going. I put it on one of my lesser known Gmail account, which

26:50.400 --> 26:56.880
only has about 10,000 emails in it, not my primary one as the first try. And it works

26:56.880 --> 27:02.960
perfectly, works exactly as advertised. All 10,000 messages were downloaded in.eml format,

27:02.960 --> 27:09.440
I was then able to open those with the mail client on Mac, view them in their full HTML

27:09.440 --> 27:12.000
glory, and it just worked.

27:12.000 --> 27:16.080
Hey, I like that it's command line, that it's basically a bash script, because then I could

27:16.080 --> 27:17.080
just cron that.

27:17.080 --> 27:21.840
That is something worth mentioning, actually. The project seems a little immature in some

27:21.840 --> 27:28.920
ways to me, because there's an issue in their GitHub, where someone said that their Wiki

27:28.920 --> 27:36.640
is open to public edits, and some insidious individual decided to change the download

27:36.640 --> 27:42.400
location of the binary or one of the scripts or something, so that it wasn't the official

27:42.400 --> 27:48.400
developer's script, and so some people had some unverified binaries being downloaded.

27:48.400 --> 27:53.080
Oh no. And you never really know how many people got that and what's in there, that's

27:53.080 --> 27:56.760
too bad. Yeah, that's early days stuff. You know, if anybody out there in the audience

27:56.760 --> 28:02.120
knows of a way to do this, something you could automate, but just the whole account, like

28:02.120 --> 28:06.320
the Google takeout functionality, boost in your answer, because I'd like to just back

28:06.320 --> 28:11.960
up everything, and then, I don't know, I'm on the edge of going over there and hitting

28:11.960 --> 28:17.160
delete. I am on the edge, man. If you've got the skills, you've got the infrastructure,

28:17.160 --> 28:21.360
you got the tools, it's really a matter of time. So I think what I've got to do is figure

28:21.360 --> 28:27.440
out a weekend where I just get it done, and then I get everything set up, and then I go

28:27.440 --> 28:33.320
just delete it. And I hope to Linus that they actually truly delete it when I tell them

28:33.320 --> 28:38.840
to delete it, because who really knows? Who really knows? Who really knows? Now this is

28:38.840 --> 28:44.480
another topic, this is photos, this is a little bit unrelated to Gmail itself, but obviously

28:44.480 --> 28:50.120
it's a fundamental part of the Google experience. There is a new self-hosted app on the scene

28:50.120 --> 28:55.720
called Image. Now I haven't checked this out yet, actually, in person, because the developer

28:55.720 --> 29:00.280
states very clearly this is not yet ready for production usage, and I don't really want

29:00.280 --> 29:05.120
to put my photos through it yet. However, every time I see this pop up on Reddit, it

29:05.120 --> 29:10.600
gets absolutely covered in praise. Everybody has nothing but good things to say about it,

29:10.600 --> 29:14.800
so I'm watching this project extremely closely. I've had several people mail in and tell me

29:14.800 --> 29:20.320
about it, don't worry, it's on our radar, we will cover it, but once it goes into a

29:20.320 --> 29:26.480
air quotes production ready state. Yeah, I'll keep an eye on it for sure. Heck, I might

29:26.480 --> 29:29.800
even throw a few photos in there when it's in an earlier state, but yeah, I wouldn't

29:29.800 --> 29:34.320
want to switch the whole library over. But Image, I like the name. We'll have a link

29:34.320 --> 29:37.560
in the show notes.

29:37.560 --> 29:50.800
Humio is a centralized, log, management, and observability platform. The company was founded

29:50.800 --> 29:55.160
by developers in Denmark in 2016, and they've really been building something incredible

29:55.160 --> 29:58.880
since then. I think the real beauty of Humio, the thing they've really cracked, is they

29:58.880 --> 30:03.640
can take logs from any source and make them usable. You don't have to constantly massage

30:03.640 --> 30:08.920
the format, it doesn't need a schema, you just pump them all into Humio, and they're

30:08.920 --> 30:12.920
there when you need them, and the dashboard to review it all is great. Humio's platform

30:12.920 --> 30:17.820
is crazy. Their index-free architecture means you can ingest over a petabyte of data per

30:17.820 --> 30:22.800
day and search that with sub-second latency. And Humio's up to 80% cheaper than the competing

30:22.800 --> 30:27.320
platforms like Splunk or Elastic, thanks to its reduced hardware and computational footprint.

30:27.320 --> 30:32.000
I think the best way for our audience to get going is probably the Community Edition. Humio

30:32.000 --> 30:37.800
Community Edition is the largest no-cost data ingestion offering on the market today, allowing

30:37.800 --> 30:44.140
you to ingest up to 16 gigs per day, 7-day retention included. It's not a trial period,

30:44.140 --> 30:48.520
you get it for the long haul. This is perfect for us self-hosters because, yeah, you can

30:48.520 --> 30:52.360
put your home assistant logs in there, you can put your NGINX logs in there, and like

30:52.360 --> 30:55.840
I said earlier, you can put just about anything in there, and Humio knows what to do with

30:55.840 --> 30:59.440
it. It gives you the ability to bring all that stuff together, view it in one place,

30:59.440 --> 31:03.280
and that makes troubleshooting easier. It's so much better than having separate places

31:03.280 --> 31:07.640
to look when you need to figure out what went wrong. That's amateur stuff. Go get like a

31:07.640 --> 31:12.720
pro setup, right? Because when this is your home setup, it's your hobby, you don't want

31:12.720 --> 31:16.120
to have to fight with it, you just want the information. You want to be able to fix it

31:16.120 --> 31:20.400
quick, you want it easy, you want it usable, you don't want it to be another job. That's

31:20.400 --> 31:26.600
where Humio Community Edition could be perfect. So go get started for free at humio.com slash

31:26.600 --> 31:32.080
H-C-E. That's H-U-M-I-O dot com slash H-C-E.

31:32.080 --> 31:36.520
Mason So you're all aboard the ZigBee train now,

31:36.520 --> 31:38.680
huh? That seems to have left the station.

31:38.680 --> 31:42.360
Alex Yeah, I was like trying so hard not to, because

31:42.360 --> 31:47.040
I already got a lot of Z-Wave, and I've already got Wi-Fi devices. Do I really need a third

31:47.040 --> 31:52.900
network, Alex? The answer is no. No. No, I do not. But yeah, that doesn't stop me anyways.

31:52.900 --> 31:59.560
This one really was because I tried everything else, and after last week's episode, I got

31:59.560 --> 32:03.320
a couple of notes almost immediately after the episode went out. They were just like,

32:03.320 --> 32:09.080
hey, you got to check out the Aquera temperature sensor. It's ZigBee, but it's battery powered,

32:09.080 --> 32:15.000
and it gives you real time data. As the temperature changes, it sends in updates. You know, it's

32:15.000 --> 32:18.940
not this problem where it falls asleep and drops off the network like you had with the

32:18.940 --> 32:25.320
Shelly H&T. And so I thought, all right, I've been wanting to get on the ZigBee train and

32:25.320 --> 32:29.000
just try it. I knew eventually I wanted to give it a go, and I'm thinking about replacing

32:29.000 --> 32:33.120
my Z-Wave devices, and if ZigBee worked out, that would probably be for the best. So I

32:33.120 --> 32:39.960
grabbed the Aquera temperature and humidity sensor and grabbed a KonBee ZigBee stick,

32:39.960 --> 32:45.040
which is like a German ZigBee stick, which just works out of the box with Home Assistant.

32:45.040 --> 32:50.440
And I got to say, Alex, this is the one. This is the one. I really like this. I think it's

32:50.440 --> 32:56.580
based on the same Yaomei chipset that a lot of these are based on. And it has two years

32:56.580 --> 33:02.440
of battery life, which is outrageous because the things about the size of a bottle cap,

33:02.440 --> 33:07.060
you know, it's only square. It's super, super small. It's also the smallest temperature

33:07.060 --> 33:14.160
sensor of all of the ones that I've tried. It says on the box requires the Aquera hub.

33:14.160 --> 33:18.240
That just means it just needs a ZigBee device to connect to. So once you put it on the ZigBee

33:18.240 --> 33:22.480
network, which takes about a millisecond, you just pull the battery, little plastic

33:22.480 --> 33:27.200
separator and click the button when you're in discover mode in ZigBee, and it's connected

33:27.200 --> 33:28.200
immediately.

33:28.200 --> 33:31.040
What are you using for ZigBee? Are you using ZHA or...?

33:31.040 --> 33:36.200
Yeah, I'm using the built-in, yeah. And it's been fine. You know, it's cleaner and nicer

33:36.200 --> 33:40.860
than the Z-Wave stuff is. Of course, I'm using the older Z-Wave stuff. And ZigBee itself

33:40.860 --> 33:47.440
I like. One of the things that I think is fantastic about it is when you add wired devices,

33:47.440 --> 33:54.480
you know, permanently powered devices like a smart plug, just like Z-Wave, it builds

33:54.480 --> 33:59.360
the network out more. They become repeaters out there. It has about a hundred meter line

33:59.360 --> 34:04.760
of sight range. And you know how big the studio is. It's not that big, but the temperature

34:04.760 --> 34:10.520
sensors in the far corner of the garage and the HomoSystem Blue is in the other far corner

34:10.520 --> 34:15.700
of the studio. So it's at the maximum separation you could get here in the studio and it's

34:15.700 --> 34:20.540
still working pretty good. I think maybe I could slide a repeater in there and probably

34:20.540 --> 34:24.060
boost the signal a little bit, but it's getting the job done.

34:24.060 --> 34:29.520
Any permanently powered device like a plug socket, like a smart plug, which is ZigBee

34:29.520 --> 34:34.400
ready would be a great repeater. And I've got a couple of those. Also, light bulbs turn

34:34.400 --> 34:39.440
out to be really great ZigBee repeaters. Like all my Hue bulbs are connected to ZHA these

34:39.440 --> 34:45.840
days and they're all permanently powered and they all extend my ZigBee network. But I'm

34:45.840 --> 34:49.600
really glad that you're using this temperature sensor now. Cause I've had one since I think

34:49.600 --> 34:54.080
just before you came in April. There's one in my fridge, which works great. And I've

34:54.080 --> 35:00.240
got a couple in Ziploc freezer bags in the freezers and they don't like minus 15 Celsius

35:00.240 --> 35:07.280
temperatures too much. The two year battery life is more like two months minus 15. But

35:07.280 --> 35:11.640
I must say the one in the fridge, which is typically around five Celsius, that's been

35:11.640 --> 35:16.040
on the original battery ever since I got it. So, so far so good.

35:16.040 --> 35:19.840
I do think I'll be buying more of these. So that's good to know. I still have my Aotec

35:19.840 --> 35:24.160
Z-Wave in my freezer at home on the original battery. I put it in there, which has been

35:24.160 --> 35:31.000
months now, but it's one of those bigger lithium Duracell. So I could see this is such a smaller

35:31.000 --> 35:36.120
a smaller battery in this guy cause it's such a tiny device. So this has the CR 2032 battery

35:36.120 --> 35:40.800
in it, which is a lot smaller. It does also come in the box with a handy little circular

35:40.800 --> 35:44.480
double-sided tape, which fits perfectly on the back of the sensor. So you could just

35:44.480 --> 35:46.680
slap that on there and then you stick it anywhere.

35:46.680 --> 35:50.760
You are getting roasted in the chat by the way. Oh yeah. Yeah. She'd go and see this.

35:50.760 --> 35:57.000
You know, the little dog from up who's like, okay, Chris is like new standard. Okay. I'm

35:57.000 --> 36:03.160
in. Yeah, I know. I know. It's true. It is true. Here's why I was okay. Going with ZigBee

36:03.160 --> 36:09.840
right is basically what matter is. Matter is based on, on ZigBee and it's an open source

36:09.840 --> 36:21.760
spec. It's going to be around forever. I mean, heck the Mars Rover is using it. It's so cool.

36:21.760 --> 36:26.400
And Z-Wave, Z-Wave is like end of life. So I think what I'm going to do is, although

36:26.400 --> 36:31.560
it sucks cause I have so many Z-Wave devices, but I think over this next year, I don't know,

36:31.560 --> 36:35.560
maybe sooner, probably a lot sooner because I just want to get rid of my home assistant

36:35.560 --> 36:39.640
set up and start over. I think I'm going to just transition to ZigBee. So I'll have ZigBee

36:39.640 --> 36:47.360
and wifi devices, but honestly I prefer not to have my IOT devices on wifi. It's heavy

36:47.360 --> 36:52.880
in terms of battery life and CPU and power, but also it's just not a great standard for

36:52.880 --> 36:58.280
it. It's a lot, it's, it's a lot of chatter and the more chatter, the worse the wifi network.

36:58.280 --> 37:03.000
Where like the ZigBee network, the individual devices can actually improve each other's

37:03.000 --> 37:08.400
signal and help route each other. And the more devices you add to a point, make it stronger.

37:08.400 --> 37:13.520
So it's clearly a better way to go for these types of devices, but it does, it does suck

37:13.520 --> 37:19.180
having yet a third, a new, any wireless standard. I, that's why I resisted it, but it was the

37:19.180 --> 37:23.120
audience that convinced me to try it and it is now my favorite. And it's nice to see the

37:23.120 --> 37:26.360
ZigBee integration work so well in home assistant. It makes me feel better.

37:26.360 --> 37:29.920
You'll be using the Ikea trad free buttons next. Just you wait.

37:29.920 --> 37:34.240
Oh man. I'm already on Alibaba and I'm already on Amazon. Just looking at all the possible

37:34.240 --> 37:41.280
ZigBee devices. In fact, I want to install led lights in the wheel wells of dupes to

37:41.280 --> 37:46.600
help with rodents and stuff. And I don't want an led light strip. I would like, you know,

37:46.600 --> 37:52.480
a big bright light that is ZigBee. That's DC powered that I could mount in there and

37:52.480 --> 37:56.760
then home assistant could turn on in the evening and turn off in the morning and shine light

37:56.760 --> 38:02.240
down on the ground. And I've seen lots of light strips. I can find lots of DC power

38:02.240 --> 38:07.960
ZigBee controllers, but I would like a mountable led light. I haven't seen it. And of course

38:07.960 --> 38:12.000
it'd have to be really weatherproof cause it'd be in the wheel well. So you're going

38:12.000 --> 38:16.860
down the road with rain, but that's my next thing. I, I, I wanted it. I want to just kind

38:16.860 --> 38:21.360
of convert over. I'd like to get some ZigBee lighting. I got to replace some of my light

38:21.360 --> 38:25.500
strips. You know, I got to do some of that crap. There's, there's some bulbs and some

38:25.500 --> 38:32.040
smart plugs and some, a lot of sensors. It does seem to work really well. And I was impressed

38:32.040 --> 38:36.640
with the performance and the fact that it's battery life is supposedly pretty good and

38:36.640 --> 38:41.280
it's still giving me near real time data. Like as we're doing the show here, I'm watching

38:41.280 --> 38:45.400
the temperature in the studio garage just go up and up and up in real time. It's wonderful.

38:45.400 --> 38:50.880
Oh, that's fun. Yeah. Useful. Do you have an also a ZigBee anxiety sensor to go with

38:50.880 --> 38:55.480
that? I will soon. Probably. I'm checking Alibaba every day now. There's all kinds of

38:55.480 --> 39:00.560
crazy ZigBee devices. So I think, uh, yeah, wheel well lights would be my next thing.

39:00.560 --> 39:04.440
Temperature sensors, just getting them replaced, just phasing out the Z wave stuff. So if you

39:04.440 --> 39:08.360
got any tips out there, let me know. Of course you can always tell us in person because the

39:08.360 --> 39:15.400
West coast meetups are coming up soon to details at meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting.

39:15.400 --> 39:19.720
We have a lot of events. We have a Southern Oregon event. We have a Northern California

39:19.720 --> 39:24.400
event. We have a Southern California event. Um, we have random meetups we'll do called

39:24.400 --> 39:28.880
micro meetups as we're going down the road. And we have all of them listed out at meetup.com

39:28.880 --> 39:34.360
slash Jupiter broadcasting, finalizing the details right now, as Alex and I are recording,

39:34.360 --> 39:39.960
the wife lady is chatting with our insiders in our matrix West coast crew room, bit.ly

39:39.960 --> 39:46.000
slash West coast crew. And they're in there chatting details. We were all set and ready

39:46.000 --> 39:49.920
to go to McMinnimans in Portland. We have a listener that works there that invited us

39:49.920 --> 39:53.840
and even offered a spot for juxtapark. Like sweet, right? And we're like, awesome. This

39:53.840 --> 39:58.480
is going to be great. We'll get like, you know, the inside scoop because the guy works

39:58.480 --> 40:02.840
there. And then as they're figuring out details, we realized there's like a really well known

40:02.840 --> 40:07.760
band coming in that night and the place is going to be absolutely slammed. And that's

40:07.760 --> 40:12.560
the kind of details we just wouldn't know unless we were talking to locals in that matrix

40:12.560 --> 40:16.760
chat room. And so we caught that and we're pivoting and we're figuring that out. But

40:16.760 --> 40:20.960
those kinds of little details, they save the day. So if you're on the West coast and you're

40:20.960 --> 40:24.880
going to be anywhere near where we're doing a meetup, we could use your brain bit.ly slash

40:24.880 --> 40:29.880
West coast crew. I think the JPL by the time we do the next episode, we'll have the JPL

40:29.880 --> 40:32.600
names too for folks that are making it. Alex will be there.

40:32.600 --> 40:36.720
Yeah. Yeah. You try and stop me. I think you'll be at the Southern meetup too that we have

40:36.720 --> 40:38.560
outside of the JPL event as well.

40:38.560 --> 40:44.200
Yeah, hopefully I'm going to be trying to do I think three or four days in the LA Pasadena

40:44.200 --> 40:49.700
area around the meetup. So really looking forward to it. Yeah, must be honest.

40:49.700 --> 40:52.520
It's going to be nerdy. It's going to be fun. It's going to be good to get together and

40:52.520 --> 40:54.960
hopefully it won't be so hot.

40:54.960 --> 41:01.920
I'm just taking a sip from my Pop OS mug glass that I got on our last factory tour. I don't

41:01.920 --> 41:07.200
wish to poo poo system 76 because that was a really fun tour. But I think JPL might be

41:07.200 --> 41:09.500
slightly cooler. Just a little bit.

41:09.500 --> 41:14.880
It's going to be a real memory now, but it's cool. Let's be fair. So I've reached into

41:14.880 --> 41:17.840
our boost bag and I've pulled out like our top five boost this week. These aren't all

41:17.840 --> 41:23.240
of them, but we did 100% read all of them. So thank you everybody who boosted in. We're

41:23.240 --> 41:26.560
just going to pick a few of them this week to keep things moving. Prozac boosted in with

41:26.560 --> 41:32.400
a row of ducks, 2222 sats with his new podcast app. He says, hello guys. I'm listening to

41:32.400 --> 41:37.760
episode 77 about the constant issues with home assistant. Have you considered moving

41:37.760 --> 41:43.720
to something like Hubitat? They sell an AIO hub with Z-Wave and Zigbee built in. It's

41:43.720 --> 41:48.280
a full device ready to go. The platform has allowed me to focus on the automation aspects

41:48.280 --> 41:53.780
rather than managing has and everything is locally processed. And I went and looked.

41:53.780 --> 41:56.920
They have a device like ready to go. Alex. I don't know. It doesn't seem like the solution

41:56.920 --> 42:02.720
for me. I like having my own hardware, but has the idea of switching away from home assistant

42:02.720 --> 42:06.240
crossed your mind at all? Or is that just not an area you're willing to go to? It's

42:06.240 --> 42:10.600
crossed my mind typically when I'm talking to you because you're a cranky old man about

42:10.600 --> 42:16.000
it these days. But I don't know, maybe we should get some hardware in for testing, right?

42:16.000 --> 42:20.600
Maybe maybe we should write it off as a tax write off or something, get it in for testing

42:20.600 --> 42:25.200
or something like that. Hubitat, reach out. We'll give it. I would give it a test. Cost

42:25.200 --> 42:31.000
peel in, boosted in with 36,900 sats. He says, hey, self-hosters, I need to confess. I'm

42:31.000 --> 42:36.040
one of the lizard people. I mean, it's a Soos user. I found Linux when I was 15 years or

42:36.040 --> 42:41.600
something like that. You're old. I was at the Sea Scouts and my troop leader used Soos

42:41.600 --> 42:46.240
version 9.2. That started my adventure and I never looked back. It was Windows XP days

42:46.240 --> 42:51.320
back then. I learned VMware, then Docker. And I know you guys these days talk a lot

42:51.320 --> 42:57.160
about NixOS and friends, but have you tried out Soos in auto? Yes. It's become my standard.

42:57.160 --> 43:02.800
Thanks for the work. Yeah, we actually got a lot of people who are Soos fans in the audience.

43:02.800 --> 43:09.000
I guess people like it for their home labs because also Colin boosted with 5,436 sats.

43:09.000 --> 43:14.840
I also wanted to give a big thumbs up for open Soos. It's easy to use and powerful.

43:14.840 --> 43:19.400
It's been the center of my home lab and home automation. You know, Soos was one of the

43:19.400 --> 43:24.440
early distros to let you like define how you wanted everything set up in that auto yast.

43:24.440 --> 43:28.300
So I guess I kind of see why it could be a good home lab. It just feels like things have

43:28.300 --> 43:34.360
moved on, but they must be very stable because you never hear any drama about Soosie, do

43:34.360 --> 43:38.600
you? Never. You don't hear people like my Soos machine died. You're right. Colin also

43:38.600 --> 43:43.560
gives a big plus one to the Aquaria Zigbee temp sensors. He says he uses them and the

43:43.560 --> 43:50.720
battery seemed to last. So, OK, do you like them? Colin likes them. I really wanted the

43:50.720 --> 43:55.160
Shelly one to work with the E Ink display. I really wanted that to be the one I use everywhere

43:55.160 --> 43:59.680
because I like having that display. I could almost I mean, I bought a couple of them so

43:59.680 --> 44:05.880
I could just use them for that. And then Purple Dog boosted in with our last boost, 2,500

44:05.880 --> 44:10.600
sats. OK, I was listening to the section where you guys were talking about dying and leaving

44:10.600 --> 44:15.720
access to your loved ones while I was doing some housework. I slipped over and I narrowly

44:15.720 --> 44:20.480
avoided cracking my head on the freezer. So he decided it might be a sign he should boost

44:20.480 --> 44:21.480
in.

44:21.480 --> 44:22.480
Forshadowing much?

44:22.480 --> 44:27.800
We got a row of ducks from user 604 who recommended people check out Mikrotik routers, which he

44:27.800 --> 44:35.920
has been managing with Ansible. And then we got 1,101 sats from a deck bot who suggested

44:35.920 --> 44:42.560
the Pi 4 Compute Module 4 with OpenWRT installed on it for a router for me. That's kind of

44:42.560 --> 44:46.200
clever. He says you get the GUI, you get the SSH, and you can actually configure with Ansible

44:46.200 --> 44:51.760
scripts too. OK, I like the idea of using because I bought the Compute Module 4 and

44:51.760 --> 44:56.960
the carrier board specifically to be a router. I hadn't even thought about OpenWRT on there,

44:56.960 --> 45:00.480
to be honest with you, and I'm sort of silly because I've actually I really liked it on

45:00.480 --> 45:01.480
that slate.

45:01.480 --> 45:05.560
I forgot it was even a thing, even though it's on that GL Inet slate thing that I use

45:05.560 --> 45:06.560
as well.

45:06.560 --> 45:07.560
Which has been great.

45:07.560 --> 45:08.560
So, yeah.

45:08.560 --> 45:10.560
Hey, if it's good enough for Starlink.

45:10.560 --> 45:16.160
Right. It's true. They're using it on theirs. Rusta Castaversa also boosted in 2600 sats.

45:16.160 --> 45:19.480
And it sounds like he's going to be clipping episodes for us from time to time. And he

45:19.480 --> 45:26.640
already has been whenever Fountain FM's transcription is working. So he has clips from various J.B.

45:26.640 --> 45:31.480
shows and other podcasts. And I'll put a link to his Fountain FM profile for Rusta Castaversa

45:31.480 --> 45:36.200
if you'd like to follow him and get clips from self-hosted and whatnots, which I think

45:36.200 --> 45:37.200
is great.

45:37.200 --> 45:41.160
I think we need more of that in podcasts because I've been discovering a lot of shows via clips.

45:41.160 --> 45:47.120
A lot of these new podcast apps, newpodcastapps.com, support clips because that's part of the podcasting

45:47.120 --> 45:52.640
2.0 standard. And I have a whole new batch of podcasts I'm listening to because I heard

45:52.640 --> 45:53.640
their clips first.

45:53.640 --> 45:58.480
So thank you, Rusta Casta. If you want to get a new podcast app and boost in newpodcastapps.com,

45:58.480 --> 46:05.400
get one that supports boosts or try out Breeze, B-R-E-E-Z dot technology. Now we've got a

46:05.400 --> 46:07.720
little sneak peek at what's coming up.

46:07.720 --> 46:12.560
That's right. I was lucky enough to get a notification just in time from Newegg this

46:12.560 --> 46:20.260
week that their Intel Arc GPU shipment, the ASRock A380s, was live. And I got in the pre-order

46:20.260 --> 46:24.840
queue and I was fast enough, I guess, because it shipped this morning.

46:24.840 --> 46:26.920
Wow. And it's now out of stock again.

46:26.920 --> 46:33.360
Yep. Already. That's great. Yeah. So I pre-ordered one for the show. It's $140 plus tax. I think

46:33.360 --> 46:37.880
it came to about 155 ships or something, which is not too bad. And I'll tell you why I'm

46:37.880 --> 46:47.200
excited about this, self-hosters. It's because the Intel iGPU that is on my CPU is with QuickSync

46:47.200 --> 46:52.520
been such a game changer for me for hardware transcoding purposes. You know, I use it for

46:52.520 --> 46:58.600
my Blue Iris box. I use it for Plex and Jellyfin. Sometimes I even use it for batch transcoding

46:58.600 --> 47:02.400
jobs. Like before I got on the plane, I just queued up a bunch of stuff with FFmpeg and

47:02.400 --> 47:07.920
it just worked great. And I'll tell you why I'm super excited about these Intel Arc GPUs.

47:07.920 --> 47:13.200
It's because they have QuickSync hardware built into them, including the brand new AV1

47:13.200 --> 47:18.000
codecs. And so I'm really looking forward to putting this through its paces. I'm hoping

47:18.000 --> 47:22.000
I'm going to be able to do some GPU pass-through with it and eventually get rid of my Blue

47:22.000 --> 47:29.040
Iris dedicated box and then just have the Windows VM with this GPU. And if it all works,

47:29.040 --> 47:33.280
you will hear all about it on the show and it will be coming up over the next few episodes.

47:33.280 --> 47:36.360
I hope we hear about it if it doesn't work too.

47:36.360 --> 47:40.640
With the state of the Intel Arc drivers by all accounts, that's probably the likely scenario

47:40.640 --> 47:42.040
to start with.

47:42.040 --> 47:46.720
Wow. I'm really glad you were able to get one before they were out of stock again. That

47:46.720 --> 47:52.120
is so cool. Well, if you are listening and thinking, I hope they're not wrapping up.

47:52.120 --> 47:56.400
Well, I've got bad news for you. We are, unless you're a member, because our members get a

47:56.400 --> 48:01.600
