1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,540
Coming up on today's show, we get fancy with traffic labels and then gush over

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:07,200
some of the new home assistant features while we save our data from certain

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:07,620
failure.

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,080
I'm Chris and I'm Alex, and this is self hosted.

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,620
I'm so excited.

6
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:14,500
Autumn is here.

7
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,720
The fall is here.

8
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,800
I'm wearing jeans today for the first time in five months.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,200
Yeah.

10
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,040
I'm wearing pants too.

11
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,620
And I don't typically podcast with pants.

12
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:23,520
I love that.

13
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,520
That's a thing.

14
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,040
I don't typically podcast with pants.

15
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:28,200
It's too warm.

16
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,680
You know, a gentleman wants to be comfortable, so that way his

17
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,920
analysis is comfortable.

18
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,520
You got nothing.

19
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,200
You're just thinking back over all the episodes, pantless.

20
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,320
Hey, I didn't say I'm not wearing shorts, Alex.

21
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,080
You know, I'm not saying I was thinking that you do what you're thinking with

22
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,160
your dick, so you've got to keep that at the correct temperature.

23
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,200
And well, let's just say I can't think if it's too warm, but then thought

24
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,480
that probably wasn't, wasn't radio appropriate.

25
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,640
No, of course not.

26
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,360
No, of course not, no, no, of course not.

27
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:03,520
You know, what we ought to do is, uh, maybe not talk about our pants and

28
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,040
instead talk about, you know, self-hosting things.

29
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:12,480
Maybe this episode is brought to you by a cloud guru.

30
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,800
Are you looking to get a high paying career, maybe move into the cloud

31
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,120
and make some good change?

32
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,640
Well, there's no better place to start than getting a certification.

33
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,000
ACG has helped more than 2 million people scale up on the cloud, AWS, Azure,

34
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,920
and Google cloud platform head over to cloud guru.com and get started.

35
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,760
So let's crack things off with a public service announcement.

36
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,120
All right.

37
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:37,640
The Linux server to IO team have made some changes to their reverse proxy.

38
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,400
So for many, many years, they've released a let's encrypt container.

39
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:45,840
Now they've been contacted by let's encrypt to enforce their trademarks.

40
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,000
So they've had to rename it.

41
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,560
They've renamed it swag for secure web application gateway.

42
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,960
Oh, okay.

43
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,040
I thought it was going to be security. We all get, it could be.

44
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,760
I mean, it's an acronym.

45
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,920
It can be whatever you want, right?

46
00:01:59,200 --> 00:01:59,880
I like to think so.

47
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,600
It's a drop in replacement for the existing let's encrypt container.

48
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,040
And there is a blog post linked in the show notes.

49
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:09,680
So if you're running the old one, it's going to stop being updated

50
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,800
in favor of this new one.

51
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,560
Just go ahead and update your compose file or whatever you're doing.

52
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,440
Well, you know, big congratulations to Linux server.io for getting large enough

53
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,160
that they showed up on the trademark radar of let's encrypt.

54
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,920
That's a milestone. I think they're at about 12 billion pulls these days.

55
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,080
So that they're doing pretty well.

56
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,560
Ooh, we, I know I'm one of them.

57
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,960
I just pulled down, uh, my new images for plex, sync thing, and a few other very

58
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,560
handy backend services that are Linux server, IO, Docker images.

59
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:42,440
So I have a link to that, like, like Alex said, self-hosted dot show slash two eight.

60
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,400
We'll talk a little bit more about some new Linux server image

61
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,680
that's been released this week.

62
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:54,480
But first I've been experimenting with traffic, uh, it's spelled T R a E F I K.

63
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,440
So traffic is kind of how it's spelled, but I think everybody just says it traffic.

64
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,080
Yeah.

65
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,880
We've talked about it a little bit before on the show.

66
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,280
Now in the last episode, I mentioned Lychee, which by the way, if you're

67
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,720
American is pronounced leechy and if you're from the UK is pronounced Lychee.

68
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,000
I went on Wikipedia and checked.

69
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,840
Oh, that's, that's not confusing at all.

70
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,320
Okay.

71
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,720
Potato, potato anyway, right?

72
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:20,640
So I started building out some infrastructure using our new sponsor Linode.

73
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,200
I was using Ansible and Terraform to do this.

74
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:27,680
And one of the things that I like to do is use ginger templating

75
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,000
to create my Docker compose files.

76
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,960
This means I can store all of my container variables in Ansible, run it

77
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,240
through the ginger templating engine, and it spits out a Docker compose

78
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,200
file on the other side.

79
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,120
Now, when I was using engine X as my reverse proxy, I was using

80
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,600
engine X as my reverse proxy.

81
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,880
It meant I had to also have an Ansible role that copied across and installed

82
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,880
the relevant engine X configuration files.

83
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:55,680
And for anybody that's ever worked with those files, they can be a little

84
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,680
bit picky and a little bit cryptic.

85
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,680
The best thing, the single best thing about traffic is that all of the

86
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:08,520
configuration now for my reverse proxy lives alongside each container as a label.

87
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,200
Yeah.

88
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,440
Talk about this label thing because I'm not a traffic expert, but that's

89
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,880
my essential understanding is that it sort of assigns what you

90
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,080
can do based on your label.

91
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,080
Correct.

92
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,360
I'm still wrapping my head around it.

93
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:20,880
Right.

94
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:24,000
And it's something I've been using for about a month now.

95
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,280
I had a lot of help with some of the guys on discord in particular.

96
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,720
I know I seem to mention discord every week, but it's a lot going on over there.

97
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,600
That's where the fun is.

98
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:39,800
So I've, I've put together a kind of beginner's guide to traffic,

99
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,600
but not as a blog post for once.

100
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:47,360
What I've actually done is I've just put a, a compose file in my infrastructure repo.

101
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,160
Oh, okay.

102
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:48,720
I'll put on GitHub.

103
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,360
And a link to that of course is in the show notes.

104
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:57,360
And in there, what you can hopefully see is just how simple this thing is to configure.

105
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,880
So you define a series of routers and services.

106
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,600
And as part of those routers and services, you define the host name and

107
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,120
the entry point you want to use.

108
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,960
So for, for me, I use Cloudflare for my DNS.

109
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:15,400
So traffic will automatically talk to Cloudflare as part of the ACME process to

110
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,800
get my TLS certificates from Let's Encrypt.

111
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:23,880
So I tell each container to use that particular certificate resolver, Cloudflare.

112
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:28,000
And then from there, I tell the router which service to use.

113
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,840
So for example, for NGINX, if I'm running that as a container behind traffic would

114
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:38,360
be on port 80 or Plex would be on three to 400, for example, and it's just super simple.

115
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,040
And where are you defining this?

116
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,040
Where does that information get stored?

117
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,160
What, what mechanism?

118
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,320
That's the best part.

119
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,760
So with NGINX, for example, it would be in a Docker volume that I would mount

120
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:56,000
through a bind mount system to my container, and then those reverse proxy

121
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,400
configuration files need to persist on my host, right with traffic.

122
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,760
It's a label that lives in the Docker compose file.

123
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:08,480
So right next to where I'm saying, I want to run, you know, Linux

124
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:13,160
server slash Plex, for example, I then have a label section with five lines

125
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:19,360
in it that says traffic enable true use this host name, so Plex dot KTZ dot

126
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,160
whatever use this entry point of web secure.

127
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:28,080
So HTTPS, for example, and then use the cert resolver of Cloudflare.

128
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,160
This is the fourth line.

129
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,560
And then the fifth line is use port three to 400.

130
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,000
And it's just right there.

131
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,760
It's simple.

132
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,280
It's easy to read YAML that's just in the Docker compose file.

133
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:41,200
And I think that's the part that really has to be underscored.

134
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,480
And it's so tidy because it's right there with all of the other

135
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,120
information about that container.

136
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:51,600
It's easy to read, easy to replicate and associated and attached with that container.

137
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:57,640
And because it's in that single file, if I commit that single file to get, I have

138
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:02,440
a history forever until the end of time, exactly what my configuration parameters

139
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,200
worth for that specific container.

140
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,920
Whereas if I'm relying on a bunch of different files that are on my file

141
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:13,520
system in different directories and stuff like that, who's to say that my Ansible

142
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,960
role don't have a bug in it that doesn't overwrite that particular file when I

143
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,560
changed the name of the container or whatever it is, there's just a whole bunch

144
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:26,360
of edge case scenarios that this solves for me and I absolutely love it.

145
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,000
How are you choosing what gets committed to Git?

146
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,320
Are you, is it every config file?

147
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,760
Are you hand committing certain config files?

148
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,480
What's the system there?

149
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,320
Well, I have a blog post about working with Ansible and secrets.

150
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:44,680
The short version of that is I use the Ansible vault functionality to encrypt

151
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:51,040
a couple of files in my repo, all of the secret source lives in that encrypted

152
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:58,120
file, Ansible then interpolates through its templating engines, those variables

153
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:03,160
into the playbooks when it runs, Ansible looks for a specific variable.

154
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,120
If it can't find it in a decrypted file, it will go to the encrypted

155
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,200
file and look for it.

156
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,120
And so for me, I generally tend to go with the appropriate

157
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:18,120
tend to go with the approach that anything that's personally identifiable,

158
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:24,440
like an IP address or a serial number or an API key, obviously is secret.

159
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:28,760
Just anything that I would rather somebody else didn't know, I tend to put

160
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:33,120
in the vault file and then use my Ansible roles to decrypt.

161
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:37,920
Now, the downside of that is it means it has to live in plain

162
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:42,680
text on disk somewhere, but the reality of being a sysadmin is that at

163
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:46,280
some point somewhere, something's got to be in clear text.

164
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,480
Somebody has to have the ultimate password somewhere.

165
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:54,600
Even if it's in your brain, encryption is, is great, but at some, some point

166
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,360
somewhere, somebody needs the key to that vault.

167
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,240
Well, that's pretty cool, Alex.

168
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,040
I like that I can just go in here and read this.

169
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:05,080
And that also makes it very easy for me to get started because this, being able

170
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,440
to actually see this example here, which we'll have linked in the show notes.

171
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,440
Really makes it click for me.

172
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,440
Like the, cause the other thing we haven't even talked about is the

173
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:17,160
user front end web UI to traffic and all of that stuff, but fully understanding

174
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,920
how I label stuff in Docker compose kind of completes my understanding.

175
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,560
And now I really kind of see why people are talking about traffic.

176
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,680
It looks really nice.

177
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,760
It was a big change in how traffic defined their routers and services

178
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:34,120
and front ends and back ends between V1 and V2.

179
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,480
Now we're talking about V2, the current release.

180
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:42,240
Now in V1 times that I just wrote them off as cluttering my doc compose file.

181
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,000
I didn't want that.

182
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,600
I didn't want that clutter in my, in my file, but as I've kind of matured

183
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,120
my approach to, you know, configuring all these different systems, I now

184
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,440
have my personal server at home.

185
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,760
I have a cloud instance that I configure that runs all my websites, you know,

186
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,840
my blog and stuff like that, and some stuff for my family as well.

187
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,920
I then have the self-hosted infrastructure and a couple of

188
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,800
other things I also look after.

189
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:11,960
By the time I'm scaling this to five, six, seven different sites, it's

190
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:16,120
just really nice to have one single source of truth be that compose file.

191
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:16,640
Yep.

192
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,520
Amen to that.

193
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,360
That's how I feel too.

194
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,920
Well, you heard Alex mentioned it.

195
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:21,800
We use it.

196
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,360
We love it.

197
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:28,800
Linode, linode.com slash SSH, get a $100 60 day credit on new accounts.

198
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,400
And here's a little pro tip.

199
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:36,480
Linode just posted a guide on using object storage as a backend storage

200
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,360
mechanism for next cloud, where you can kind of just have unlimited space, but

201
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:46,240
you also take advantage of their crazy fast storage and it's what we use.

202
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,120
It's how we do it here at Jupiter broadcasting.

203
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,840
And so I'm going to put a link to this in the show notes because Linode is

204
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,880
simple cloud infrastructure that you can spin up for anything you need.

205
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,960
A shared host is something with dedicated GPUs or CPUs.

206
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:02,120
Everything's priced really reasonable and they have a cloud management

207
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,320
UI to take care of all of it.

208
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,960
You just get started by going to linode.com slash SSH.

209
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,480
You mentioned Alex, that you were deploying some systems

210
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,640
with Terraform on Linode.

211
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,800
What's that process like?

212
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,440
It's been really, really easy.

213
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:19,280
Actually, the documentation up on Terraform providers website is very

214
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,880
well-written, very well-documented.

215
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,880
And if you would like to see a full example, of course, there's a link

216
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,400
in the show notes to the self-hosted infrastructure repo that I'm using.

217
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,960
Uh, and in there it's, it's just been really simple, really

218
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,960
straightforward to get started.

219
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,120
That's nice.

220
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,520
That is really nice because you can plug it in with an orchestrated

221
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,160
and orchestration switch you're already using or take advantage

222
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,720
of the tools that they have.

223
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:45,640
And what's great about Linode is they're the largest independent open cloud

224
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,760
provider in the world with 11 global data centers.

225
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,760
Linode has been around for about as long as user mode Linux has been around.

226
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,200
Their founder saw the opportunity and built something that was accessible

227
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,800
for just about everyone, just about everywhere.

228
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,560
So go to linode.com slash SSH to get started and then check out

229
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,920
the app marketplace, for example.

230
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,560
An easy way to self-host your own applications and get started

231
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,600
with their stack scripts.

232
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:13,560
Another nice way to build a quick and easy system, reproducible, easy system.

233
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:17,320
I just recently decided I'm going to set up a dedicated SSH jump host.

234
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,480
At first it sounds kind of crazy, but then I realized at $5 a month, I can

235
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,520
really go all in on the security on this box, maybe even kind of as a

236
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,640
learning opportunity, and it'll be my jump host system to get

237
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,760
around wherever I need to go.

238
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,440
That's a great use for the $5 a month system.

239
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:38,000
But our matrix box that runs the Jupiter broadcasting matrix server.

240
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,600
That's a little more powerful.

241
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,840
We went ahead and did a dedicated CPU for that one because there's hundreds

242
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,240
of users using that system.

243
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,720
And that's the great thing about Linode.

244
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,360
They've been around for a long time.

245
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,760
They're the largest independent open cloud provider, and they've got a great

246
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,840
pricing structure and a very competitive dashboard.

247
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,840
You got to go check them out.

248
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:58,880
Linode.com slash SSH and a big thank you to Linode for sponsoring

249
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,960
the self-hosted program.

250
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:05,640
Last week, we celebrated our birthday and this week it's home assistant's birthday.

251
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:06,080
Yeah.

252
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,200
Only we get the presents.

253
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,080
How great is that?

254
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,800
We get all the new stuff.

255
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,880
This is one of those things like before the show, Alex and I were like, how do we

256
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:18,320
cover this because we could probably, I bet you make two episodes out of just

257
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,840
the updates in this one release.

258
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,280
This was a really big one.

259
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,280
So we thought maybe instead we'd just pull out like two or three of like the

260
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:30,000
heavy hitters and just talk about those and then link you to the resources.

261
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,400
For those of you that haven't listened to the show for a while, Alex and

262
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,520
I, big home assistant users.

263
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,480
In fact, I use it more than ever these days.

264
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,160
I don't know about you.

265
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,160
I think you too, Alex, right?

266
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:39,720
Huge.

267
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,200
Continual.

268
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:40,760
Huge.

269
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,560
I love the home assistant.

270
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,040
Well, the home assistant has the new release and I think probably the thing

271
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,160
you're excited about, the thing I'm looking forward to is NFC tag support.

272
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,360
I think that's going to be a big deal.

273
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,160
Mm-hmm.

274
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,560
It's really, really easy.

275
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,760
It's really, really easy as well.

276
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:01,000
So they've updated the companion apps that run on iOS and Android.

277
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,920
So you can actually write the NFC tags directly from the app on your phone.

278
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:09,320
And then as soon as you scan it, you can assign automations to it.

279
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,880
So as part of this release this week, the automation engine

280
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,440
has had a complete overhaul.

281
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:18,000
So now the YAML based automation stuff is a lot better than it used to be.

282
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:23,200
And so one of the things I've decided to do is stick an NFC tag on the outside of

283
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,960
my house so I can tap my phone to the outside of my house and have it open

284
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,440
my garage door, for example.

285
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:32,800
Can't tell you the number of times I've been outside my house without my keys

286
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:37,160
thinking I need to get in, but my keys are on the inside and the only door

287
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,960
that's open is the back door, but I want to go in the front door right now.

288
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,560
And this should be a solved problem.

289
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,040
And I want to be lazy, dang it.

290
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,400
No, I, I completely agree.

291
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:51,960
So the, the mixer I have here, the Behringer X32 has a built-in

292
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,400
spot for your cell phone.

293
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,160
It's weird.

294
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,840
I've never seen a mixer that does this, but it actually has a little spot for

295
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,200
you to place your cell phone on the mixer.

296
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,160
And that's because it has, I think a mobile app where you can control

297
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,320
some of the mixer settings.

298
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:08,240
You know what I did put a little NFC tag right in that spot.

299
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,560
So when I set my phone down in its holder on the mixer, it turns on my

300
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,520
lights, it changes the colors.

301
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,600
It just sort of gets things ready to go.

302
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,000
So I don't have to come in here and, you know, I don't even have to speak to

303
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,040
the, to a, to an echo or anything.

304
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,920
It just put it right down there and it communicates with the home assistant

305
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:24,760
we have here at the studio.

306
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,600
I love this feature and I'm going to do the same thing.

307
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,320
I'm going to put a little tag outside.

308
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,920
I'd like to find a black colored NFC tag.

309
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,640
All the ones I have right now are white stickers.

310
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,840
I found some heavy duty outdoor grade ones.

311
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,680
Oh, really?

312
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,680
They're about a buck each.

313
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,880
So they're quite expensive for NFC tags.

314
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,480
It's okay.

315
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,040
It's got to survive going down the road and in the rain.

316
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,120
So I'll put a link in the show notes.

317
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:46,720
Okay.

318
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,280
That'd be great.

319
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:47,440
Yeah.

320
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,840
That's the kind of thing I think I want to do is put something outside and

321
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,120
just turn lights on and whatnot.

322
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:56,320
You know, I came up with quite a fun thing to automate in this house.

323
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,440
My wife loves classical music and I love sort of rock music, you know, like tool

324
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,560
and green day and stuff like that.

325
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:06,200
And so when we're cooking, we both generally want the opposite person's

326
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,080
playlist to never be in existence.

327
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:13,600
And so I've 3d printed a violin and a guitar, and I've put the NFC tags on the

328
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,760
back of these 3d printed things.

329
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:19,760
I just tap the thing that I want and it plays it through Spotify,

330
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,800
through my Google home in the kitchen.

331
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,520
That is a clever idea.

332
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,880
I like the use of the 3d icon really to drive it home.

333
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,720
Makes it a physical thing you're touching.

334
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,320
Yeah.

335
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,640
And then the other thing I've done is when it's been day, we have a little

336
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:39,800
picture of a, a bin, which I've 3d printed again and put next to the bins in the

337
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,200
kitchen.

338
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,800
So we tap that and it turns all the lights in the whole house on so we can walk

339
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,600
around for 20 minutes, empty all the bins.

340
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,120
Uh, but then it also turns on the driveway lights, opens the garage door.

341
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,040
Uh, so you don't have to do anything.

342
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,600
The house is just ready for you to go out.

343
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,160
Cause you know what?

344
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,560
When you're in the, emptying the bins, you know what you're going to do.

345
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,760
You're going to walk around, empty the bins, then go outside, put it in the big

346
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,840
plastic ones outside, put them at the end of your driveway and then come back in

347
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,120
again.

348
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,120
Yeah, that's fantastic.

349
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:09,000
I have a series of like outdoor lights and a couple of other things that I need

350
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,440
to quickly take down and pack up.

351
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:14,520
And what I have to do now is that when I'm outside, I have to bring out

352
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:18,240
my phone and I re I load the home assistant UI, and then I tap them off

353
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,320
before I unplug them all.

354
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,280
So that way they're in an off state when I remove them from the network and I

355
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,560
could just put an NFC tag out there and just totally do it that way.

356
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,880
You totally could.

357
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,160
Yeah.

358
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:33,360
The magic part is with this bin automation.

359
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:38,560
I'm very proud of this one is when it starts, it takes like a snapshot of the

360
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,360
current scene of the house.

361
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:46,000
So all the lights that are currently on are stored to a temporary state.

362
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:50,760
If you're like a temporary scene 20 minutes later, when the bin automation

363
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:55,400
finishes, that scene gets recalled on the house, just returns to how it was before.

364
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,440
Oh, so the previous state is restored.

365
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,400
That's great.

366
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:00,800
That is nice.

367
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:04,280
That's a real, that's see, now you're getting fancy with the automations with

368
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,840
the 3d printing and the restoring the previous state.

369
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,400
Like that's next level stuff there.

370
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,320
Guy gets bored, particularly in lockdown.

371
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:10,960
Yeah.

372
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,560
And we love ourselves some home assistance.

373
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:18,800
So the other thing that, uh, is noteworthy for Mac users and perhaps an indication

374
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:22,360
of the knock-on effects of the upcoming Apple ecosystem with ARM processors in

375
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:27,960
the Macs too, but home assistant companion app for the Mac is now a reality.

376
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:32,400
It's early, it's rough, but the thing that's neat here, and I'd like to put a

377
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,480
call out to the audience to see if we can pull this off for Linux is one of the

378
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:42,240
many things this companion app can do on the Mac OS is observe the state of the

379
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,920
Mac cause the Mac has several conditions in use idle screensaver sleeping, and it

380
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:50,200
could turn those into sensors into home assistant among other things.

381
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,720
There's other things that it's monitoring as well as sensor inputs to home

382
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:57,000
assistant to help automate things around when you're using your computer.

383
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,800
I love this idea and I'd like to apply it to other desktops.

384
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:05,720
It can detect which Mike, which webcam is in use when you're on a particular

385
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:10,640
zoom call or something, you could have a light outside of your office that turns

386
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,640
red that says, I am on the phone, be quiet, stop making noise or, you know, like me.

387
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:18,800
I mean, I'm that guy, but I have like lights and stuff in the background for

388
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,880
my zoom calls, you know, I try to make it look presentable.

389
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,040
You could have that stuff turn on when the mic activates.

390
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,320
Is there a word for that?

391
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,640
I feel like it's going to be added to the dictionary soon.

392
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:29,520
It's like peacocking, but on zoom, do you know what I mean?

393
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:29,840
Yeah.

394
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,400
Like zoom fronting, backgrounding.

395
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,640
That'd be better zoom backgrounding.

396
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:33,880
Yeah.

397
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,160
Of course, most people these days just go with the virtual backgrounds.

398
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,360
So that's, that's neat.

399
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:42,120
It's a, it's an official release from the, from the project, but you know, just

400
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:46,000
as an aside and maybe ultimately more important for new users, cause I played

401
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,400
around with this and it's pretty powerful.

402
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:54,000
There is a new feature that allows you to add Lovelace cards, which is the dashboard

403
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,560
UI of home assistant by entity.

404
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:03,240
And what that means is you can select a sensor or a camera feed or power source

405
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:07,920
or power switch and home assistant will suss out what the functionality of that

406
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:12,200
is supposed to be and automatically generate you a dashboard card for it.

407
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,720
And so you don't have to appreciate or understand how these are constructed

408
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,120
anymore.

409
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:19,000
You just look at your entities like myself.

410
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:22,720
I've never built dashboard entries for my seismic sensors.

411
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,360
I just never got around to it.

412
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,200
I knew the data was getting logged.

413
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,000
I was happy with that.

414
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,680
However, I thought, well, why, why not?

415
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,760
I never really quite knew how to do that.

416
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:36,040
So I went in by entity, selected my seismic sensors and home assistant just

417
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,680
generated me a brilliant dashboard widget for it, a Lovelace card.

418
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:40,840
And it's great.

419
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:45,320
And you can do the same thing with new integrations just to get an idea of what

420
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,160
home assistant thinks you might be able to do with them.

421
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:51,280
I did that with the ring camera, which has limited functionality if you don't

422
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,920
pay for the service, but it's still useful integrating into home assistant.

423
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,720
And I didn't really know what you could do there.

424
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,360
So I just added that entity and let it generate one for me.

425
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:58,840
Yeah.

426
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,640
I think we should talk more about that ring stuff in the future.

427
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:05,520
There's a whole world of cloud connected stuff.

428
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,440
It's actually pretty cool that we don't touch on that often.

429
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,400
Yeah, I agree.

430
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,040
Some of that cloud stuff is expensive.

431
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:15,920
Like the ring products themselves, not a cheap product longterm, but they

432
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:20,840
have a pretty low upfront cost and initial indications are they integrate

433
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,240
pretty well with home assistant.

434
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,680
If you guys are out there experimenting with that, let us know, because I do feel

435
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:30,280
like it's a blind spot of ours a little bit big congratulations to the home

436
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,360
assistant for their seventh birthday release.

437
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,360
Huge, huge amount of work must be going into this project.

438
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:41,200
I'm so glad that it exists because it just makes so many things that you would

439
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,720
have had to buy proprietary stuff for possible.

440
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,840
I'm so thankful.

441
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,280
So thank you home assistant.

442
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,800
Now let's talk about scrutiny.

443
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:52,360
This is a project that could help bring visibility to something that I often

444
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,520
forget to check in on.

445
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,760
You think you're so smart.

446
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,440
Oh yeah.

447
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,240
Well, at least my hard drives do, but of course, what does it matter if nobody's

448
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,720
ever checking their smart status?

449
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,320
Correct.

450
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:01,640
Yes.

451
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:06,840
So one of our community members, Analog J has released a new tool called scrutiny.

452
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:12,760
And this is designed to monitor your hard drive smart metrics, but

453
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,960
here's the really cool part.

454
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:19,360
It uses the real world failure rates published by black blaze to tell you

455
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:23,440
whether that is in line with what other people who have those hard drives are

456
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:23,840
seeing.

457
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:24,680
Yes.

458
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:30,280
And it puts it all together in a very easy to read dashboard with a brilliant

459
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:30,680
layout.

460
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,920
So it's super easy to consume the information.

461
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,280
This is a great idea, Alex.

462
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:35,960
Yeah, it is.

463
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,600
And I nearly lost my freaking mind when I first saw this on Reddit.

464
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:43,840
Analog J was asking for 25 sponsors before he made this public and open source.

465
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,080
And he got there last week.

466
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:48,920
And as soon as he went open source, one of the Linux server devs reached out to me

467
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,800
and said, Hey, do you think we could release this as a container?

468
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:56,200
So I put those two people together and they put the PB and the J in the sandwich.

469
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:00,600
And there's now a Linux server container for scrutiny.

470
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:04,040
Oh, so I could put this easy peasy on the studio NAS.

471
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,160
I need to as well.

472
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,880
Cause those drives are getting a few years old, like they're getting in that

473
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,160
zone.

474
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:13,800
So being able to compare that to the mean from black blaze, well, that's either

475
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,600
going to make me accelerate my plan to replace them or give me some comfort.

476
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,160
I'm not sure.

477
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,520
Now it's still early days with the project.

478
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,840
You know, there's still a few buttons and knobs and widgets that don't work yet.

479
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:27,120
And he's adding to it all the time, but, uh, if you find it useful, go open some

480
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:31,160
issues, give him some feedback, come find him in the discord, tell him what you

481
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:35,400
want to see, because I think something like this is sorely needed for those of

482
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,040
us that aren't running on raid or free NAS or something like that.

483
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:41,800
And, uh, it just looks like a really great project.

484
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:47,360
The UI is beautiful and the information it provides is really, really useful.

485
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,840
So yeah, and it's using smart D on the backend.

486
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:55,440
So it's getting tried and true information from smart D also, we're going to

487
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,480
mention again this week, cloudfree.shop.

488
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,840
Now cloudfree.shop has a wide range of smart home devices.

489
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:04,760
This is a community members project that are pre flashed with Tasmota.

490
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:08,160
And that means no cloud connection is ever required.

491
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:12,440
It means you can just plug it in and guarantee that as long as that device

492
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,520
operates and runs, it is under your control.

493
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:17,040
There is no service that will turn it off and check this out.

494
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,000
This is pretty great.

495
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,120
If you use the code self-hosted to check out, you support the show.

496
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,600
So that's pretty nice.

497
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,240
And do they get anything special when they use that?

498
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:25,800
Yeah.

499
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:30,760
Since last time we've negotiated that the audience will get a dollar off per plug.

500
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,800
Oh, per plug.

501
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,040
So buy a whole bunch.

502
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:34,760
Yeah, right.

503
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:35,760
That's great.

504
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:39,720
Cloudfree.shop is something that Alex and I had talked about on air.

505
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:44,360
It's like, why doesn't somebody just sell these devices preloaded with Tasmota?

506
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:45,720
Yeah, this is just really cool.

507
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,720
Cloudfree.shop, Alex and I have talked about it before and wondered,

508
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,240
why isn't somebody doing this?

509
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,320
Get these things pre flashed with Tasmota and sell it.

510
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,480
And it's pretty good price too.

511
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:58,320
All right.

512
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,480
Time for some feedback, I think.

513
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:04,560
So Alex C writes in in the one is non episode when you were converting

514
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,920
from ext four to butterfs Chris.

515
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:12,320
I was wondering why you don't use Mosh or something like Tmux or screen.

516
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:16,240
The reason I like Mosh is that it covers you if your network connection

517
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,880
drops, or if you're roaming between wifi and mobile internet.

518
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:25,240
And, and I think Alex maybe might have Mosh and Tmux slightly confused

519
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:29,400
if, uh, when you read the full email, but it's a good question because a lot

520
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,600
of mistakes were made that night, Alex, a lot of mistakes.

521
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:35,320
So I generally always do use Mosh.

522
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:40,200
I don't think of it typically when I'm on the land as the same machine

523
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:44,080
that I'm connecting to, although I really should always just be in practice.

524
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,080
But I think my bigger mistake honestly was not using Tmux.

525
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:52,320
See Tmux would keep that session persistent, even if I completely

526
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:57,360
disconnected, right, where Mosh is going to help smooth out disconnects and

527
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,440
interruptions and changing of IP addresses.

528
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,160
So it would have helped, but Tmux would have been the better solution.

529
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:07,520
But that night I just wasn't thinking, I bet you my laptop wasn't even plugged in.

530
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,760
I mean, I was just in a bad state.

531
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:10,760
It was too late.

532
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:15,560
I knew I shouldn't be doing it like in the back of my mind, but I pushed forward

533
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:19,560
because I had ran out of time and I needed to get this done before we left

534
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:27,120
for a trip, if I recall, and made the mistake of not taking the proper process,

535
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:32,120
not taking the proper steps to make sure an SSH remote connection is absolutely

536
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:35,640
as rock solid as possible when doing a major file system operation.

537
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,360
And that's just the fundamental mistake.

538
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,160
I know better.

539
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,080
I knew better.

540
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,120
Thankfully, you know, in the end I was able to recover everything.

541
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:45,800
I remember Alex, how that compounded with an issue where my Google drive

542
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:51,440
payment had expired because my credit card got shut down due to fraud at the

543
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,160
same time.

544
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,680
Oh my God, that was a nightmare.

545
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,800
It was like the perfect storm of data loss.

546
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,400
It was a nightmare.

547
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,400
So like I have learned from that.

548
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:05,240
I constantly check in on that stuff now because I'm, I'm

549
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:09,440
paranoid that that's going to get shut down and fricking fraud happened again.

550
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:15,200
Just about a month ago, my credit card was shut down again, somewhere on one

551
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,600
of my trips, I guess somebody had copied it and then waited quite a while in

552
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,600
Texas to try to use it, but they did eventually try to use it.

553
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:26,640
So the bank cut that off and I had to go through the process all over again, but

554
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,360
this time I made sure that Google drive was paid for.

555
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,800
Fool me once, right?

556
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,240
Right.

557
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:31,840
Exactly.

558
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,120
Yeah.

559
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,000
Mosh is pretty cool.

560
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,800
I've, I've used it a few times.

561
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:38,520
Mostly when I was a consultant traveling around on the trains and stuff in England

562
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:43,160
a lot, perfect for that, relying on, you know, three, three G four G connections

563
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,880
all the time and the reason Mosh feels so nice to use is because all the key

564
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:51,920
strokes are local and then it sort of sends them quietly in the background.

565
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,800
So obviously you might, if you know, you go through a dead patch, you might

566
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:59,720
have to wait for the screen to update on the result of your command.

567
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:03,440
But in terms of what you're typing, which is kind of the biggest indicator

568
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:08,240
of latency, it just feels really responsive and just really nice.

569
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,840
Well, it is it's local echo.

570
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:13,680
So it's, it's locally echoing back to you and then buffering it, which is so clever.

571
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,560
That is really pretty nice.

572
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:19,480
Since then, I am like so good about it.

573
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,880
I don't know if it'll last forever, but it sort of renewed my best practices

574
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,880
when it comes to this stuff.

575
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,280
I was like, Oh, you know, that was the, that was my moment.

576
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,320
That was my lesson.

577
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:33,080
I managed to pull out of it, but I never want that to happen again.

578
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:33,720
Absolutely.

579
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,160
Yeah.

580
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:38,160
I mean, the downside of something like Mosh is that you've got to type

581
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:42,480
Mosh instead of SSH and at this point, SSH is muscle memory for me.

582
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,640
I guess I could use a bash alias, but it also requires Mosh to be installed

583
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,160
on the remote system, which isn't always the case.

584
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,480
Not too hard to do.

585
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,680
You know, it's not a whole bunch of stuff, but it is, but you have

586
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,520
to have it on both ends.

587
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,320
That is very true.

588
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:58,240
I think Tmux, if you're not familiar with Tmux, it's worth looking into.

589
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,440
It's a real neat trick to connect into a server, get a set, get a session running,

590
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:05,440
get a whole bunch of stuff going, and then you can just disconnect and it keeps

591
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:05,960
running.

592
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,960
It's a great way to pair program as well, because if you open two Tmux

593
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,960
sessions on two different systems, they will both update in real time with the

594
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,480
same thing.

595
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,920
Yeah, that's pretty nice.

596
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:19,640
Um, we actually even just use it just recently, Wes and I were messing around

597
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:22,840
with recording audio from the command line and we just use it for working on

598
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,560
that kind of stuff.

599
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:28,960
It's great. So I, I know better anyways, I will, I won't, it won't happen again.

600
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,320
I promise.

601
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,600
But if it does, I will admit it to you guys.

602
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,800
I will come clean on the show.

603
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,200
Yeah, yeah, sure.

604
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:40,800
In future episodes, we're going to take a look at some container dashboards and

605
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:45,840
maybe a look at Caddy, which is another alternative to traffic as a reverse

606
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,360
proxy.

607
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:50,800
But in the meantime, I think it's time we thanked our site reliability engineers.

608
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,400
Don't you, Chris?

609
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,000
Yep.

610
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:57,200
Last episode, we launched the self-hosted site reliability engineers membership.

611
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,560
The folks that help keep this show sustainable, reliable, and fully

612
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,360
operational.

613
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:05,200
I think we still have some early bird SSH codes too.

614
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,440
If you use the promo code SSH, it takes a little bit of money off.

615
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:12,400
So the membership is even, I think a dollar cheaper and you can go to self

616
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:17,000
hosted.show slash SRE to get there and just put the promo code SSH in there.

617
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,400
We've got more show for our members.

618
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,760
We're doing a bonus to post show with every single episode, and we're also

619
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:25,240
doing a limited ad feed for that episode.

620
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:30,240
So it gives you a whole new RSS feed for the show, a fully produced limited

621
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,640
ad with additional bonus content.

622
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:37,440
And that's a thank you to the site reliability engineers who are keeping

623
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,160
the show going.

624
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,240
So big thank you to everybody out there.

625
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,640
And Alex and I are already cooking up new ideas for future membership

626
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,640
content as well.

627
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,760
Self-hosted.show slash SRE.

628
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:47,840
Thank you.

629
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,640
Everybody it's pretty cool, Alex.

630
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:52,160
You know, it's pretty nice seeing that come in because going independent

631
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:56,120
again is scary, but also awesome at the same time.

632
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:59,600
And it's, it's a great representation of audience support too, but we totally

633
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,960
understand not everybody can afford a membership.

634
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:02,960
That's totally cool.

635
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,480
Just listening to the show.

636
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,120
And if maybe a sponsor seems like the right fit or there's somebody you

637
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,280
think you could share the show with.

638
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,680
We really appreciate that support too.

639
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,320
Word of mouth is the best marketing.

640
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:16,520
There is it's like the only marketing that works for me.

641
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:19,280
It's the only marketing that works for podcasts.

642
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,280
It really is.

643
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,280
Mm-hmm.

644
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:25,520
Quick follow up from last episode where Chris, you talked about having to run

645
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:28,200
home to pull in your awning because it got too windy.

646
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,440
We had a few recommendations from the audience.

647
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:30,960
Yeah.

648
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,760
A couple of people.

649
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,720
And I think you and I thought of this right after we wrapped up recommended

650
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,640
the Shelly that crossed our mind as well.

651
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:42,360
But Brian Davenport wrote in with a neat idea of essentially a little wind

652
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:48,880
gauge that would transmit on the 433 megahertz band and it would send the

653
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:53,280
speed to a decoder device that decoder device would monitor the speed.

654
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:57,080
And when it reached a certain percentage or whatever, a certain speed

655
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:00,960
number, it would then trigger a whole sensor switch and close that, which

656
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,960
would then retract it.

657
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,120
The other idea that I had was just check the weather in the morning.

658
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:07,880
Come on.

659
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:08,880
I know.

660
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,760
No, it's not good enough.

661
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:13,240
Well, and you know, what's funny Alex is today as we're recording a

662
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:17,080
construction truck backed up into the pole that has our power transformer

663
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,640
and knocked it over.

664
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,160
And now we have no power, which is fine because we've got plenty of

665
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,120
battery and solar.

666
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,480
The thing is, is nobody's home.

667
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:29,800
We may have left the air conditioning set to automatically kick in and that'll

668
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,160
drain the batteries pretty quick.

669
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,960
And so I got thinking, it's like, you know, what I need is I need the system

670
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,920
to know when it's in a limited power state.

671
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:41,280
And I go back to, I know we have a couple of audience members out there

672
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:45,480
who are pulling this state information from their Victron devices and feeding

673
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,400
it into home assistant.

674
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:51,120
And I remember somebody hooked up a Raspberry Pi to pull in the information

675
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,960
and then essentially MQTT it to home assistance.

676
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:57,240
But I don't recall the details, but all this started flooding back to me

677
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:01,720
when I think about, is there anything I could do to tell the system, Hey,

678
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,080
now you're in battery mode.

679
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,280
Why don't you turn some crap off?

680
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,360
Seems so obvious.

681
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,600
It seems like you need to have your air conditioning on a remote

682
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,160
control as a, as a starting point.

683
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,000
Yeah, I do.

684
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,720
And it's tricky because I don't think it's like a household air conditioner,

685
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:17,920
right?

686
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:21,080
It's a furnace, a fan and AC.

687
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,200
And I imagine it's all DC wiring.

688
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,560
So I'm not, I'm not sure what my options are there either.

689
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,400
You know, it's just one of those things.

690
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:31,960
I think the step one is take the panel off the wall and see what the wires are.

691
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:36,520
You know, when we launched this show, the world was still normal and I was planning

692
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,720
to come out and see you in April.

693
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,600
And we were going to do a whole bunch of these projects.

694
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,200
Yeah.

695
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:40,440
Yeah.

696
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:43,400
Oh, I just want to come out and do half of this stuff for you.

697
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,320
I know it would be great because we could record it.

698
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,200
You know, I can learn a bunch from you.

699
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:51,240
You could see how I do some of my crazy setups and the things I'm trying to solve

700
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:51,720
for.

701
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,640
It would be a lot of fun.

702
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,120
We could try and not get pulled over in the mountains.

703
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,520
We definitely could do that.

704
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,800
That would be a lot of fun.

705
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:03,040
In the meantime, thank you to everyone who sent in some suggestions.

706
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:06,640
If you have Leet Victron knowledge, I would like to pick your brain.

707
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:10,360
So maybe that's my next ask, because we just have the best community ever.

708
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:15,160
Self hosted dot show slash contact, or if you'd like to jump on the discord, self

709
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,280
hosted dot show slash discord.

710
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:19,760
Victron always sounds like it should be like a transformer or something.

711
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,600
It is pretty cool equipment.

712
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:27,080
And the neat thing is I kind of made a bet on this and wasn't sure cause I'd never

713
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:31,280
used any of their equipment before, but I got to say very, very, very satisfied

714
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:31,960
with the purchase.

715
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:38,200
It it's an inverter, charge controller and converter, and it is so smooth.

716
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:44,120
I can switch between multiple different power sources and nothing blips.

717
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,800
All of my gear stays on.

718
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,320
It's great.

719
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,600
It's really clean and smooth.

720
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,920
It produces clean power.

721
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:50,680
Just very happy.

722
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:55,120
Well, now that we're at the end of the show, I'll mention my website, Chris last

723
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:58,920
dot com Alex's website, blog dot KTZ dot me.

724
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,280
Well, you can find our sponsor on social media too.

725
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,760
A cloud guru is at twitter.com, youtube.com and facebook.com.

726
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:07,520
They're all just slash a cloud guru couldn't be easier.

727
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,400
And the podcast here is also on Twitter self-hosted show.

728
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:31,400
I'm at ironic Badger and that was self-hosted dot show slash 28.
