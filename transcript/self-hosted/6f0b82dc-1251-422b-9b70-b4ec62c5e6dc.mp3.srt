00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
Coming up on today's show, Chris talks about industrial grade LTE.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,520
We have a philosophical debate on cloud versus local,

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,880
and I experienced full blown Americana this Halloween.

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,240
It involves golf carts.

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,040
I'm Chris.

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,880
And I'm Alex, and this is Self Hosted.

7
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,720
Well, this is an awkward one because it's just after Halloween

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,400
and just before the election.

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,680
So there's a lot going on.

10
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,680
How are you doing, Alex?

11
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,520
I'm doing very well, thank you, yes.

12
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,640
We don't really celebrate Halloween very much in England,

13
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,640
but it's a big deal over here, isn't it?

14
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:36,720
I actually had my, I think one of my biggest Halloween wins as a dad,

15
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,880
and it just came on accidentally

16
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:42,320
while the kids were out doing a Halloween activity.

17
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,000
I had the realization in a moment of clarity

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,600
where nothing else was going on,

19
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,400
I realized that basically 90% of the lights in my house are smart lights.

20
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,440
And I always have them at just a warm white,

21
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,600
but I actually could change their colors.

22
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,720
And so I went around, well, inside Home Assistant,

23
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:04,080
and changed all the different colors of the lights to Halloween colors

24
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,040
and then turned on the Halloween sound effects on the Home Pods.

25
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:07,680
Oh, cool.

26
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,520
And then the kids got home and opened up the door to Lady Choops,

27
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,120
and it was like a Halloween festival inside.

28
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,080
It was like a nice smart home win moment

29
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,680
because everybody looked around and went,

30
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,320
oh, yeah, right, colors.

31
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,200
You can do that.

32
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,840
How is it going for you, though?

33
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,040
I mean, Halloween's one thing, but of course, the election's coming up.

34
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,280
There's got to be a lot of new, a lot of America in your face right now.

35
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,200
Well, yeah, I think the most American thing I've seen since I emigrated

36
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,000
is a family trick or treating on a golf cart.

37
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,200
Oh, that's next level.

38
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,360
That's a good idea.

39
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,200
You know, I mean, you don't want to have to wear yourself out getting your candy.

40
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,640
You don't have to walk.

41
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,680
I mean, and even this year, because it was all, you know, corona,

42
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,800
everything was socially distant.

43
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,840
So people just placed the tables at the end of their driveways.

44
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,920
And the kids, they literally drive along on the golf cart, hop off,

45
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,440
take three paces to the nearest driveway, load up the bowl of candy,

46
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,600
and then off they go again.

47
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,120
So it's a minimum viable effort trick or treating this year.

48
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:12,160
I lurk on a lot of the communities that share their ring footage.

49
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,920
This is a thing on the internet, by the way.

50
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,680
People that share their ring footage.

51
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,320
And so many, so many videos this year, a lot of them have made it to Reddit

52
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:28,160
of full-fledged dudes like adults just coming up and wholesale stealing candy out of bowls.

53
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,680
I just can't even with these people.

54
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,400
People need to do something better with their time.

55
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,280
Like get certified.

56
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,440
This episode is brought to you by Cloud Guru.

57
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,160
Are you looking to make a high paying career move into the cloud?

58
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,200
Well, there's no better place to start than getting a certification.

59
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,720
ACG has helped more than 2 million people skill up on the cloud.

60
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,760
AWS, Azure, and Google exam preps, you're covered.

61
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,800
Just get going at a cloudguru.com.

62
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,760
I'm so excited.

63
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,040
I saw on the road outside my neighborhood last week,

64
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:02,480
the AT&T techs were fiddling around with a ditch, which running fiber up the road.

65
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,120
So I might be getting fiber soon.

66
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,480
Oh, I was thinking maybe they were running down infrastructure for the towers for 5G.

67
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,360
Oh, it could be.

68
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,480
Yeah, it could be.

69
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,160
You've got to get that Corona in somehow.

70
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,280
Right.

71
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,280
You got to get in every town in every neighborhood.

72
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,680
Well, I mean, either way, though, you're getting an upgrade, right?

73
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,320
So fiber would be great.

74
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,800
Speaking of backhaul, though, you have been

75
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,160
going crazy with this industrial LTE modem setup.

76
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,200
Tell me about that.

77
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,920
Oh, my gosh.

78
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,800
I have achieved LTE nirvana, I suspect.

79
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,240
I mean, early days, big, big upgrade for the RV.

80
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,080
So super quick recap.

81
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,320
For those of you who maybe are new or don't know,

82
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:49,840
I choose to live in a Class A RV, a 40-foot bus, basically.

83
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,280
That's what the Class A is.

84
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,640
A baked bean tin on wheels.

85
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,280
Yeah, carry on.

86
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,640
And it's sometimes loaded up with kids and dogs and tons of podcasting gear.

87
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:04,720
And it has to accommodate working from home and school from home now for three kids.

88
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,920
And my wife, who has transitioned some of her practice online, so she's doing video calls.

89
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,560
You forgot one important thing that it carries as well.

90
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,280
What's that?

91
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,040
Your poops.

92
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:15,600
That's true.

93
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,880
Lady Jupes carries my poop.

94
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:22,480
So I call my RV Lady Jupiter, named by the audience, live on Linux Unplugged one day.

95
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,400
And for short, Lady Jupes.

96
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,960
And you might not think of this initially, but it's really tricky to have a solid,

97
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:35,440
reliable internet connection in a mobile vehicle, especially if it's not just a car.

98
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,840
Because there's some booster solutions that you just throw an antenna on the roof of your car.

99
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,200
They're pretty straightforward.

100
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:45,360
But I needed something that could accommodate a family, that could accommodate work,

101
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,000
and that could accommodate multiple cellular scenarios.

102
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,640
Because some areas have better carrier coverage.

103
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,480
In fact, it's just how it always works.

104
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,480
There's some areas that are stronger with different carriers.

105
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:01,840
And through research, I had come across the PepWave Max Transit by a company called Peplink.

106
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:09,680
The Max Transit is a purpose-built modem router unit with two LTE modems,

107
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,520
each with two antenna ports.

108
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,440
And you can do redundancy, you can do combination here.

109
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,880
I'll get into that a little bit.

110
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,320
With optional speeds on the modems.

111
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,920
So to really learn all this, Alex, it was actually really kind of fun because I had

112
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:28,240
to learn a lot about LTE and LTE modems that I never knew before.

113
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:34,640
And I didn't know or appreciate that there were multiple categories of LTE modems.

114
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:41,280
And each category is sort of translatable to an expected best-case scenario speed.

115
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,920
Well, I know there's lots of different bands available,

116
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,480
like different frequencies, effectively, is what that means.

117
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,480
Right. There's that as well.

118
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,000
Oh, that's different.

119
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,920
Yes. And also very important.

120
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:59,840
It's so crazy, Alex, because you have networks like AT&T, and they have this super hodgepodge

121
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,080
network where they have got different bands in different areas, and it's very uncommon.

122
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:11,520
And then you have a carrier like Verizon, who in comparison has a much more kind of streamlined

123
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:16,320
network, a more maybe custom or intentionally built network.

124
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:24,560
But no, the category of the modem, to really kind of just make it just super approachable,

125
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,200
think of the category of a modem like how many antennas it has.

126
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,840
And each category you go up, you get more antennas.

127
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:39,920
And antennas, you could think of those as listening ears and sending ear and mouths

128
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,280
to the tower.

129
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,440
And the more antennas you have, the faster the connection is.

130
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:52,160
And it could be really common for a cell phone to have two or even like four antennas like

131
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,080
in the iPhone 12 now.

132
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,440
And in certain scenarios, you can utilize all those antennas at once.

133
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,640
And each one of them could be potentially 20, 30 megabits.

134
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:06,800
So I needed something that was pretty high end.

135
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,520
I had to find that sweet spot between ridiculous money, because this is something you could

136
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:18,480
spend ridiculous money on, and something that was performant enough that I could actually

137
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,620
notice a difference when I went through all this hassle.

138
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:24,800
And so I ended up with something that's called a category 12 modem.

139
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:34,320
And that has somewhere around a maximum transfer speed on LTE of around 603 megabits, potentially

140
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,520
if your LTE network could handle that.

141
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:44,120
So you could go as far up as a gigabit with some of these modems, but the cost just exponentially

142
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,120
grows.

143
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,500
So I went right there in the middle.

144
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,720
Some systems have what's called a category four, some have all these different categories.

145
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,800
At the end of the day, you have to kind of pick and choose.

146
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,240
And when you start getting into this, you have to start learning what these terms mean.

147
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,120
So I wrapped my head around all of that, and I got myself a dual cat 12 modem.

148
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:07,840
So I have two cellular LTE modems, each of which are capable of around 600 megabits,

149
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,200
given the proper LTE connectivity.

150
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,560
So do those things support GSM and CDMA?

151
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,740
GSM and CDMA are a different set of technologies.

152
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,720
This is all LTE.

153
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,640
And then within LTE, like you touched on earlier, there's a ton of different bands that you

154
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,300
could get that have their various pros and cons.

155
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,880
That's interesting, because when I unboxed my OnePlus 8T last week, I put my Verizon

156
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:35,960
SIM into it, and it said this device is CDMA-less, and I'm like, uh-oh, and then it just activated

157
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,960
just fine.

158
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,600
So does that mean that CDMA is not really a thing anymore?

159
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,600
Right.

160
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:45,440
Yeah, Verizon was the bigger CDMA carrier, and they've transitioned to LTE.

161
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,440
Fascinating.

162
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,200
And of course, 5G is just around the corner, right?

163
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,840
So there's also that math.

164
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:55,520
I had to look at getting a technology that was sufficiently performant, but was sort

165
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:00,080
of established and reliable enough that I felt comfortable putting it in my RV.

166
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:05,120
I sort of treat the RV like a boat, and I don't always go for the absolute crazy, latest

167
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,120
and greatest.

168
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:10,800
Like when I put my lithium and solar system in, I got a really nice system, but there

169
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:16,500
are crazier, newer, higher-tech systems that are coming out now.

170
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:21,880
But I kind of go for one generation back that's gotten really good, gotten a lot of market

171
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:26,560
adoption and really worked out a lot of the bugs, and then I put that into the RV.

172
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,960
And that's what these transits are.

173
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:38,920
This Pep Wave is built for public use on transit, on a bus, in a plane, where you have maybe

174
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:44,720
even up to 100 people using Wi-Fi off of this thing and then using its LTE connection.

175
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:50,240
And it is this particular line, the MAX line for these transit devices, are ruggedized

176
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,720
for harsh environments.

177
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:57,040
They're built to be going down the road bumping, and they're built to be powered directly off

178
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,800
of DC or AC if you need.

179
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:05,600
And so they're like for a home use, they're just up to the line of overkill without actually

180
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,240
being overkill for my particular use case.

181
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,560
So I'm just looking at this picture you have in the show notes of the device itself, and

182
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:17,720
there are lots of antenna holes and serial and console and power inputs and Ethernet

183
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,800
jacks and all the rest of it.

184
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:24,920
So what do you need to put on the outside of your bus and stuff like that?

185
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:29,160
So you can hook up antennas directly to the ports that it comes with, and you're going

186
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,520
to get something that's way faster than any Wi-Fi.

187
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:37,480
You're going to get something that's screaming fast, and that's how I use it right now.

188
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:42,400
But in about two weeks, I'm going to get the seven in one antenna installed on the roof.

189
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:46,360
I'm going to have to drill a hole, which I'm very nervous about through my roof, and that

190
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:52,400
will bring in external antenna into this guy, and I'll take off the little antenna that

191
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:56,120
I have installed on it, and I will hook up the wires from the external antenna.

192
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:00,920
That'll give me even more performance because it's outside the metal box.

193
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:07,160
It has multiple antennas in it, and it'll probably give me about a 5 dB gain in cellular

194
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,440
signal, which is huge.

195
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,440
That's a massive gain.

196
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:15,360
So your before speeds were what, and what are you hoping to get with this new antenna?

197
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,000
So right now, with the current setup that I have where I'm just using the built-in antennas,

198
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:25,960
I'm getting somewhere between real world, it depends on the carrier, but 60 to 90 megabits,

199
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,960
which is pretty great.

200
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,960
That's good.

201
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,960
Yeah.

202
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,960
I'm pretty happy with that.

203
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:34,520
It's enough where you combine it with some of the other features this thing has, and

204
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,560
it's really freaking cool.

205
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,920
Let me tell you about the really freaking cool stuff.

206
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,240
So I guess one other disclaimer is you've got to pay for the LTE, right?

207
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:47,080
So I have an unlimited AT&T SIM in this thing, and I have an unlimited Verizon SIM in this

208
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,080
thing.

209
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:52,080
And then I have a Google Fi data-only SIM, which are awesome, by the way, if you're a

210
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,840
Google Fi customer.

211
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,880
You just get a data SIM and just pay for its usage.

212
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,520
I have that as a failover device.

213
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,520
Oh.

214
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,520
Yeah.

215
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,520
I'm going to do that.

216
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,160
Catherine has a Pixel with Fi.

217
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,680
I need a SIM card for my iPad.

218
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,680
I didn't know you could do that.

219
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,680
Yeah.

220
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,480
You've got to be a current Fi customer to get it.

221
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,480
Yeah.

222
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,480
Well, she is.

223
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,480
I'm going to do that.

224
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,480
Thank you for that tip.

225
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,480
It's pretty great.

226
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,200
So the peplink itself runs their own OS.

227
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,880
They put a super nice processor in this.

228
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,880
It's very fast.

229
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:23,120
I have no complaints about performance, which is not an easy bar for me.

230
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:28,400
I'm pretty sensitive to slow-loading admin pages and whatnot.

231
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,900
But one of the things that pushed me over the link on going with this setup versus what

232
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:36,360
I had before, which originally was a travel slate router, and then I kind of replaced

233
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:44,080
that with a Raspberry Pi 4 that was doing kind of a bonded VPN sort of, which worked.

234
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:50,640
But I needed something that was 100%, something that I could rely to run a security system,

235
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:55,800
something that if I'm not home and my kids are home and they're doing school, I don't

236
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,640
have to get a frantic call from my wife saying the internet's gone down again and I walk

237
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,200
her through rebooting a MiFi.

238
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,120
I wanted it rock solid.

239
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,520
And one of the things that they build into this, you have to pay for it, but it's what

240
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,920
they call speed fusion technology.

241
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:18,340
And it is a bonding VPN that very, very cleverly bonds your two LTE connections.

242
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:22,600
And it's aware of the data going over both and it's aware of the individual performance

243
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,680
characteristics of each connection.

244
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:29,480
And it will intelligently balance and bond these two connections into one.

245
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:32,200
So how does that work with stuff like cookies and things like that?

246
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,920
Because I've often run into this issue, well, this used to be something I did when I was

247
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,920
back in college.

248
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:42,720
We used to flash a couple of cable modems with a spoofed Mac address and we used PF

249
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,880
Sense with multi WANs and that caused loads of issues when it did a round robin balance

250
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:51,720
between different connections, different WAN connections.

251
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,760
Does this kind of have like a sticky feature?

252
00:13:53,760 --> 00:14:00,560
Well, the way it is really working is what it's doing is their own custom source VPN.

253
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:07,480
So your endpoint is what all of the client websites and services see as your IP.

254
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,080
Oh, that's smart.

255
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,760
Yeah, I like that.

256
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:17,200
The downside is you have to either pay them to host it, which they offer multiple servers

257
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:21,940
across various VPS providers that they've abstracted throughout everywhere.

258
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:27,520
There's also other companies that are now around that just offer VPN endpoints for these

259
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,880
routers because they're pretty common in industrial use.

260
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,920
And so there's a good amount of enterprise customers out there that are willing to pay

261
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:39,840
$200 a month for something like this, which is mind boggling to me because it's really

262
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,240
just a VPN.

263
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:46,460
And you've got these people that are charging $150 to $200 a month for the service.

264
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:49,720
They do allow you and they have different licensing options.

265
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,920
Some are more affordable than others to just self host as well.

266
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:53,920
That's very cool.

267
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,920
What's the VPN tech they're using?

268
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,520
Is it WireGuard or OpenVPN?

269
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,640
I wonder if it's OpenVPN.

270
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,360
I haven't dug super deep into it.

271
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:06,880
I did grab their self hosted VM image and I am in the process of testing that so I may

272
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,660
be able to figure that out.

273
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,600
I don't know if I will.

274
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:14,900
They layer a lot of their own like signaling tech on top of it.

275
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,880
So whatever it is, it's unique in that sense.

276
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:21,960
Like for example, they have this technology that they call WAN smoothing, which duplicates

277
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:25,960
packets, which sounds like it would take bandwidth, but stick with me for a second.

278
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,960
And they call this forward error correction.

279
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:32,400
It sends additional reserve packets, which can be used to mitigate the effects of packet

280
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,600
loss via interpolation.

281
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:41,180
The actual practical use case of that is your video calls are rock solid over LTE.

282
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:48,320
And so I'm doing video calls, I'm using this connection for, I went off into the woods

283
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:56,240
and there's a spot that is on a farm that is, you know, at least a hundred acres.

284
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,960
And I don't know what it is about this spot.

285
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:01,120
Well, actually I do know is on the Hill above, I actually saw it this trip.

286
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,680
This is the third time I've been there and I finally found the cell tower and it's just,

287
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,980
it's a beautiful line of sight cell tower to the camping spot.

288
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:12,200
And I get 90 megabits on LTE.

289
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:18,000
And it's just it, when you have a device that can handle very high performance LTE and it

290
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,840
can handle 30, 40 wifi clients, which is what I actually have.

291
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:27,960
And it can, it could manage all of this intelligently and it can determine, well, if you send something

292
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,920
to Verizon and you're waiting for it to come back, I'll use the AT&T line.

293
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,000
Like it figures all of that out for you.

294
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
It's really nice.

295
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Man.

296
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I need, I think I need that in my house.

297
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,220
I mean, spectrum is just rubbish.

298
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,080
So I put a link in the show notes.

299
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,080
It wasn't fantastic.

300
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:47,260
It wasn't, it wasn't amazing that I could still, I could still see some compression,

301
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:55,040
but I played Red Dead Redemption over Stadia in the woods on an LTE connection.

302
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,040
Wow.

303
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,640
You are living in the future.

304
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,640
That's fantastic.

305
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,640
It was really good.

306
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,200
I mean, there's some latency issues time.

307
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,800
And every now and then I got a message from Stadia saying your connection is not that

308
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,560
great, but it, you know, it works pretty solid.

309
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:11,520
I don't think you are probably their target market when they, when they invented Stadia.

310
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,140
No, no, I don't think so.

311
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:18,080
The other thing that's just absolutely been brilliant and it was one of those why factors,

312
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:21,340
you know, I do this change and she's like, yeah, it seems faster, right?

313
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:26,240
But you're like, oh my God, like I put all this, I put all this time into research and

314
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:31,600
spent a fair chunk of change on this thing and did all of this work to get it installed.

315
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,800
You know, I had to switch over our DNS, I had to switch up our DHCP.

316
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:38,600
I had to take out devices, you know, replace my SSID.

317
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,480
Like I really, you know, put a lot into this thing.

318
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:48,500
And her first response was it's kind of faster until we sat down and watched YouTube.

319
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,840
And you have to understand how this works to fully appreciate this.

320
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:55,800
On AT&T, YouTube gets slammed to 480p.

321
00:17:55,800 --> 00:18:00,560
It basically puts up a wall and the client, the YouTube client just smacks his head into

322
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:08,180
that wall until it finally settles on 480p and then it streams you mud essentially.

323
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:13,120
And it's annoying because you just sit there and the YouTube video player just spins while

324
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:17,440
it has this confrontation with AT&T and then you get your crappy result.

325
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,560
That's one of the reasons I love YouTube DL because I just download this stuff and watch

326
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,560
it offline.

327
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,360
Love YouTube DL with all this hoopla going on.

328
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,660
I have faith.

329
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:27,660
I have faith.

330
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:28,660
Yeah, me too.

331
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:33,460
But I'll tell you what, when you're going over the bonded VPN, AT&T has no idea what

332
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:35,820
you're doing and YouTube doesn't care.

333
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:42,280
And so the video starts immediately and it's full 1080p, beautiful, crispy, just boom.

334
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:45,920
And so the wife and I were sitting there on the couch and we pull up YouTube to watch

335
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:51,760
some of the creators that we follow and we hit play on that video and she goes, whoa,

336
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,400
it's like we got a brand new TV.

337
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:58,120
The picture quality just skyrocketed and that she noticed.

338
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:01,880
And that, you know, when you're doing that once or twice a week, three times a week,

339
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,960
whatever you're doing, like that kind of thing, it's like a quality of life improvement that

340
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,380
she noticed.

341
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:10,800
And then that kind of built on that and then she started noticing other things and now

342
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,800
she loves it.

343
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:19,180
And the very clever thing that this thing does, Alex, is it sets the bonded VPN on its

344
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,380
own SSID.

345
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:26,360
So you get a new wireless access point on your LAN and you join that and everything's

346
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,360
the same.

347
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:33,280
You're on the same LAN, same IP space, same DHCP server, same DNS, except for your default

348
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,280
route.

349
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,560
I'm not sure how they handle DNS in this case, but your default route gets set to the bonded

350
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,960
VPN.

351
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:44,780
So you have these, you have this new AP and you can put certain hosts on that AP and they

352
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:48,560
go out the bonded VPN and everybody else just goes out the balanced connection, which that

353
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,040
just automatically balances.

354
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:56,160
So you just put the televisions on the bonded VPN and boom, streaming is just magic now,

355
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,680
buttery smooth.

356
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:00,960
It's so great.

357
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:08,640
It reminds me a lot like when we did the solar and lithium battery upgrade last year and

358
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:14,040
it just changed everything because now all of a sudden we always had power and all of

359
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:18,200
our outlets, we went from having three outlets that worked when we were on battery and having

360
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,100
two lead acid batteries and then two lithium batteries.

361
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:28,440
Now we went to 600 amp hours of lithium and solar and it just changed everything.

362
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:33,480
We could leave our smart lights on the automations and home assistant could be completely changed.

363
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:39,080
It was a massive quality of life upgrade and it feels similar to that.

364
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:44,160
It's just another huge improvement and for the kids, it just means everything works just

365
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:49,160
like all the outlets work and we always can turn lights on and all of that and we can,

366
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,520
we can leave a TV going if we want.

367
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:56,800
Now the internet just works because if AT&T is having problems, it just switches to Verizon

368
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:00,880
and Verizon's having problems, it switches to Google Fi and it just sorts it all out

369
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,480
without me ever having to touch it.

370
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:08,480
You have such a wonderfully unique set of problems to solve in an RV, don't you?

371
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,480
What about Starlink though?

372
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:12,000
Isn't that going to change the game in a year or two?

373
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,080
I hope, you know, I really, I hope it's maybe in a year.

374
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,080
I don't know.

375
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,080
We'll see.

376
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,800
I imagine the last thing they're going to support is RVs because right now if you're

377
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:28,200
a Starlink beta customer in the EULA, it says that you have to use the Starlink service

378
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:34,160
where you signed up and I don't know if they're doing like geo checking or not, you know,

379
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:38,520
maybe they sure could be and so in there it says you use it where you signed up and I

380
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:43,120
think, I don't know, maybe it's, maybe they don't have the tech right on repositioning

381
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,960
the satellite when you move or something like that and the other thing to think about Starlink

382
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:53,100
is it won't be usable while you're going down the road or if there's a lot of tree coverage.

383
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:56,880
So I think this will still fill those gaps in even once Starlink arrives.

384
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,720
Have you ever gone outside and watched the Starlink trainer satellites go over?

385
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,720
It's pretty cool.

386
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,120
I have never seen it.

387
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:08,460
Every time I look on a night sky on my phone, it's always underneath me.

388
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,460
It's awesome.

389
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:14,480
I'll tell you what, we went out a few weeks ago and every, you know, 10 seconds or so

390
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:19,960
there's another satellite goes over and they're just all in a long line and it's just, it's

391
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:23,880
amazing and you think to yourself, well, okay, now I've got visibility of that satellite

392
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:29,720
for maybe a minute as it goes over and then you know that they've got like some kind of

393
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:34,680
mesh network between them and communicating so that they're doing some kind of like zero

394
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:38,360
handoff type style thing between the satellites.

395
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,240
It's very cool.

396
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,240
Crazy cool.

397
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,760
They're doing a lot of beta testing here in Washington state.

398
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:48,720
So I've been getting little bits of information and you know, people are seeing decent speeds

399
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:55,400
20 millisecond ping time, which is doable and a hundred megabits on a, on a good night

400
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,720
of unlimited data.

401
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,720
Yeah.

402
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:03,120
My, my, my worry really is that, you know, satellite is very, very easily disrupted by

403
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:08,280
weather or trees or something like that, you know, so yeah, a cable is always going to

404
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:13,720
be better, but you know, it could open up possibilities for new economies of, of people

405
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:19,200
moving to rural Montana and stuff and working, you know, for a Facebook or an Apple or a

406
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,080
Google or whoever or a red hat.

407
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,320
Oh, it's my dream.

408
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,320
It's my dream.

409
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,320
Yeah, man.

410
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,320
Me too.

411
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:29,440
Like, I mean, I live in Raleigh right now, but you know, there's no reason besides the,

412
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,040
you know, social things that you can do here.

413
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:35,360
Like you can go to the cinema and well, not the moment, but anyway, you get the idea,

414
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,360
right?

415
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:42,680
Like we live in cities, but there are also reasons to kind of think about that fully

416
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:48,240
remote off-grid style lifestyle, but there's also that kind of middle ground of I'm going

417
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:53,800
to live within half an hour's drive of a town and then, you know, have a few acres to myself

418
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,880
and, you know, I think I would love that.

419
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,880
I would love that.

420
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:03,160
I just spent Thursday through Sunday off-grid, you know, it's funny because when we started

421
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:06,640
the show, I, the, the RV was just not off-grid capable, right?

422
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:11,400
And you remember I launched project off-grid and yeah, and now I'm living it.

423
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:18,680
We went off into the woods and it is, it's about 45 minutes from town.

424
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,080
It is very remote.

425
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,280
It's you don't see another soul.

426
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:25,920
It's a giant forest you can walk around in and there's, you know, there's wildlife, there's

427
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,640
bears and there's, there's things like that to be aware of.

428
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:34,760
But when I'm out there at this, this time, it made me realize, I think I could pull this

429
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,800
off on an ongoing basis.

430
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:44,080
Like, I think I could buy a chunk of land that didn't have utilities and I could live

431
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,080
there.

432
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:48,040
I would probably build a little shed with solar and some additional supplemental batteries.

433
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:52,400
So maybe I could double my battery capacity while I was there and I might need an extra

434
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,260
large propane tank for the winter.

435
00:24:55,260 --> 00:25:01,120
But outside of that, I have, as long as I have cell signal now and it's reasonable to

436
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,360
get into town or Starlink, right?

437
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,980
It's getting really close.

438
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:05,980
It's happening.

439
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:10,680
I saw an article, I don't know what website it was on, maybe New York Times or something,

440
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:19,320
where Bozeman, Montana is seeing, you know, 16% year over year real estate price growth.

441
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,320
Yeah.

442
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:25,760
I went to Bozeman just a few months ago and I go every year, I went twice this year and

443
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:31,800
it is just, even during Corona with lockdowns, it has, it has changed every year significantly

444
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,280
and it's going through major growth.

445
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:36,880
I talked to a real estate agent at a pizza place, of all things, I'm sitting there eating

446
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:41,400
pizza and I'm talking to a owner of a business at the pizza place and I'm talking to the

447
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:45,280
real estate agent and he said, the thing he said is that people are getting these places

448
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:48,700
and they're just kind of doing the off-grid lifestyle and they're doing exactly what you're

449
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,060
talking about.

450
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:53,480
And you know, I am thinking, you know, it could happen.

451
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:59,100
I mean, a year ago I was just figuring out how to even use solar and now I just basically

452
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:02,100
spent nearly a week off-grid loving it.

453
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:05,640
So it just has to have connectivity, but with Starlink it changes it.

454
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,760
And I really debated, should I build this towards 5G?

455
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:13,260
Because that's an example of a decision where I could have gone a little more cutting edge

456
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:18,200
here and because you could build a 5G system that's still fully LTE capable.

457
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:23,740
And this speaks to what you said a few minutes ago of, you know, you're using the version

458
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:28,320
of the tech that is, you know, not the latest and greatest that's got all the bugs worked

459
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,720
out and that's what LTE is right now.

460
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,720
Yeah.

461
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:37,380
And it's got the most durable gear, the stuff that's built to go into industrial grade operations.

462
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:41,000
The reality is if I could start getting ideal LTE connectivity, if I can start getting a

463
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:46,360
hundred megabits on LTE, you know, and the system's capable of dual 600, but if I can

464
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:50,640
get even a hundred megabits, that's plenty really.

465
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,840
It's just the cost of those plans, right?

466
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:53,840
Yes.

467
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,840
Yeah, exactly.

468
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:58,160
And maybe that changes as time goes on, you know, you go down the road five years from

469
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:02,840
now when LTE will still be around, but the majority is now everyone's on 5G just because

470
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:05,680
that's what all the phones have that are in operation.

471
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:10,440
Maybe they, maybe they stop being such jerks about data usage on LTE.

472
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,440
Maybe they don't really care.

473
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,320
That's what happened with the edge network for years.

474
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:17,960
Like edge went on for a decade and they just started letting people have full access to

475
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,960
the edge network.

476
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,040
And you started seeing all these little devices, little tracker devices and whatnot show up

477
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:25,040
that used edge with unlimited data.

478
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,280
And maybe that could happen.

479
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:29,920
And then, you know, be a perfect, you know, three, four or five years from now would be

480
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:33,200
a perfect time to upgrade the system.

487
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:59,320
I've been using Linode for over two years.

I started right after I sold Jupiter broadcasting and I wanted to just separate work stuff and

489
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,160
personal stuff.

490
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:10,680
But then as we started to go independent again and I needed a lot of infrastructure fast

491
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:17,000
and I mean, really it was a serious undertaking, Linode was my obvious choice.

492
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,400
They started in 2003 as one of the first companies in cloud computing.

493
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,000
So they really know what they're doing.

494
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,240
That's three years before AWS.

495
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,040
And they're independently owned and founded that entire time.

496
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:31,840
And you know that this is a good sign when it's a company that got into this business

497
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:36,320
because they saw the technology that was being built into the Linux kernel and they knew

498
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,400
what they could do with that and they started a company around that.

499
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,480
I think that's really something special.

500
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:47,480
And they've built such a manageable and usable system now with their cloud dashboard.

501
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:50,960
I'm not going to spend hours and hours learning how to manage these systems.

502
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,240
I can go in there and it's really easy to use.

503
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,520
You don't have to have a very high skill level.

504
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:00,640
But if you want, you can do everything through SSH.

505
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:06,200
You get full access unlike entry level hosting services that lock you into their platform.

506
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:09,400
It gives you full back end access to customize and control your server.

507
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,480
So if you want it, it's there.

508
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:14,920
And if Kubernetes is your thing, maybe you want to centralize your management a little

509
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:20,320
bit, Linode's managed Kubernetes engine is simple and the pricing is simple.

510
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,880
You only pay for what you use.

511
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:26,940
And there's no management fees like AWS charges for their Kubernetes implementation.

512
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:31,000
And with Linode's 99.9% SLA, you know you're going to be set.

513
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
You know you're going to be okay with your infrastructure.

514
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,820
That's why I run everything on there.

515
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:38,600
And if you're going for something that you want that's customer facing, you've got a

516
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:43,040
lot of great options from node balancers to object storage, different tools you can use

517
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,560
to really make your performance super fast.

518
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:49,040
Or maybe you just want to build something for yourself or for your family, an online

519
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,360
gallery or a blog.

520
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:56,040
Linode's got plans that make that really easy to starting at $5 a month.

521
00:29:56,040 --> 00:30:02,400
But if you go to linode.com slash SSH, you're going to get a $100 60 day credit.

522
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:06,320
I'd encourage you to play with something with some horsepower.

523
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,600
It's a great opportunity to learn too.

524
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,520
Go build a website just as an experiment.

525
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,720
Check out their stack scripts.

526
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:17,800
It's a great way to get a really nice base WordPress setup up and going.

527
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:21,320
And they've got a couple of options depending on if you want NGINX or Apache, and of course

528
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,560
you've got all the different distros to choose from.

529
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,640
So go check that out too.

530
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,200
It's a great way to get up and going.

531
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:30,280
And with 11 data centers worldwide, you're going to find just the right spot to deploy

532
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:33,300
something that's going to be either close to you or close to your clients.

533
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:36,320
So go over to linode.com slash SSH.

534
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:40,660
Receive that $100 60 day credit towards your new account and support the show.

535
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:42,560
And simplify your cloud life.

536
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:46,640
Linode's been around since 2003, and they're dedicated to offering the best virtualized

537
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,640
cloud computing.

538
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,520
If it runs on Linux, you can run it on Linode.

539
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,480
Linode.com slash SSH.

540
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,100
Big thank you Linode for sponsoring the show.

541
00:30:54,100 --> 00:31:00,200
Go get your $100 60 day credit, linode.com slash SSH.

542
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,600
And with some feedback, do you think?

543
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,440
Yeah, it's been a little bit.

544
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,000
And now that we're in our early thirties, we got to start paying attention to these

545
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
kinds of things.

546
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Alex.

547
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Early thirties.

548
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Sure.

549
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Wink, wink.

550
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Squirrely wrote in.

551
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
He says, uh, this is on discord by the way.

552
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:18,900
I have six, eight terabyte drives at the moment, but I just picked up two 12 terabyte drives

553
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,160
on sale.

554
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,160
Nice.

555
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:25,680
What are some options for how to incorporate these new drives into my environment?

556
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:30,160
I have the eight terabyte drives protected via a single snap rate parody set up right

557
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:34,440
now, but I'm curious as to whether this is still the best route in 2020.

558
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:38,760
The vast majority of my stuff on my NAS is replaceable via media.

559
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:43,040
So I was thinking about putting the truly important stuff on a mirror or something that

560
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,880
will also get backed up with something like Backblaze.

561
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,480
What are your thoughts, gentlemen?

562
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,480
Interesting question.

563
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,480
Yeah.

564
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:52,080
So we had this discussion a little bit on, on discord, but I thought it was going to

565
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:56,280
be useful to relay this to the audience as well.

566
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,960
And there's a few different routes you can go.

567
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:04,360
So you're already using snap rate and the process of adding new disks to snap rate is,

568
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:09,640
is quite straightforward until you start to mess around with drive sizes.

569
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:15,000
Like you have here, you know, you had six, eight terabyte drives and now you've changed

570
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,960
and added a couple of 12 terabyte drives.

571
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:23,800
One of the requirements of snap rate is that your parity disk has to be as large or larger

572
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,400
than your largest data disk.

573
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:30,080
So currently your parity drive is an eight terabyte drive.

574
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:34,960
You're going to have to swap that out to be one of these new 12 terabyte drives.

575
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:39,520
So what that means is that you're effectively giving up a little bit of space to parity

576
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:45,160
in the short term, but as you expand and buy more 12 terabyte disks over the next year

577
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:52,280
or two, you'll be able to add those into the snap rate array for want of a better word.

578
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:55,160
And that should just work just fine.

579
00:32:55,160 --> 00:33:00,720
So that's an important consideration, but the last part of your questions is, is about

580
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:07,280
should I put stuff on a mirror or, or have something backed up with, with backblaze what's

581
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:13,460
important to remember is that raid or snap raid or any kind of parity system, whether

582
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:18,920
it's ZFS or whatever, is no replacement for a real backup.

583
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,920
Raid is not backup.

584
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:26,080
We've pushed this mantra for years as a community and I just want to implore you to, you know,

585
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:30,800
remember that parity is not, raid is not a backup.

586
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:36,360
So having an offsite is, is absolutely something I would suggest, you know, you could do the,

587
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:43,000
the G suite hack, although there was some news about that is changing the terms of service

588
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,760
with G suite stuff is changing.

589
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:50,600
So we'll dig into that more in a future episode, but you know, backblaze do offer some really

590
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,280
competitive prices for backups.

591
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,680
So that's a really good option as well.

592
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:58,000
There's, there's loads of other backup services as well, but make sure you have an offsite

593
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,640
backup would be a recommendation of mine.

594
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:07,900
Then the other option that you've got is to do what I do, which is I have a kind of a

595
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:15,000
JBOD array of disks with merger FS, which are all of, you know, eight to 10 terabytes

596
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,360
in size.

597
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:22,280
And then I have a pair of drives, which are ZFS, which are mirrored.

598
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:29,440
And then I combine that mirror into the merger FS pool of, of drives using a, a specific

599
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,440
mount point.

600
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:33,720
And as a blog post I've written on this, which is in the show notes.

601
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:37,320
And so essentially what it allows me to do is keep my photos and my drone footage and

602
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:45,280
the stuff that I can't reacquire that stuff stays on ZFS and is, you know, using a Sanoid.

603
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,440
I mirror that to my parents' houses, stuff like that.

604
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,920
And it gives me huge peace of mind.

605
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:57,040
As I said, a couple of episodes ago, when I woke up and my ZFS array was blank, I was

606
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,600
just like, Oh, she's annoying rather than, uh, I've actually lost data.

607
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,800
So that's an important thing to consider as well.

608
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:08,180
But when you're looking at the number of drives you have, you know, you've got six eights

609
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:10,140
and two twelves.

610
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:14,400
If you were to do a ZFS mirror with the two twelves that you have, if you do the math

611
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:20,460
behind it, you're actually going to keep the same amount of available usable space by doing

612
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:21,460
it that way.

613
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:26,960
So my suggestion certainly to start with would probably be do a mirror of ZFS, free up some

614
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:32,160
space on the, uh, the eight terabytes by moving some stuff off of that onto a new mirror that

615
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:38,120
you've created and then, you know, uh, add drives as you see fit to the snap rate side

616
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,120
of things.

617
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:44,760
For my perishable data, it's like inconvenient to lose, but not going to wreck my life.

618
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,640
I accomplished this through Butterfess.

619
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,840
For better or worse, I find Butterfess to be a great way to manage this and you can

620
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:54,360
just add mixed sized volumes to an existing mount point.

621
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,760
You just plug it in and you add the volume.

622
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:59,660
It's a really simple, straightforward process, but there's no redundancy there unless you

623
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:01,120
do underlying rate.

624
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,120
Tasty too.

625
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,120
Yes.

626
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,120
Very much so.

627
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:07,120
So let's talk about a ZigBee future because Chris L wrote in about something that's been

628
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,120
on my mind.

629
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:12,640
He's been listening from the start, he says, and it's rich in all sorts of fabulous ideas,

630
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:17,860
but ones that you've actually worked out, not just ones that you're theorizing about.

631
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:19,560
To some degree, there's a little bit of both, I'd say.

632
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:24,280
He said, I wanted to comment about episode 24, open makes sense.

633
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,280
There are some discussion in there about Z-Wave.

634
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:30,480
I think Chris commented that Z-Wave is used less and less as embedded devices have switched

635
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,720
more to Wi-Fi.

636
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,480
While this may be true, I thought I would share comments from a man who fitted the smart

637
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:41,420
meter last month at my house, which is currently being rolled out across the UK.

638
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:45,440
He goes on to say the different meters like gas and electric and the monitoring station

639
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:51,520
all talk to each other on ZigBee, the open standard cousin of Z-Wave.

640
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:55,700
And the central point he made is that the SIM card sends the data over a mobile network

641
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:57,380
to the energy supplier.

642
00:36:57,380 --> 00:37:02,760
The main point being the Zmesh technologies are not being used less, but more as these

643
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:06,720
meters are battery powered and expected to survive in service for a long time.

644
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,720
Thanks for everything.

645
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:08,720
Looking forward to the next show.

646
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:14,600
Also, he didn't mention this, but the new round Amazon Echo, I think has ZigBee built

647
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,040
into it as well.

648
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:20,440
Is that part of being a central like home automation hub type thing?

649
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,440
Yeah.

650
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,840
So it can control the ZigBee devices.

651
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:28,800
I agree, and I have ZigBee abilities on my home assistant.

652
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:33,480
I even got a little ZigBee to MQTT adapter, which is pretty rad.

653
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:38,980
However, in actual practical production, I found Z-Wave to work better.

654
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:41,680
And you guys know me, I'm always going to go with the open standard first.

655
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:46,040
That's why I went the ZigBee to MQTT route first.

656
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:51,760
But having several devices, I have found Z-Wave to be iron clad, rock solid.

657
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:55,640
Like I can have devices that have been missing from the network for three or four months,

658
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:59,160
come back online and it sorts itself out and rebuilds the mesh network and everything's

659
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,160
just working.

660
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,700
I love it.

661
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:06,120
And I would love to see ZigBee be just as good and reliable.

662
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:09,560
And maybe as more vendors get serious about it and start to use it, that just happens

663
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,560
over time.

664
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:15,600
I don't currently have anything on the Z-Wave or ZigBee trains besides my Hue lights, I

665
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,600
don't think.

666
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,600
Right.

667
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,600
Yeah, they use ZigBee, don't they?

668
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,600
On the back end.

669
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:23,360
There are things like that, that are consumer, quote unquote, products, but are actually

670
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,000
just using ZigBee.

671
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:31,320
The other notable new addition to the smart home communications world is Thread, which

672
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:36,000
the new HomePod Mini support and Iroh Wi-Fi access points support.

673
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:44,700
And Thread is another industry standard, open, low power communications technology that has

674
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:49,120
been around for a while, just like ZigBee has, but more and more recently seems to be

675
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,960
getting adoption by the mainstream vendors.

676
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,600
It's a weird world out there.

677
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:57,400
So there may be more to come in low powered communications outside of just Bluetooth.

678
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,400
Good.

679
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,040
Just what we need, another standard.

680
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,040
Yeah.

681
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,040
Yeah.

682
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:05,480
So Michael wrote in and asked us to explain our view on local versus cloud.

683
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:10,360
He says, you focus on privacy and self-hosting, but you also seem comfortable with Alexa,

684
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,360
Google, and the Ring doorbell.

685
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:15,920
Can you take a moment to explain the balance on a future show?

686
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:16,920
Interesting question.

687
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:20,960
We could get quite philosophical here if we were not careful.

688
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:27,400
I generally speaking try to self-host first these days, obviously being a host of the

689
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:31,480
show that's clearly now a part of the job description.

690
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:38,400
But when I'm talking with family members and people at work or just generally people on

691
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:44,360
the internet, I don't always suggest self-hosting because it comes with the overhead of you

692
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,360
are the admin.

693
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:50,760
Like when it goes down, as we've talked about in the last few episodes, when there's a problem,

694
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,760
you're the one that's got to fix it.

695
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,600
And sometimes that can be jolly inconvenient.

696
00:39:54,600 --> 00:40:00,580
So you've got to really weigh up the trade-off that you're going to make of your time and

697
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:03,280
money and convenience and privacy.

698
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:07,040
You've got to trade all those things off against each other for the particular use case that

699
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,680
you're talking about.

700
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:13,240
And lighting is quite low risk, but quite rewarding to automate.

701
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:18,640
But the doors on your house, for example, if you screw up the automations there and

702
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:25,160
you get locked out or locked in, let's say, it could be even worse.

703
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:31,480
There are different situations where the cost of stuff going wrong is higher.

704
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:37,320
So when you look at the privacy angle, you are just a single data point in a sea of noise

705
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,580
to Amazon and Google.

706
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:47,640
So you could argue that actually it doesn't matter if you are saying to your Google homes

707
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:50,240
this, that, and the other, or your Alexa's this, that, and the other.

708
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:55,880
You could argue that nobody's listening because you are one of X number of million people

709
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:56,880
doing this.

710
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:01,400
But at the same time, there is a microphone always listening in your house and you don't

711
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:04,200
know they say what they're going to use it for.

712
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:07,600
We don't know necessarily what it's going to be used for.

713
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:12,360
So there is that to consider as well, I mean, there isn't one right answer to this question.

714
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:17,880
It's it's you have to evaluate your own risk profile for these sorts of things and figure

715
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,120
out what works for you and your beliefs and values.

716
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,520
Yeah, it's like so many things in life.

717
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:24,500
It comes down to getting the balance right.

718
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,320
And that balance is different for each people.

719
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,320
It's like dieting.

720
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,680
It's just different people.

721
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:33,800
A balance of intake and exercise is generally that you got to get that just right.

722
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:34,800
Yeah.

723
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:35,800
Pizza a day keeps the doctor away, right?

724
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,800
That's the saying.

725
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,800
Right.

726
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:38,800
Right.

727
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:44,160
And I think it's the same for not just cloud services, but privacy and security in general.

728
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:48,160
So there is some areas where for me, it's just it's a no brainer.

729
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,840
I always run a local DNS server.

730
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:55,020
The benefits of that is literally everything I do on the Internet just is just that tiny

731
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:57,780
bit faster and it feels private.

732
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:00,360
And it's something I know how to do intrinsically.

733
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:04,080
Now it's I know the ins and outs of it and I can get it going in 15 minutes.

734
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,120
So obvious one.

735
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:10,920
I have not hosted my own email in a decade.

736
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:14,800
It is just something that I feel like the risk profile is higher.

737
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:20,560
The attack surface is high and then the pain in the arsonist is extreme because of spam

738
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:24,800
blacklisting and all of that crap that you end up having to deal with.

739
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:29,240
And so that is something where I've made a judgment call to outsource.

740
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:31,020
Same with cloud backup.

741
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:34,520
I think it's good to have your own backup regime that's local that you can have immediate

742
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,920
access to.

743
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:40,400
But it makes sense to also leverage cheap cloud storage that's off site that protects

744
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,400
you from natural disaster, et cetera.

745
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,600
There is an obvious kind of balance to be had there.

746
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:48,380
And I kind of look at all of these things.

747
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:54,200
Let's to address like the ring one, for example, I think this is one where we kind of we kind

748
00:42:54,200 --> 00:43:00,240
of get lost in the story a little bit and we hear stories about cops doing subpoenas

749
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:09,640
and getting a block's door camera footage and that being bad and privacy invasive.

750
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:13,880
So the reality is, is that somewhere in the middle there is a process when you have a

751
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:17,280
ring doorbell where they can request access to your footage.

752
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:20,080
You can deny or approve it via the app.

753
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:22,960
You can determine if that's a good thing or a bad thing.

754
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,000
And there's the privacy aspect of a third party hosting those videos as well.

755
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,160
And you can determine if that's a good thing or a bad thing.

756
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:32,600
And I think it all just kind of depends on your sense of the company, their risk profile

757
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:33,600
and all of that.

758
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:37,040
And that's, you know, an always moving target as well.

759
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:40,960
So if I think if you choose to host, like, say, a doorbell or something with a company

760
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:44,480
like ring, you have to continually assess the risk.

761
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:48,100
It's not something you can just look at once and continually assess.

762
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:52,320
So there's downsides to it as well beyond just the privacy aspects of it.

763
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:56,640
There's that overhead of always needing to be cognizant of what's going on and reassessing.

764
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:05,280
But the balance for me, I tend to be a little more practical, I tend to be a pragmatist

765
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,280
when I look at these things.

766
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:10,560
And I don't get overly concerned about the privacy story around some of these things

767
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,520
like others do.

768
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:14,520
But that's just different for each of us.

769
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:19,960
The other thing as well is that companies change, like Chris says, you know, look at

770
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:25,040
Nest with their works with Nest API situation, and then you end up with nine months, nearly

771
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:30,000
a year where there is no API whilst Google figures out what they're doing with Nest and,

772
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,160
you know, companies get bought and acquired and closed down and change priorities and

773
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:40,960
focus all the time and, you know, you've just got to bear in mind that if you buy a product

774
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:45,920
now that is subsidized with a cloud subscription or something like that, there is no incentive

775
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:51,160
for that company, unless you're paying them money every month to keep offering that service.

776
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:55,360
And sometimes even if you are paying them, it's not enough to be sustainable.

777
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:59,200
So well said, the only constant with your self-hosted home is going to be that things

778
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,200
are going to change.

779
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:01,200
Yeah.

780
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:04,560
I mean, I think it's like you said earlier, it's always preferable if I can, if it's

781
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:09,040
something that my business relies on or something that is really critical to me, something I'm

782
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:13,840
really concerned about the privacy, like my internal cameras to my RV are completely disconnected

783
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:16,120
from the cloud.

784
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:20,440
I think that's where self-hosting can play a really significant role, especially for

785
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:21,440
businesses.

786
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,120
I think that's something businesses should think a lot about.

787
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,120
Yeah.

788
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:27,240
There's no reason the internet needs to see Chris walking around in his robe, is there?

789
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:29,680
No, no, no, there's not.

790
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:34,740
And the other thing too is the other line I sometimes consider is, would I deploy this

791
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:37,400
if it wasn't all like a cloud provided service?

792
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:40,560
If, you know, they didn't take care of all of the implementation details, would I ever

793
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,600
get around to doing this?

794
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:45,760
And that's something I consider as well.

795
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:51,320
Datadog.com slash self-hosted, today's episode of self-hosted is sponsored by Datadog.

796
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:56,600
The unified monitoring platform for real time observability and detailed insights into Docker

797
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:58,440
performance and more.

798
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:03,460
Enhance visibility into container orchestration with live container view and easily detect

799
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:08,560
clusters that are consuming excessive resources using auto-generated container maps.

800
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:13,040
Out of the box, Datadog will collect critical metrics from each Docker container so you

801
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:18,400
can get immediate visibility into aggregated and dis-aggregated service level traffic.

806
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:39,840
I actually still have a Datadog t-shirt from DockerCon Europe 2015, I think.

807
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:40,840
That's great.

808
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:45,400
I've definitely picked up swag from the Datadog booth at a few events.

809
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:50,240
You know, I've used Datadog just from a keeping track of systems and metrics standpoint, but

810
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,280
I like this new stuff they have for containers too.

811
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:58,280
So go check them out if you haven't tried Datadog before, datadog.com slash self-hosted.

812
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:02,440
So following up on a previous episode where I talked about the new Chromecast with Google

813
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:09,200
TV, they've released an ethernet adapter, which turns out is a bag of crap.

814
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,800
Oh, really? Because it looks so slick.

815
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:12,800
Yeah.

816
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:16,600
Well, I was watching a YouTube video yesterday, so I haven't personally tested it out.

817
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:23,440
It's just based on a YouTube video, but the ethernet speeds are capped at 100 meg.

818
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,440
Stop it.

819
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:25,440
Not even gigabit.

820
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,440
Yep.

821
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:27,440
Apparently so.

822
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:28,440
I'm looking at the specs.

823
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:29,440
You're right.

824
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:30,440
You're right.

825
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:33,080
Now in reality, is that going to be an issue?

826
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:34,080
It's 2020.

827
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:36,820
Why are we putting up with a device that isn't gigabit?

828
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:42,640
It probably saves Google a few pennies from using a gigabit adapter instead of a megabit

829
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:43,640
adapter.

830
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:47,800
What they've done here that's super neat, though, is it looks just like a standard tiny

831
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:53,080
white USB-C power adapter, but on the side of it, it has an ethernet port.

832
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:58,000
So you plug the ethernet into the power adapter and then it all comes back up one USB-C cable

833
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,160
to the Chromecast.

834
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:06,020
I also saw a guy doing like a USB-C hub and it had a power delivery because the Chromecast

835
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:07,920
needs 7.5 watts.

836
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:13,840
You have to have a power delivery-supportable hub to put that much juice through it.

837
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:18,000
And the gigabit speeds were not capable of gigabit either.

838
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:23,200
So I don't know if there's some performance limitation on the USB bus inside the Chromecast

839
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:29,520
because he was getting about 300 megabits from his Wi-Fi connection using AC Wi-Fi,

840
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:34,840
but then he used ethernet through USB-C, not even the actual official Chromecast adapter,

841
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:37,840
and he was only getting something like 180 to 200 meg.

842
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:42,080
So it was actually slower in both cases being wired, which is just wrong.

843
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:48,920
It just dawned on me that we just assume it's USB 3 because it's a USB-C connector in there,

844
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:52,480
but maybe they saved money and put USB 2 in the thing.

845
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:53,680
That's got to be it, hasn't it?

846
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:54,800
That's got to be the answer.

847
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:55,800
It could be.

848
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:56,800
It could be.

849
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:57,800
Oh, Google.

850
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:58,800
Let me ask you this, though.

851
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:03,680
Seriously, is a hundred megabit wired connection not still better though than Wi-Fi for what

852
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:04,680
you're doing with this thing?

853
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:05,680
Yeah, I guess it depends.

854
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:09,920
I mean, Google have engineered this thing to be on Wi-Fi.

855
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:13,120
Ninety nine percent of customers will use it on Wi-Fi, haven't they?

856
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:14,520
So I don't know.

857
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:19,680
I've not noticed any performance difference between my wired shield and my Wi-Fi Chromecast.

858
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:20,680
It's right.

859
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:23,400
It's like if you're not going to get gigabit, then might as well just keep using N. It's

860
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:24,400
pretty good.

861
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:25,400
Mm hmm.

862
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:26,400
Yeah.

863
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:27,400
I will.

864
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:29,400
Bart writes in with potential pick replacement for you, too.

865
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:32,960
So this is our last email and it also is going to be a bit of a pick.

866
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:33,960
He says, hello, friends.

867
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:34,960
Thanks for the show.

868
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:38,120
It helps me get a great deal of home automation ideas for my home.

869
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:42,680
I've been looking for Chromecast alternatives, though, and lo and behold, quite recently

870
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:44,840
someone came up with this beauty.

871
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:46,440
It's called Nymphcast.

872
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:48,120
Seemed right up the self-hosted crowd alley.

873
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:53,160
I for one certainly am going to build it and take it for a spin with my Pi zeros I have

874
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:54,160
in a drawer somewhere.

875
00:49:54,160 --> 00:50:00,680
So this thing is essentially a build it yourself using Raspberry Pi zero stream audio and video

876
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:03,920
anywhere around your house using any Linux system.

877
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:07,280
Kind of like a universal DIY Chromecast.

878
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:09,600
That is super cool.

879
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:12,120
I think we've needed something like this for quite a long time.

880
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:16,380
Yeah, I like this because it's not just something that's like figuring out the Chromecast protocols

881
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:17,520
and using that.

882
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:23,440
But this is a full fledged open replacement and it seems surprisingly well thought out

883
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:26,920
and further along than I would think.

884
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:27,920
It's really in-depth.

885
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:32,000
It's an alpha stage right now, but you can download the server binaries from GitHub.

886
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Yeah.

887
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,680
I've designed Linux images too, so I could see this being really easy to container up

888
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:41,360
if it isn't already and just have the server running as a container on your media box.

889
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:44,880
And we'll have a link to that in the show notes at self-hosted.show slash 31.

890
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:49,920
And I want to say thank you to our self-hosted site reliability engineers who keep this show

891
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:51,540

892
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:57,320
They also get a limited ad feed and they get extra content every episode, a post show.

893
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:01,960
If you'd like to support the show, help us stay independent and be choosy about who sponsors.

894
