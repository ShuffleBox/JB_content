1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,720
Are you getting tired of the thunderbolt single cable promise? I know I am.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,000
I thought you were going to do an ad. Well then friends,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,560
I have something special for you. It's the super thunderbolt cable promise.

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,400
PetsOvernightInTheBox.com.

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,400
No, seriously, I just bought a CalDigit TS4 a couple of months ago.

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,360
You know, it's plugged into my MacBook with Thunderbolt 4 as well.

7
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:27,840
So, you know, the signal chain is extremely simple so far as Thunderbolt goes.

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:36,480
This thing is frustrating, very frustrating, because when I wake it from sleep, my MacBook,

9
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:42,960
I mean, nine times out of 10, I have to unplug and replug every USB device from the dock.

10
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,560
So I go over to the CalDigit website and I think, okay, cool, there must be a firmware

11
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:53,840
update for this thing. Turns out a Thunderbolt 4 dock marketed primarily at Mac users,

12
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:59,760
they don't have a Mac-based firmware update utility. It's only for Windows.

13
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,720
No, no, that's ridiculous. That's embarrassing.

14
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:10,800
Seriously, it is embarrassing. I totally agree. So luckily for me, I have a ThinkPad T480S,

15
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:16,960
which has Thunderbolt 3 on it. So I wipe the thing. I put Windows on it specifically

16
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,680
just to update the firmware on this dock. Get all the way through the rigamarole of

17
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,400
installing Windows, which is still a pain in the ass. And then I go to update the

18
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:32,400
firmware on the dock and it says Thunderbolt firmware mismatch. Thunderbolt 3, isn't it?

19
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,680
Oh, no.

20
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,000
Right. So you can't update a Thunderbolt 4 device from a Thunderbolt 3 device?

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,520
Oh, no, you can. So I got in touch with CalDigit support, which took me about a week and a half

22
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:49,360
to get through the hoops I needed to get through via email. They then informed me that my firmware

23
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:55,200
on the T480S was out of date and I needed to use the firmware update tool to update the

24
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:02,320
ThinkPad's firmware. And for some reason, it wasn't working from Windows. So I wiped

25
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:07,200
Windows and I used FWAPD on Linux to update the firmware on this fricking laptop.

26
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,040
You could have just used a live image, Alex.

27
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,400
Amazing. I love this.

28
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,920
Oh, Brent, I could have, couldn't I?

29
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,960
Yeah.

30
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:17,600
I love this so much. You must have been like in a fugue state. You were just trying to get

31
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,600
this done.

32
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:24,000
You know, I was losing the will to live slowly, but surely. Anyway, long story short, eventually

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,960
I got the firmware update done. It took way longer than it should have done. We're talking

34
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:33,280
like two weeks to finally get everything, all the moon and the stars aligned correctly

35
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,280
to make this thing happen. I go to open my laptop today to record this show and guess

36
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:44,800
what? The USB devices didn't show up. So it was all for nothing.

37
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:52,160
Ah, this does confirm my personal bias in that I think CalDigit makes the worst Thunderbolt

38
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:59,520
docks. And I know some podcasters out there, big talk CalDigit, but I've never liked them.

39
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:05,600
And I have owned one CalDigit and I never went back. And I've owned two OWC Thunderbolt

40
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,520
docks and never had problems. But I don't know if they've been Thunderbolt 4 docks.

41
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:14,000
They might have been Thunderbolt 3 docks. But I also think the OWC docks look better.

42
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,600
I think they're better looking docks too. So there's that. I'll put a link in the show

43
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:24,320
notes. I swear by my TS3+, that thing has been extremely solid for me. I had a bad experience

44
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:31,200
with the TS3 Pro, the smaller one from CalDigit, where it caused a broadcast storm of packets

45
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,960
on my network and literally took out my entire LAN until I unplugged the thing whenever the

46
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:40,480
Mac went to sleep. So, you know, out of the three CalDigit products I've bought, only

47
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,040
one has functioned as advertised so far. It's not going so well.

48
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,080
Alex, can I ask why you thought you should upgrade to the Thunderbolt 4?

49
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,640
Well, I need, you know, in my house, I have a home set up like in my family room where

50
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,200
I sort of hang out and record podcasts and stuff. And then I have a home office downstairs

51
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,600
and work provided me with a MacBook. And so I thought, oh, wouldn't it be great if I just

52
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:08,160
had a Thunderbolt cable in each place and I can just plug in whatever computer I have

53
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:15,840
and I'm good to go. This TS4 has 2.5 gig Ethernet as well. So I thought, hmm, that's a tasty

54
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,720
little upgrade.

55
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:22,480
I also love the idea. I've had some success, but again, it's all Thunderbolt 3. I know

56
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:27,840
this sounds weird, but I really love Thunderbolt and I wish it was more widely used. There's

57
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:33,040
definitely some uptake in the PC side of things, but it's still predominantly a Mac tech. And

58
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,480
it's so much better than USB.

59
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:39,920
It's just too expensive. When it works, it's fantastic. But, you know, you look at how

60
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:45,600
USB is with USB hubs and switches and all that kind of stuff. I need all that for Thunderbolt

61
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,800
2, however technically difficult it is to implement. And I need it to not cost $300

62
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,000
or $400 every time I want to buy a peripheral.

63
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,920
It reminds me of Firewire back in the day.

64
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:02,320
It is very much. Same, same like, I think they're cousins. Same kind of lineage. Alex,

65
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:08,160
I know that you've been continuing to de-Google like I have. This trend has not slowed for

66
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:14,880
me. I am so far Google Photos free once again after getting sucked back in a year ago when

67
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:21,680
they got me some free storage. And I have yet to delete the photos, but I have a full

68
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:27,040
side like secondary system that's working all the way. It's backing up. I'm trying Storage

69
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:31,520
J for the first time. I don't know if you've played around with those guys, but it's pretty

70
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:37,040
cheap decentralized S3 compatible storage. And I'm using that with Duplicati to do backups

71
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:41,760
like I'm making moves, Alex. The de-Googling thing is continuing even while on the road.

72
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:46,800
Next step is I'm going to try out Graphene OS on my Pixel 3. Not there yet because I

73
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,080
had to find the Pixel 3 first.

74
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:55,760
That's great to hear. I've been looking at Photosync on iOS this week, which also supports

75
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,880
S3 storage backends. I'm not quite ready to talk about in the show yet. Like I'm still

76
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,440
figuring it out and making it work as I want to.

77
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,160
You figure it out.

78
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,280
Thanks.

79
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,080
Figure it out.

80
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,200
We didn't we didn't welcome Brent to the show yet. Hello, Brent. How are you?

81
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:13,840
Oh, hi. I'm doing well. I'm being reminded that almost exactly a year ago we were doing

82
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:19,520
the same on the road trip. I was sat in this very seat doing a self-hosted with you both.

83
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:26,080
And we were talking about de-Googling. We talked about maps. So it's kind of our yearly review.

84
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,640
And the maps thing is stuck. You know, since then I am still Google Maps free.

85
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,040
Wow.

86
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:37,600
However, I realized kind of recently that I do use Waze on occasion. And that is actually

87
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,720
a Google product. So there's that. But I don't use it actually for Nav, you know,

88
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,640
but I just use it for the police stuff.

89
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,280
Apple Maps is surprisingly good these days.

90
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,120
Yeah, I've had I've had I'd say I've had a 90% success rate.

91
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,840
That's impressive. I mean, I can't say that I've given up Google Maps yet. I want to.

92
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:01,600
But maybe one day. So any talking about the de-Googling side of things, I was focusing on

93
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:07,200
audio for the last couple of weeks, really. And I have, for some reason, I've got about

94
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:12,560
feels like a nearly a dozen Google Home Minis dotted around this house. I got for like $5

95
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:18,080
offers or free or I've just acquired an unbelievable number of these things over the years.

96
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:24,560
Also a couple of Chromecast audios. And so I've been using these things in home audio groups or

97
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:33,120
speaker groups, I think is the Google phrase to create a whole home audio solution. I haven't

98
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,680
been 100% happy with it, but it's honestly just been good enough. And, you know, sometimes

99
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,680
when you just want some tunes or in the shower or something like that, or just, you know,

100
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:47,120
tidy in the house, you just want the same song playing everywhere. However, as you all know,

101
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:53,680
Google are not currently flavor of the month with me or Chris. And the goal was still is

102
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:59,760
whole home audio in sync through multiple different amplifiers and different speaker

103
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:06,480
types and all that kind of stuff. And so in my family room, I have a discreet amplifier

104
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:12,880
plugged into a pair of passive floor standing loudspeakers. Downstairs, I have another one

105
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:19,280
in the kitchen area. Again, it's just a normal amplifier, no smarts to it, no network

106
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:24,160
connectivity, nothing like that. And I've really struggled to integrate these into home

107
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,640
assistant and the smart home in general. And so I went on a bit of a mission this week to try and

108
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:33,680
solve that. And a few pieces of the puzzle had to fall into place to make this happen. So first of

109
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:40,080
all, I thought I would tackle the audio playback side of these things, because there's no, you

110
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:46,160
know, network jack on these on these amplifiers. So I needed to use some other hardware to act as

111
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:53,520
a Spotify Connect endpoint and Airplay endpoint for when I'm using Plex Amp. And I came across

112
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:57,600
a bunch of feedback from a couple of years ago when I was talking about doing a similar thing

113
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,000
whilst I was drumming, and allowing people in the house to listen to the backing track that I'm

114
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,960
playing along to through the speakers throughout the rest of the house. I never actually acted on

115
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:11,120
much of that feedback back then I just sort of stuck with the Google Home thing and the Chromecast

116
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:17,360
audios. And it, like I said, it sort of worked good enough, but we are where we are today. And

117
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,400
so I tried a few things this week, one of them that's still on my to do list that's very high up

118
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,840
there, I just haven't got to eat yet is called snap cast. So if you're about to write an email

119
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:31,680
telling me to check out snap cast, don't worry, I'll get to it next time. The first thing I tried

120
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,800
was something called pi core player. And the reason that I wanted to use this was because I've

121
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,120
got a couple of Raspberry Pi sat in the drawer behind me. Well, actually, they're deployed now.

122
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:47,520
So they're out of the drawer and actually in use, which is amazing. But pi core player primarily

123
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:54,080
for me was a vehicle to run the Spotify Connect software, the share play, the share port software

124
00:09:54,080 --> 00:10:01,440
for AirPlay one compatibility, and something called Logitech media server. I don't know if you

125
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,960
remember this. It's a really old piece of software. It's about 10 years old or so. Does it do basic

126
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:13,520
DLNA? Is that what it does? Well, I think back in the day, Logitech made a piece of hardware called

127
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:19,200
the squeeze box. Do you remember that? Oh, I do remember the squeeze box. Yes. And it was their

128
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:27,520
kind of vision of what the smart home smart media world should look like. But they were just 10 years

129
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:31,840
too early with it. And I'm not exaggerating with that. No, everybody, you're like the whole idea

130
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:37,440
was rip your CDs and get them on this thing, right? They were just before Spotify. It was before

131
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:43,840
music in the cloud, really. Yeah. And you had this kind of piece of hardware that sat on a coffee

132
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:50,560
table or was like a small like little touchscreen, almost like a tablet, but before touchscreens are

133
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:55,920
actually any good. This media server kind of sat behind this thing and indexed your files and

134
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:03,120
connected to internet radio was the was the sales pitch back then. Of course, now internet radio is

135
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:10,480
Spotify and Pandora and all that other stuff. You know, it kind of created its own cloud in a way,

136
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:15,120
which is sort of what you needed back then. I suppose that the idea, thinking about it now,

137
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:22,160
is kind of a fun one. And if you've got one out there, you could sell it for a decent price,

138
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:29,280
for a decent price, depending on how good the condition is. What? Yeah. Yeah. Like a decent

139
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:34,720
decent condition one's going for 400 bucks online right now. Because it's like a museum piece,

140
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:40,000
right? I don't know. Because people love this stuff. I don't know what it is. But you know,

141
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,160
the idea is pretty great. So this thing can run the indexing back end or what Alex, the receiver?

142
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,680
Well, so this there's two things at play here. This Logitech media server, which is the

143
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:56,720
has has been abandoned by Logitech now, as I understand it, and taken up by the open source

144
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:02,080
community and kind of improved over the years. Fundamentally, though, it's still the same old

145
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:09,280
piece of crap underneath. And I don't wish to be rude about it. But I guess I kind of have been

146
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:15,760
already. It's just not. It's just not a modern application. But Alex, it has an iPod aux in

147
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,960
in back when they had audio connections, right? Yeah, back when they had audio ports.

148
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:29,600
So I was using pi core player to actually host LMS. And pi core player is pretty cool. Actually,

149
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:35,440
it boots fast and it runs entirely in RAM. So it doesn't write to your Raspberry Pi's SD card,

150
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:40,240
unless you want to save any settings. And it can stream from all sorts of services like Spotify

151
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:47,920
and Deezer and tidal and BBC music and a bunch of other stuff. And it was a pretty simple setup,

152
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,160
you know, typical pi stuff, you just flash an image to the SD card. And five minutes later,

153
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:58,080
you've got a working system. Trouble is, the interface once this thing loads up looks like

154
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:06,000
it was written in about 1984. And it's got lots of little tweaks and buttons. I'm sure the

155
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,000
developers of that interface know exactly where they are and which dials to tweak. And it's just

156
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:18,720
it's not an interface written by humans for humans. You know what I mean? Yeah. And it makes

157
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:24,080
it not only is it a challenge for you, but forget spousal approval, if you ever want to know, man,

158
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:30,720
you know, well, my goal for spousal approval was simply to have it appear as a Spotify Connect

159
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,280
endpoint. You know, when you list the devices, and it says, you know, here are speakers that support

160
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:40,240
like, like a Chromecast list or an Airplay list or something like that. My goal was for her not

161
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,800
to actually ever interact with this thing. Just except from like, on her phone, maybe it's one

162
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:50,000
of the available output options. Correct. But I've got to interact with it and try and figure this

163
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,280
thing out. Unfortunately, pi core player, I don't think is quite it. I couldn't get the speaker

164
00:13:55,280 --> 00:14:00,400
groups set up as I wanted or configured correctly, whether that was my fault or the interface or the

165
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:07,120
hardware I've got. I don't know, it just took up an entire evening of my time. And I just got by

166
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:12,400
the end of the evening, I got quite frustrated and gave up, frankly, were you able to get it

167
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:18,400
working at all? Like, did you get any piece of it working? It's still running behind me. It's

168
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:23,120
booted on the Raspberry Pi that's on my desk behind me. And it's still sat there providing

169
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:28,720
a Airplay endpoint. But what I ended up doing was actually pulling out my Raspberry Pi two out of

170
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:35,520
the drawer, probably the oldest Raspberry Pi I have. And I threw another project on it called

171
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:41,840
rpi audio receiver. There'll be a link to it in the show notes. And this is a simple lightweight

172
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:48,000
audio receiver with Bluetooth, Airplay one and Spotify connect built in. I couldn't honestly

173
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:55,040
believe that within one minute of it booting and configuring a couple of things from the command

174
00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:04,560
line, there's a script you install on Raspberry Pi OS, it just worked. That's nice. After my whole

175
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:09,440
evening futzing around with Pi core player, this thing just worked within a minute. I was like,

176
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:16,480
is that it? Oh, great. Cool. Isn't that what you'd expect to really, because all of these things are

177
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,800
just using like broadcast DNS and stuff to just discover each other. So you just need to get it

178
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:25,040
on the network, I would imagine, right? You must have had to give it what DHCP, there must have been

179
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,200
some sort of network config info, and then it just boots up. Yeah, well, so it's a Raspberry Pi two.

180
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:34,400
So I just installed Raspberry Pi OS on it. And then you clone the Git repo, and you run the install

181
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:40,240
script, which sets up Bluetooth, it sets up Shareport sync, and Ross Spotify, which is an

182
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:46,640
open source Spotify client for Raspberry Pi. And then once you've configured it via the script,

183
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:51,840
asks you for a couple of credentials, you're good to go. Wow. I mean, I guess setting up

184
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:55,840
Raspberry Pi is not too bad. Raspberry Pi OS doesn't take too long. But it is a step.

185
00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:01,040
What took the longest was the Raspberry Pi two installing all the packages. I mean,

186
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:06,800
oh, I slow I bet that took about 45 minutes to run the script. I think I couldn't believe how

187
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:11,840
slow it was. I think I was texting Brent at the time saying, Oh, yeah, this thing is just one step

188
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:17,200
away from junk. But yeah, it's old. But I mean, it doesn't need to be that fast. It does the trick

189
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:23,040
for playing audio. And one thing I can't say was the case for pi core player. Sadly, one of the

190
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:28,080
biggest issues with it beyond the interface was that audio just kept skipping. Oh, and that's just

191
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:33,040
no good. These days, you'd think and that was running on a pi four as well. So for anybody

192
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:38,320
that thinks it was the pi two that couldn't cope with it. The pi four couldn't cope with streaming

193
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:45,360
a Spotify stream through pi core player. Okay, so that's no good. Yeah, I have a question, Alex,

194
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:50,720
why did you decide to like downgrade to a pi two and not just switch over to the pi four? I was

195
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:56,160
trying to do too many things at once. I think just, I happened to have that one in the drawer.

196
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:04,000
I knew that I wanted to deploy two of these things to both amplifiers in the house. And I only had

197
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,280
one Raspberry Pi four and one Raspberry Pi two. So I knew that the pi two was going to have to be

198
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:15,200
used at some point. I kind of figured out the pi core player wasn't where I wanted to be fairly

199
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:19,440
quickly. But even though I kept at it, and so I was googling for other stuff in the meantime,

200
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:23,920
whilst it was doing its thing. Yeah, I've been there. You've already got you've already burned

201
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:27,280
a pie. It's working on another version. I got I got to put this on a different one. That's why

202
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:32,240
you got to just have so many pies, Alex. Now you understand my problem. I know. There you go. I'm

203
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:37,120
I'm inducted. So the last piece of the puzzle was figuring out how to control these dumb

204
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:44,000
amplifiers. And for that I turned to IR blasters, which is the technology that I've used for many

205
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,920
years with the Logitech Harmony Hub system. But Logitech again, they're turning into Google,

206
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:55,040
aren't they with deprecating products. They stopped supporting the Harmony Hub, which I still

207
00:17:55,040 --> 00:18:00,640
have one, but I don't want to deploy a new piece of hardware in the house. For starters, I only

208
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,960
have one of them. And secondly, I don't want to deploy a piece of hardware. There's already end

209
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:12,160
of life. I bought a Broadlink RM4 Mini. And this is an infrared blaster that I can use to program

210
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:19,040
from Home Assistant, infrared codes from my remote control to change the inputs on the amplifiers,

211
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:24,880
and then couple that with Home Assistant to detect the source changes on the Raspberry Pi media

212
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:30,880
player. And it will automatically change the inputs on the amplifier based on what's happening

213
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:38,080
in the real world right now. It's it's not perfect, unfortunately. So there's a bug, I think,

214
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:44,720
in the Broadlink integration where I will need to toggle between the three inputs I have on on the

215
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:49,680
amplifier in a random order, in order for it to actually end up on the correct one eventually at

216
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:54,560
the end of it, like it just doesn't send the right command. And I can't figure it out. So I

217
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:59,520
just spam the inputs and eventually it gets where I want it to be. That sounds a bit annoying. It

218
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:04,240
is. And ultimately, that's why I hate infrared blasters is because they have no knowledge of

219
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:10,320
what the end result, you know, was their blasting successful? Well, they have no idea. Yeah, that

220
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:15,040
does sound a little rickety. A little brittle, I guess. The trouble I've got though is both of

221
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:20,960
these dumb amplifiers don't have an RS232 port. They don't have any other way of controlling them

222
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:26,480
besides infrared. So I'm kind of stuck really, unless I buy two new amplifiers, which sounds

223
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,880
like it's going to be expensive. What's your sense of the reliability so far? When it works,

224
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:37,120
it works. When it doesn't, it doesn't. Hmm. Hit and miss. Yeah. Yeah, about 80%

225
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:44,160
just is not it's not high enough. I bet you there is some sort of some sort of solution out there

226
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:50,720
for this. Somebody out there listening has solved this problem. I solve it with HomePods. I admit

227
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:56,640
it. I'm a filthy iOS ecosystem user. And I just solve it with HomePods. Well, Alex, since you're

228
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:03,040
not satisfied, what's your next step? Well, the trouble is, both of these amplifiers are sort of

229
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:09,840
audio file grade amplifiers, like the one in the family room powers those beautiful big floor

230
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:16,000
standing Kef speakers that I've had for forever. And it I am super happy with the sound profile of

231
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,440
these things. And I don't want to replace it. So I don't know if you have a better idea, maybe

232
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,920
an infrared blaster that's more reliable than the broad link that you could recommend me and

233
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:33,840
I could try out. Please let me know at self hosted dot show slash contact. Linode dot com slash SSH

234
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:38,080
go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account and you get to support the show while

235
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:43,200
you're trying out something really awesome shows made possible by folks like you taking advantage

236
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:49,040
of our sponsors offer. And Linode is one that we can enthusiastically endorse. You know, they started

237
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:55,280
in 2003 as one of the very first companies of what we now call cloud computing. And now nearly 19

238
00:20:55,280 --> 00:21:00,160
years later, they're at the top, man. They are like the best the cream of the crop in performance,

239
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:06,080
pricing, support, flexibility. I mean, you just name it. They got 11 data centers around the

240
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:12,320
world. They are their own ISP. They've invested heavily and continue to do so in high performance

241
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:17,040
hardware. So they just make cloud computing simple, affordable and accessible. And as a

242
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:23,280
self hoster, I love the control I get. I have several in nodes that I have just nuked and built

243
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:29,440
from the metal up running. One of them runs Nix and one of them runs a super crazy custom VPN Linux

244
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,840
and Linode works with you to do all of that. They're not trying to prevent that kind of stuff.

245
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:38,720
What other provider out there combines that flexibility with pricing that's 30 to 50% cheaper

246
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:43,920
than the major hyperscalers? And then they wrap it all up with great support because that's how

247
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:48,800
they've architected the business. And they always have the latest Linux distros ready to go. They've

248
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:53,200
got Kali Linux if you want to do some remote auditing of your land. They have fantastic

249
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,600
documentation if you just want a deep dive on a topic like I don't know, maybe Ansible or

250
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:02,880
Kubernetes. And if you need some great backup or maybe you want to do a static website, they have

251
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:08,400
S3 compatible object storage that just screams. Then their VLAN support that lets you bridge

252
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:13,360
multiple different data centers together creating one flat virtual Linode network. And of course,

253
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:18,160
their powerful DNS manager makes it easy to manage your domains. I could just go on.

254
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,040
I think the best thing to do would be to try it for yourself. That's where that $100 comes in.

255
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:30,800
That's where the $100 comes in. So go to linode.com slash SSH. Get that $100 in 60 day credit on a

256
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:35,440
new account. And it's just a great way to support the show and try out my favorite way to run

257
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:43,760
applications in the cloud. It's linode.com slash SSH. Now, Alex, when I was there last,

258
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:48,560
I remember you were fussing with some hard drive issues which had existed when I was there the

259
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:54,000
time before. Me? Never. Many months ago. So did you ever solve that? Because it wasn't solved

260
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:02,800
when I left. I'll let you know. I've taken some steps to try and solve it. I tried all sorts of

261
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:08,560
stuff to fix this. So what was happening was I had a hard drive niggle that's been hanging around

262
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:16,400
since April, as you just said. And since then, I've tried new power cables, new data cables,

263
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:25,040
a new HBA card, even a new hard drive and still just random stuff just keeps disappearing. Like

264
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:31,440
you text me, I think it was the other week saying, I'm sure you had more episodes of Final Space

265
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:37,680
than that. Yeah, it's true. Yeah, some stuff is just vanishing randomly. And the trouble with

266
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:42,800
that is that it screws with all sorts of stuff like the Plex library reindexes every night,

267
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:50,720
just as a scheduled job that I have. And so when the drive comes back after a reboot or something,

268
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:57,280
Plex thinks, oh, goody, here's a whole bunch of new content for you. And it just screws up so

269
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:03,600
much stuff. It's both the most amazing feature of merger FS, and probably the most frustrating in

270
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:09,440
this specific scenario is that it supports drives disappearing, like a USB drive disappearing would

271
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:18,000
be no issue for just silently. And it doesn't tell me that a failure has happened. So I haven't

272
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:25,280
figured out a good way to alert on this particular issue, simply because it just it's so random when

273
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:29,920
it happens. Anyway, I took the decision that I got fed up of messing around with cables in the back

274
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:37,280
of hard drive bays. I'm using the Rosewill LSV 4500 for you rack mount server case. The version

275
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:42,480
I had did not have the hotswap hard drive cages in it. And so to make a change to the hard drives,

276
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:49,200
I had to pull the server out, lift the lid off, reach down inside in the dark with my phone torch

277
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:56,080
and like a caveman I know I know. So I finally bit the bullet. I bought three new hard drive cages

278
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:02,720
that take four three and a half hard drives each hotswap bays. They look amazing. They've got

279
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:08,480
beautiful sexy blue LEDs on the front and they they flash when activities happening like a real

280
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:15,920
server. I can only fit 12 hard drives rather than 15. But actually, I found the 10 to 12 ranges about

281
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:22,400
the sweet spot anyway for my needs, particularly with density going up as it is. And so the way

282
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:28,160
I tried to solve it is just by making it easier to do maintenance, trying to reduce the number of

283
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:34,960
cables being unplugged and re plugged and going to a backplane based solution instead of cables

284
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:39,760
directly into the drives themselves. That does sound like a really good setup Alex, even if it

285
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:43,360
doesn't necessarily solve the specific problems, it is going to be a lot easier to maintain,

286
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:48,160
which will probably reduce problems overall. I do hope so. We'll see though time will be

287
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:53,680
time will be the tell. Maybe by the next time I visit, we'll have this solved.

288
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:59,200
Maybe by the next time you visit matter might actually be in existence. Did you see the update

289
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,600
from powerless this week? Now hold on. I thought this was I thought this was my gig on the show.

290
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:08,720
I thought I was the matter hype guy and you were the guy saying matter is never going to happen.

291
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:18,080
It doesn't matter, Chris. Oh, man, it matters so much, though. I am really hopeful. I know,

292
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:23,280
you know, almost as much as Paul is the founder of Home Assistant. He really seems to be like

293
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:28,960
one of their biggest fans out there. He says he tweets matter being open source is what gives

294
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:35,680
this standard a chance to be a success. Google, Apple, Home Assistant and any other controller

295
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:40,560
will all run the same code to control the devices. The device themselves will also run

296
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:46,080
a standard matter SDK supported by the chip vendor. I expect a wave of new controllers

297
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:51,360
because with this multi admin setup, you can now have multiple controllers for your home.

298
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:56,160
Manufacturers that focus on just devices might add a hub. Home Depot will be back in the game.

299
00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:01,760
I expect Sonus to join in to maybe you. He's very hyped. He doesn't think it'll be a success from

300
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:06,800
day one, though. I don't know. I just remember that XKCD comic, you know, where there are seven

301
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:10,880
standards and they create a new standard. And now there are eight standards. And I just fear

302
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:15,760
that's where we're going to end up. But it does sound too good to be true. Doesn't it matter?

303
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:21,760
That's that's my fear. It does. Every experience I've had in my life in tech tells me this is too

304
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:28,400
good to be true. But then at the same time, we also kind of have this situation that is a little

305
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:37,760
unprecedented in tech. And so maybe a new solution is required here. No one vendor has just totally

306
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:42,880
dominated home automation and the networking protocol and the standards that go with that.

307
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:49,200
Nest didn't do it. Ring didn't do it. Apple hasn't done it with home kit. Microsoft doesn't even

308
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,840
have anything really, except for like the Xbox ecosystem. And Amazon hasn't successfully done

309
00:27:53,840 --> 00:28:00,080
it with the echo. And Google hasn't necessarily successfully done it with also the their home

310
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:05,280
assistant and all that stuff along with the nest. It's just kind of like this really kind of mix.

311
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:10,400
Everybody has a small little chunk. You have a bunch of ten percenters that have ten percent

312
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:15,040
of the market, ten percent of the market. You know, and so there's no one vendor who's leading

313
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:20,560
in this space that can declare Victor and and everybody must follow it. So they kind of need

314
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:26,080
to all come together and just declare a Victor because none of them have won. And it's been years

315
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:32,240
now. It's a very good point. And I think maybe that's driven in part, at least by the proliferation

316
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:38,960
of cheap Chinese clones of everything that gets made that's had proper R&D on it. So maybe this

317
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:43,600
is the conclusion of that and a way to try and prevent that and try and keep the Western companies,

318
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:48,400
shall we say, in the game in the long run. And the thing that Paulus was really excited about

319
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:55,440
is that version one dot o seems to have hit the project chip GitHub repo. You know,

320
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:00,640
I feel like we don't really need to speculate when is matter going to hit the market. I know

321
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,320
with absolute certainty when it's going to hit the market as soon as I break down and replace

322
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:10,000
everything with Zigbee devices, matter will come out and it'll ship. It's obvious. So you guys just

323
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,920
have to wait. The question really is, yeah, when's Chris going to get his Zigbee devices? That's

324
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:20,400
really the question we should be asking. Hurry up. OK. All right. When I get back from the trip,

325
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:25,680
that'll be one of my projects. Have we mentioned, too, that Brent and I are here in southern

326
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,960
Oregon? We just did our first meet up. So, yeah, we're on the road right now if we sound weird.

327
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,640
But yeah, when I get back, I'm working on that. Yeah. This time next week, I think we'll all be

328
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:38,480
in L.A. together warming up for JPL. Mm hmm. That's I am getting so excited. Yeah. I've been

329
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:44,080
watching videos, reading docs, getting like all the JPL knowledge. But the videos you've been

330
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:51,440
watching are like historical. Awesome. They are very the US military needed a very special unit.

331
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:55,520
You know, that kind of stuff. Well, I'm sorry to derail your space fun, but I did find a pretty

332
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:59,440
cool project related to ESP home and home assistant this week. We actually mentioned iPods

333
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:04,000
a little earlier in the show. Well, here's another reference to them. Remember that click wheel style

334
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,760
navigation on iPods as it used to have back in the day, kids? Of course. Yes. Yeah. There'll be

335
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:15,280
some kids around that don't remember that, which just makes me feel very old. But anyway, take a

336
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:19,520
look at this link that's in the show notes and tell me this isn't the coolest home assistant

337
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:24,000
remote you've ever seen. This is better than an iPod touch because it doesn't even have a housing.

338
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,360
So it looks really cool. But it's a little bit smaller, too. But it's essentially like a click

339
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:34,480
dial attached to an ESP home with a display, a little LED display mounted on it. And you can

340
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:40,640
just toggle your way through the various home assistant menus. You know, and the nice thing

341
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:46,400
is, is a toggle wheel actually is a pretty good UI when you're doing things like turning up

342
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:53,440
brightness or turning up audio up and down like the toggle UI works. Yeah, it does. And, you know,

343
00:30:53,440 --> 00:31:01,040
before touch screens, it was the way to go. Have you have you heard that there was some

344
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:05,920
like at one point or like there's some mock up of the iPhone, but with a click wheel,

345
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:10,720
they actually for a short period of time were doing two projects at the same time. There was

346
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:15,440
one camp that wanted an entirely new OS that was re based on Mac OS. And there was one camp that

347
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:20,720
wanted to take the iPod OS and bring it to the iPhone. And so they ran both of them simultaneously

348
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,960
until obviously the one based on OS 10 one out. Fascinating. I did not know that, you know,

349
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:30,640
a little iPod, an actual legitimate little iPod might not make a bad little home assistant remote

350
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:34,880
if you just wanted a couple of toggle switches on there. I could see that. I was watching some

351
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:40,480
videos the other day on YouTube. People now are taking the old iPod classics, removing the spinning

352
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:46,480
hard drive and putting SD cards in them instead. And because the SD cards require, you know,

353
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:51,680
a tenth of the power of a spinning hard drive, the battery life on these things is measured in

354
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:59,200
months, not hours. That is incredible. That's such a great idea. I love that. I'm going to I'm

355
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,640
going to experiment with different tablets and stuff, you know, use stuff. I want to find really

356
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:08,080
cheap ones because I want even more screens. I want a home assistant control screen in every

357
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:13,120
room. I would say again this year, it's been great for me to come to the studio and also into

358
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:19,040
JOOPS and have those screens as someone who doesn't know, you know, all the control voices,

359
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:23,840
the voice commands that I can use here. Just having those screens is great. Bring them up.

360
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:28,000
And I was able to eventually figure out how to turn the lights off before I went to bed last night.

361
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,360
You did it. Was it hard? Was it hard to figure it out? I would say the icon set on that particular

362
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,880
one, trying to figure out which one was going to control, you know, which one was going to

363
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:41,120
represent all the lights. I got tons of information about other systems that got me really curious.

364
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:44,720
But I eventually got there and it's pretty straightforward. Yeah, because the icons really

365
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:49,040
mean something to me. It's the bus icon, right? The bus icon. Yeah, I never saw the lights. I

366
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:53,600
never thought that was going to be a correlation. Yeah, that makes sense, I suppose. And that

367
00:32:53,600 --> 00:33:00,640
screen, the tablet that Brent was using, it defaults to the climate control when you load up

368
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:05,040
the when the screen wakes up, because that's what my wife wants access to in the morning when she's

369
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:08,640
like managing power or something like that. She wants to be able to just toggle on or turn up heat

370
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:14,720
and so that's what it turns on to by default. But you can toggle to the other dashboard pages, but

371
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:21,360
then the then the tablet on the other side of the door that's in the bathroom, that tablet does

372
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:27,440
default to that bus page with all the buttons and stuff. So go figure, right? So does she use one

373
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,360
for one function and go to back if she needs to turn the lights on? I don't think so. It's just

374
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:36,160
because it's it turns out, you know, there's like a lot of times there's just different things going

375
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:39,920
on out here that there are in the back. And so you just want two different controls. And I want

376
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:44,080
even more. I'd like one by the door. So when you get in, like I just have one that just has like

377
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:48,560
big buttons for lights, hit up one big button, just lights on. Would you like can you put something

378
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:54,160
like a stream deck instead? Yeah, or you could do like a, you know, just a regular little wireless

379
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:57,760
button. There's all kinds of you could do an actual physical button. Yeah, I think for the door,

380
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:02,320
I'd probably do a physical button. Look, even I'm getting excited. You know, you can buy the old

381
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:08,800
NVIDIA Shield tablets for like $60 on eBay right now. Oh, those are great tablets. All right. All

382
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,920
right. That's a good hot tip. I'm gonna go look that up before somebody listening buys them all

383
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:17,520
up. How many ads are gonna be on them? Well, no, I don't know. You think on the video shields? Not

384
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:22,080
really. I mean, they're running Android. So you know, that may or may not float your boat. But

385
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:25,680
I wonder if you could flash them with something newer. I would I would imagine it's a well

386
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:31,840
supported device by the likes of lineage or that that that sort of stuff. Oh, you're right, Alex.

387
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:39,760
Look at this. Oh, also the iPad mini two is 75 bucks. How would that work as a home assistant

388
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:45,040
screen? Well, you see the thing about the Android based stuff is you could use fully kiosk browser,

389
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:49,440
and then you have it, you know, use the camera to turn on and off when you're nearby, which for you

390
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:54,000
with a limited power situation is probably what you want. Yeah, I think that's a good idea.

391
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:59,360
Probably what you want. Yep. I use that now. Actually, I do that same thing. There you go.

392
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:02,880
When you approach the tablets, they just auto turn on. Heck, I might have to pick one of these up.

393
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:10,160
Look at this thing. I know. That's what I'm thinking. That's great. I'm great. I'm getting

394
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:15,840
one because I'm looking for a new tablet. There you go. You see, you're you're going to see me

395
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:20,800
just spend money right here live on the show. You shouldn't watch that print. It's just not

396
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:28,880
it's not gentlemanly of me. humio.com slash h c e go there to ingest and view all of your logs

397
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:34,080
in one place. humio is a centralized log management and observability platform. The

398
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:39,280
company was founded by developers in Denmark in 2016, as an alternative to the legacy logging

399
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:44,640
solutions that make it cost prohibitive to ingest and search data volumes that you see in your large

400
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:49,840
infrastructures today. But I think the real beauty of humio is that it can take logs

401
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:55,040
from any source and then make them usable and you don't have to constantly massage the format.

402
00:35:55,040 --> 00:36:00,240
It doesn't need the schema ahead of time. You just pump all of the logs in there and it has them when

403
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:06,560
you need them and the dashboard. It's great. This platform is crazy. Humio's index free architecture

404
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:12,160
means that it can ingest over a petabyte of data per day and search that with sub second latency

405
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:16,880
and humio is 80% cheaper than the competing platforms like Splunk or Elastic thanks to its

406
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:21,440
reduced hardware footprint. But really, if you're going to ask me, the best way to get started with

407
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:26,640
humio is the humio community edition. humio community edition is the largest no cost data

408
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:31,200
ingestion offering on the market today, allowing you to ingest up to 16 gigabytes per day with

409
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:36,480
seven day retention. It's not a trial period, you get it for the long haul. This is perfect for

410
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:40,560
self-hosters who want to ingest their home logs and get a single view of everything happening

411
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:45,040
in your environment. Rather than having to go to separate places to look at your logs and every

412
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:49,920
component in your home, humio gives you the ability to bring them together and correlate them in one

413
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:54,560
place for easier troubleshooting. You can have it do things like monitor your voltage and your

414
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:59,360
energy or take data out of home assistant and then generate alerts in real time to take action.

415
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:04,160
You can protect your computing infrastructure that way. When it's your hobby, you want it easy

416
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:08,480
and quick and usable. You don't want to have to turn it into a job after you just got home

417
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:15,040
from your job. So go get started with humio community edition today at humio.com.

418
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:26,960
Well, it's meetup season people. I'm sure you are totally not fed up with us talking about meetups,

419
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:32,160
but Chris and Brent are on the road on the way to LA already. If you'd like to get details of all

420
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:37,680
the meetups that are happening along the way, go to meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting.

421
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,160
Where's your next one going to be, gents, after this airs?

422
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:45,200
Sacramento on Friday. Really? So the day this comes out will be. So if you're listening the

423
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:50,800
day this comes out, I believe it's Sacramento and we have all the details up there. And then after

424
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:56,240
that it's Southern California and then shortly and that's a couple like a week later. And then

425
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:00,960
after that there's one more and that is in Portland. And there was actually an issue

426
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:07,360
where we had accidentally limited the RSVPs for a couple of the meetups. So if that happened to

427
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:13,360
you, if you tried to sign up and it said sorry limit reached, that was a mistake. That was

428
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:17,920
that was a meetup.com. You know, I'm getting rid of meetup. This is the last trip. I swear.

429
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,360
Well, actually I can't swear because sometimes we just don't get to it, but I would love to get a

430
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:26,080
self hosted meetup replacement. So if you had any problems, go sign up. There's still spots

431
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:31,040
available. Also, if you have any suggestions for a meetup.com replacement, we're all ears.

432
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:35,680
We did get some emails. People went over to self hosted dot show slash contact. Dr. Pepper

433
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:39,840
Shaker says he has some great Z wave light switches he wants to tell us about. I wanted to

434
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:45,760
give a shout out to the zoos. That's what the Z at the end zoo with a Z Z wave light switches.

435
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:51,920
I was chatting with the folks on Discord. Some Shelly was recommended and I was really just kind

436
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:56,400
of worried about having 40 plus Wi-Fi devices because he wants a lot of these things. And I

437
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:04,000
agree. You know what? He's got an ISP mandatory provided router AP that he has to use. I bet that

438
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,480
thing doesn't handle a whole bunch of Wi-Fi devices very well. So he wired up his whole

439
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:14,000
house with these zoo Z Z wave light switches. The Z wave network is working great. He says he got

440
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:20,880
them on sale for Labor Day for $24 each. Nice. What a score. What a score. All right. That's

441
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:25,280
definitely something to check out, he says. Thank you. And he loves the show. Well, thanks, Dr.

442
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:30,800
Pepper Shaker. We love that tip. Yeah, they're on at $28 right now. So I mean, even outside of the

443
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:35,920
sale that they're not particularly expensive compared to, say, a Shelly or something like

444
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:40,800
that, which is typically in that, you know, for the Shelly 2.5, it's typically in that $25 range

445
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:46,960
anyway. But these look really, really interesting and they get fantastic reviews. And a friend of

446
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:52,240
mine actually moved house last weekend. And one of the jobs that we went around to help him with

447
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:58,720
was pulling out all of his old Shelly's out of the walls. And ah, putting putting Shelly's in

448
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:04,320
is not difficult, but it is also really difficult trying to reverse engineer which wire goes where

449
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:10,480
and what's a traveler and blah, blah, blah, blah. Trying to reverse engineer the Shelly's when you

450
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:15,360
take them out in someone else's house is also just as much of a pain in the ass as well. So

451
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:21,760
I think smart switches with the smarts built into them versus a Shelly is something I really

452
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:26,560
think I need to investigate strongly moving forward. That makes a lot of sense. It seems

453
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:31,520
you're right. I had not given a lot of thought about removing them because honestly, if I was

454
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:35,920
going to sell a house, I just leave them in there and say it's part of the package. But no, dude,

455
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:41,440
no one else cares about your smart home stuff. And if you've got, you know, 1520 of these things,

456
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:46,160
that's, you know, four or $500. Why would I leave that for someone else? They're never going to use

457
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:49,360
it. They're never going to set it up. It doesn't add any value to them. It just adds complexity.

458
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:53,520
It's probably a negative for most people. Unfortunately, when was the last time you

459
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:58,000
moved into a house and took the light switches apart just to see what was behind them? Like

460
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,480
never. You always find some surprise in my experience. Yeah, that's you guys are just

461
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:07,600
adding to that. That's true. Yeah. But building it into the switch does seem a lot simpler from

462
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:14,000
an installation, a removal troubleshooting if it dies. That's a great point. All right.

463
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,160
Another check in the box for Z-Wave. We keep now that I've committed to switching to Zigbee,

464
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:23,200
we keep finding all these awesome Z-Wave devices. I'm going to have both. One thing I should note,

465
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:28,960
though, about these Zoos switches is that they some of these switches nowadays don't require a

466
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:35,760
neutral. So in older houses, they didn't always include a neutral wire. These ones do require a

467
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:40,400
neutral. So please make sure you go and check before you spend any money. Sue writes in and

468
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:44,880
we got a lot of opinions about hosting your own email server because we brought that up. We read

469
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:50,720
that article where the author was very frustrated, said that it's basically just only for big tech

470
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:56,720
now. Sue says, you know, maybe it was a bit of a country based issue. He's in Barcelona. I have

471
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:02,400
been self-hosting email and web service since 2011 across three states in the US, and I've only ever

472
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:08,400
had one undelivered email. And that was actually a misconfiguration on the far side. If you get a

473
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:13,360
business connection, yes, it costs more. It's about double. I have two hundred and fifty dollars for

474
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:20,080
gigabit symmetric. Oh, oh, man. Today we have been fighting bandwidth issues. We've been struggling

475
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:26,240
for a few kilobits a second. That sounds glorious. If you get at least one static IP, the same day

476
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:30,560
customer service, and then there's generally no bandwidth caps. Not to mention, no one is going

477
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:36,000
to eat everything into the sun from a business block IP space. That's true. They're not just

478
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:41,440
going to write off a whole business block of IPs. I realize that there are some for whom this is

479
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:50,080
impossible, you know, awful you or the crypto bro, musky starling types, but the crypto. Yeah, we

480
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:57,120
call it Elon link, Sue. That's what we call it. That's what it's Elon link. But you know what?

481
00:42:57,120 --> 00:43:01,920
I kind of get the I kind of get your point here. It's like if you set it up right, if you have the

482
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:08,720
right kind of connection, if you don't get your IP in trouble, you get a good ISP, you can still host

483
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:17,360
your own email. I get that. Also, Sue mentions that they're a big user of unread 186 terabytes

484
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:22,800
and running for 12 years. Yeah, that's solid. I mean, the unread stuff. Unread has been around

485
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,560
a long time. And, you know, I think I've been interested in an extra sort of seven or eight

486
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:32,800
years at this point. And it was it was pretty old when I got involved in the unread community. So

487
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:38,000
good on you, Sue. Sue also gives you a shout out, Alex, for lots of assistance over the years.

488
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:45,120
Thank you. Thank you. Now, on the flip side, we got a boost from I'm going to say a Hannigan,

489
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:52,400
a Hannigan. And they write, I actually agree with that blog post on the self hosted email.

490
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:57,520
I have done it since 2003, but found out it's increasingly harder to get my mail delivered,

491
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:01,600
especially sending to Gmail. I ended up switching to fast mail last year.

492
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:06,720
Here's another benefit of using a real email provider. And I use I use real email provider

493
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:13,680
to be slightly provocative, only slightly. Bitwarden this week actually added alias support

494
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:18,640
for fast mail. Yeah, that's so sweet. So for those that don't know what that means, you know,

495
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:24,000
when you sign up to a website and you put your real email address in an alias through Bitwarden,

496
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,080
that user generation stuff, that username generation stuff they added fairly recently,

497
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:36,800
you can now also generate a username with an automatic email forwarding alias going via your

498
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:42,800
fast mail account. They also support simple login and non Addy and Firefox relay email services.

499
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:48,880
So essentially you can mask your real email address from these services automatically as

500
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:54,880
part of the Bitwarden generation. And it interfaces with the fast mail API to actually

501
00:44:54,880 --> 00:45:01,520
add that alias into your email kind of universe within fast mail, which I just thought is amazing.

502
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:05,760
I hear so many good things about fast mail to so many good things from the audience.

503
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:12,800
A Hanukkah Hanukkah sent 5000 stats. Froze there also sent in 5000 stats. Just wanted to mention

504
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:18,640
Podverse is great, but I wish Podverse had sats streaming. It's a more fair way to give value

505
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:22,800
for value. I wanted to give Podverse a plug here on the show, because I think the self hosted

506
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:30,720
audience might be really interested in it. It is a slick cross platform web, Android and iOS

507
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:35,920
podcast player, and it sinks between all of them. I love that because it means I can listen to

508
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:41,360
something and then finish it at my desk using the web player. And it also means that when I have my

509
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:45,680
flings with Android, I have all my podcasts on there. The other thing I really like about Podverse

510
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:51,360
and why I wanted to mention it on here is because it's GPL and you can embed it on your website.

511
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:56,320
We've done it on Jupiter broadcasting and I've talked to the lead Dev Mitch several times.

512
00:45:56,320 --> 00:46:00,080
In fact, he's messaging me right now as we're recording and they're working on all kinds of

513
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:05,520
stuff, including sat streaming so you can just send the sats as you listen and they and will

514
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:10,400
receive them. It also supports a bunch of the other podcasting to features like live streaming

515
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:18,640
chapters, transcripts, host information and a bunch of other things. They've also been really

516
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:24,400
great collaborators on our new website as well. Yeah, we solved a lot of issues on both ends

517
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:29,680
with adding their player embedded on our website. And it was really neat because we had, you know,

518
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:34,400
found a few bugs in their player and they were happy to fix them pretty quickly. And it's been

519
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:37,840
great to see those two communities come together. Yeah, that's one of the really neat things that

520
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:42,000
Mitch told me is now that some of their best contributors to Podverse are Jupiter broadcasting

521
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,800
listeners. That's that's so cool. Yeah, it is really neat. So check out Podverse if you haven't

522
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:53,200
podverse.fm also shout out to Prozac who sent us a row of ducks just thanking us for the pragmatic

523
00:46:53,200 --> 00:47:01,200
cloud discussion in Episode 79 and a young dookie who just got a house and is looking to build a

524
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:06,800
full home assistant set up going all in. It's such an exciting time. So congratulations, young dookie.

525
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:13,360
Keep us posted on that. And then shim. What do you think there, Brent? Schmitzfeld. Schmitzfeld sent

526
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:20,720
two sats just to see if it was possible to send two sats across the Internet. And it was. Yeah.

527
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:25,600
And then we got 10,000 sats from Silver Snake. No message. Just send it into the show. And I just

528
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:31,280
want to give a special hello to main Hippo, who sent their very first boost this week into the

529
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:35,280
show. Amazing. Yeah, I think my favorite thing about boosts is the fact that we're kind of

530
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:41,280
rekindling the bizarreness of the IRC Nick and all these names. It's fantastic. Yeah, it's a

531
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:45,920
yeah, it's a struggle for me to read some of these. But that's my favorite part. When I get it right,

532
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:49,200
it's a win. And when I don't get it right, they can boost in again. Tell me I got it wrong. It's

533
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:55,520
also a win. Yeah. So go check out a new podcast app. Go to newpodcastapps.com and grab one that

534
00:47:55,520 --> 00:48:02,240
works for you or grab Breeze if you don't want to switch or boost CLI or, you know, try out Podverse.

535
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:09,680
I think it's pretty great. A little bit of self promotion isn't the right word,

536
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:14,400
but you know what I mean? I'm looking to sell my old dual Xeon motherboard. It's a gigabyte

537
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:25,440
GA7 PESH2. It's the dual Xeon LGA2011 board. There's a pair of E5 2690 v2 CPUs in there.

538
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:32,720
I've also got 128 gigabytes of DDR3 ECC memory in that system. I just don't use it anymore. And I

539
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:37,680
figure it should go to a good home. There's a couple of 10 gig NICs on the board, which have

540
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:44,640
been a little flaky recently. So I've been using an Intel NIC card to go in there. So just be aware

541
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:50,000
of that. If you're interested in the board, let me know via Discord or Twitter if you would like

542
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:55,120
it and we'll come to some arrangement about how to get it to you. Maybe it'd be a good start for

543
00:48:55,120 --> 00:49:00,720
somebody to build a home lab box. 128 gigs of RAM in those CPUs. You could run some VMs. That would

544
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:07,520
do the job. I paid $250 for those CPUs four years ago and they're worth about 20 bucks now, but they

545
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:13,360
still crunch, man. They still crunch. I'm impressed by the old Xeons. I have to say, I mean, I have

546
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:18,800
that old super micro box. It's like seven, eight years old. And I threw Photo Prism on there the

547
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:23,840
other day and yeah, it lit up every single core, but sure enough, it did the face detection and

548
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:30,160
it did the object recognition at a pretty reasonable pace on an old box. So you never

549
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:34,400
know. And those CPUs are slower than what you're talking about. So you never know. You could get

550
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:39,600
quite a bit out of that stuff. 10 cores and 20 threads per CPU is quite the thing to observe in

551
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:45,840
HTOP, let me tell you. Yes, it is. You know what? I'd say it's a thing of beauty, Alex. It is

552
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:50,800
beautiful. Also, our members are beautiful. Thank you for supporting the show. If you'd like to

553
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:55,920
become one of our SREs, you can go to selfhosted.show slash SRE. I really think of that as an

554
00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:00,240
investment in future content generation. You know, people can boost in and thank us for the episode

555
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:05,360

560
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:31,280
Twitter is a good one at Brent Jerva. If you can spell it, you win a prize. Don't forget that other

561
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:35,680
show that we make called Linux Unplugged as well. Yeah, I mean, he forgot to mention that part,

562
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:41,600
but Alex got it for your brand. Thanks, Alex. Yeah, I did actually get a new computer and that

563
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:47,040
episode is going to come out this week. So we talk all about it as a big day for you. That doesn't

564
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:52,080
happen very often. Yeah, you were there last time that I got a new computer and you and I Frankenstein

565
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:58,000
the whole thing. The x 250 was the x 250 x 250. Yeah, we put a new screen in it and a bunch of

566
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:02,960
like hard drive and memory upgrades. And you know what I did? Chris and I spent basically three days

567
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:08,560
running a bunch of benchmarks on both the x 250. And the new dev one that Chris and West bought me

568
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:13,360
those sweethearts. And we can now say also the brand new Thalia that was just released today

569
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:17,920
as we're recording. That's true. Yeah, that's why it took three days. We had a lot of fun.

570
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:22,320
We were doing some major shootouts. It was pretty great. Those guys over at system 76,

571
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:26,880
they do some cool stuff. Speaking of which, actually, I got word today that one of our

572
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:32,800
old friends of the network cheese bacon is going to be at all things open in Raleigh at the beginning

573
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:38,240
of November. I will try and be there as well. Certainly, we'll do a micro meetup in the rally

574
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:44,880
area. We'll post some details on the meetup page in the element room as well to get the details on

575
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:48,800
that one as well. But if you come into all things open, it'll be great to see you. Maybe we'll go

576
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:56,240
out for an evening of debauchery and fun. I don't know what we'll do any trivia, Alex. Maybe some

577
00:51:56,240 --> 00:52:04,080
trivia. Maybe, maybe. Yeah, go get in that matrix room and do the meetup spaces. We have more and

578
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:09,440
more all the time details are at Jupiter broadcasting.com slash matrix. And of course,

579
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:13,520
we always love your feedback. You can send that in at self hosted dot show slash contact. That's

580
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:18,240

00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:22,480
podcast. Well, that's at self hosted show, obviously. Thanks for listening, everybody.

582
