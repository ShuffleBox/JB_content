WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.440
I've been busy making tons and tons of bread this week.

00:03.440 --> 00:04.480
Bread? Really?

00:05.040 --> 00:07.360
Yeah, bread, like the dough stuff, right?

00:07.360 --> 00:09.280
You know, flour, water, yeast.

00:09.280 --> 00:10.960
Yeah, okay, how's that going?

00:10.960 --> 00:11.520
It's good.

00:11.520 --> 00:17.440
You know, it's a good way to work out some frustrations needing that dough.

00:17.440 --> 00:18.080
I'll tell you what.

00:18.720 --> 00:21.920
So are you telling me you've bought into the pandemic craze of making sourdough,

00:21.920 --> 00:23.440
or is this bread for something else?

00:23.440 --> 00:24.560
This isn't sourdough.

00:24.560 --> 00:25.840
I'm not a hipster, bro.

00:25.840 --> 00:27.360
I refute that allegation.

00:27.920 --> 00:28.880
Sourdough is delicious.

00:28.880 --> 00:29.840
It is, yeah.

00:29.840 --> 00:32.400
I tried sourdough last year and failed.

00:32.960 --> 00:34.560
Pretty spectacular.

00:34.560 --> 00:38.560
I ended up with this soggy lump of what should have been delicious bread,

00:38.560 --> 00:40.160
and it was, I mean, it tasted fine.

00:40.160 --> 00:42.720
It was just dense AF.

00:42.720 --> 00:43.600
Doesn't sound very good.

00:43.600 --> 00:46.080
Yeah, I've seen those bad bread experiments.

00:46.080 --> 00:47.280
It's not so good.

00:47.280 --> 00:53.840
But this stuff, I'm just making standard crusty loaf, and it's all in the kneading.

00:53.840 --> 00:55.680
It's all in the, you know, working.

00:55.680 --> 00:58.080
You got to work it, girl, you know?

00:58.080 --> 01:00.000
Sure, sure.

01:00.000 --> 01:00.960
I love to work it.

01:00.960 --> 01:02.080
And is it sandwich bread?

01:02.080 --> 01:03.360
Is that what you're doing with it?

01:03.360 --> 01:06.800
Yeah, well, we actually went to Trader Joe's for the first time this week.

01:06.800 --> 01:08.560
Do you have Trader Joe's up where you are?

01:08.560 --> 01:09.360
Sure, we do, yeah.

01:10.160 --> 01:13.680
And we've discovered it's somewhat like, for the British audience,

01:13.680 --> 01:20.000
it's like a cross between Aldi and Marks and Spencer's food hall.

01:20.880 --> 01:24.000
There's only own brand products in this shop,

01:24.000 --> 01:27.120
and we found this thing in there called cookie butter.

01:27.120 --> 01:28.320
It's like peanut butter.

01:28.320 --> 01:30.800
It's a spread, and it goes on bread.

01:30.800 --> 01:38.560
And it's like gingerbread meets Nutella on fresh crusty bread.

01:38.560 --> 01:43.200
I'm telling you, man, there are few meals that are more delicious than that one.

01:43.200 --> 01:44.400
Man, you're making me hungry.

01:44.400 --> 01:47.600
Well, if you want to spend your time learning something else,

01:47.600 --> 01:49.840
maybe you should consider a cloud guru.

01:49.840 --> 01:53.920
They are the leader in cloud learning, and they have all kinds of modern tech skills,

01:53.920 --> 01:56.480
including Linux that you can learn, hundreds of courses,

01:56.480 --> 01:57.680
thousands of hands-on labs.

01:57.680 --> 01:58.400
Get certified.

01:58.400 --> 01:59.360
Get hired.

01:59.360 --> 02:02.160
Get learning at a cloudguru.com.

02:02.160 --> 02:04.480
Or you could learn bread, too, or maybe both.

02:04.480 --> 02:06.080
You mean this isn't the bread action show.

02:06.080 --> 02:06.880
Is that what you're trying to say?

02:07.680 --> 02:08.400
I mean, not yet.

02:09.680 --> 02:10.720
It could be.

02:10.720 --> 02:12.480
Now, you just got back from a trip, right?

02:12.480 --> 02:13.440
Welcome back.

02:13.440 --> 02:14.320
Got back yesterday.

02:15.760 --> 02:16.560
Still a little tired.

02:17.120 --> 02:20.480
Went all the way to Bozeman, Montana, which is one of our favorite destinations.

02:20.480 --> 02:22.000
Just a beautiful spot.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.800
Had the kids, had the dog, had the wife.

02:24.800 --> 02:26.960
So it was a fully loaded bus.

02:26.960 --> 02:31.200
And it's also, I think, Alex, the first trip since the big Project RV upgrades,

02:31.200 --> 02:34.960
like all of them, including the internet setup, have all been in place.

02:34.960 --> 02:35.360
Yeah, nice.

02:35.360 --> 02:38.480
I think the last one I recall you took was down to Texas.

02:39.120 --> 02:39.600
Yeah.

02:39.600 --> 02:41.040
And we didn't have the internet system then.

02:41.040 --> 02:44.720
We had the solar system at that point, but we did not have the internet.

02:44.720 --> 02:44.960
Right.

02:44.960 --> 02:48.160
Your industrial grade carrier busting.

02:48.160 --> 02:49.200
How did that work out?

02:49.200 --> 02:50.720
Well, you know, I'm pretty happy.

02:50.720 --> 02:51.360
I'm pretty happy.

02:51.360 --> 02:54.800
I mean, so the main goal when I'm traveling with the whole family

02:54.800 --> 02:58.480
is to have my self-hosted system in my RV just be like out of the mind,

02:58.480 --> 03:03.680
out of the picture, no hassle, just I call it out of the way automation

03:03.680 --> 03:05.840
because it's like facilitating the entire trip,

03:05.840 --> 03:08.320
but I don't want to be managing it during the trip.

03:08.320 --> 03:09.200
It's like hygiene.

03:09.200 --> 03:10.640
You shouldn't have to think about it.

03:10.640 --> 03:13.600
The minute you're thinking about someone else's hygiene,

03:13.600 --> 03:15.520
like you know they need to step it up a bit.

03:16.160 --> 03:20.080
And it definitely, the setup passed that bar.

03:20.080 --> 03:22.800
It was pretty seamless, really.

03:23.600 --> 03:28.320
I had reception in areas that I've never had reception before.

03:28.320 --> 03:31.200
And the whole thing is like, I want the whole land to be really solid

03:31.200 --> 03:35.120
because the kids are streaming videos off of a Raspberry Pi

03:35.120 --> 03:37.840
or they're playing peer-to-peer networking games.

03:37.840 --> 03:39.680
And I want that connection to remain up

03:39.680 --> 03:42.320
regardless of what the cellular connection is doing.

03:42.320 --> 03:43.760
So I've sort of separated it all out.

03:43.760 --> 03:48.320
I have Wi-Fi access points and I have a router and I keep that all separated

03:48.320 --> 03:50.480
so that way the router could even be offline theoretically.

03:50.480 --> 03:52.640
Because there are times, legitimately,

03:52.640 --> 03:54.480
while we're driving through the Cascade Mountains

03:54.480 --> 03:57.440
or we're going through passes that we just don't have signal.

03:57.440 --> 03:59.680
There's just nobody has a cell tower on the mountain.

04:01.200 --> 04:02.320
So we want stuff to work.

04:03.760 --> 04:05.520
And then when we get back into connectivity,

04:05.520 --> 04:08.560
whichever cellular provider is available and we have three on board,

04:08.560 --> 04:11.920
I want that one to pick up and just start working.

04:11.920 --> 04:14.720
That blew my mind the first time we took a trip in the Southwest

04:14.720 --> 04:17.680
in the deserts around like Utah and stuff is,

04:17.680 --> 04:22.400
we went sometimes an entire workday without any coverage.

04:22.400 --> 04:23.120
Yeah.

04:23.120 --> 04:24.000
Crazy.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
Yeah, it is really,

04:26.000 --> 04:28.560
Washington has gotten really good about it, my home state.

04:29.200 --> 04:32.400
We have got towers everywhere except for the tops of the passes.

04:32.400 --> 04:35.280
But there are absolutely parts of Montana

04:35.280 --> 04:38.320
where there's just no signal we were at and same in Texas still.

04:38.320 --> 04:40.080
So what I have for my technology stuff,

04:40.080 --> 04:41.920
because I wanted all the work really smooth

04:41.920 --> 04:43.920
and I just want it to be a really good experience

04:43.920 --> 04:47.440
and it's really when I just need it to be the most hassle-free.

04:47.440 --> 04:50.160
So I kind of have a regime before I go into a trip

04:50.160 --> 04:51.840
and I have these windows of time.

04:51.840 --> 04:55.760
And this is just something where it's for the entire RV,

04:55.760 --> 04:58.000
but the technology stack is part of this.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.720
And the first one is what I call my T48 window.

05:00.720 --> 05:03.200
And that's 48 hours before a trip.

05:03.200 --> 05:07.200
In this T48 window, major changes are allowed to the technology stack.

05:07.200 --> 05:11.360
Like I did an Ubuntu 2104 update to get all the security fixes in.

05:11.360 --> 05:13.360
I installed the latest Home Assistant upgrade.

05:13.360 --> 05:16.720
And if I'm going to remove a node from the network

05:16.720 --> 05:18.640
or add something to the network,

05:18.640 --> 05:22.160
this T48 window is my last chance, 48 hours before we leave.

05:22.160 --> 05:24.560
That's my last chance to make a major change like that.

05:25.200 --> 05:28.880
It's also when I'll take snapshots of Home Assistant and my boxes

05:28.880 --> 05:31.200
and make sure my backups are offsite.

05:31.200 --> 05:35.360
It's a window of time to kind of just do a sanity check on all of my,

05:35.360 --> 05:37.360
what if I lose the devices?

05:37.360 --> 05:40.640
What if there's something that causes me to completely lose the storage

05:40.640 --> 05:41.760
or something like that?

05:41.760 --> 05:45.360
Do I have something in place just to make sure before I go?

05:45.360 --> 05:47.440
You know, it's so great about everything you've just said.

05:47.440 --> 05:49.760
I think you actually have more pre-flight checks

05:49.760 --> 05:53.840
than some customers of mine do deploying stuff into production.

05:54.960 --> 06:00.480
Well, I recently kind of decided to really treat these trips

06:00.480 --> 06:03.440
as kind of an operational thing.

06:03.440 --> 06:07.520
And that goes into like finding gas stations that we can fit in

06:07.520 --> 06:10.560
and the best routes to take and trying to identify weather conditions

06:10.560 --> 06:15.200
and construction and these concepts of a T48 checklist,

06:15.200 --> 06:18.320
we expand that too to like making sure we have propane available,

06:18.880 --> 06:20.240
double checking reservations.

06:20.240 --> 06:22.560
Like it's a lot outside of just the tech stack.

06:23.040 --> 06:25.120
And you know, we also will use this window of time

06:25.120 --> 06:27.600
to make a go or no go call possibly on the trip.

06:27.600 --> 06:29.280
Maybe something came up.

06:29.280 --> 06:32.800
Like this last trip, we had something come up and we're like,

06:32.800 --> 06:34.960
well, we should have added that to the T48 checklist.

06:34.960 --> 06:37.280
And now that's part of what we're going to do from now on.

06:37.280 --> 06:40.640
Oh, hold on, hold on, your checklist has a name?

06:40.640 --> 06:42.560
Yeah, T48. Yeah, yeah.

06:42.560 --> 06:43.280
That's not just it.

06:43.280 --> 06:46.480
We have it's yeah, because that's T minus 48 hours until leaving.

06:46.480 --> 06:46.720
Yeah.

06:46.720 --> 06:48.400
Oh, okay.

06:48.400 --> 06:49.520
I like it.

06:49.520 --> 06:51.920
And then we also have the T24 window.

06:51.920 --> 06:54.480
Now that's the last like crunch time.

06:54.480 --> 06:56.640
That's 24 hours before the trip.

06:56.640 --> 07:00.960
That's when I break down my home office set up quote unquote in the RV.

07:00.960 --> 07:03.200
So I no longer have a PC set up.

07:03.200 --> 07:06.880
So I mostly transitioned to using my iPad for most of my work

07:06.880 --> 07:08.800
or if I have to allow, I'll break out my laptop.

07:09.440 --> 07:15.680
And this is where the change control committee AKA myself says no more big changes.

07:17.840 --> 07:20.000
Just stop with your crazy updates.

07:20.720 --> 07:21.520
I don't care.

07:21.520 --> 07:22.640
I love this so much.

07:23.200 --> 07:26.640
I can't even, oh, this is so good.

07:26.640 --> 07:27.360
It works though.

07:27.360 --> 07:29.600
It's like, and I've been in that window before.

07:29.600 --> 07:31.680
I'm like, oh, I didn't install the home assistant update.

07:31.680 --> 07:34.480
I'm probably going to be too behind by the time I'm on the road trip.

07:34.480 --> 07:37.200
I should do it right before I leave because I'm going to be in a limited

07:37.200 --> 07:39.600
or maybe no bandwidth situation on the road.

07:39.600 --> 07:43.040
But when I'm in that T24 window, no, no major changes

07:43.040 --> 07:45.440
because I don't want to do anything that's going to break

07:45.440 --> 07:48.160
and cause me to go on a big project right before we leave.

07:48.160 --> 07:48.560
Right.

07:48.560 --> 07:51.760
That's what we call in the biz a change freeze window.

07:51.760 --> 07:52.160
Yep.

07:52.160 --> 07:52.480
Yep.

07:52.480 --> 07:56.400
And that is an effect on once the T24 window is in effect.

07:57.120 --> 08:01.920
But you know what I will do during this time is I will manage the media for the trip.

08:01.920 --> 08:06.640
This is part of happy family, happy life where I go through because I have only

08:06.640 --> 08:09.120
two terabytes of media storage in the RV.

08:09.120 --> 08:12.480
So I go through and I purge old movies and shows that we're not watching anymore.

08:13.120 --> 08:17.040
And then I kind of load in the fresh stuff because I want content that the kids can watch

08:17.040 --> 08:21.600
while we're going down the road that I know is kid friendly and will also keep them occupied.

08:21.600 --> 08:26.800
So little tip for you dads out there, what I start doing or you moms is I start collecting

08:26.800 --> 08:30.320
a show for them like weeks before the trip and I don't tell them about it.

08:30.320 --> 08:32.800
And I get it all organized like on an external hard drive.

08:32.800 --> 08:38.640
And then I load it on the Plex server in this T24 window and then I tell Plex to immediately

08:38.640 --> 08:39.840
index and do its thing.

08:39.840 --> 08:43.280
So that way when we set off for the trip, all of a sudden they've just got new content

08:43.280 --> 08:43.840
on Plex.

08:43.840 --> 08:44.560
Oh, look at this.

08:44.560 --> 08:45.360
It's great.

08:45.360 --> 08:48.960
And then something else I'll do is I'll look for like a movie or a trilogy.

08:48.960 --> 08:52.480
That's what I've been doing is finding family trilogies and loading them on there as well.

08:52.480 --> 08:56.480
So while we're on the road, maybe we're at a rest stop for a night or we're at some site

08:56.480 --> 09:00.880
where it's really bad weather and the kids are kind of stuck in the RV, we've got movies

09:00.880 --> 09:01.280
to watch.

09:01.280 --> 09:02.960
Like this year I brought Jurassic Park.

09:02.960 --> 09:04.480
Last year I brought Back to the Future.

09:04.480 --> 09:05.440
I love the trilogies.

09:05.440 --> 09:07.520
Who doesn't love a bit of Jeff Goldblum, eh?

09:07.520 --> 09:08.000
Right.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.120
Oh, my gosh.

09:09.680 --> 09:12.560
I have not watched Jurassic Park in like forever.

09:12.560 --> 09:15.440
And boy, Jeff Goldblum is laying it on thick in that movie.

09:16.320 --> 09:18.880
It's thicker than my cookie butter on fresh bread.

09:20.800 --> 09:21.760
No doubt about it.

09:22.560 --> 09:25.440
So, you know, they get all that stuff sorted in my 24 hour window.

09:25.440 --> 09:29.680
Verify that my LTE networks are all active, that one of my crazy carriers hasn't like

09:29.680 --> 09:31.920
canceled my account for some random reason.

09:31.920 --> 09:37.680
I'll even reboot my router often just to make sure that comes up fresh and nice and snappy.

09:37.680 --> 09:39.520
And then we set off.

09:39.520 --> 09:41.280
And that's kind of my process every time.

09:41.280 --> 09:45.440
And it forces me to go through and verify my backups, kind of forces me to do updates

09:45.440 --> 09:48.000
and figure out what needs updated and what I couldn't do.

09:48.000 --> 09:52.480
And kind of makes me think about what do I need that I can store offline so that way

09:52.480 --> 09:54.880
when we don't have connectivity, life goes on as usual.

09:54.880 --> 09:56.480
And I think it worked really well.

09:57.280 --> 10:02.000
You know, this kind of trip to Montana was one of my use cases in my mind for this whole

10:02.000 --> 10:02.800
project off grid.

10:02.800 --> 10:04.000
That's awesome, man.

10:04.000 --> 10:12.160
Like last time you were trying to solve some issues around, was it the various voice tubes,

10:12.160 --> 10:16.480
the voice assistants and their GPS locations and stuff with them freaking out.

10:16.480 --> 10:17.680
How was that this time?

10:17.680 --> 10:23.760
So the HomePod does all right because it goes often, not always, but by the location of

10:23.760 --> 10:25.360
like the primary phone that set it up.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.400
But the other stuff is really dumb about it.

10:28.400 --> 10:32.640
And so what we just use the other stuff as is reference for what it's like back at home.

10:32.640 --> 10:36.880
So when we ask for weather or we see the clock on there, we know that's what time at home

10:36.880 --> 10:38.000
is or what weather is at home.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.600
And that's just, you know, what really, I think, solved that problem for me was when

10:41.600 --> 10:47.040
I put up the fire tablets that have the Home Assistant dashboard up all the time and the

10:47.040 --> 10:50.160
family can just, they kind of just prefer to do that anyways.

10:50.800 --> 10:52.640
And then I still kind of use the tubes.

10:52.640 --> 10:54.960
But you made a point the other day on Linux Unplugged.

10:54.960 --> 10:57.040
There's actually a great interview on there.

10:57.040 --> 11:00.800
And we were torn about whether to use that interview in this show or LUP.

11:00.800 --> 11:05.760
And we ended up using it in LUP in the end with Aaron about his converted school bus.

11:06.320 --> 11:07.920
Yeah, really cool project.

11:07.920 --> 11:10.640
You know, and Alex, he's taken to the next level.

11:10.640 --> 11:14.320
I'm still not there yet where I'm not pulling all of the metrics out of my electrical system

11:14.320 --> 11:17.200
and putting it into Home Assistant, but he's done it.

11:17.200 --> 11:22.800
He's done it with some raspberry pies and a little box that Victron makes called the Venus.

11:22.800 --> 11:24.960
And he gets all that information in there.

11:24.960 --> 11:27.280
And I love that idea.

11:27.280 --> 11:29.760
And then what I want to do is kind of gamify it a little bit.

11:29.760 --> 11:35.680
And I saw another post recently from a dad who took Home Assistant and put family chores

11:35.680 --> 11:39.360
in there and the family checks off the chores via the Home Assistant Lovelace dashboard.

11:39.360 --> 11:40.640
And it generates points.

11:40.640 --> 11:41.360
You saw that?

11:41.360 --> 11:42.320
I saw that one, yeah.

11:42.320 --> 11:43.200
It's such a great way.

11:43.200 --> 11:47.520
I'd love to do that, but with power to kind of encourage and incentivize the family to

11:47.520 --> 11:53.600
conserve power, although on this trip, Alex, legitimately, the solar system was totally

11:53.600 --> 11:54.080
enough.

11:54.080 --> 12:00.320
I was worried that 600 amp hours of lithium would not be enough power for a full family.

12:00.320 --> 12:03.920
But when you get some good solar coming in, like we had on this trip, we had good solar

12:03.920 --> 12:08.000
every day, and you're doing just a little bit of driving so you also charge from the

12:08.000 --> 12:11.840
alternator, I'm not exaggerating when I say we had unlimited power.

12:11.840 --> 12:18.240
We had more power than we could use for the nearly two weeks.

12:18.240 --> 12:23.440
We just lived life as if we were hooked up to the grid, and I never had to tell the kids

12:23.440 --> 12:25.600
turn off the lights or don't turn that TV on.

12:26.320 --> 12:28.160
I do still struggle with some overheating problems.

12:28.160 --> 12:32.240
I had my power system overheat once when it was pretty hot out and we were really pushing

12:32.240 --> 12:35.520
it, and I was really trying to see how hard I could push the system in general.

12:36.480 --> 12:40.640
And it did like a safety shut down on me and turned off the power to everything.

12:40.640 --> 12:43.280
Harder everything, including the servers.

12:43.280 --> 12:47.040
Well, I mean, if you're doing a life hack where you're using the sun to power your air

12:47.040 --> 12:51.680
conditioner to cool you down as well as, you know, running a toaster or whatever else you're

12:51.680 --> 12:52.080
doing.

12:52.080 --> 12:55.680
Yeah, it's a bit of a it's a bit of one of those situations where when you have that

12:55.680 --> 12:59.200
much sun, it creates enough heat that you need to run the air conditioning and you end

12:59.200 --> 13:00.560
up trying to balance it all out.

13:01.280 --> 13:02.400
And I was really pushing it.

13:02.400 --> 13:03.840
Oh, and we'd been driving.

13:03.840 --> 13:06.080
And of course, the drivetrain itself gets hot.

13:06.080 --> 13:10.240
So where our power bay is at, you know, there's heat from the drivetrain to adding to this

13:10.240 --> 13:10.640
whole thing.

13:12.880 --> 13:14.400
So, yeah, I'm very happy with it.

13:14.400 --> 13:18.640
I do have to seriously figure out cooling, but it just is going to involve major cutting

13:18.640 --> 13:19.680
into the side of my RV.

13:19.680 --> 13:21.280
And I just don't want to do that.

13:21.280 --> 13:24.160
But one day and I need to get that data into home assistant.

13:24.160 --> 13:25.760
I've got to get that figured out as well.

13:26.480 --> 13:31.840
And then ultimately, Alex, I would love to be managing this entire thing with some system

13:31.840 --> 13:35.200
that allows me to redeploy everything from scratch.

13:35.200 --> 13:39.440
So if a Raspberry Pi died from heat or everything died and I had to pop in new units when I'm

13:39.440 --> 13:44.160
on the road, it would be a minimal amount of downtime and just totally be able to redeploy

13:44.160 --> 13:46.080
my infrastructure from one central point.

13:46.080 --> 13:49.360
And I know that's something we want to talk about today, but it's been on my mind because

13:49.360 --> 13:53.840
that seems like the next level I could take this set up to to make it even more trouble

13:53.840 --> 13:54.160
free.

13:54.160 --> 13:58.480
And when there is a problem, a couple of Raspberry Pis in the drawer, I pop them in

13:58.480 --> 14:01.440
and I run some sort of system and they're back up and running.

14:01.440 --> 14:02.880
OK, I'm out 45 minutes.

14:02.880 --> 14:04.400
That's that's where I want to take it next.

14:04.400 --> 14:10.080
So data from the power system, figuring out cooling and doing some kind of infrastructure

14:10.080 --> 14:13.200
as code set up are my next goals for Project Off Grid.

14:13.200 --> 14:16.320
I love your optimism that you've only got a couple of pies in the drawer.

14:17.840 --> 14:21.840
And I should probably have a switch and maybe a whole other router because that stuff gets

14:21.840 --> 14:22.240
hot.

14:22.240 --> 14:22.960
Power supplies.

14:22.960 --> 14:24.000
Don't forget those.

14:24.000 --> 14:24.400
Yes.

14:24.960 --> 14:25.360
Yeah.

14:25.360 --> 14:28.480
Everything the stuff in the in the in the telco cupboard.

14:28.480 --> 14:29.520
How's the bench seat?

14:29.520 --> 14:30.160
It gets hot.

14:30.160 --> 14:31.200
It gets really hot.

14:31.200 --> 14:33.600
The bench seats also getting hot, but less equipment in there.

14:33.600 --> 14:36.560
It's better now as I've moved, as I've dispersed stuff.

14:36.560 --> 14:39.200
Now that I have power over Ethernet, I've kind of spread stuff out.

14:39.200 --> 14:39.520
Yes.

14:39.520 --> 14:43.840
So the thermal load is not as bad, but it's still not where it's still need.

14:43.840 --> 14:44.880
It still needs a solution.

14:44.880 --> 14:45.680
I'm still not happy.

14:45.680 --> 14:47.520
POE is just so awesome.

14:47.520 --> 14:52.800
I was putting a TV on the wall in my kitchen the other day and I've got one of these Unify

14:52.800 --> 14:58.640
units that's powered over Ethernet and on the bottom, it's got a couple of Ethernet

14:58.640 --> 14:59.760
jacks on the bottom.

14:59.760 --> 15:04.480
And so rather than running a whole second Ethernet cable from wherever in the house,

15:04.480 --> 15:09.040
which would have been a good couple of hundred feet's worth of cable, I just plugged one

15:09.040 --> 15:13.360
tiny little right angle jack into the bottom of this Unify thing, fed it up through the

15:13.360 --> 15:15.680
drywall and out behind the TV just above it.

15:15.680 --> 15:17.600
And it was so easy.

15:17.600 --> 15:17.760
Yeah.

15:17.760 --> 15:21.440
Those are the kinds of solutions that feel like like life hacks because you just saved

15:21.440 --> 15:24.320
yourself an hour or two running cable.

15:24.320 --> 15:27.280
And who enjoys fishing cables through walls, man?

15:27.280 --> 15:28.400
And crawl spaces.

15:28.400 --> 15:28.960
Not me.

15:28.960 --> 15:30.080
I'll tell you that.

15:31.840 --> 15:34.240
Linode.com slash SSH.

15:34.240 --> 15:39.120
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit towards a new account and go there to support the

15:39.120 --> 15:39.680
show.

15:39.680 --> 15:41.760
Linode.com slash SSH.

15:41.760 --> 15:43.520
Linode is our cloud server provider.

15:43.520 --> 15:48.400
And really, it's not just because the price is so great, although it is great.

15:48.400 --> 15:52.560
It's also because the tools they have make it possible for a small team to have killer

15:52.560 --> 15:53.680
infrastructure.

15:53.680 --> 15:55.840
Alex and I use it for our projects here on the show.

15:55.840 --> 16:00.880
We use it for the back end infrastructure for JB 3.0 and millions of projects and sites

16:00.880 --> 16:03.360
that we all love on the Internet are using Linode.

16:03.360 --> 16:07.600
They've been around since 2003 as one of the first companies in cloud computing, three

16:07.600 --> 16:10.240
years before AWS and other enterprise providers.

16:10.240 --> 16:13.360
They're independently owned and founded on a love for Linux and open source.

16:13.920 --> 16:15.360
I mean, they like to geek around with this stuff.

16:15.360 --> 16:16.800
That's why they started so long ago.

16:17.360 --> 16:22.080
Now that we live in the future, they're dedicated to offering the best virtualized cloud computing.

16:22.080 --> 16:25.280
If it runs on Linux, well, it'll run on Linode.

16:25.280 --> 16:29.760
And they have node balancers and, of course, a fantastic dashboard to make it all possible.

16:29.760 --> 16:34.560
Eleven data centers around the world, one click deployments of the entire application

16:34.560 --> 16:37.200
stack, if that's how you roll or build the whole thing up from scratch.

16:37.200 --> 16:42.240
And if you like to manage it with some centralized tools like Terraform, they support that, too.

16:42.240 --> 16:48.160
And then just kind of like the bow on top of it all, they have fantastic 24 seven customer

16:48.160 --> 16:50.400
support by phone or by ticket.

16:50.400 --> 16:53.200
So you're going to be taken care of if you ever run into any problems.

16:53.200 --> 16:58.320
Go see why a huge part of our community has started using Linode and why we use it ourselves.

16:58.320 --> 17:00.400
Linode.com slash SSH.

17:00.400 --> 17:04.560
Now, you know, I have a bit of a thing about

17:04.560 --> 17:07.680
GUIs and I prefer to do things on the command line, don't you?

17:07.680 --> 17:09.120
That is totally true.

17:09.120 --> 17:15.280
The one exception to this rule for probably seven or eight years has been my firewall

17:15.280 --> 17:16.320
for some reason.

17:16.320 --> 17:20.480
I've allowed myself to run PFSense and then I moved to OpenSense last year.

17:20.480 --> 17:23.360
You know, I've thought about that and I've meant to ask you why that is.

17:23.360 --> 17:24.320
I don't know.

17:24.320 --> 17:25.520
It's not rational.

17:25.520 --> 17:27.520
Maybe it's you always do something that way.

17:27.520 --> 17:29.600
And so you go on doing it that way, perhaps.

17:29.600 --> 17:30.480
Yeah, that must be it.

17:30.480 --> 17:34.800
Like and I came to the conclusion that with my home lab set up where I'm spinning up and

17:34.800 --> 17:40.800
down OpenShift stuff all the time and I'm constantly adding Mac address reservations

17:40.800 --> 17:46.960
for new smart devices that arrive, you know, I get a new phone or a new Shelly device pops

17:46.960 --> 17:48.160
up or whatever it is.

17:48.160 --> 17:52.880
I feel like I'm logging into OpenSense three or four times a week to make some small tweak

17:52.880 --> 17:53.360
for some reason.

17:53.360 --> 17:57.680
Now, that's fine if you, you know, think about it.

17:57.680 --> 18:02.880
It's not really that big of a deal, but I would prefer to just make one config line

18:02.880 --> 18:07.040
change in an Ansible repo or something and then run a playbook and it's done.

18:07.680 --> 18:14.080
So I finally bitten the bullet and written a playbook to turn an old Raspberry Pi 3B

18:14.080 --> 18:18.480
plus that I have into my DNS and DHCP server.

18:18.480 --> 18:20.000
Very nice.

18:20.000 --> 18:24.160
And you think a Raspberry, I mean, yeah, it should be powerful enough for what you've

18:24.160 --> 18:24.480
got.

18:24.480 --> 18:26.560
How many devices on your network would you say?

18:26.560 --> 18:33.760
I think I've got like 150 or so, but I mean, it's not like, you know, the performance

18:33.760 --> 18:39.600
of a DHCP server, this is ancient history technology, you know, that those servers have

18:39.600 --> 18:46.240
been around as long as the internet has pretty much those technologies and they need such

18:46.240 --> 18:47.760
minimal resources.

18:47.760 --> 18:52.880
The only thing I was worried about with the Raspberry Pi using that for DHCP and DNS was

18:53.440 --> 18:54.400
it's a Pi, right?

18:54.400 --> 18:59.840
I mean, it's logging to an SD card, but then I can just USB boot and put logs into RAM

18:59.840 --> 19:03.280
and ship them off to some remote server if I really want to keep them.

19:04.240 --> 19:05.520
So I think I can work around that.

19:05.520 --> 19:12.080
But what I ended up doing was using this as an exercise to remind myself how much I enjoy

19:12.080 --> 19:12.880
writing code.

19:13.840 --> 19:15.920
It's not something I do as much as I would like anymore.

19:15.920 --> 19:24.080
And one of the most difficult challenges I found actually was making Ansible look at

19:24.080 --> 19:28.320
a list of Mac addresses that I'd supplied and check for any duplicates.

19:28.320 --> 19:32.880
I mean, it sounds like a really simple thing and, you know, probably to some people it

19:32.880 --> 19:36.400
is, but to me, I felt like I was working on the DaVinci code solving this one.

19:37.360 --> 19:45.680
I have one big list of dictionaries with multiple sub keys and sub elements within them,

19:45.680 --> 19:46.080
right?

19:46.080 --> 19:51.280
So it's, you know, name, IP and Mac address, for example, which corresponds to a specific

19:51.280 --> 19:53.600
device or a specific host on my network.

19:54.320 --> 19:59.440
So I can go in and iterate over those keys using Ansible, over those sub elements using

19:59.440 --> 20:04.560
Ansible, and pull out the bits of information that I need to generate the config files,

20:04.560 --> 20:07.600
which then get deployed onto the Raspberry Pi using Ansible.

20:08.400 --> 20:17.360
But what was really difficult was actually trying to control the flow of variables using

20:17.360 --> 20:18.800
facts using Ansible.

20:18.800 --> 20:21.840
And there's a code snippet in the show notes if you're interested.

20:21.840 --> 20:28.240
But what I ended up doing was reading the list of Mac addresses into a fact and then

20:28.240 --> 20:33.840
comparing it against itself to be unique using one of Ansible's built-in filters.

20:33.840 --> 20:40.240
And I'm sure very few people listening to this are going to ever want to solve the problem

20:40.240 --> 20:42.400
that I solved, but I'm incredibly proud of this bit of code.

20:43.840 --> 20:45.520
So I thought I'd talk about it on the show.

20:45.520 --> 20:46.960
That's a nice solution.

20:46.960 --> 20:52.560
And kind of just works towards what I was talking about, how, in a way, what you've

20:52.560 --> 20:57.280
done is you've let the computer solve a problem for you that I would just spend human

20:57.280 --> 20:58.480
hours burning.

20:58.480 --> 21:07.840
I spent probably two evenings whilst I was rocking a baby to sleep in one hand and trying

21:07.840 --> 21:08.720
to code in the other.

21:08.720 --> 21:09.920
Productive right there.

21:09.920 --> 21:12.080
Solving this problem, yeah.

21:12.080 --> 21:14.880
Those late nights are productive for some reason.

21:15.680 --> 21:21.680
What was really interesting, actually, was for my testing, I ended up using my ESXi lab

21:21.680 --> 21:27.760
and I created a second virtual network interface on that system.

21:27.760 --> 21:34.480
And then I span up an isolated network within my network to test DHCP, because obviously

21:34.480 --> 21:40.720
I didn't want to turn off my primary DHCP server because, well, I kind of need that

21:40.720 --> 21:43.760
for everything that goes on most days.

21:43.760 --> 21:49.680
So I ended up with a completely separate subnet within VMware that I was able to test it and

21:49.680 --> 21:55.600
I was able to have OpenSense actually running as a firewall on this virtual network running

21:55.600 --> 21:56.560
within VMware.

21:56.560 --> 21:57.920
It was really cool.

21:57.920 --> 22:03.440
And I really think that if you're remotely interested in networking, that there are just

22:03.440 --> 22:07.360
little projects like this you can do to kind of stretch yourself and challenge yourself,

22:07.360 --> 22:09.840
where you can learn little bits and bobs here and there.

22:09.840 --> 22:12.400
And I don't know, I just had fun doing it.

22:12.400 --> 22:16.720
Yeah, push yourself in a way that it solves a problem and you learn something.

22:16.720 --> 22:21.520
And that solving a problem, something that's been on your mind for a while, is such a good

22:21.520 --> 22:22.000
motivator.

22:22.000 --> 22:25.440
It's such a great way to get into something or in your case, maybe take something to the

22:25.440 --> 22:26.480
next level.

22:26.480 --> 22:28.640
People ask all the time, like, where should I get started?

22:28.640 --> 22:29.600
How should I get started?

22:29.600 --> 22:33.840
That's how, it's a cliche to say it, but scratch that itch.

22:33.840 --> 22:35.280
Absolutely true.

22:35.280 --> 22:40.720
Now, speaking of, we've been using something called Slexi on JB for many, many years.

22:40.720 --> 22:42.960
This goes back to Linux Action Show days.

22:42.960 --> 22:44.480
Excuse me?

22:44.480 --> 22:47.280
Yeah, it does, yeah.

22:47.280 --> 22:50.720
It's a bad name, Slexi.org, but it was a good tool.

22:50.720 --> 22:52.400
Yeah, dude, you old, you know?

22:53.040 --> 22:53.600
Yeah, I know.

22:54.320 --> 22:58.880
I know, and I could see the signs coming because every now and then the service would be offline

22:58.880 --> 23:00.080
for a couple of hours.

23:00.080 --> 23:02.400
And then it came back strong for a bit.

23:02.400 --> 23:08.640
It was just a clean pastebin that supported basically every language on the planet, including

23:08.640 --> 23:10.000
my beloved Markdown even.

23:10.000 --> 23:15.840
And it was really simple for us as a team to take emails that come in or messages on

23:15.840 --> 23:20.240
Discord and throw them in something that we could link the other hosts to and link them

23:20.240 --> 23:21.360
in our show notes.

23:21.360 --> 23:26.160
And it really wasn't something that was necessarily intended for public consumption, although

23:26.160 --> 23:27.680
it could be in some cases.

23:27.680 --> 23:32.560
But it was mostly just so that way you have 15 different platforms, messages come in for

23:32.560 --> 23:36.400
a show, and we could take them and have one central spot.

23:36.400 --> 23:37.760
And so it was Slexi.org.

23:37.760 --> 23:42.480
And then, like so many things, when the cloud giveth, the cloud taketh.

23:42.480 --> 23:45.760
And at the beginning of March, they announced they were shutting down.

23:46.800 --> 23:54.240
And I was beside myself, Alex, and I looked over to you, Alex, and I said, Alex, save

23:54.240 --> 23:54.720
us.

23:54.720 --> 23:56.800
This is clearly something we should self-host.

23:57.840 --> 24:03.600
Well, I think we might have found a solution in a project called XBin, and this is over

24:03.600 --> 24:09.360
on GitHub at midnight slash XBin, midnight spelt with a one instead of an I.

24:09.360 --> 24:11.920
Just look in the show notes, there'll be a link there for you.

24:12.560 --> 24:14.160
And this project is actually really interesting.

24:14.160 --> 24:18.960
It's a very simple interface, which is, you know, what Chris needs after a late night,

24:18.960 --> 24:20.000
let's be honest.

24:20.000 --> 24:23.280
Yeah, and it just, boom, pops right up and there's a text field, just paste the stuff

24:23.280 --> 24:25.040
in there, pow, it's good, it's really quick.

24:25.040 --> 24:26.800
And I've actually been working with the developer.

24:26.800 --> 24:31.760
I've opened probably more issues than I should have on his GitHub, and he's been honestly

24:31.760 --> 24:37.760
fantastic. He's added, just for us on our request, custom logo support, the ability

24:37.760 --> 24:41.680
to moderate comments, as well as a couple of other things as well.

24:41.680 --> 24:42.800
That's neat.

24:42.800 --> 24:50.160
Yeah, you know, sometimes you just love open source so much that some random guy who I

24:50.160 --> 24:54.560
will probably never meet in person is willing to put some time and effort in to help us

24:54.560 --> 24:57.120
adopt his thing by adding features that we asked for.

24:57.120 --> 24:58.880
It's just so cool.

24:58.880 --> 25:00.160
It really is great to see.

25:00.160 --> 25:03.360
It's actually so hard to overstate the point you just made.

25:03.360 --> 25:09.440
There is an internal tool that we use as a team to produce our shows, and you contact

25:09.440 --> 25:14.240
the developer, or developers, and they're actually going to implement those features.

25:14.240 --> 25:18.560
Think about that in the context of, say, like subscription enterprise software.

25:18.560 --> 25:22.720
You could be paying thousands of dollars a year and not get that kind of service level.

25:22.720 --> 25:27.040
And it's MIT licensed, so it's, you know, it's a really permissible license.

25:27.040 --> 25:30.720
And I just think it's super wonderful to see it.

25:30.720 --> 25:32.880
Do we have a demo for folks so they can check it out?

25:32.880 --> 25:33.520
We do, yes.

25:33.520 --> 25:36.400
We're actually using it for all of our feedback for this episode.

25:36.400 --> 25:41.360
So at paste.docs.lol, that's now the Jupiter broadcasting paste bin.

25:41.360 --> 25:45.840
We're going to just use it for show notes and, well, not show notes, feedback into shows

25:45.840 --> 25:46.560
and stuff like that.

25:46.560 --> 25:49.840
So I think we're already using it on Coder, but you'll see it in other shows as we go

25:49.840 --> 25:50.880
forward.

25:50.880 --> 25:54.800
There is an actual official project demo linked in the show notes as well.

25:54.800 --> 25:59.280
It's really just a nice, easy to use paste bin clone with some great features.

25:59.280 --> 26:01.280
It's written in Phoenix and Elixir.

26:01.280 --> 26:05.840
And I think one of the things that's appealing to us is it's pretty easy and straightforward

26:05.840 --> 26:06.640
to self-host it.

26:06.640 --> 26:08.400
Now, have you seen the stats page that it has?

26:08.400 --> 26:14.800
So if you go to URL of your instance slash stats, you can see how many public snippets

26:14.800 --> 26:19.200
have been made and, you know, the number of views they're getting, the most popular one,

26:19.200 --> 26:20.000
all that kind of stuff.

26:20.000 --> 26:23.600
I mean, kind of pointless, but also who doesn't love a good graph anyway?

26:23.600 --> 26:25.200
Who doesn't love a good graph, eh?

26:25.200 --> 26:31.200
If you want to see ours, you can go to paste.docs.lol and then it's slash stats, like Alex said.

26:31.840 --> 26:33.760
So we've had 11 public snippets.

26:33.760 --> 26:35.040
I make most of mine public.

26:35.840 --> 26:38.480
So we've done, I guess, 11 emails on this thing so far.

26:39.120 --> 26:44.560
It's interesting that what qualifies as popular is eight people viewed one of them, which

26:44.560 --> 26:45.360
is really just us.

26:45.360 --> 26:46.720
That's just the people in JB.

26:47.680 --> 26:49.280
But, you know, it's great that it shows that.

26:49.280 --> 26:50.960
It runs in Docker, of course.

26:50.960 --> 26:54.000
I wouldn't honestly have looked at it if it didn't.

26:54.000 --> 26:55.840
I'm running it up on a Linode.

26:55.840 --> 27:01.200
I think it's up to about 15 containers, that single $5 Linode now.

27:02.160 --> 27:04.320
Hard to overstate how awesome that is really.

27:04.320 --> 27:04.640
Yeah.

27:04.640 --> 27:08.320
So please be nice to it and don't break it because it's a tool we use for daily production

27:08.320 --> 27:11.600
and we're opening the Komodo a little bit telling you about it.

27:12.400 --> 27:18.080
And now in a feature that I think may well be aimed exclusively at Wes Payne, you can

27:18.080 --> 27:23.200
actually use Netcat to pipe text to Xbin.

27:23.760 --> 27:26.880
When I saw that, I was like, this is so for Wes.

27:26.880 --> 27:27.760
This is so great.

27:27.760 --> 27:29.520
But it's actually just a very quick way.

27:29.520 --> 27:33.200
And if you're already on the command line, the fact that you could Netcat something to

27:33.200 --> 27:37.680
your pastebin, your self-hosted pastebin solution, that's a winning feature.

27:37.680 --> 27:38.240
I'm sorry.

27:38.240 --> 27:38.960
That's great.

27:38.960 --> 27:44.160
Now, I know we use HedgeDock for all of our show notes and stuff in our internal collaboration,

27:44.160 --> 27:48.320
but Xbin also has a synced text mode.

27:48.320 --> 27:53.440
So, you know, if you click on, in the UI, there's a button that says synced, it will

27:53.440 --> 28:00.480
give you a five digit custom code in the URL you give to whoever you want to, you know,

28:00.480 --> 28:05.360
watch in real time, what you're doing, you know, and I can just type away and in real

28:05.360 --> 28:10.160
time, it will update whoever is looking at that URL, what I'm doing, which for like pair

28:10.160 --> 28:15.360
programming or something like that, I can see this being absolutely awesome.

28:15.360 --> 28:22.080
ProvadoVPN.com slash SSH PR VA DO VPN.com slash SSH.

28:22.080 --> 28:25.840
Go there and try out Provado for free and support the show.

28:25.840 --> 28:28.800
ProvadoVPN is a zero log VPN.

28:28.800 --> 28:33.280
That means no records of your online activity are logged when connected to ProvadoVPN.

28:33.840 --> 28:37.440
Even in the event of a legitimate authority request for logs associated with your activity

28:37.440 --> 28:42.160
when connected to the service, there's just nothing to give and if that wasn't good enough,

28:42.160 --> 28:45.520
you can rest comfortable knowing they're protected by Swiss privacy laws.

28:45.520 --> 28:48.800
They have a strict zero log policy and they're based in Switzerland.

28:48.800 --> 28:53.600
That really mattered to us and that's why we picked ProvadoVPN for our sponsor.

28:53.600 --> 28:58.240
It means you're protected by the absolute strongest consumer privacy laws in the world

28:58.240 --> 29:01.280
and they have a fantastic network to back it all up.

29:01.280 --> 29:06.000
ProvadoVPN owns and operates its own data centers and fiber lines and the network is

29:06.000 --> 29:11.920
composed of hundreds of servers physically located in 45 countries and 58 cities around the world.

29:11.920 --> 29:14.800
You can connect anywhere in seconds and no matter what server you choose,

29:14.800 --> 29:17.760
you'll get incredibly fast speeds every time you connect.

29:17.760 --> 29:23.760
ProvadoVPN's network was built from the ground up, fully optimized for lightning fast speeds.

29:23.760 --> 29:28.880
So visit ProvadoVPN.com slash SSH and try it out for free.

29:28.880 --> 29:33.120
That free account provides the same service level and unlimited speeds as the premium version,

29:33.120 --> 29:38.000
as well as 10 gigabytes a month of data transfer and access to the top 12 servers.

29:38.000 --> 29:42.240
And all ProvadoVPN users get access to the dedicated customer support specialists,

29:42.240 --> 29:47.360
24 hours a day, seven days a week, of course, and they have that unlimited plan

29:47.360 --> 29:51.440
with hundreds of servers and P2P traffic support and a lot more.

29:51.440 --> 29:56.400
So visit ProvadoVPN.com slash SSH and try it out for free.

29:56.400 --> 29:59.200
ProvadoVPN.com slash SSH.

29:59.200 --> 30:01.840
We've got some feedback from Kevin in Belgium.

30:01.840 --> 30:03.680
Love the show, guys. Keep it up.

30:03.680 --> 30:07.920
In the last episode, there was some talk about pooling different bits of storage over the network.

30:07.920 --> 30:11.280
In the past, I've used GrayHole to do this.

30:11.280 --> 30:16.480
I was able to pool two different machines into one virtual storage presented via Samba.

30:16.480 --> 30:18.400
Brackets. Yes, I know.

30:19.440 --> 30:22.400
It worked for me for many years until I switched to one new machine,

30:22.400 --> 30:25.200
pooling all drives using merger FS using the...

30:25.200 --> 30:31.280
I don't wish to blow my own trumpet here, but the now famous perfect media server guide.

30:33.280 --> 30:37.280
Yeah, it is. People love that. It's a great guy.

30:37.280 --> 30:40.240
So I took a look at GrayHole. It's actually a pretty interesting project.

30:40.240 --> 30:44.480
And yeah, pooling different bits of storage using Samba.

30:44.480 --> 30:46.880
I mean, that's it. That's the pitch for the product.

30:46.880 --> 30:51.440
I wonder what you think of this, Alex, compared to just something like merger FS with a Samba share on top,

30:51.440 --> 30:58.800
because ultimately you get similar results, but the difference with GrayHole is it's taking care of the network layer for you.

30:58.800 --> 31:03.680
And also the sort of the organization via the web UI, if you want,

31:03.680 --> 31:07.440
which I know triggers you sometimes, but it does have a web UI, if you want.

31:07.440 --> 31:10.000
I love a good UI. What are we talking about? I love that.

31:10.000 --> 31:14.800
OK, all right, fine, fine. You won't engage, but I know, I know.

31:14.800 --> 31:19.760
So GrayHole, think of it as a way to pool a bunch of shares.

31:19.760 --> 31:24.960
A way to pool a bunch of shares across your network into one big share, right?

31:24.960 --> 31:26.720
And that's sort of a fair summary of it.

31:26.720 --> 31:31.120
Yeah, pretty much. And the underlying shares, it's a bit like Gluster FS in this regard.

31:31.120 --> 31:34.320
So you've got different effectively bricks of storage,

31:34.320 --> 31:41.040
which you then concatenate together into one mega Tron of storage.

31:41.040 --> 31:49.040
Yeah, nice feature is that you can set redundancy on a per share level so you can indicate how many copies of each file you want to keep as well,

31:49.040 --> 31:54.480
which, you know, if you've only got one copy of something, you may as well have zero copies of it.

31:54.480 --> 31:59.120
I know this is popular with the audience because we got several emails about it as the recommendation

31:59.120 --> 32:02.720
when I put out the question of how are you how are you pooling your storage?

32:02.720 --> 32:07.920
I have to say, overall, it's a solution that feels kind of like an old school approach,

32:07.920 --> 32:10.080
and it has been around forever, so that might be part of it.

32:10.080 --> 32:13.920
But I'll give you an example like to get it up and going via their docs.

32:14.720 --> 32:18.160
You start by curling a shell script and then, you know, pseudo bashing that.

32:18.160 --> 32:22.240
You could do it manually, but either way, you end up just stalling a ton of stuff on your box.

32:22.240 --> 32:23.040
It really does.

32:23.040 --> 32:25.360
And that's just the thing I don't really enjoy anymore.

32:25.360 --> 32:33.280
And then there's quite a bit of configuration to essentially build up a whole system based on Finicky Samba shares,

32:33.280 --> 32:37.760
which I again totally appreciate and think there is a spot for that.

32:37.760 --> 32:43.760
And I could even see it like if I was in if I was in like a condo with a couple of roommates like I was,

32:43.760 --> 32:50.160
you know, 20 years ago, I could definitely see us using each of our PCs in a system like this.

32:50.160 --> 32:52.240
And it worked really well for what we want.

32:52.240 --> 32:55.040
But I just don't really see it today.

32:55.040 --> 32:59.200
The way this setup works, Alex, it just doesn't seem doesn't quite seem like it's it.

32:59.200 --> 33:00.880
Like, it's not quite the solution I was looking for.

33:00.880 --> 33:04.320
So when I tried it, I that was my that was my impression.

33:04.320 --> 33:08.160
We also had some feedback coming from Greg, also recommending Gray Hole.

33:08.160 --> 33:12.240
And his point was that each drive is a standalone file system.

33:12.240 --> 33:17.520
So losing just one drive doesn't affect the data on the others, which is useful.

33:17.520 --> 33:22.640
But I don't know, to me, this is I know you asked the audience to send in their opinions,

33:22.640 --> 33:26.560
but it feels to me like this is a solution looking for a problem.

33:26.560 --> 33:29.600
And then people have kind of built some reliance on it.

33:29.600 --> 33:32.400
And it's kind of it's a Jeff Goldblum moment, right?

33:32.400 --> 33:36.400
Just just because we can your scientists were so obsessed with whether they could.

33:36.400 --> 33:38.240
They didn't stop to think about whether they should.

33:38.240 --> 33:40.000
Right. And I think that's it.

33:40.000 --> 33:41.120
I think that's my impression of it.

33:41.120 --> 33:43.760
But I do like I do like hearing how it works for people.

33:43.760 --> 33:46.160
And we did get several people that said it works well for them.

33:46.160 --> 33:49.280
And that's kind of awesome because I know Gray Hole's been around for a long time.

33:49.280 --> 33:51.520
And I'm glad to see it's still going.

33:51.520 --> 33:53.680
The Web UI does make it simple to get up and going.

33:53.680 --> 33:54.400
You can go in there.

33:54.400 --> 33:58.400
The first thing you do is you add some storage to it and then it lets you get things set up.

33:58.400 --> 33:59.840
And and that's nice.

33:59.840 --> 34:01.040
That's good to see it.

34:01.040 --> 34:04.560
But I don't know, I guess this sounds really dumb when I go to say it out loud.

34:04.560 --> 34:08.960
But you know what I'd really like is I'd love a solution at the ZFS level where there was

34:08.960 --> 34:14.400
some kind of service where you could you could dedicate any partition formatted in ZFS or any

34:14.400 --> 34:18.800
dedicated to ZFS could become part of some sort of network ZFS pool.

34:18.800 --> 34:20.640
That's where I'd love to see that work get done.

34:20.640 --> 34:21.360
That would be nice.

34:21.360 --> 34:27.040
Yeah. The tricky part of this, I think, is you don't know what OS the remote system is running.

34:27.040 --> 34:32.560
And with ZFS in particular, licensing is so such a touchy subject.

34:32.560 --> 34:37.520
Whether you could actually have ZFS running as some kind of a container on that remote system

34:37.520 --> 34:43.360
and then say, here's a hundred gig, you know, virtual disk, a bit like Docker desktop works like.

34:44.080 --> 34:45.200
Maybe that's the way to do it.

34:45.200 --> 34:50.560
All right. Well, Rob writes in and Rob's been been using quite a few containers recently

34:50.560 --> 34:53.440
and been running with like 50 terabytes of content.

34:53.440 --> 34:56.880
And while that's been fine for Rob, he kind of wants to take things to the next level.

34:56.880 --> 35:01.360
And he says, so do you have any advice or resources for folks out there like me who

35:01.360 --> 35:05.680
maybe know just enough to be dangerous, but don't actually know how things are working

35:05.680 --> 35:10.880
under the hood of Unraid? Like, do you have a beginner's guide for folks who maybe know just a bit,

35:10.880 --> 35:15.520
but not as much as they could or really should yet? Thanks for the help, Rob.

35:15.520 --> 35:21.840
Well, I think Rob, you're exactly the type of person I had in mind when we were founding Linux server.io.

35:21.840 --> 35:27.680
You know, it's all about finding some good sources of documentation.

35:27.680 --> 35:32.640
And I think something like perfectmediaserver.com may well be a good place to start

35:32.640 --> 35:34.240
if you're looking to build your own box.

35:34.240 --> 35:39.440
But websites like linuxserver.io, as well as there's a few other things like the self-hosted wiki,

35:39.440 --> 35:44.160
self-hosted subreddit, but this is the magic of containers, right?

35:44.160 --> 35:46.400
They allow you to walk before you can run.

35:46.400 --> 35:50.400
And I think that is a huge tick in the pro column for containers.

35:51.040 --> 35:56.480
Back in the day, I think a lot of people kind of gate kept Linux because they were like,

35:56.480 --> 36:02.480
well, you need to, you know, have your neckbeard badge to be able to do this particular thing on Linux

36:02.480 --> 36:09.680
and install these 59 packages in a specific order and then recite some incantations to do as, you know,

36:09.680 --> 36:11.600
just to get a simple Samba server going.

36:12.080 --> 36:18.080
Whereas nowadays, you can just, if you want to run Samba in a container and type docker run Samba,

36:18.080 --> 36:20.080
and there's a little more to it than that.

36:20.080 --> 36:24.560
But effectively, you are now piggybacking off the shoulders of giants, right?

36:24.560 --> 36:26.320
That's the whole purpose of containers.

36:26.320 --> 36:34.640
You're basically outsourcing a lot of the sysadmin stuff to other people, like building these containers.

36:34.640 --> 36:41.680
You're outsourcing those decisions about what goes into them to other people who you maybe trust more

36:41.680 --> 36:46.320
than you trust yourself, which, you know, certainly as a newbie is probably a wise decision.

36:46.320 --> 36:52.400
Maybe as you mature your approach to building systems, you'll decide that actually I know better

36:52.400 --> 36:53.760
and I want to go and build my own stuff.

36:53.760 --> 36:56.960
But I wouldn't say what you're doing is necessarily wrong.

36:56.960 --> 37:00.320
Just use the stuff that Unraid lets you use.

37:00.320 --> 37:02.320
There's a reason you picked Unraid, right?

37:02.320 --> 37:05.920
And that's because it has a simple to use user interface.

37:05.920 --> 37:09.120
You can use their templates to click and install stuff.

37:09.120 --> 37:11.040
I mean, keep doing what you're doing, man.

37:11.040 --> 37:11.840
That's what I say.

37:11.840 --> 37:16.480
Yeah, you could absolutely just keep using that and you can mess around with VMs on your local box.

37:16.480 --> 37:20.000
Or if you are ready to build something, I'm going to double down on Alex's recommendation

37:20.000 --> 37:26.400
to go by the perfect media guide, because which if I don't know if he said, but is that perfectmediaserver.com?

37:26.400 --> 37:29.920
Because that gives you the projects to really kind of branch off from there.

37:29.920 --> 37:35.360
I'm not quite as pro magic server sauce as Alex is.

37:35.360 --> 37:39.520
That scares the crap out of me a little bit from just a security standpoint, because ultimately

37:39.520 --> 37:42.880
it's not understanding how the system works that leads people to make security mistakes.

37:42.880 --> 37:47.520
But I do agree with your point that in most cases, the people designing the containers

37:47.520 --> 37:53.040
for popular applications and projects probably know more about what's going on in there than Rob might.

37:53.040 --> 37:55.840
You know, the people creating the application know a hell of a lot about it.

37:55.840 --> 38:01.360
So you're generally going to be all right, but it's definitely worth learning, but it's really easy to learn.

38:01.360 --> 38:07.600
And Rob, I wish the built-in tooling was better at explaining to you, like these four containers

38:07.600 --> 38:11.200
are using this same layer and it's all possible to discover.

38:11.200 --> 38:16.880
But I wish it would tell you in terms of like, and that is these applications and this layer

38:16.880 --> 38:20.800
of libraries and Linux, I wish it was more, if you could understand it in those terms,

38:20.800 --> 38:22.320
I think you'd start to click for you.

38:22.320 --> 38:26.400
So what I would recommend you do is pick a container software of choice, go out there

38:26.400 --> 38:31.120
and read about Podman, go out there and read about Docker, and then start playing, get

38:31.120 --> 38:35.760
inside the containers, learn how to do that and explore them and just see what that's

38:35.760 --> 38:37.600
like and understand what's inside there.

38:37.600 --> 38:41.280
And then you start to realize, you know, it's good things, it's easy to get going.

38:41.280 --> 38:46.080
It's generally pretty well built, but there's also a lot of old libraries in there.

38:46.080 --> 38:50.880
And you're relying on them to update the software and maintain the security for applications

38:50.880 --> 38:51.840
you're running on your stack.

38:51.840 --> 38:54.800
And so you just need to be cognizant of the trade-offs.

38:54.800 --> 38:58.720
And I think the way you start that is by learning and then, you know, you can take advantage

38:58.720 --> 39:02.800
of tooling around that to maybe get a better insight into what they're doing.

39:02.800 --> 39:05.840
But ultimately don't feel bad for using Unraid.

39:05.840 --> 39:07.840
They are building a good product.

39:07.840 --> 39:12.160
I think both Alex and I are not currently Unraid users, but we think it's a pretty

39:12.160 --> 39:17.040
solid product, and I think it's one of those tools that helps people get going and gets

39:17.040 --> 39:20.160
their data off of something like Google and gets it on their own land.

39:20.160 --> 39:22.720
And that's ultimately something that we're both big fans of.

39:22.720 --> 39:24.640
Yeah, Unraid was how I got started.

39:24.640 --> 39:29.440
And then I ended up trying to build some packages for myself for some apps that weren't on the

39:29.440 --> 39:30.480
platform.

39:30.480 --> 39:35.680
And like Chris says, trying to exec into a container, like figuring out what that means

39:35.680 --> 39:40.560
and sort of getting a shell inside a container and poking around and breaking some stuff,

39:40.560 --> 39:43.040
you know, it's that's how I got started.

39:43.040 --> 39:45.120
So absolutely a good route to go.

39:45.120 --> 39:50.080
Now, Martin writes in that in the latest episode, you are wondering about one way phone backup.

39:50.080 --> 39:54.960
And for Android, he recommends an app called Foldersync, and I can't recommend it enough.

39:54.960 --> 39:56.000
Thank you, Martin.

39:56.000 --> 39:57.040
Foldersync.

39:57.040 --> 40:00.080
We'll have a link to that in the Play Store, as you would imagine.

40:00.080 --> 40:04.960
Surprise, surprise, it allows simple sync to cloud-based storage from your local folders

40:04.960 --> 40:08.080
on your phone and SD card on your Android device.

40:08.080 --> 40:11.440
It does exactly what it says on the tin, and it's free.

40:11.440 --> 40:16.240
It does offer, I guess, an in-app purchase to remove the ads, but it looks pretty clean

40:16.240 --> 40:17.520
and straightforward.

40:17.520 --> 40:19.920
Gosh, and it supports everything it looks like.

40:19.920 --> 40:25.200
Martin says it automatically recognizes where he is based on SSID, and then it backs up

40:25.200 --> 40:29.360
to the appropriate local NAS system so that he has multiple physical copies, which is

40:29.360 --> 40:30.560
a really nice feature.

40:30.560 --> 40:32.880
I think I've used an earlier version of this, actually.

40:32.880 --> 40:34.240
I think I have and I liked it.

40:34.240 --> 40:39.360
Now, I use the Nextcloud clients on my phones to back up all my photos and things like that.

40:39.360 --> 40:44.640
Those are primarily the files that are created on my mobile devices that I want to get off

40:44.640 --> 40:46.000
of those devices.

40:46.000 --> 40:50.880
It doesn't require any plugins in Nextcloud, it's just built into the standard iOS and

40:50.880 --> 40:56.480
Android clients as well, but I think if I was creating something else regularly on my

40:56.480 --> 41:01.520
phone that wasn't a photo or a video, Foldersync looks like it would be the solution.

41:01.520 --> 41:05.760
A big thank you to our site reliability engineers at selfhosted.show slash SRE.

41:05.760 --> 41:10.000

41:10.000 --> 41:12.080
You get the post show today.

41:12.080 --> 41:16.880
We're going to chat about Alex's very first computer and how he got his very start in

41:16.880 --> 41:17.920
computers.

41:17.920 --> 41:18.880
I'm looking forward to that.

41:18.880 --> 41:20.720
I don't think I've ever heard that story.

41:20.720 --> 41:25.920
So if you would like to join our membership, support the show and get access to the limited

41:25.920 --> 41:32.080

41:32.080 --> 41:36.800
And join us next week on Linux Unplugged for a special episode where we go through some

41:36.800 --> 41:42.000
of the self-hosted Google Photos alternatives that will be episode 409.

41:42.000 --> 41:46.000
Now for all the ways to get in touch with us, you can go to selfhosted.show slash contact
