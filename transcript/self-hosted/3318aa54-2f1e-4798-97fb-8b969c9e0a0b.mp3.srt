1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,680
Well given that we only record every two weeks, it's not often that I get the chance to say

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:15,520
BREAKING NEWS. I have some exciting news about the Prusa XL, a 3D printer that is enormous.

3
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,800
Okay. Wait, when you say enormous, like how enormous are we talking about?

4
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:28,320
So the standard size for a 3D printer has kind of been dictated by the Prusa Mark III now for

5
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:35,360
several years. Similar size to like the Ender 3 and the Creality CR-10. All these guys,

6
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,960
they've had a build volume that's been in the region of 10 inches by 8 by 8, something like

7
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:49,360
that, which is 25 by 21 by 21 centimeters. This new one from Prusa, 14 inches square.

8
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,400
Ah, okay.

9
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,000
So it's a big boy.

10
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,960
It's adequate, at least.

11
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:02,240
Yeah. Now what's really interesting is the Prusa Mark III has a bed that moves back and forwards

12
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:06,160
and the extruder moves left and right and that kind of stuff. So there's a lot of moving parts.

13
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:12,560
The Prusa XL is so big that they couldn't really figure out a way to make the bed move properly

14
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:18,800
and smoothly. So they're doing what's called a Core X Y 3D printer for this. So essentially

15
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:23,440
what that means is the extruder does all the movement and the bed moves up and down.

16
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,360
Uh-huh.

17
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,240
Which is pretty cool.

18
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,440
It sounds like my place.

19
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:33,360
Now this thing has five interchangeable or up to five interchangeable tool heads.

20
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,360
That's great. So you put your order in, I assume.

21
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:43,760
Oh, no, no, no. Because this thing, wait for it, starts at $2,000.

22
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,520
Oh. And that's before you've tricked it out.

23
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:53,120
That's, yeah. I mean, that's beyond even Alex Impulse purchased territory at two grand. You

24
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:53,840
know what I mean?

25
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,560
Here's what we do is we launch a merch store that's filled with stuff that we've 3D printed.

26
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,000
It pays for itself.

27
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,520
Yeah. Yeah. So it's not that easy. You know, I've had a few things up on Etsy that I've

28
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,080
been 3D printing for a while, like workshop accessories, that kind of thing. And I've sold

29
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,880
a few, but I mean, I've come nowhere close to even paying for a couple of spools of filament,

30
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,280
you know?

31
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:22,400
So, yeah, there is that. I guess you got to deduct the cost of the machine, the materials,

32
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,840
and God forbid your time.

33
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,600
And the electricity. Don't forget that.

34
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:30,880
Right. All that's valuable. So that's why you should probably go learn at acloudguru.com,

37
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,840
I've been thinking about talking a bit more about 3D printing on the show. If you're

38
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:52,720
interested in a segment on 3D printing, let me know, selfhosted.show/.contact. Now, something

39
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,320
else I found on the internet this week, well, I guess it was a couple of weeks ago now,

40
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:56,800
was-

41
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,640
It was like just after the last episode.

42
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,400
Yeah, literally a day or two after the last episode. It was a new toy for you, Chris,

43
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,280
a Raspberry Pi compute module powered router.

44
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,240
Ah, you're spending my money again, Alex.

45
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,320
Yeah. It's easier when it's someone else's.

46
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:15,280
Yeah. Well, this is perfect timing because we have a project to replace the router here

47
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,520
at the studio and we want something that does WireGuard. I've decided, after the last road

48
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:27,120
trip, that I wanted to divorce my VPN and server because guess what? My server was down

49
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,040
and I couldn't VPN into troubleshoot. I want to put it on the router. I've wanted it that

50
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,320
way for a long time, but I got a confession.

51
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,600
Dear listener, Alex is nodding very, very strongly right now.

52
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:46,320
I've been using the Comcast router that came with my Comcast business internet since they

53
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,240
gave it to me. It worked.

54
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,800
Can we have a sad tuba sound effect, please, editor?

55
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,880
I know. The only excuse really is truly just I didn't feel like Googling. That's barely

56
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:04,240
an excuse. So this is obviously something that needs to be fixed. And you found this

57
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:11,920
fantastic dual gigabit Ethernet carrier board for the Raspberry Pi 4 compute module. It's

58
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,960
a pretty small board, smaller than the original size of the Raspberry Pi, not quite, but around

59
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:24,080
that size that you snap the compute module onto and you get USB ports, you get Ethernet,

60
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:30,480
you get HDMI. And I should make it clear, you get two Ethernet, which wouldn't that

61
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:34,160
be great? You can have one interface connected to your LAN, you have one interface

62
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,240
connected to your network, to your ISP or whatever it might be. And, you know, you can

63
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,560
build yourself a firewall.

64
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:47,200
Are they both on the PCI bus? Because only one of them is like on the Raspberry Pi 4

65
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,480
at least is PCI, right?

66
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:54,240
Sadly, I would say you have cut right to what the core issue is.

67
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,520
Interface zero is on the PCI bus, so like that would be a great LAN interface, right?

68
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:07,680
But interface one connects via USB, which is then connected to the PCI bus. And

69
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:16,800
this is also a challenge because stock OpenWRT does not have a driver for that. So you if

70
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,200
you install just regular old Linux or Raspberry Pi OS, you're good to go. I mean, it's like

71
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:28,240
there's been a driver since like kernel four. But OpenWRT has decided not to ship that and

72
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,800
a friend of the show, Jeff Gerling, you know, he posted a poll request saying, hey, how

73
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,400
about adding this support for this? And it doesn't seem like it's going anywhere. Yeah.

74
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,800
It was actually funny. Speaking of Jeff, I was doing some research on this very thing

75
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,720
and I came across this this whole GitHub thread that he had created on this very issue. And

76
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,760
it was actually really useful to know don't go with stock OpenWRT with this router board

77
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:56,720
because of this issue. And if you look at the documentation from the folks over it,

78
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:02,560
what is it, Seed Studios? Is that what it is? Yeah. Link in the show notes. Yeah. On

79
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:10,480
their Wiki, they link to their own build of OpenWRT, which has the driver. So if you get

80
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:16,080
the image from them, you're pretty much good to go. But I'd like to back up and talk about

81
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:21,520
why I wanted this because the compute module has interested me for a while, because I think

82
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:28,160
that the critical flaw in the Raspberry Pi four as a server for me was the SD card just

83
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:34,000
sucks. It's fine for booting the random OS here and there. But you know, I want to run

84
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:42,480
your server on that. And you can get the compute module with a built in eMMC up to 32 gigs

85
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:48,560
of eMMC. And that's pretty appealing. So I thought that would be the way to go. Or, you

86
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,120
know, maybe an external USB drive. But I really wanted to try the eMMC and see how that works.

87
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,080
And I got this device pretty quickly. I was I was shocked because I've tried to get the

88
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,440
compute module on its own in some cases. And I've seen prices as high as one hundred and

89
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:06,720
thirty dollars right now. And I think this whole thing all in was like 80 bucks. Then

90
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,960
depending on the price of the computer module goes up from there. So you get it and it's

91
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,520
really small. One thing I didn't like about it is they put the SD card on the bottom of

92
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,000
the board and it's right under the HDMI port. So when you're plugging in the HDMI port,

93
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,440
your thumb in the SD card, which is a trigger to eject. It's really frustrating. And then

94
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:30,560
the USB-C ports also in the same area. And so when you're like kind of using your thumb

95
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,400
to brace on the board so you can pull the power out. Well, guess what you're doing?

96
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:40,160
You're ejecting the SD card. It's kind of annoying. So if you can avoid it, just don't

97
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:45,280
use the SD card. I don't like the way they've designed that at all. But the trick is to

98
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:52,080
the tricky thing is flashing eMMC. I didn't really appreciate this. But if you want to

99
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:58,640
flash the eMMC with an image, a pre-built image directly, you got to move some jumpers

100
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:03,600
on this little board to put it in a specific kind of boot mode. So it shows up as an external

101
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,680
storage on your OS. Then you got to install a driver and you got to actually flash it

102
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:14,640
that way. Well, I wasn't down for that. I said, no, thank you. Thanks anyways. And I

103
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:18,800
went and got myself OpenSUSE at Tumbleweed because I've been I've been diving deep into

104
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:24,880
Tumbleweed recently. Downloaded their Arch 64 image, just their generic ISO, not a Raspberry

105
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:31,120
Pi image, not an image file, but an ISO, which is also an image file. Downloaded that to

106
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:40,080
my machine and I flashed it to a Samsung SSD, a USB-C SSD. The ISO image. Plugged it into

107
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:47,360
the USB port on this little board, booted it up like a regular old PC. It booted off

108
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,640
the SSD because there's no OS on the thing. I booted up the SUSE installer, which was

109
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,680
crazy slow, like ridiculously stupid slow. They're taking every opportunity to check

110
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,080
your packages, scan your hardware, double check this. I mean, I'm not exaggerating

111
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,400
when I say maybe it was nearly a 30 minute boot process just to get to just to get to

112
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:11,440
the install. Oh, my God. Yeah. But then you get a full graphical yas installer and all

113
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,880
that kind of stuff, which is, you know, that's nice. That's nice to see. 30 minutes. Mm hmm.

114
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:23,040
Yeah. And it took quite a while to install it, too. I noticed on the console that it

115
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:28,080
was like checking repositories and every single thing it was checking was 404ing on

116
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:34,640
the console. But I could ping, right? Like I had no problem getting out and routing to

117
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,760
the Internet. So I don't know what exactly was going on there, but it seemed to just

118
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:45,920
really slow stuff down. But goodness, if my name isn't Chris, I tell you what.

119
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:53,680
The SUSE installer just saw the EMMC like it was a hard drive. No big deal at all.

120
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,640
It just auto the whole auto partition auto install the bootloader. It all worked. It just

121
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,760
it installed to the EMMC on this Raspberry Pi compute module as if it was an x86 PC.

122
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,880
I just booted off a thumb drive and was installing to the internal disk. It felt like a real

123
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,440
computer and then it rebooted. And sure enough, I'm in open SUSE tumbleweed and it's good to

124
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,640
go. And it worked great. I did do a little bit of benchmarking on the old EMMC because

125
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:27,920
I was curious. And, you know, I saw anywhere between 80 to 200 megabytes a second. I don't

126
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,440
really I don't really think it's very I don't think it's very good performance in terms

127
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,120
of like overall, like if you want this thing to be faster, it's not going to be that. But

128
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,920
it's way better than the SD. That's the same kind of level of performance as a spinning

129
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:45,200
hard drive. Yeah. Yeah. It kind of performs like a yeah. Yeah. That's a good way to think

130
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,440
of it. Alex is it kind of performs like a spinning hard drive. Yes, that's a that's

131
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:57,600
a no for me, Doug. Yeah. Well, you know, some of these compute module boards have MVME slots

132
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:05,200
and stuff. Our PCI Express slots. It's still an order of magnitude better than the SD card.

133
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,840
Yeah. Oh, for sure. Yeah, for sure. At what point do we sit back and think we're flogging

134
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:14,720
a dead horse here? You know, everything you've just told me, there wasn't a single thing

135
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,680
that made me think, oh, I need this now. Like when I first saw the link, I was like, huh?

136
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,760
OK, now I'm going to take this seriously. But hearing what you've just said, I'm like,

137
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:33,760
oh, yeah, reality doesn't match. I mean, you could use like I do on my Pi four servers in the RV.

138
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:39,680
You could use an external USB three SSD, which I never I never would have done until I was in

139
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,480
this situation. And I can't believe how well it's worked. It's it's embarrassing. Like,

140
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,880
what am I, two years now into using these things with SSDs that are over USB? It's stupid. It

141
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:54,160
shouldn't be working, but it is. So you could go that route or, you know, I'm I'm going to get the

142
00:11:54,160 --> 00:12:00,080
IO board that I think has a PCI one X Express slot on it. And I want to get an MV. I already have an

143
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:07,600
MV adapter for that that I'm going to try that. The other area that's a bit of a limit in terms

144
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:15,200
of performance is thermals. So this thing runs hot. I think there's not a lot of room between

145
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:23,120
the router board and the compute module. So it runs warm. And I was throwing different jobs at

146
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,720
it. Like, I thought, let's this is a great opportunity to try out jellyfin again. It's

147
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,760
been a couple of years. And so I tossed jellyfin on there and had it scan my library. And the CPU

148
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:36,960
got up to like 181 degrees Fahrenheit, which is pretty hot. Then I started a build of net data

149
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:43,600
while the library scan was going on. And I got up to 186 degrees. Sorry. And then in real numbers,

150
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,800
that's 82 Celsius, right? I ain't dealing in your freedom units, dude. I know I live here,

151
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:53,920
but still, I think I saw it got up to 85 Celsius is the highest I saw somewhere out there. I mean,

152
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:59,200
that's warm. It's I mean, you know, Intel starts to thermal throttle, though, you know, real CPUs,

153
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:05,680
air quotes, real CPUs get up to 100 and then they start throttling. So 85 is OK. It's warm.

154
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:11,840
Yeah, no, it's fine. And it'll handle it all. It's literally been going now for

155
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:17,040
more than 24 hours. And it's it's I'm still getting like 1.5 gigahertz out of the most of

156
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:24,320
the cores most of the time. It's going as we as we record right now. If you put a heat sink or

157
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,960
put it in a case with a fan, I think you'd get a little bit less thermal throttling out of this

158
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:33,600
thing is kind of what my takeaway was, because this is just naked. You know, it's just absolutely

159
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,880
naked. I saw decent performance on the network transfer. I will have a better take at how it

160
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,120
works as a router after I've, you know, gone through all of the paces there. But

161
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:52,080
I don't have a super fast connection to deal with. So I was getting around 600 megabits out of the

162
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:59,680
interface that's connected to USB, which is the ETH one. 600 megabits is doable for me. I have a

163
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:06,960
300 megabit Comcast connection, right? I have a gigabit LAN so that the LAN interface that's on

164
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:11,520
the PCI bus, that'll be full. That's like you get nearly 900 megabits a second out of that thing.

165
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:19,600
And because the interface connected to USB is still twice as fast as my Internet connection,

166
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,800
I don't really think it's going to be a problem. The only other downside I could foresee is that

167
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:31,360
stuff on the USB bus also takes more CPU. So I could see it putting more load on the box. So I

168
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:36,320
won't know until I put this thing into production in that regard. But as far as like this kind of

169
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:44,000
like this, could this work as I can no longer wait for the Home Assistant Amber to arrive because of

170
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,240
part delays or something. So I'm going to deploy this. Could it work as that? Yes. I think this

171
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:55,120
would be a pretty good upgrade from my current Pi setup as servers. I think this compute module

172
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:00,960
on a board, especially maybe the IO board, which is arriving tonight after we record,

173
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:04,160
funny enough. If it just would have showed up a little earlier, I could have told you. But

174
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,160
I bought it like two days later. And so it's of course, it's showing up a little late. But that

175
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,640
has I think that has real potential for me to build a server platform around. And when you say

176
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:18,080
what when I look at this and what do I get out of it, what I get out of it is two to three watts of

177
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:24,640
power draw, even when it's being slammed. That's massive for me. And to get dual network ports and

178
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:29,760
to have additional IO, depending on which board you put the compute module into while having access

179
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:35,040
to the Raspberry Pi ecosystem of support. And at this point, you can pull down Arch Fedora,

180
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:44,800
Alma Linux and of course, CentOS and and Rel and Ubuntu that all just work out of the box using

181
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:51,520
the generic arm 64 ISO image now. And they work with this stuff. And so we've gotten past the

182
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:57,120
point where you got to go find this very specific image to get it all to work. And that opens the

183
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:02,240
door up to a lot more people, in my opinion, and a lot more standard server type operating systems

184
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:09,360
just in time for the Raspberry Pi five to come in and require a whole new bunch of esoteric builds.

185
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:16,000
I wonder. Yeah, you're probably right. We'll see. I also after I was reading through the thread that

186
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,520
Jeff had started, I found another board that he's talked about before in the past that has both NICs

187
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:27,760
on the PCI bus. Yeah, so I ordered that one. No, of course you did. Of course, it's like it was like

188
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:32,720
30 bucks. So like, why not? Right. Once you've got a compute module, this is where this is actually

189
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,200
quite a powerful little thing. Right. For those that aren't familiar, the compute module slightly

190
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:43,760
smaller than the Pi four itself. And it just sort of pops into a daughter board, if you like. And

191
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:49,120
then lots of different people make different breakout boards, I suppose that expose different

192
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,440
interfaces for the Pi and stuff like that. So the one that Chris has been talking about, obviously,

193
00:16:53,440 --> 00:17:00,320
is focused at being a router. But this I.O. board, for example, exposes like it's got an NVME slot

194
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:07,280
on it and all sorts of other stuff. Yeah. And a battery for the real time clock, which is something

195
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,920
that the Pi has traditionally been missing. You know, the nice little. Yeah. Nice thing for a

196
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:17,200
server. Yeah, very cool. Well, I put a link in the show notes to that Seed Studio website.

197
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:21,840
It's a little bit funny, so you will need to go and look it up, how it's spelt. And they do still

198
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:28,320
have, if you can believe it, the compute module fours in stock shipping today. So take it for

199
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:31,600
what it's worth. Chris bought one, it showed up. So hopefully that's the same for you. We're not

200
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,480
affiliated in any way. I wish you luck.

201
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,600
lino.com slash SSH. Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account and you go there to

202
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,520
support the show. It's like the next best thing to being jacked into the business.

203
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:49,760
Next best thing to being jacked into the matrix and having information downloaded to your brain.

204
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:57,200
I mean it because you can go on there and you can just learn and play and investigate and test.

205
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:02,560
I mean, that's a huge part of what I use Linode for when I think about how it's changed my game

206
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:06,560
over the years, doing just a little bit of research here and there, trying something out

207
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:11,760
every now and then. And when you add it all up, man, that's been like one of the keys to like

208
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:16,080
getting things done on time for these shows and being able to get things figured out.

209
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,400
But you know, Linode really is just super fast too. And I think that's a big part of why I've

210
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,520
stuck with it. They just rolled out new MVME disks. They've got 40 gigabit connections coming

211
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:30,960
to the hypervisors. They are their own ISP. That's the level of control they have over their

212
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:36,880
connectivity. They've got 11 data centers to choose from. And I feel like it is a bit of a

213
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:42,400
superpower because it's how we've hosted everything for the last couple of years. And you know,

214
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:47,040
frankly, our audience would tell us if something wasn't up to snuff. There's a higher expectation

215
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:51,840
with Jupiter Broadcasting that our technology stack is going to respect your privacy, that's

216
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:56,160
going to perform well, that it's going to be up when you want to download a show right before you

217
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:04,080
hit the road or something like that. And you know, you're all kind of picky as I am. And if things

218
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:09,920
didn't work right, if the infrastructure wasn't up to snuff, you'd tell us. And we literally get

219
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:15,920
zero complaints because Linode is just screaming fast. And it's 30 to 50% cheaper than the major

220
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:19,280
hyperscalers out there that just want to lock you into their platforms anyways.

221
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:26,800
And that's one of the nice things about Linode. I strike that balance with Linode where I feel like

222
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:32,160
I'm in control. I have the power in this relationship. And I think that's also really

223
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,640
important for just the type of business person that I am. But like I said earlier, there's so

224
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,560
much you could learn and try with Linode too. And that's where that $100 is really special.

225
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:45,760
That is actually a unique opportunity. Because with $100, you can really try out the platform,

226
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:51,920
see what you can do with it. And then if you ever have any problems, they've got the best customer

227
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:56,960
support in the business by phone or ticket or even on social. If you're a customer, they're

228
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:02,000
going to help you out. And I think they're going to impress you. They also have just

229
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,200
a bunch of great tutorials and how-to guides. They have S3 compatible object storage that

230
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:12,480
I use just the crap out of. So from the best customer support, super fast rigs,

231
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:18,080
super fast networking, and a Linux culture that runs deep, there's just like a lot of

232
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:24,000
these types of reasons to choose Linode, but you'll find your own. So go try it out. Linode.com.

233
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:31,760
Right. So we're not really going to be talking about self-hosting for the next few minutes.

234
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:38,800
I want to have a bit of a rambling gripe grudge airing fest about Android 12 and everything that

235
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:43,680
I think is wrong with the state of the mobile ecosystem these days. I'm actually up for it

236
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:47,520
because how do you access all these things you're hosting? A lot of times it's through

237
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,760
a mobile device or a tablet on the wall or something like that. You know, it was interesting

238
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:56,560
as well as I posted a tweet last night or the night before about saying, you know, Pixel 6

239
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:02,800
isn't for me. I can't stand Android 12's UI, which I'll come on to shortly, and the fingerprint

240
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:07,920
reader sucks and the phone is too slippery and, you know, all these different reasons.

241
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:13,040
And then a couple of people reminded me why I was excited about buying it in the first place.

242
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:18,400
There's stuff that the Pixel does that is genuinely pretty cool. So they've got this

243
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:25,040
call screening thing built in for scammers, which if you don't live in the US, like in the UK,

244
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:30,240
that you can just register with some telephone preference service. But in the US, there's no

245
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:35,840
such thing. And I get, you know, it's a brand new phone number to me that I've obviously only ever

246
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:42,160
given out to a few people. And I get four or five spam calls a day that just love to call me and

247
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:49,520
just say nothing. Does that happen to you? Oh, well, it did for a long time. Yeah. Yeah, I've

248
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,520
got I've got a couple of apps that screen calls on the iPhone because they did open up an API for

249
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:58,480
that. But it's not built into the OS like it is with Google Assistant. My mom got a call recently

250
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:05,920
saying that she owed AT&T $1,200 for an iPhone, but the whole call was a scam. But she was very

251
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:11,760
convinced. So she calls me up. She's like, I owe somebody money. Like, what's going on? Mom, it's

252
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:16,000
a scam. Yeah, it's absolutely a scam. Yeah. And that kind of stuff is really nice just to when

253
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
you're at when you're at work and your phone, you know, maybe you're in a meeting, it's nice to have

254
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,360
something catch that kind of thing. So it doesn't interrupt your day. Yeah, not only do they have

255
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:31,680
cool screening, so that's inbound, they've also added with the Pixel six, a new outbound kind of

256
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:39,440
on hold Google Assistant will be on hold for you type mode, which is legitimately very, very cool.

257
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:44,160
It uses all of the text to speech stuff to listen to what the phone is saying the person on the

258
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:50,160
phone is saying. And it will print out in text for you on the screen. So you know, press one to

259
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:54,560
talk to sales, press two to talk to and by the time you got to option seven, you're like, what was

260
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:59,280
option one again? It's on the screen in front of you. So I found that quite helpful a couple of

261
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:08,960
times. But yeah, in general, I just couldn't deal with with Android 12. You know, it's just they I

262
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:15,440
think they've ruined it. There's also in the background, like the slow and continued effort

263
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:20,800
to de Google different services over different, you know, like different chunks, like, I still

264
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:25,840
haven't gone back to Google Maps. Like that was that was a successful de Google vacation. It was

265
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:31,600
rough because I did it on the road trip. But I think because I did it on the road trip, I had to

266
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:39,520
do it like in anger under pressure and it's stuck. Great. So I wonder too, like, does this play into

267
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:46,000
that at all for you? A little bit? Yeah. I mean, when when I saw the news this week that Apple have

268
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:53,280
somehow made a U turn on right to repair and made some parts available, what previously only

269
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:58,880
available to authorized service centers and stuff like that, I think to myself, okay, that's another

270
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:04,720
pin down on the Apple domino board of stuff that I care about. So, you know, right to repair,

271
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:09,920
I can get parts for my phone and my laptop shortly. Okay, right now it's only a very small

272
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:14,480
program. But I'm excited for what that means over the next five, 10 years of how they're going to

273
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:19,760
expand that program and hopefully start designing the devices with a bit more modularity in mind so

274
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:24,640
that people can just pop out the logic board and pop out a battery and that kind of basic stuff

275
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:29,840
that after two or three years, the phone still functions fine. You think, I wish I could just

276
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:35,760
have a new battery. I don't want to buy a whole new phone. Well, that's hopefully going to be

277
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:41,360
the reality moving forward. The other thing that Apple are doing pretty well, and I was really

278
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:48,240
suspicious of this at first, but I think their privacy stance is actually really solid. You know,

279
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:53,680
a lot of the stuff they're doing with the ask to track stuff in iOS, you know, particularly I've

280
00:24:53,680 --> 00:25:00,080
seen articles talking about how much that's hurt Facebook and specifically their targeted advertising.

281
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:05,200
Okay, you've got me. I am really impressed by that. Google could never do that.

282
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:11,440
Right. Well, that's true. Yeah. You know, it's funny. It is good to see them make these right

283
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:18,240
to repair moves. And I do like to see them make anti-track moves on the platform, even if they're

284
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:23,520
in some cases just asking apps not to do it. But then I see them doing like the library scanning

285
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,280
stuff. And I'm like, boy, you got it with Apple. There's a lot of good with the bad you have to

286
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:33,120
take. And that's the thing that I've been struggling with. So for me, I have to ask myself how important

287
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:38,480
is customizing my device, like changing out the launcher, maybe even just putting an entirely

288
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:43,360
different OS on there or different image. And for different devices, I have different answers

289
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:49,200
to that question. If you were to ask me about the fire tablets that I have littered throughout my

290
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:55,280
homes now, the studio or at least the studio in the RV, I would say extremely. I want to always

291
00:25:55,280 --> 00:26:00,400
be able to reflash that. I always want to be able to replace the launcher. That is probably the

292
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:07,200
two top features of those devices for me, right? Mostly because the fire launchers are just garbage

293
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:13,280
and so unstable, very slow and unstable. Yeah. Yeah. What are you? And it's like, okay,

294
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:18,480
maybe maybe a decade ago. But what are we doing today? What's going on here? It's just it's

295
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:25,280
unacceptable. So and you know, but I've never I've never wanted that from my phone. And I think maybe

296
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:33,280
I'm just an old enough guy where I've never totally wanted that. I wanted that early on

297
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:38,640
in the early days of Android when there was like things I was getting from it, maybe improved

298
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,720
battery life, improved performance, getting the OS on a device that didn't get that OS because

299
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:47,120
the vendors bailed so quickly or maybe the camera app was better. The same reason that you're into

300
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:54,960
Linux. Yeah. You like to tinker under the hood. I mean, right. That's just you. Yeah. And I want

301
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:02,560
my phone to always take a picture and I want it to always make a call. So I didn't really have that

302
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:06,960
same requirement for that device. And I think those things shift for us to over time. You may

303
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,640
really, for example, like the launchers may be replacing the launchers with something you did

304
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:15,680
all the time. And then the vendor started to get it right after a while. So the need to replace it

305
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:19,280
stopped becoming as necessary. It's funny you should say that because I've been running a

306
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:26,160
OnePlus 7T for the last two years. I think that's actually the last good device that OnePlus made,

307
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:31,680
but I still replaced the launcher. So it's running Android 10. It did run Android 11,

308
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:36,400
but I wiped and downgraded it because the update that OnePlus shipped for Android 11 was,

309
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:42,000
it was just so buggy. Like it just kept dropping the frame rate because a 90 Hertz

310
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,840
display and it kept dropping the frame rate to like 20 or 30 frames a second. And I noticed

311
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:52,080
that kind of thing. So I had to go into the settings and toggle it to 60 Hertz and then

312
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:59,200
back to 90 and it was fine again. I also have the Google work profile installed on my phone.

313
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,440
So it has like, I love the way Android does this, by the way, it has like two separate

314
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:09,440
profiles, like modes on the phone. Yeah, that's nice. All my work apps are completely separate

315
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:14,480
from my personal apps. So like I've got two Gmail apps installed on my phone. So it's very obvious

316
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:20,640
for me when I'm context switching to calendar apps, you know, you could achieve that in iOS

317
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:27,120
as far as customizing alerts and, and icons. Like you could have a focus mode that is work.

318
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:32,320
And so you'd have work launchers and you'd have work alerts, but you would not be able to have

319
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:36,560
two versions of Gmail. You'd have to have essentially two mail apps. One's a personal mail

320
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:40,720
app and one's your work mail app. I'll tell you what's also awesome is there's an app I've got

321
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:46,880
called quiet for Gmail and I have it set on a timer and it turns my email on and off at 8am.

322
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:51,920
It turns it on at 6pm, it turns it off. And then for the rest of the time, I can just go into the

323
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:57,280
app and swipe to refresh and it will, you know, load my emails if I really want to at, you know,

324
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:02,160
midnight check, you know, a Sunday night before work or whatever. But, you know, on the whole,

325
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:08,640
it's a very easy way to separate concerns between the two contexts of my life.

326
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:15,680
And, uh, there was some really awful bugs in the way the under screen fingerprint reader on the,

327
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:24,880
uh, 70 and Android 11 just kept not working very well. And you know, I use it dozens of times a

328
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:29,840
day and it was very frustrating. So I've gone back to Android 10 on the 70 and forever there,

329
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:35,520
it shall stay until I find a replacement, you know, that'll be fine. But that brings me back

330
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:44,720
to the pixel six, I think, and, uh, the in-screen fingerprint reader. Oh God, is it bad. It's really

331
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:49,600
bad. You know, I've had one for two years in my OnePlus device and sure. You know, when, when I'm,

332
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:54,640
you know, baking bread or doing something and my hands are a little bit greasy or sweaty or whatever,

333
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:59,920
it doesn't work all the time, but I have the pattern to unlock and on OnePlus devices, I have

334
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:04,960
face unlock as well. Don't have face unlock on a pixel. It seems like something they would have

335
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:10,080
ripped off by now. Yeah. Well, I mean, all the OnePlus are doing is using the selfie camera.

336
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:15,600
It's not like a face ID system like Apple with a fancy 3d dot matrix scanners. It's just,

337
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:23,360
does that look vaguely like Alex? Yeah, that'll do. Is that a picture? Who cares? Right. Exactly.

338
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:27,840
And, uh, for the most part, I mean, if you physically got my phone, I'm probably going to

339
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:32,880
notice, you know, unless you're my kid and then maybe, but she's not quite old enough for that

340
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:38,000
yet. She'll be coming for it soon. Yeah. Yeah. She started crawling this week. So that's, that's been

341
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:43,120
fun. I remember early on when I was in a grocery store when, and I figured out, wait a minute,

342
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:48,800
are there rattle apps? There was a rattle apps. Perfect here. Hold this. And this is like,

343
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:53,600
I'm going to let you hold this, you little monster while I pay for these groceries, this thousand

344
00:30:53,600 --> 00:31:01,680
dollar baby rattle. Yeah. Really kind of ridiculous actually. So fingerprint readers aside, because,

345
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:07,520
you know, you can kind of just about learn to deal with that. We've got to talk about Android 12 and

346
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:13,280
this material you interface redesign. Have you seen much in the way of screenshots? Have you got

347
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:19,200
a pixel three, right? Yeah, I do. I do. Um, it's up to date as far as the pixel three will go. So

348
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:25,520
I don't know, but I have not immersed myself in it. I have heard a lot of different takes on it,

349
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:29,040
though. So I'm curious to know what you think. Cause I've actually heard people that like it

350
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:34,480
and it doesn't sound like you do well, they're wrong. I tell you, do you like padding?

351
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:40,800
I mean, not really. I generally find it to be kind of gross. Cause if you like lots of wasted

352
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:46,320
white space on a beautiful big display, then Android 12 is for you. But it makes it feel like

353
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:51,520
it's the, like the whole UI just isn't designed for your screen size. No, you know, so there's a

354
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:56,960
couple of things and they almost all to do with how the notification center toggle swipe down thing

355
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:05,120
operates. So on my one plus device, which is running, I can say Android 10, I have 12 toggles

356
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:10,640
that I can customize to be practically anything on my phone that are just a tap. You know, I want to

357
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:15,280
turn wifi off swipe tap. That's it. It's all in one place. It's all at the top of the screen.

358
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:20,240
It doesn't move around. It's just in one place. And there are 12 different things and I can long

359
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:26,560
press to get to the settings of wifi or Bluetooth or whatever it is. Right. It's a really elegant

360
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:37,040
system. Android 12, there are four. That's just crazy. Not only that, one of those options now is

361
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:45,040
a new internet toggle. So rather than it being a simple single tap to turn off wifi, I have to

362
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:51,600
swipe tap and then do this hand kind of gymnastic gesture all the way down to the bottom of the

363
00:32:51,600 --> 00:33:01,520
screen, then toggle off wifi. You know, that's so funny because it seems like even iOS, right? It's

364
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:04,800
going in the direction of like control center where there's just way more things you can do

365
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,280
just by sliding down the screen. Like even Apple is out of a whole bunch of buttons there.

366
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,120
Why, why go back? Why, why reduce functionality? Why make you take more taps? Yeah, that kind of

367
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:20,400
stuff. I don't know. It was too complicated. Alex. The problem was it was too complicated of a UI

368
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:25,120
and it was intimidating to new users. I need to make it simpler. You're sounding like the

369
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:31,760
comment section on one of Linus tech tips, Linux challenge videos. At this point, we hear this all

370
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:39,040
the time. Who are these mythical new users? Who are they? I don't know because it's funny because

371
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:46,240
Google changes it all the time with every single release. And so it causes users, these new users

372
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:51,760
to actually lose their footing. It's the geeks who can adapt and people criticize the iOS launcher

373
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:56,240
for being very slow to change and the notifications, which got a huge change in the last OS.

374
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:03,120
You still saw them there. Yeah. But at the same time, the reality is, is all of my family members

375
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:09,920
that got an iPhone or an iPad a decade ago are, are more competent today. Like they know how to

376
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:14,080
get to settings. They know how to change stuff. They know how to launch apps. They have evolved

377
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:19,840
their skill set. And my family members that have Android devices are still lost as hell. Every time

378
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:24,640
they get an Android device, the buttons are all in a different place. Setting screen is reorganized,

379
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:31,040
renamed, and they start at zero every single time. And every time Google reorganizes these

380
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:35,040
dropdown screens, they're making it harder for these very new users that they're trying to

381
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:39,840
design this stuff for. You know what it feels like? And I think it was Tyler on Twitter that

382
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:46,080
said it most succinctly to me. It feels like someone has slapped a cheap skin on top of my

383
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:52,880
stock Android. And it just, it doesn't, it doesn't work. It doesn't fit for me. And, you know, they

384
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:58,880
tout all these features. Like it picks up colors from your wallpaper and changes the theme throughout

385
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:04,480
the app. I don't want that. I want to set it and forget it. It is a production device that should

386
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:13,200
just always be exactly as I left it. That's it. That's its job. It's funny. That has been a trend

387
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:17,520
recently of like, well, we will automatically detect a primary color in your website or in

388
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:23,120
your background and we'll completely recolor the UI. So that way it matches and user's response is

389
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:29,840
always, no, don't, don't really want that. I think Big Sur might've started this trend, actually,

390
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:35,440
you know, Apple, maybe even going back to, was it iOS seven when they introduced like the new

391
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:42,240
Crayola style, you know, cartoonish kind of vibe to it. It was a big redesign. It was a while ago

392
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:47,120
now. Yeah. Well, wasn't there just a big upset about Safari, like getting changing colors and

393
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:51,600
stuff, new tab design or something like that and taking colors from websites and people hate it.

394
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:57,680
People don't like change. Why change it? It's not broken radical change for just change sake. I

395
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:03,040
think is what people don't like. I mean, I'm the type of guy that installs bartender on my Mac

396
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:09,040
so that I can condense the icons in Big Sur back together again. You know, I don't need things

397
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:16,160
spacing out more. I have a very fine cursor on a laptop or, you know, a computer. I don't need

398
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:23,760
finger sized buttons. Yeah. I'm on a phone. I tell you, you know, you give me a six and a half inch

399
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:29,360
display or whatever, and you take, you reduce my options by an order of magnitude. I just,

400
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:35,120
can I tell you what my lesson is from this is that if you're building an app or you're hosting

401
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:43,120
something or whatever it is, web apps are still the best way to go because all of these OS platforms

402
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:47,360
disappoint in some other way. And like you can be an Android fan for a while and then you get

403
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:50,480
burned out. You can be an iOS fan for a while. You get burned out and it's not like you can go out

404
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:56,400
and buy some other phone at any scale, any practicality right now. But as long as it's a web

405
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:01,120
app, well, you can get to it from your, any phone OS, you can get it from any desktop OS.

406
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:10,400
Ultimately it is the neutralizer, which brings me to my final nail in the coffin for iOS for now.

407
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:17,200
And I do hope the courts kind of change how this is going to go. I was listening to Craig Federighi

408
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:23,200
passionately defend against sideloading. And I could not believe some of the trash.

409
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:27,200
That's so embarrassing to listen to him. Cringy.

410
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:32,000
And for me on, on Android, you know, I discovered sponsor block this week for YouTube.

411
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:37,280
By the way, if you've not come across this thing, it will cut out the intros of YouTube

412
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:42,400
videos. And this video is brought to you, but like all that stuff is just gone. You know,

413
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:47,600
like, and subscribe is gone, just gone. It's amazing. And I wanted to sideload this on my

414
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:53,040
Android TV device and I can do that. If I wanted to do this on an Apple TV, I mean,

415
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:57,040
I don't have one, but I assume it would be more difficult because why would Apple approve

416
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:02,960
something like that through the app store, you know? Yeah. Um, so for now at least,

417
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:08,960
I think I will stick with my 7T until something better comes along. Although,

418
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:16,480
the grass over on the iOS side is looking ever more slightly verdant and greener.

419
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:20,880
I'll probably buy one at some point and then regret it and return it like I always do.

420
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,320
Well, since we'll probably never have this chat again on the show where we will have

421
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:29,520
it very infrequently, I just want to add, because I don't get an opportunity to do this

422
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:35,200
very often and it holds true now about two years in, I think something we do not give

423
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:39,920
iOS enough credit for on this show in particular, is that if you are a Home Assistant user,

424
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:49,600
you can use HomeKit to integrate with the iOS HomeKit system. And every device you have in Home

425
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:57,200
Assistant, every light, every fan, every thermostat, shows up as a HomeKit device to your iPhone,

426
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:02,720
which means it shows up as a device to Siri. It shows up as a device to your iPhone.

427
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:08,000
As a device to Siri, it shows up as a device to your watch. It shows up when I pull down

428
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,400
the control panel and it changes location too, by the way. So when I'm at the studio,

429
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:18,000
it updates to devices that are here. And when I go home, it updates to devices and chips.

430
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,040
And as I'm here right now...

431
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:22,640
Is that what you've been telling me about this HomeKit bridge for ages?

432
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:26,560
No, HomeKit bridge is a little different. That's a little different. That HomeKit

433
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:30,720
bridge allows you to talk to devices that don't natively speak HomeKit. It'll talk

434
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:39,120
whatever they speak and bridge it to HomeKit. But this, you connect the HomeKit on the iOS

435
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:45,360
to Home Assistant and Home Assistant actually speaks native HomeKit now. And it means every

436
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:50,640
device is in here and I can use voice prompts on HomePods, on the phone, but also in Control

437
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:58,160
Center in the Home app. And it also means if you have a family iOS setup, so like my wife and kids

438
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:02,960
were all family in iOS, they also get access to devices through the Home app. I don't even

439
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,880
have to give them the Home Assistant app. And it works remotely because we have a HomePod.

440
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:12,960
And it's very special and there's nothing quite close to that integration on Android without

441
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:19,840
going all in on Google Assistant. And additionally, what I love about it is the Home Assistant app

442
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:26,800
for iOS is a particularly great piece of software. And the developer who makes the iOS Home Assistant

443
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:33,440
app deserves a few beers, just for me personally, because it is such a great app. And they've

444
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:39,680
recently added focus mode support as a sensor to Home Assistant. So I want you to think about what

445
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:45,840
that means for a second. I have an NFC tag on my mixer. I sit down, I set my phone on this tag,

446
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:51,680
it goes into recording focus mode. Now Home Assistant knows I'm in recording mode. So lights

447
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:57,440
change. I can do all kinds of automations based around that. And it all happens without me having

448
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:03,520
to do hardly anything. And last part, and then I'm totally done, because all of the devices show up

449
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:11,520
in HomeKit, I can actually just use the built-in shortcut app on iOS. So if I never wanted to write

450
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:15,440
a Home Assistant automation because I felt it was too complicated or whatever, I could do all

451
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:20,560
my automations with shortcuts on iOS and on the Mac, and just have it talk to the devices like

452
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:25,600
HomeKit devices. And you could just do that. And it's fantastic. And it's something that I think

453
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:30,320
is five notches above anything you can do on Android with Home Assistant. And I think it's

454
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:34,560
fantastic. But other than that, I agree there's nice things about both platforms. But I just think

455
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:39,440
that's an area where iOS perhaps has a leg up for us Home Assistant users.

456
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:45,280
Yeah, and this rant, it wasn't too much of a rant, I don't think. But this segment for me

457
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:51,520
isn't necessarily a, I think iOS stinks and Android is better. I just think in general,

458
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:58,800
they've both got significant issues that I don't know what the next few years holds in the mobile

459
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:05,920
OS space. There's room for a third player, honestly, to come along and disrupt, I think.

460
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:13,520
But I'm tempted by an iPhone, I must admit. Those cameras in particular, the camera on the

461
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:19,440
Pixel 6 is good. But it's not earth shatteringly good. Everybody else has caught up to what Google

462
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:26,720
are doing. Their de-blurring of face feature is just marketing. Their erase thing that they love

463
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:32,240
to tout on the adverts is just that, it's just marketing as well. So I mean, it's a perfectly

464
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:40,560
fine device, but it's $700. And my 7T is just about as good, to be honest. So I think I'm

465
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:47,840
going to stick with that. Backblaze.com slash SSH. Get peace of mind knowing your files are backed

466
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:53,440

00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:12,560
on your PC backed up to the cloud and restored anywhere you want. I mean, you could just directly

470
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:17,680
download them back to your machine or restore them via the app. Or if it's a lot of data,

471
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:23,520
heaven forbid, you need to restore like a lot of data. Backblaze will work with you to restore by

472
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:30,480
mail as well. It's a neat system. And you know, the nice thing about the mobile apps is that even

473
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:34,400
when you're out on the go, if you really need to get something, you don't have to expose your

474
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:39,520
network to remote access or something like that. You can log into that Backblaze app and grab the

475
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:46,240
file there. That's really nice. And these kinds of reasons are why 50 billion files have been

479
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:06,720
you can support the show, but you get that 50 day free trial too. You go there, play with it,

480
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:13,040
start protecting your data and start backing up today. Backblaze started 14 years ago as a bold

481
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:17,840
idea to create a business that was fair and good for its customers, its partners, its employees,

482
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:22,880
and of course your data, and now the greater community. And I love how they've contributed

483
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:27,600
over the years with not only their Drive reports, which we've cited on the air lots of times,

484
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:35,360
they've got their storage pods, over 500,000 customers in 175 countries. It's Backblaze.

485
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:40,400
And you can try it out 15 days for free. And then it's only $7 a month after that

486
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:45,600
for unlimited backup for your Mac and your PC. Backblaze.com slash SSH.

487
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:52,800
Now if you have any thoughts on whether Chris and I should talk a little bit more about the world of

488
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:57,600
technology and the art of smart... No, wait, that's the wrong show. We should talk about this stuff a

489
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:02,320
bit more. Do let us know at self-hosted.show slash contacts. And we'd love to hear from you.

490
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:07,360
Speaking of which we have a bit of feedback about Home Assistant.

491
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:12,720
Yeah. Listener Chris writes and he says, hello, Chris and the Badger. Home Assistant hit a

492
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:19,360
milestone recently with 100,000 users participating in their analytics. This is a great way for users

493
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:24,080
to contribute to the project and help shape the development. And the best part is it's an

494
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:29,920
opt-in implementation. The downside to an opt-in is that it can get overlooked by some users who

495
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:35,120
maybe wouldn't mind contributing. So I thought maybe a shout out to this feature and its location

496
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:39,360
in the UI would be an excellent way for the self-hosted community to give back to an incredible

497
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:45,120
project. Thanks for all you do and happy hosting. If you go into Home Assistant, and this can just

498
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:49,840
be Home Assistant Core, and you go into configuration, and then in the configuration

499
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:55,360
screen you go to general, and then in general at the bottom of that there's an analytics section.

500
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:03,360
And I have opted on my systems to check all those boxes and hit save. I trust the Nebuchadnezzar

501
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:07,680
guys. I also pay for the service and I want them to know that I'm running this thing on a Pi and

502
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:12,560
I'm running on an x86 box and I'm not always using their OS. I actually want it to represent

503
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:18,000
my usage and I feel like that's the best way for me to do it. Brandon writes in with some feedback

504
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:23,360
about Frigate from a couple of episodes ago. Hey guys, I just listened to episode 56. I really

505
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:28,000
enjoyed the show. I've been using Frigate for a while now and I think it's pretty great. I have

506
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:36,400
not upgraded to 0.9 yet. I'm still on the version of 0.8. I'm contacting you guys because one thing

507
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:41,520
Frigate is very good for is improving a camera system that you might already have. As Chris

508
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:48,640
mentioned, Frigate just needs an RTSP feed and I had a Lorex Dahua, I hope I said that right,

509
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:54,400
camera system set up on my network with a standalone NVR. Frigate's integration with

510
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:58,560
Home Assistant is pretty great. I've got a Wyze camera in the basement which detects if the kids

511
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:04,320
are playing down there. If they leave and don't turn the lights off, brackets, they never do,

512
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:08,240
then it will turn the lights off after 10 minutes of not recognizing any people.

513
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:11,840
That's nice. When an object is detected,

514
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:17,440
I get a snapshot and a notification through Home Assistant. One thing I'm curious about is updating

515
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:22,160
the models in Frigate though. I'd love to have a custom model that could detect our two vehicles

516
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:30,080
versus say a DoorDash delivery vehicle or a UPS truck. Wow, that's a great idea. Have you seen

517
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:36,000
anything about that? I wonder if that's possible right now. Well, we might have something in this

518
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:42,560
space. We're planning fairly soon a site reliability engineers only live stream with

519
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:47,440
Chris and I to hang out with the supporters and patrons of the show. I've been doing some

520
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:53,280
background sleuthing with the author of an app called Double Take. Essentially what this does

521
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:59,920
is it's facial recognition for Home Assistant. It'll plug into DeepStack and Frigate and

522
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:07,840
Double Take. It's all this kind of machine object detection learning type melange of stuff that all

523
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:13,120
sort of kind of works together. I could see adding a vehicle detection model in one of these programs

524
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:17,600
being quite viable and perhaps we'll pick the Double Take author's brain on that on that live

525
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:22,720
stream. Interesting. I look forward to that. I could see like the next thing I might want

526
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:30,960
is detecting Levi versus any other animal. Don't worry about Levi, but dog, not hot dog, right?

527
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:37,520
Right. All right. This is probably our last one today. IA writes in with some network jargon

528
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:43,600
questions. He says, I recently graduated and discovered this podcast a few days ago. So since

529
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:48,880
I've been listening, I've heard the term doubly natted and the term punching a hole through a

530
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:53,680
firewall on the podcast at least a couple of times. I think TeamViewer was cited as an example.

531
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:58,880
I'm wondering if you could explain what this is in a bit of detail. I'd like to know about ways to

532
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:04,000
overcome double net and the pros and cons of that. You mentioned wire guards and VPNs. Maybe they

533
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:09,600
fit into this picture. Thanks. Well, Mr. Carrier Grade. Nat, why don't you stop by explaining that

534
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:17,280
one? I thought you were giving me a hard time. Right. So what has just unfortunately become way

535
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:23,120
more common than we'd like is a situation where you have somebody that runs a private network.

536
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:28,320
So this is a private network is generally a way of saying a network that doesn't route outside

537
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:33,040
itself. So if you're on that network, you're not, you're not routing, you're not publicly

538
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:37,600
available. People can't find you on the internet. You're a private network. The most typical example

539
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:43,040
of that would be say like an intranet at a school or even just your LAN at home. Right. Those are

540
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:50,800
all private networks. Now imagine that private network set up a network for another set of

541
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:57,360
machines and it was essentially networkception and it was also a private network. So you have

542
00:49:57,360 --> 00:50:01,200
a private network that is connected to a private network that is then connected to the public

543
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:08,480
internet. And that in a really loose way is what double netted is, is you are behind two network

544
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:13,280
address translated networks. You can actually set this up for yourself if you're curious to kind of

545
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:20,320
play around with it, spin up open sense or PF sense in a VM behind your existing router. And that

546
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:24,800
would create a network within a network, which is essentially what Chris is talking about here. So

547
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:31,520
he has a wireless ISP that's got a mast up on a hill somewhere and that thing has a router behind

548
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:38,320
it. So that router has a public facing IP address. Now, you know that there are only a certain number

549
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:44,320
of IPv4 addresses available. They're expensive as a consequence, relatively speaking. And so what a

550
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:51,760
lot of these wireless ISP guys do is to save a bit of money. They will just give you a private IP

551
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:58,560
and essentially translate your local devices on your local network in Chris's RV, for example.

552
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:02,560
They won't know, you know, everything he's got behind their little router that they've given him,

553
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:08,320
but his router will have an IP address on their network, not the public internet.

554
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:17,120
And because of this, software like VPNs or other types of software that want to, quote unquote,

555
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:22,000
punch a hole through a firewall, they can't just open up a port on the firewall through something

556
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,320
like universal plug and play and start receiving connections. Because even if they open up a

557
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:31,280
port on that firewall, there's just a private network on the other side of that that can't

558
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:37,680
talk to the internet. And so when you're double netted, you need something that is sort of like

559
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:43,200
a proxy between whatever is on the private network and whatever is on the public network.

560
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:47,440
And that's usually what you hear us talking about ways around double netting or something like that.

561
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:52,960
And really what it just means is that if you want to host something on a double netted network,

562
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:56,560
you're going to have to work to make it happen. And it's not going to be the most efficient way

563
00:51:56,560 --> 00:52:01,760
to do it. And they probably don't want you doing it because another place you'll often see this

564
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:08,880
is on cell networks and mobile networks and some satellite internet. And so they probably don't

565
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:12,480
want you hosting anything either. That's very common. And that's that's where something like

566
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:17,360
our sponsor Linode could be useful. Yeah. And this is one of the reasons why I found

567
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:25,280
tailscales so useful is they host a lighthouse, a third party kind of witness node somewhere that

568
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:30,560
does all that nat traversal stuff for you. So then you end up with a peer to peer connection

569
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:35,120
to the remote host. And I'm very pleased to say that I've been using tailscale now for what,

570
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:41,360
a couple of months and doing all my backups to England on my Synology box over tailscale. And

571
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:44,880
it's just working. I mean, I really like it too. Yeah.

572
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:50,080
I think you cannot find it just works, you know, it is so simple to get up and get going

573
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:56,080
and have a mesh network. The only thing about tailscale that I'm not a huge fan of is you are

574
00:52:56,080 --> 00:53:01,040
placing a lot of trust in them because they are doing the key exchange and managing all of that

575
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:06,960
stuff for you. And if you want something like tailscale, but you want full control and you want

576
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:11,600
to be completely, you know, a trustworthy setup. I still think Nebula is better in that regard.

577
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:16,720
Like, especially in a server to server to server scenario, I might be more comfortable with Nebula,

578
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:22,480
but if it's like phone workstation server, that might be where our or or workstation workstation

579
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:26,640
workstation among friends. I'd probably go tailscale, but when it's server server server,

580
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:30,240
I might be more inclined to go Nebula just because you have complete control.

581
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:36,800
It is also exceedingly good at punching through double nat and you have complete control over

582
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:42,640
the keys in that scenario. You know what? I'd equate that to tailscale is a bit like plex.

583
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:48,080
Like, I'm not totally 100% on board with what they're doing, but it's very slick.

584
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:55,360
And Nebula is kind of like Cody. No, jelly. You know what? I didn't say it during during the

585
00:53:56,160 --> 00:54:03,760
compute module review, or at least first look. But jellyfin in a way is be is a lot more appealing

586
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:08,640
now because, you know, plex is added a lot of stuff and jellyfin remains kind of lean and mean.

587
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:14,480
And it it has a pretty good metadata manager and it will write the information to the folders

588
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:19,920
and NFO files and it'll go through and scan for chapter images. You can get chapters for all your

589
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:25,840
all your stuff. That's fine. That's fine. How are the clients? Yeah, you're right. That's that's

590
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:30,080
the problem. You see what I mean? Like tailscale has that figured out. They have all the clients

591
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:36,080
for iOS, for Android, for everything. Whereas Nebula, you're on your own. That's kind of what

592
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:41,360
I mean. Yeah, it is. It is a similar, I think. And I think there is a place for both of them.

593
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:46,320
But when you want simplicity and ease of use, tailscale wins. You're right. It is that. Yeah,

594
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:50,720
they should. They should totally sponsor. If anybody at tailscale is listening, hook us up

595
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:54,720
with like a deal and we'll start getting people signed up. Well, we're all pretty happy users.

596
00:54:54,720 --> 00:55:02,000
You know, we like some of them. We started asking them to sponsor us. And by that point, we've

597
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:09,120
already given away the milk. We'd love to hear your feedback, your ideas, your projects you're

598
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:13,760
working on, things you're using a compute module for. Let me know. Let us all know.

599
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:20,000
Self host dot show slash contact. And also find our sponsor, a cloud guru on social media.

600
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,800
They're just slash a cloud guru at anything that's like a social media platform, you know,

601
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:28,960
like the YouTube, the Facebook, the Twitter slash a cloud guru. Now you heard me mention

602
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:33,440
it a little bit earlier in the show, but for our site reliability engineers at self hosted dot show

603
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:40,240
slash SRE, we're going to be doing a secret super special live stream over the next few weeks for

604
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:44,640
Chris and I. We're going to hang out with you guys and we'll just have like a video call where we

605
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:49,760
can all talk. But we have a few special guests on the on the show as well at that point. It'd be

606
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:55,200
basically like a pseudo episode, I guess, except you're part of it, like a hypervised episode.

607
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:59,680
It's not like it's not or a pair of virtualized episode. That's what it is. I just wanted to say

608
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:04,400
to I also I bought a new microphone for it. I'm going to do it up for my office, I think. And so

609
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:09,280
I needed a microphone in my office. I'll be trying out a brand new microphone for these for this for

610
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:15,120
this for this whole live stream stuff. Self host dot show slash SRE. And don't forget, you also get

611
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:20,560
the post show every episode. So, you know, by now, so posted dot show slash contact is the place to

612
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:25,440
go to get in touch with us. You can find me on Twitter at ironic badger. I'm over there at Chris

613
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:30,720
Elias and the show is at self hosted show. Don't forget the network at Jupiter signal. And thanks

614
00:56:30,720 --> 00:57:00,720
for listening, everyone. That was self hosted dot show slash 58.
