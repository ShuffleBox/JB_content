WEBVTT

00:00.160 --> 00:05.600
Coming up on Self-Hosted 15, we help preppers get their toilet paper stockpiles in order.

00:05.600 --> 00:09.840
We also battle valiantly the WebSockets demon of reverse proxies.

00:09.840 --> 00:14.480
And I let you know why Chris has fear of missing out on HASS.io.

00:14.480 --> 00:15.440
I'm Alex.

00:15.440 --> 00:18.000
I'm Chris. And this is Self-Hosted 15.

00:19.360 --> 00:21.840
So how many toilet paper rolls have you bought this week?

00:21.840 --> 00:25.360
I got two orders from Amazon in, actually. But just because I was

00:25.360 --> 00:28.320
afraid that the store would run out, not because I wanted to stockpile,

00:28.320 --> 00:31.840
and I'm about to go on a road trip. You're such a hoarder.

00:32.400 --> 00:34.720
I'm going to Denver and I don't want to run out halfway.

00:35.280 --> 00:40.560
This is the thing, right? So I was recently buying some parts to flush the coolant on my truck,

00:40.560 --> 00:45.600
and I had to buy six gallons of distilled water to do it. And the woman at the checkout looked

00:45.600 --> 00:50.880
at me like I was some crazy zombie prepper man. I'm like, no, I'm just flushing the coolant on

00:50.880 --> 00:55.680
my truck. I'm not trying to be a hoarder here. Yeah, what would you be using that for?

00:55.680 --> 01:00.320
The thing is, is every time I'm leaving for a trip, I wish I had some sort of inventory

01:00.320 --> 01:04.400
management system. And I got a sense from the audience this week that they were feeling the

01:04.400 --> 01:07.200
same way, you know, whatever they might be prepping for.

01:07.200 --> 01:12.800
Yeah, I mean, it's no secret at the moment, the world's going coronavirus mad. And I think it

01:12.800 --> 01:17.840
makes sense to have some stocks of different sorts of provisions, you know, tins of beans, rice.

01:17.840 --> 01:18.800
Batteries.

01:18.800 --> 01:23.040
Yeah, all that kind of stuff, right? The issue with buying so much stuff at once,

01:23.040 --> 01:27.200
though, is that it's really hard to keep track of when that stuff's gonna expire and go bad in your

01:27.200 --> 01:32.720
cupboard. So I was browsing through the Home Assistant add-on store last night, and I saw

01:32.720 --> 01:42.880
Grossi, which is spelled G-R-O-C-Y. And this thing allows you to manage inventory of food,

01:42.880 --> 01:45.600
of batteries, of all sorts of stuff.

01:45.600 --> 01:49.280
Yeah, it's an inventory management system specifically really for

01:49.280 --> 01:54.160
groceries, but you could use it for other things like chores, like Alex said, batteries.

01:54.160 --> 01:59.920
But in here, here's an example of cheese. There's three packs of cheese currently in the fridge.

01:59.920 --> 02:04.640
They expire at X amount of time. And then the system even has a price history chart in here,

02:05.360 --> 02:10.000
and basic information about what you have in the inventory. I could really see people

02:10.000 --> 02:14.560
who like to track everything just super geeking out on this.

02:14.560 --> 02:18.560
And you can then use those constituent ingredients you have in the cupboard,

02:18.560 --> 02:22.960
in the fridge, whatever, as part of the meal plan and recipes function

02:22.960 --> 02:25.600
that this software has as well. It's pretty cool.

02:25.600 --> 02:28.960
Would you really find yourself, though, going in here, like when you eat a cookie,

02:28.960 --> 02:31.280
go in here and remove one cookie from the inventory?

02:31.280 --> 02:32.160
Hell no.

02:32.160 --> 02:38.800
I think that's too granular for me, too. But I could see the equipment tracking being really

02:38.800 --> 02:39.440
useful.

02:39.440 --> 02:44.000
Well, for you, yeah. Who has which microphone? Who has which interface? That kind of stuff

02:44.000 --> 02:44.960
could be useful.

02:44.960 --> 02:49.600
Even where is it stored? Which storage bay is it in? Or which shelf in the studio garage

02:49.600 --> 02:51.520
is it on? That could be really useful.

02:51.520 --> 02:55.600
Or for you, which house? Is it in the one in Wales? Or is it the one that's bolted to

02:55.600 --> 02:56.480
the earth?

02:56.480 --> 03:00.880
Absolutely. Right now, we're trying to pack up things for the trip to Denver in the RV.

03:00.880 --> 03:06.160
And I realized that the heater I use while I am off grid is in the garage here at the

03:06.160 --> 03:10.880
studio. And I almost left without it. And if I had a system like this, it's like checklist

03:10.880 --> 03:14.080
to the next level for me. And I could totally use that. Check in, check out.

03:14.080 --> 03:15.760
For those kinds of important things.

03:15.760 --> 03:19.760
And you could put serial numbers in there. So if, God forbid, you needed that information

03:19.760 --> 03:22.560
for insurance purposes, it's all in one place.

03:22.560 --> 03:27.440
And of course, it's self-hosted. G-R-O-C-Y. We'll have a link in the show notes. The cool

03:27.440 --> 03:33.200
thing is, if you go to their website, demo.grossy.info, they have a live link there with a demo

03:33.200 --> 03:37.040
account and data in the inventory for you to try before you set it up.

03:37.040 --> 03:41.120
I don't know exactly what the setup process is. I didn't try it yet. But I did find a

03:41.120 --> 03:45.440
guide. And I also have a link in there to integrate it in with Home Assistant. That

03:45.440 --> 03:46.960
might just be the better way to go.

03:46.960 --> 03:51.680
Yeah. HASS.io is making it really easy to run a whole bunch of apps right now. And I'm

03:51.680 --> 04:00.160
kind of seeing how this Home Assistant image can become your one-stop portal to all of

04:00.160 --> 04:05.360
the apps in your network. I talked a couple of episodes ago with Poppy about not needing

04:05.360 --> 04:11.200
a GUI, but having an app store to browse to find stuff sure is helpful for discovery.

04:11.200 --> 04:16.320
You know, I tell you what, it's not just that. Being able to pull all kinds of things into

04:16.320 --> 04:21.920
Home Assistant makes it really useful for other members of the family who maybe don't

04:21.920 --> 04:26.640
know all the URLs or don't remember which app to go to. So for this road trip that I

04:26.640 --> 04:31.360
just mentioned, I set up a tab in Home Assistant. And Alex, if you look, I put a screenshot

04:31.360 --> 04:35.600
in the show notes. I want you to check that out so you can see what I'm talking about.

04:35.600 --> 04:41.200
I'm using the picture elements card in Home Assistant to pull in over a dozen different

04:41.200 --> 04:48.960
webcam feeds of road conditions along our route to Denver. So from Oregon to Wyoming

04:48.960 --> 04:53.920
and Utah, and they're all in there. And so when I'm going down the road, Hadeel only

04:53.920 --> 04:57.280
has one tab she has to check to let me know how the road conditions are. She doesn't have

04:57.280 --> 05:02.720
to go to each site because every state has a different UI with different functionality

05:02.720 --> 05:07.840
and crazy ways of displaying things. So I just threw it all in there. Isn't that neat?

05:07.840 --> 05:10.560
That's fantastic. That is so cool.

05:10.560 --> 05:14.640
It's just an example of how pulling things into Home Assistant, it's handy in multiple

05:14.640 --> 05:18.560
ways because it's convenient, obviously, but it makes it more approachable to others

05:18.560 --> 05:19.680
in the family, too.

05:19.680 --> 05:23.520
I hadn't even considered doing that. I mean, obviously, I don't drive my house down the

05:23.520 --> 05:28.720
road on the regular. But now we just have one tab in Home Assistant. We check and we

05:28.720 --> 05:32.800
get all of the road conditions. And then if there's one that looks particularly bad, she

05:32.800 --> 05:36.560
can tap that and she will get the name of it. And then we could look it up more. We'd

05:36.560 --> 05:40.880
probably go to their website or go to their app. So there's all kinds of neat ways you

05:40.880 --> 05:42.800
can use Home Assistant to pull things in.

05:42.800 --> 05:48.560
The official add-ons are just getting out of control. I mean, you can run a DHCP server

05:48.560 --> 05:56.400
in Home Assistant with one click, DuckDNS, MariaDB, Samba shares. You can do your reverse

05:56.400 --> 06:00.080
proxy through NGINX all through the Home Assistant UI.

06:01.040 --> 06:06.000
I pull all my Wwise cameras in via the RTSP feeds along with Shinobi. I just have cards

06:06.000 --> 06:09.520
in Home Assistant that show them as well, which is just nice as a quick overview.

06:09.520 --> 06:14.160
Then there are the Home Assistant community add-ons, which are done mostly by Frank Nichoff.

06:14.160 --> 06:18.320
Sorry if I said the name wrong. And there's a bunch of stuff in there. Grossi is one of

06:18.320 --> 06:25.200
them. InfluxDB, MQTT, Node-RED, Plex Media Server, Spotify Connect. There's a whole bunch

06:25.200 --> 06:30.720
of stuff that you can now host on your Home Assistant rig just through the web UI with

06:30.720 --> 06:36.400
a couple of clicks. It's really slick. I accidentally blew up my Home Assistant last

06:36.400 --> 06:39.840
night. What? I was taking the opportunity to rebuild it, you know.

06:40.400 --> 06:43.760
Hold on. Hold on. You have backups beyond backups, I thought.

06:43.760 --> 06:48.960
I know. I do have a backup in Google Drive from literally yesterday, but I don't want

06:48.960 --> 06:53.360
to use it. This might sound a bit strange to you, but I quite enjoy nuking and paving

06:53.360 --> 06:59.200
every now and again. I don't do it with my desktop anymore because Linux is too good

06:59.200 --> 07:05.360
these days. I don't use Windows anymore, so I don't need to. I've got to scratch that

07:05.360 --> 07:06.400
itch somehow.

07:06.400 --> 07:11.200
It's a chance to apply all of the new lessons learned, get rid of the cruft, some of the

07:11.200 --> 07:15.440
things you set up but never finished, etc. It's a blank slate. I've been thinking about

07:15.440 --> 07:22.480
doing the same thing, but I'm always worried that I won't get things 100% functional again,

07:22.480 --> 07:27.600
which is actually a good reason to do it because you have to learn those things. Doing it over

07:27.600 --> 07:29.120
and over again, you definitely learn it.

07:29.120 --> 07:32.320
Well, if you put it in your Wiki, Chris, along with your last will and testament.

07:34.080 --> 07:37.360
It's more like, I don't know if I'll get it done before somebody in the family misses

07:37.360 --> 07:38.400
the functionality.

07:38.400 --> 07:44.320
That's very true. So, if you're going to nuke and pave, what are you going to do? Are you

07:44.320 --> 07:49.840
going to run it out of a container or are you going to go the appliance HASIO SD card

07:49.840 --> 07:50.800
image route?

07:50.800 --> 07:56.640
I really don't know. I very much appreciate the simplicity of a very base simple OS I

07:56.640 --> 08:01.760
know how to manage, a Docker container that is just the application, in this case, Home

08:01.760 --> 08:08.160
Assistant, and it's a very simple setup that is reliable. However, every time I run it,

08:08.160 --> 08:15.600
every time you talk about these HASIO add-ons and the community stuff, I'm feeling FOMO.

08:15.600 --> 08:19.760
I feel left out. I'm like, I wish I could try this stuff. And I know there's kind of

08:19.760 --> 08:24.240
a way I could do it, but the fact that I don't even fully understand what that way is, is

08:24.240 --> 08:25.360
just sort of a barrier.

08:25.360 --> 08:30.000
There is. It removes the barrier to entry. It's just a bunch of stuff you click. I don't

08:30.000 --> 08:36.160
know. I haven't really found any downsides to doing it this way other than I have less

08:36.160 --> 08:43.920
control over how the container itself and I guess by association, the other kind of

08:43.920 --> 08:50.400
containers are spun up, but I actually don't mind. It's a dedicated VM on my ESXi box downstairs

08:51.120 --> 08:56.000
and it just does the job. I occasionally have to increase the disk space, but other than

08:56.000 --> 08:58.400
that, it's been bulletproof reliable.

08:58.400 --> 09:04.800
That might be it for me is I'm not necessarily doing this in a VM. I'm doing this on hardware

09:04.800 --> 09:09.680
that is doing many other things. It has many other containers that are doing important

09:09.680 --> 09:14.160
functional work and I don't really have a VM to dedicate or a box dedicated to it.

09:14.160 --> 09:19.600
I don't think you need one. So in the name of science, I believe, Chris, you should try

09:19.600 --> 09:26.800
HASSIO because I think once you do, you'll be like, this is really easy to just do a

09:26.800 --> 09:27.600
whole bunch of stuff.

09:28.720 --> 09:31.040
Okay. Now you're speaking my language.

09:31.040 --> 09:36.160
You could do it the other way and as an experienced admin, I think there's a lot of value

09:36.160 --> 09:41.440
in knowing how the nuts and bolts under the hood are working, but sometimes time is your

09:41.440 --> 09:44.400
enemy and this is less of an enemy.

09:44.400 --> 09:47.760
And if it's something that's popular, I should probably have some experience with it just

09:47.760 --> 09:50.560
to round out my ability to comment on it.

09:52.240 --> 09:56.960
Dang it. The old do it for the show excuse. Why don't we answer a couple of questions?

09:56.960 --> 10:00.720
This is a good episode maybe to take a pause and answer some questions that have rolled

10:00.720 --> 10:06.160
in because Kyle has one sort of along this theme. He says, Hey guys, big fan of the show.

10:06.160 --> 10:07.760
I've learned a lot so far.

10:07.760 --> 10:12.640
Do you have a tutorial or a guide you recommend for setting up a reverse proxy? I'm open to

10:12.640 --> 10:18.400
all options and genetics, traffic, et cetera, but I want a quality guide since I'm exposing

10:18.400 --> 10:23.840
stuff on my network to the internet. Thanks, Kyle. That's such a great point.

10:23.840 --> 10:29.520
I don't run my reverse proxy as an add on in home assistant. You can and it integrates

10:29.520 --> 10:35.280
really nicely and it has let's encrypt automatically generating your SSL certificates and all the

10:35.280 --> 10:41.280
rest of it. I run the Linux server, let's encrypt image on my main media VM, which is

10:41.280 --> 10:48.480
a separate VM from where home assistant runs. And that VM has about 20, 25 containers running

10:48.480 --> 10:54.080
on it. And it uses the local DNS of that Docker daemon to resolve the containers on that host.

10:54.080 --> 11:00.720
So I don't have to open a bunch of ports from those containers to be able to see, be seen

11:00.720 --> 11:06.240
by the reverse proxy. Now that sounds great until you start trying to run services that

11:06.240 --> 11:11.680
are no longer on that box like home assistant. And I ran into an issue last night with web

11:11.680 --> 11:18.640
sockets. So I had the reverse proxy configuration working just fine. And then I loaded up node red,

11:18.640 --> 11:22.880
which is one of the add ons. You click the button, you install it and it would load,

11:22.880 --> 11:27.280
but then the actual, I don't know what you call it, I guess the sockets underneath the

11:27.280 --> 11:33.440
web sockets on the page wouldn't connect. And I thought to myself, hmm, how do I isolate this

11:33.440 --> 11:39.360
issue? Because, you know, being a troubleshooting sort of chap, I like to understand where the

11:39.360 --> 11:44.560
problem is. And you think to yourself, right, is it a reverse proxy? Is it node red? Is it home

11:44.560 --> 11:50.080
assistant? And you can isolate these things by going to the IP address of the server instead of

11:50.080 --> 11:57.520
the reverse proxy URL. So in my case, that was 192.168.whatever. And it worked perfectly. So I'm

11:57.520 --> 12:02.400
like, okay, cool. I now know it's a reverse proxy. Didn't help me find the answer, but I knew what

12:02.400 --> 12:10.960
the problem was. And after maybe two, three, maybe more hours, I eventually discovered that web

12:10.960 --> 12:16.160
sockets were required in both blocks, not just the API web socket section, but also the root of the

12:16.160 --> 12:23.360
web URL, added two lines of config, restarted Let's Encrypt, and boom, we were off to the races.

12:23.360 --> 12:29.120
So I put the full details in a blog post over on my blog, and hopefully that saves somebody else

12:29.120 --> 12:38.320
some pain. Now, if you are looking to do a reverse proxy, like I've done on my main media VM, I

12:38.320 --> 12:45.200
mentioned I was running the Linux server Let's Encrypt NGINX reverse proxy container. And I've

12:45.200 --> 12:50.960
been running that for maybe for two, three years at this point. Works great, really reliable.

12:50.960 --> 12:55.840
There's a bunch of pre-baked NGINX configuration files in a Git repo that the Linux server team

12:55.840 --> 13:01.040
maintain. And there is a fantastic blog post written by Aptalka, who's the guy that put most

13:01.040 --> 13:06.480
of the work into that container. It's basically an NGINX starter guide. So if you're trying to

13:06.480 --> 13:11.840
figure out how do I expose my services securely to the internet without opening a whole bunch

13:11.840 --> 13:17.120
of ports in my firewall, this guide is the one that you want. It's from April 2019, but it's

13:17.120 --> 13:22.880
still as relevant today as it was then. Very nice. Thank you. We'll make sure to put links to that at

13:22.880 --> 13:28.480
selfhosted.show slash 15. So before we roll off of Home Assistant completely,

13:29.200 --> 13:34.000
I want to throw a couple of problems I've had at you recently and also by extension the audience

13:34.000 --> 13:39.600
and just get people's take on this. I have a problem in Home Assistant where my automations

13:39.600 --> 13:46.240
from time to time just crap out. The one where it really matters is I have temperature sensors

13:46.240 --> 13:51.760
that are monitoring the temperature consistently. And when the temperature gets above, say 73

13:51.760 --> 13:58.960
degrees Fahrenheit, the heaters cut off. Well, sometimes that automation just stops working.

13:58.960 --> 14:04.320
And so I'll wake up in the middle of the night and it's like 85, 90 degrees in my bedroom and

14:04.320 --> 14:10.720
we're roasting because the automation failed. I don't know what that is. And then recently,

14:11.760 --> 14:19.120
my wife's phone and my phone using the Home Assistant app for iOS stopped connecting to

14:19.120 --> 14:23.840
our Home Assistant instance. On the same phone, you can go to the browser and bring up the Home

14:23.840 --> 14:29.520
Assistant UI in the browser, but you can't connect via the apps. You get you get some sort of API error.

14:29.520 --> 14:36.400
And these weird little issues, I wonder, are they related to being on a platform like ARM,

14:36.400 --> 14:40.160
like a Raspberry Pi 4? Is it because it's a Raspberry Pi 4 Home Assistant server and

14:40.800 --> 14:44.720
I don't know, maybe there was disk I.O. contention and something failed and it just breaks?

14:45.440 --> 14:51.760
Or would this be striking me if I was on a Core i7 system with plenty of CPUs and

14:52.480 --> 14:58.720
32, 64 gigs of RAM? I don't know what's going on here. I don't know if it's something that

14:58.720 --> 15:04.560
I could fix with hardware, but doing OS updates, keeping Home Assistant fully up to date, keeping

15:04.560 --> 15:09.920
the app on the phone up to date, none of that has fixed it. The only thing that gets the automations

15:09.920 --> 15:15.680
working properly again is to restart Home Assistant or reboot the entire Raspberry Pi, whichever I

15:15.680 --> 15:21.520
choose, then my automations work. I don't remember what my issue was, but it was something along the

15:21.520 --> 15:27.040
lines of an automation not working. And I just set up an automation, funnily enough, to restart

15:27.040 --> 15:31.120
the container every day. I didn't do it in Home Assistant, though. I wrote a cron script that did

15:31.120 --> 15:35.920
it. But I've run into that issue as well, where you just have to restart the container for what

15:35.920 --> 15:41.760
seems like no good reason. And 4 a.m. every day, bang, restarted, couldn't tell the difference.

15:42.320 --> 15:47.440
So I was considering doing that, but I thought maybe that was just sort of the lazy hack way out.

15:47.440 --> 15:51.280
Well, it is. It's not really fixing the problem. It's fixing the symptom, isn't it?

15:51.280 --> 15:57.120
I could accept that it's just software in development and that this is a problem that just

15:57.120 --> 16:04.160
is internal to Home Assistant. But I think what plagues me is this this nagging question that I

16:04.160 --> 16:08.960
always come to. You hear me touch on it from time to time here on the show. Is it because I'm on a

16:08.960 --> 16:15.680
Raspberry Pi? Should I have done this on a proper x86 system? And I think maybe that's my bias,

16:15.680 --> 16:20.080
because in my world, a server is an x86 box, which is probably silly and outdated.

16:20.080 --> 16:27.360
The only thing I would say against the Pi is the SD card. It's the SD card. Yeah.

16:27.360 --> 16:32.400
Yeah. I don't really like the fact that a production and I say air quotes production

16:32.400 --> 16:39.120
machine is running off an SD card that just doesn't. But then again, my 3D printer has been

16:39.120 --> 16:46.880
running OctoPrint for the last year plus off an SD card. Absolutely fine. Yeah. But I don't see

16:46.880 --> 16:51.600
that as a critical piece of infrastructure like Home Assistant is in my house. I mean,

16:51.600 --> 16:57.600
if my 3D printer doesn't work, oh, well, if my home automation stuff stops working,

16:57.600 --> 17:03.200
that could be more frustrating. Yes, it is. And especially the more you end up relying on it.

17:03.200 --> 17:06.720
And I can hear a lot of people writing in right now. I can hear their keyboards,

17:06.720 --> 17:12.640
their mechanical keyboards, clacking, telling me to get xyz arm box and that it's so much better

17:12.640 --> 17:17.440
than the Raspberry Pi. But the truth of the matter is, I think if I was going to jump off of a Raspberry

17:17.440 --> 17:22.880
Pi 4, I think I would jump to one of the x86 boxes that Wendell mentioned last week.

17:22.880 --> 17:28.720
It just seems like a better way to go. I just feel like I want to ride this thing out a little

17:28.720 --> 17:33.120
bit longer. So I'm hoping somebody can tell me that they've had the same problem with

17:33.120 --> 17:37.440
automations. But it sounds like you kind of are confirming it. So maybe this is not Pi specific

17:37.440 --> 17:42.640
and that I should just buckle down and accept it, cron job a reboot. I wish I could remember what it

17:42.640 --> 17:50.400
was, but I haven't had the issue since I switched to Hasio. So maybe that's more motivation for you

17:50.400 --> 17:56.160
to try it out. I don't know. Well, we got another bit of feedback to get to. This one comes in from

17:56.160 --> 18:02.560
Glenn and he's telling us about Chenmon. Chenmon is a generator monitor. It's a little self hosted

18:02.560 --> 18:08.000
program that operates on a Raspberry Pi and it will relay the status of your generator.

18:08.000 --> 18:13.440
He says he uses it on his little 22 kilowatt generator across the water from where I'm at

18:13.440 --> 18:19.360
over in Port Orchard, which is a gorgeous area. He says it hosts a web page with the current status.

18:19.360 --> 18:26.240
It'll send an email or text message on changes. And you'll love this, Alex. It also has MQTT

18:26.240 --> 18:33.280
integration. Boom. If I had a bell, I would ding it right now. I know. We need like an MQTT

18:33.280 --> 18:38.480
like sound effect. He likes the data, especially likes to know when the power goes out. He says

18:38.480 --> 18:42.640
it's not really applicable to an RV, but it's still pretty cool. And it's an actively maintained

18:42.640 --> 18:47.440
Python project. And we'll have a link in the show notes. It doesn't support all generators,

18:47.440 --> 18:52.160
obviously, but it does support a fair amount. I have an own in generator that does not have one

18:52.160 --> 18:55.600
of these boards in it that gives you any information. But you got to wonder if there's

18:55.600 --> 19:01.440
some way you could add one. That'd be so cool. Now that I know this is data that is capturable,

19:01.440 --> 19:07.680
now I want it. Glenn is a man of about data, just like we are. Look at this.

19:07.680 --> 19:15.920
He also has an open source app called Salt Level. This is so great. Maybe it's a little

19:15.920 --> 19:21.680
more limited for people out there, but it monitors my water softener salt level.

19:21.680 --> 19:27.280
How fun is that? And he wrote that and that's a Python project and he's definitely scratching

19:27.280 --> 19:32.000
his own itch there. You can hear my dad right now saying, how hard is it to lift the lid of the thing

19:32.000 --> 19:36.800
and look inside the thing and put more salt in the thing? I'm like, that's not the point.

19:37.440 --> 19:42.320
See, my dad would love something like this because getting this just right was a point

19:42.320 --> 19:46.800
of pride for my dad growing up and he didn't have the tools we have today. And then on top of that,

19:46.800 --> 19:50.720
he had a saltwater tank where he had built a whole bunch of monitoring around it, but it was

19:50.720 --> 19:55.600
really old school style and none of it generated alerts. So my dad would be like, this is great,

19:57.360 --> 20:04.160
but has no need for it now. He says he's enjoyed the podcast and has gotten into Home Assistant

20:04.160 --> 20:07.840
because we've been talking about it, which is really cool to hear. I hope he loves it. He says

20:07.840 --> 20:12.400
he recommends anybody out there with a generator, go check out Genmon, see if it'll work for them.

20:13.120 --> 20:15.920
I want to check it out. I want my generator to do it now.

20:15.920 --> 20:21.120
I wonder if you could hook up some current sensors or something just to the outputs of

20:21.120 --> 20:25.920
the generator. And I mean, this was the reason I included the feedback was because I know that you

20:25.920 --> 20:30.160
have such a reliance on them. They're not something that are a tall part of my life, but

20:31.360 --> 20:36.080
power is a constant concern for you. I'm always looking for some way to get power. I can't wait

20:36.080 --> 20:39.920
for the summer. How is that solar thing working out? Give us a quick solar update.

20:39.920 --> 20:45.360
Well, really, you know, here in the Pacific Northwest in the winter, it's not super solar.

20:45.360 --> 20:52.000
It's not super sunny. But for one glorious day, really? Yeah, I know, right? Surprise, surprise.

20:52.720 --> 20:56.320
I do have the ability, although I don't think I can do it when I'm not on the network,

20:56.320 --> 21:01.760
but I have the ability to pull in information from the solar charge controller onto my phone.

21:01.760 --> 21:06.960
And one glorious day, we generated a surprising amount of power where the RV ran off solar for

21:06.960 --> 21:11.840
the entire day. But otherwise, it's just been little bits here and there. I'm looking at it,

21:11.840 --> 21:17.040
though, and I'm thinking in that day where we had really glorious sunshine, we definitely

21:17.040 --> 21:24.800
had spec'd it right. We had run the batteries down overnight using lights and using the furnace to

21:25.360 --> 21:31.440
about 82 percent or something like that. And then when the sun came out, by midday,

21:31.440 --> 21:36.560
we were back up at 100 percent and we were running completely off solar for one glorious day.

21:36.560 --> 21:37.520
By midday?

21:37.520 --> 21:38.640
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

21:38.640 --> 21:41.920
So what, like three or four hours of sunlight? That's pretty amazing.

21:41.920 --> 21:45.920
It's probably a little more than that. But yeah, it was great. It was great. I got home and I

21:45.920 --> 21:49.200
thought, oh, I better start the generator. And I looked at the batteries and it was

21:49.200 --> 21:50.400
completely charged.

21:50.400 --> 21:54.320
I want to put some solar on the roof of my house hearing things like that.

21:54.320 --> 22:00.000
I've always dreamed, too, about setting up solar on a studio and having all of the gear

22:00.000 --> 22:02.960
in the studio powered by solar or a battery bank, obviously.

22:02.960 --> 22:08.720
How great would it be to mine Bitcoin literally for free?

22:08.720 --> 22:14.080
That would be fantastic. Or Doge, you know, whatever it might be. Or run your media server

22:14.080 --> 22:18.880
and your self-hosted servers off of some sort of green energy, whatever it might be.

22:18.880 --> 22:24.320
Dogecoin. I can't believe you went there. You'll say 2000 and late.

22:25.280 --> 22:30.640
I know. Well, you know, the classics never die, Alex. The classics.

22:30.640 --> 22:31.280
That one should.

22:31.280 --> 22:38.080
Yeah, it should. But really, I mean, I hope one day in the future to have like a server

22:38.080 --> 22:43.520
shack somewhere or something that I've set up that is powering a couple of home server

22:43.520 --> 22:48.960
systems like a plex box and some storage that runs off of solar. I think that'd be very cool.

22:48.960 --> 22:54.960
We should set up our own colo data center that is just a solar powered self-hosting

22:54.960 --> 22:56.240
data center only.

22:56.240 --> 23:02.000
So we got one more email to get to. But before we do that, maybe we should do an update on

23:02.000 --> 23:04.960
the self-hosted Wiki. It's been a couple of episodes since we talked about that.

23:05.760 --> 23:13.600
Yeah, it has. Now, we had a call with the sort of kind of air quotes core maintainers

23:13.600 --> 23:18.080
of the Wiki a couple of weeks ago and talked about some of the tech decisions that we're

23:18.080 --> 23:23.200
going to use. And right now we're looking at MKDocs. We're going to press ahead with

23:23.200 --> 23:30.320
that as the primary technology stack, as it were, with a view towards eventually moving

23:30.320 --> 23:36.880
towards Hugo once we get the search and the theme where we want it. But the primary thing

23:36.880 --> 23:40.880
we're looking for right now is content. We need people to go and submit pull requests.

23:40.880 --> 23:45.040
It can be a really short how-to guide. You know, here's how I flashed Tasmota on this

23:45.040 --> 23:51.360
particular thing. Or this is what I use to monitor my plex media server.

23:51.360 --> 23:55.040
Or anything you've heard us mention on the show that you have an idea of how to do,

23:55.680 --> 23:58.480
write up a guide and then link it to us on the contact form.

23:58.480 --> 24:03.760
Yeah. And we would like things to be in markdown so that they're easily transposable between

24:04.400 --> 24:09.600
MKDocs and Hugo when the time comes. But if you open a pull request, we will give you

24:10.160 --> 24:15.840
feedback if we need some changes. But more than likely, it'll just be stylistic stuff,

24:15.840 --> 24:21.920
the actual content itself, unless it's horrible. Fair enough. Unless it's horrible.

24:23.760 --> 24:28.880
Well, I mean, if it's, I bought this thing and flashed something onto it,

24:28.880 --> 24:31.920
and you should do it too, we might not accept that pull request.

24:34.000 --> 24:38.480
We do incidentally need somebody to write a guide on how to do a pull request.

24:38.480 --> 24:42.400
There are lots of GitHub guides on how to do pull requests. But what you've got to remember

24:42.400 --> 24:48.160
is a lot of people in this community are coming to self-hosting stuff, not as Linux admins,

24:48.160 --> 24:54.320
but because they have bought a Synology or built an Unraid box and they're just learning

24:54.320 --> 24:58.480
and or home assistant users and they're learning Linux and they're learning this stuff for the

24:58.480 --> 25:03.520
first time. And they may not be familiar with stuff that as part of my day job, pull requests is

25:04.960 --> 25:10.000
something I do every day. And whilst I could write a guide, I would love a beginner to write

25:10.000 --> 25:16.320
a guide because the beginner's eyes are always going to be a lot wider than mine. And I think

25:16.320 --> 25:21.920
ultimately that's going to produce better content for everybody. Great point. That is something we

25:21.920 --> 25:25.840
should try to keep in mind and make this as accessible to as many people as possible.

25:25.840 --> 25:30.240
All right, sir. I know we've got one more email into the show today. Do you want to get to it?

25:30.240 --> 25:34.320
Yeah. You're a Windows guy, right? At least for the last week.

25:34.320 --> 25:41.840
Yeah. So Daniel Braun writes in and he says, Hey guys, I've been planning to move my company off

25:41.840 --> 25:48.320
of Windows Server. Hooray. Now, the problem is that I'm in a remote area and to get support out

25:48.320 --> 25:52.960
here is a bit difficult, which is the reason I went with Windows in the first place. I know my

25:52.960 --> 25:59.840
way around Linux, but I don't really have the time to manage the server. That's a tricky question.

25:59.840 --> 26:05.200
Yeah. What would be the distro and application you would recommend for Active Directory,

26:05.200 --> 26:09.200
file sharing and exchange? Thanks, PS. I really enjoy the show. Keep it up.

26:10.240 --> 26:12.800
Boy, I don't know if Daniel's going to want to hear this,

26:12.800 --> 26:16.640
but I think maybe he should consider sticking with Windows.

26:17.280 --> 26:22.160
Yeah, you can't just build a box and let it rot. You do have to do some stuff to it every now and

26:22.160 --> 26:27.520
again. Yeah. And if the core functionality you want from that box is Active Directory,

26:27.520 --> 26:34.400
I mean, you could definitely do it with Samba and LDAP. Absolutely. I have done it.

26:34.400 --> 26:40.160
Yeah. Or free IPA is another one and Red Hat seller product IDM that does it if you want to

26:40.160 --> 26:45.440
use that. But yes, if you've already got Windows and you've already got Active Directory set up,

26:45.440 --> 26:52.800
my first inclination would probably be even as a Linux guy would be to stick with what you've got.

26:52.800 --> 26:57.920
Yeah. I think the real cincher is that not only does he want Active Directory,

26:57.920 --> 27:02.960
but he wants exchange-like functionality. And again, this is reproducible. Things like

27:02.960 --> 27:07.760
Zimbra, for example, could be deployed on Linux. It would search back to your free IPA LDAP

27:07.760 --> 27:13.120
directory, which could be sitting behind Samba. And you could achieve Active Directory file

27:13.120 --> 27:18.640
sharing and exchange-like functionality with something like Ubuntu LTS, free IPA and a VM,

27:18.640 --> 27:26.240
and Zimbra and a VM. You could absolutely do this. I don't really see it. I would probably

27:26.240 --> 27:31.760
just stick with Windows. Keep in mind, too, I just got done with the WSL Comp, the Windows

27:31.760 --> 27:35.760
subsystem for Linux conference. And something that was made clear to me is that this is coming

27:35.760 --> 27:40.800
to Windows Server as well. And so, certain functionality like Ansible management,

27:41.920 --> 27:48.240
Kubernetes support, and even SSH are just going to be table stakes for Windows Server soon.

27:48.240 --> 27:54.880
And it's going to be simpler and easier for Linux guys and gals to manage a Windows Server.

27:55.600 --> 28:00.480
And I wish I could tell you, Daniel, this is the time to do it because I made a living for a long

28:00.480 --> 28:05.680
time going in as a contractor and migrating people's Windows servers to Linux. But I don't

28:05.680 --> 28:10.480
think this is the one, sir. He could look at how he has it set up, perhaps make it more manageable

28:10.480 --> 28:15.120
by having the primary systems in a VM and have the base system be the virtualizer where you can

28:15.120 --> 28:20.240
do snapshots and things like that. So, there's ways you could go about this. And that base system

28:20.240 --> 28:25.360
could be a CentOS or Ubuntu LTS machine. Don't forget, though, every time you add a layer,

28:25.360 --> 28:30.720
you also add complexity. So, unless you are familiar with that kind of stuff, just be careful.

28:30.720 --> 28:35.040
And I think because you've written the phrase, I'm planning to move my company. I don't know

28:35.040 --> 28:38.640
whether it's a small business or whether it's a big one. I'm assuming it's sort of small to

28:38.640 --> 28:44.720
medium size. I'm assuming that it's probably you that's in charge. So, just remember that

28:44.720 --> 28:49.680
when you get the phone call at 2am that something's on fire, you don't want to have to

28:49.680 --> 28:54.880
wade through nine layers of virtualization and abstraction to fix what would be a simple problem

28:54.880 --> 29:00.560
if you were just running on that host bare metal, so to speak. And honestly, it might just be worth

29:00.560 --> 29:07.280
waiting a little while. As crazy as it sounds, there are entire organizations now that operate

29:07.280 --> 29:12.400
without something like Active Directory. And I know that sounds nuts, but it's becoming the

29:12.400 --> 29:18.000
new normal. And hosted services, or ones you can host yourself, are a big part of that. And

29:18.000 --> 29:22.720
there's a shift happening in the industry. And if you just waited a couple of years, even,

29:22.720 --> 29:25.920
you'd probably have a much clearer signal in which direction that's going.

29:25.920 --> 29:30.080
Yeah, that's a great point. The DevOps movement is really bridging that gap,

29:30.080 --> 29:34.880
and a lot of developers now are deploying their own authentication services that mean that

29:35.440 --> 29:40.080
single sign-on is a service that runs on a Kubernetes cluster somewhere. And

29:40.080 --> 29:45.280
you can do a bunch of interesting stuff there. I don't find it very interesting, but some people

29:45.280 --> 29:53.040
do. Some of you guys do, yeah, and they're out there. If you want to get your question into the

29:53.040 --> 29:59.760
show, selfhost.show.com or on Twitter or on the Telegram in our Jupiter Broadcasting Telegram

29:59.760 --> 30:04.880
channel, hashtag ask SSH, and then put your question in there. We'll try to keep an eye out

30:04.880 --> 30:09.280
for those and incorporate them in future episodes. We have a lot of questions that come in. So from
