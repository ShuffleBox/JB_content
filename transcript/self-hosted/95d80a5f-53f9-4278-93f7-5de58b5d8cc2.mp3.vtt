00:00.000 --> 00:03.540
Joining us on the show today from serverbuilds.net is JDM.

00:03.540 --> 00:06.220
He's my go-to hardware guru.

00:06.220 --> 00:08.900
We also cover the new Raspberry Pi release

00:08.900 --> 00:12.360
and I stage an intervention for Chris's Raspberry Pi habit.

00:12.360 --> 00:13.260
I'm Alex.

00:13.260 --> 00:16.020
I'm Chris, and this is Self Hosted 21.

00:17.260 --> 00:19.800
Alex, have you ever had the perfect system

00:19.800 --> 00:22.140
end up being the machine you built yourself?

00:22.140 --> 00:23.980
There's no such thing as the perfect system, is there?

00:23.980 --> 00:25.420
It's just between upgrades.

00:25.420 --> 00:26.580
I don't know.

00:26.580 --> 00:30.320
I kind of think the workstation I have upstairs

00:30.320 --> 00:32.240
is one of those kind of perfect builds

00:32.240 --> 00:36.680
where I had kind of the confluence of the core series

00:36.680 --> 00:38.680
of CPUs were in a good maturity.

00:38.680 --> 00:40.980
Six cores was a good bang for the buck.

00:40.980 --> 00:43.280
It was a good price to get 32 gigs of RAM.

00:43.280 --> 00:45.360
Fast storage was cheap enough

00:45.360 --> 00:47.000
that I can have multiple disks.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.640
I just love this box I built.

00:48.640 --> 00:51.240
I feel that way about this one I'm talking to you via.

00:51.240 --> 00:56.240
It's an i7-8700K with a couple of NVME storage

00:56.240 --> 00:59.640
storage drives and all my actual storage is in the basement.

00:59.640 --> 01:03.760
But I've got an SSD for Windows and an SSD for Linux

01:03.760 --> 01:05.520
for pass-through and stuff like that.

01:05.520 --> 01:07.360
It does everything I could ever dream of.

01:07.360 --> 01:09.440
It's just a champ.

01:09.440 --> 01:10.260
What's yours?

01:10.260 --> 01:12.480
Mine's my Linux box upstairs that I run Manjaro on

01:12.480 --> 01:14.840
with my three 27-inch screens.

01:14.840 --> 01:17.440
It's got an AMD 580 graphics card in it,

01:17.440 --> 01:21.760
Intel six core CPU, 64 gigs of RAM in this thing

01:21.760 --> 01:23.280
because I like to run lots of VMs.

01:23.280 --> 01:24.360
And I have multiple disks.

01:24.360 --> 01:26.220
I have a dedicated disk for my home.

01:26.220 --> 01:29.640
A dedicated disk for my root and a dedicated disk

01:29.640 --> 01:32.320
for my VMs and a dedicated disk for my steam games

01:32.320 --> 01:33.960
and also my sync folders.

01:33.960 --> 01:36.080
That's the way to go, man.

01:36.080 --> 01:37.240
It's pretty great.

01:37.240 --> 01:39.160
Now it's fun when you're building a desktop

01:39.160 --> 01:43.200
but it like really matters when you're building a server.

01:43.200 --> 01:45.420
And that's why it's really great that we are joined

01:45.420 --> 01:48.580
by a very special guest today who helps the community

01:48.580 --> 01:53.000
figure these things out with his website, serverbuilds.net.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.760
JDM, welcome to the show.

01:54.760 --> 01:55.880
Hey guys, thanks for having me.

01:55.880 --> 01:56.840
Man, thanks for being here.

01:56.840 --> 02:00.060
And for those that are not familiar with serverbuilds.net,

02:00.060 --> 02:01.520
can you give them like the elevator pitch

02:01.520 --> 02:02.520
on what the website is?

02:02.520 --> 02:05.800
Well, our website's a little stale at the moment

02:05.800 --> 02:08.600
but the forums are really where it's happening.

02:08.600 --> 02:09.600
That's where the action is.

02:09.600 --> 02:11.760
Yeah, the forums and the Discord.

02:11.760 --> 02:16.640
So we got almost, probably what I would say 10K users

02:16.640 --> 02:19.200
like including Reddit, Discord,

02:19.200 --> 02:21.140
but it's a very community focused,

02:22.440 --> 02:24.200
well, for lack of a better word, community.

02:24.200 --> 02:27.360
So I try to engage as much as possible

02:27.360 --> 02:31.560
but anyone can write a guide and post it on the forum.

02:31.560 --> 02:33.600
And then if it's good enough, like we'll help you edit it

02:33.600 --> 02:35.520
and it can become featured.

02:35.520 --> 02:39.640
But mostly I write guides on hardware getting used

02:39.640 --> 02:43.060
or enterprise off-lease hardware.

02:43.060 --> 02:45.160
Sometimes it's not even used, sometimes it's brand new.

02:45.160 --> 02:48.840
It's just old stock, but it's all very affordable.

02:48.840 --> 02:51.920
And I basically just try to make it easy

02:51.920 --> 02:55.200
if you're like used to building gaming PCs and whatnot

02:55.200 --> 02:58.020
and you wanna build a server, it's just as easy as that.

02:58.020 --> 03:00.920
Yeah, but you do help kind of give people an area

03:00.920 --> 03:03.040
to focus in and some of these guides are pretty useful

03:03.040 --> 03:05.400
because I think Alex, you've used one of them in the past

03:05.400 --> 03:06.460
to build your setup.

03:06.460 --> 03:07.400
I certainly have.

03:07.400 --> 03:09.560
So yes, hi JDM, welcome to the show.

03:09.560 --> 03:10.400
Thanks.

03:10.400 --> 03:12.720
I built when I immigrated a brand new server

03:12.720 --> 03:16.120
and I built your anniversary,

03:16.120 --> 03:18.400
I think it was 1.0 build at that point,

03:18.400 --> 03:23.400
which has a pair of dual LGA 2011 Xeons,

03:23.400 --> 03:27.680
128 gigabytes of RAM, 100 plus terabytes

03:27.680 --> 03:32.680
in the Rosewill LSV4500, I think case.

03:33.140 --> 03:36.520
And that was all about a couple of thousand dollars.

03:36.520 --> 03:39.880
So, I mean, the bang for buck that you and your site

03:39.880 --> 03:42.960
enabled me to get was just astonishing really.

03:42.960 --> 03:46.280
That power, you know, five years ago would have cost

03:46.280 --> 03:50.520
three, four, five times what it cost me a year ago.

03:50.520 --> 03:52.400
The CPUs that you have,

03:52.400 --> 03:53.800
if you look at the retail price of them,

03:53.800 --> 03:57.280
they could be in the 2000 to $3,000 each

03:57.280 --> 03:59.320
back when they were brand new,

03:59.320 --> 04:03.160
but now you can get them on eBay for maybe a couple

04:03.160 --> 04:04.880
of hundred bucks, $150.

04:04.880 --> 04:07.800
I think the magic sauce really that you have,

04:07.800 --> 04:11.080
there's a few tools that you kind of share with the community.

04:11.080 --> 04:14.000
There's an absolutely awesome spreadsheet,

04:14.000 --> 04:16.360
the CPU Compendium spreadsheet that you have,

04:17.240 --> 04:21.200
which lists every single Xeon in that era

04:21.200 --> 04:24.680
and compares the price to performance, to TDP,

04:24.680 --> 04:27.480
to, you know, everything that you're trying to think about

04:27.480 --> 04:28.840
when you're building one of these servers.

04:28.840 --> 04:33.280
So stuff like idle power draw is obviously quite important

04:33.280 --> 04:36.800
for a 24 seven home based box, but then, you know,

04:36.800 --> 04:38.880
Plex transcoding performance might be important

04:38.880 --> 04:41.100
for some people, or, you know,

04:41.100 --> 04:42.920
there's just a whole bunch of stuff that's in there

04:42.920 --> 04:43.840
that's just really great.

04:43.840 --> 04:46.280
And one of the things you actually helped me with,

04:46.280 --> 04:47.400
I don't know if you remember this,

04:47.400 --> 04:49.280
about six to eight months ago,

04:49.280 --> 04:52.160
was I was having some temperature issues in my build

04:53.440 --> 04:55.700
and I was posting on the forums,

04:55.700 --> 04:57.440
or I think it was Discord actually,

04:57.440 --> 05:00.200
with, you know, all the pictures and things like that.

05:00.200 --> 05:03.120
And it turned out that the fan configuration I had in my box,

05:03.120 --> 05:05.960
I just didn't even look, I just bought Noctua's

05:05.960 --> 05:08.120
just because that's what I've always done.

05:08.120 --> 05:09.960
And then you told me, no, Alex,

05:09.960 --> 05:14.800
you need high static pressure fans because of XYZ.

05:14.800 --> 05:18.000
I was already to buy a new case at this point, you know?

05:18.000 --> 05:20.180
And I changed the fan configuration based on your advice

05:20.180 --> 05:22.680
and you saved me probably another few hundred dollars.

05:22.680 --> 05:24.480
So thanks for that.

05:24.480 --> 05:25.320
Oh, absolutely.

05:25.320 --> 05:29.800
And we try to do a full service recommendation

05:29.800 --> 05:32.720
where if you're in that situation and you're like,

05:32.720 --> 05:34.280
okay, I've got the hardware,

05:34.280 --> 05:37.580
but I don't have these little tiny details fleshed out,

05:37.580 --> 05:39.720
I try to do my best to pay attention to that.

05:39.720 --> 05:43.080
And say like, okay, well, if you're in a server chassis

05:43.080 --> 05:45.840
and you do need those high static pressure fans,

05:45.840 --> 05:48.000
here's not only the ones you should buy,

05:48.000 --> 05:53.000
but here's those fans compared to what else is on the market

05:54.120 --> 05:55.480
and here's why they're a better value.

05:55.480 --> 05:57.360
You can get like, you know, for the ones that you got,

05:57.360 --> 05:59.640
they were, I don't know, five pack for 28 bucks

05:59.640 --> 06:00.640
or something like that.

06:00.640 --> 06:03.520
Yeah, they weren't really even very expensive, so.

06:03.520 --> 06:05.360
Right, and sometimes it's just about

06:05.360 --> 06:07.320
buying the correct hardware

06:07.320 --> 06:09.920
and it doesn't always have to be the most expensive.

06:09.920 --> 06:11.880
And especially for servers, I mean,

06:11.880 --> 06:14.760
why did you go that route?

06:14.760 --> 06:16.240
Like, I know you came across it and all that,

06:16.240 --> 06:18.760
but what was so attractive to you about that

06:18.760 --> 06:21.280
versus going for something more modern?

06:21.280 --> 06:23.480
I like the idea I had dual 10 gig on board

06:23.480 --> 06:27.760
as well as IPMI and dual Xeon is obviously quite attractive

06:27.760 --> 06:30.320
from a Plex transcoding perspective.

06:30.320 --> 06:32.240
My use case was that I wanted to be able to run

06:32.240 --> 06:34.080
a couple of Kubernetes clusters at once

06:34.080 --> 06:37.200
in addition to my normal server workloads, that is.

06:37.200 --> 06:39.880
I needed to be able to have at least 96 gigs of RAM,

06:39.880 --> 06:41.600
but I went for 128 in the end

06:41.600 --> 06:43.560
because I'm a baller and why not?

06:43.560 --> 06:48.360
That board actually tops out at like 512 or 768.

06:48.360 --> 06:50.560
Yeah, it's kind of insane what you can get

06:50.560 --> 06:51.880
and it just blew my mind.

06:51.880 --> 06:54.720
I mean, I kind of, because I was emigrating,

06:54.720 --> 06:56.840
I didn't really have a lot of time to, you know,

06:56.840 --> 07:00.640
dig into the minutia like you and your team obviously do.

07:00.640 --> 07:03.560
And it was just really helpful to have all that information

07:03.560 --> 07:05.160
in one place and be able to say, right,

07:05.160 --> 07:07.240
if I buy this board, I'm gonna expect roughly

07:07.240 --> 07:09.760
this performance, it's gonna all work together.

07:09.760 --> 07:11.840
And you were actually lining up vendors as well.

07:11.840 --> 07:14.800
So I bought from, I think the IT Mart at that point.

07:14.800 --> 07:17.520
We've been trying our best to work with a lot

07:17.520 --> 07:21.880
of these vendors that do either off lease servers

07:21.880 --> 07:25.400
or they're like resellers or refurbishers

07:25.400 --> 07:29.520
and there's a ton on eBay, but they're all very professional

07:29.520 --> 07:33.800
in the business of reselling server hardware.

07:33.800 --> 07:36.000
And you can get some really interesting stuff

07:36.000 --> 07:38.800
that the public just doesn't even know about.

07:38.800 --> 07:41.680
For example, like you said, there's a vendor

07:41.680 --> 07:43.360
that we do group buys with,

07:43.360 --> 07:48.360
and he had a few 6.4 terabyte NVME drives.

07:48.960 --> 07:52.760
They went for, I think, $600 a piece on group buy.

07:52.760 --> 07:55.360
And if you think about that for a second,

07:55.360 --> 07:58.240
consumer NVME drives, your two terabyte brand news,

07:58.240 --> 08:00.720
maybe 270 bucks.

08:00.720 --> 08:03.640
So if you're getting 6.4 terabytes for 600

08:03.640 --> 08:05.360
and then the best part is that it has

08:05.360 --> 08:08.480
a 60 petabyte write endurance.

08:08.480 --> 08:10.360
So that drives never gonna die.

08:10.360 --> 08:12.480
Oh, could you ping me next time that comes up?

08:12.480 --> 08:13.800
Right?

08:13.800 --> 08:14.640
Absolutely.

08:14.640 --> 08:16.920
I mean, that's the kind of thing that you would see

08:16.920 --> 08:17.760
in the discord.

08:17.760 --> 08:20.520
And I mean, maybe that was a little bit of a rare deal,

08:20.520 --> 08:23.480
but stuff like that does come up.

08:23.480 --> 08:25.120
We try to establish that relationship

08:25.120 --> 08:26.840
because these vendors, they don't know

08:26.840 --> 08:28.560
that there's communities out there for that.

08:28.560 --> 08:32.320
They're just selling to businesses and things like that

08:32.320 --> 08:34.920
where if I can establish the link between the vendors

08:34.920 --> 08:37.760
and this large community that's still growing,

08:37.760 --> 08:40.480
I mean, it's growing at a fantastic rate

08:40.480 --> 08:41.640
that helps everyone.

08:41.640 --> 08:44.400
I think what you do so nicely is you bridge the gap

08:44.400 --> 08:47.520
between Googling, I want to build my own server

08:47.520 --> 08:49.880
and actually having a functional list of parts

08:49.880 --> 08:52.440
that all work together, which is just really nice

08:52.440 --> 08:53.760
at different price points as well

08:53.760 --> 08:55.960
and different performance points.

08:55.960 --> 08:57.760
So we've talked about the anniversary build.

08:57.760 --> 09:01.680
That's kind of like the no compromises build almost.

09:01.680 --> 09:04.040
There's another one that you guys do called the NAS killer.

09:04.040 --> 09:05.200
Tell us about that one.

09:05.200 --> 09:08.120
The home NAS is something that's becoming very,

09:08.120 --> 09:08.960
very popular.

09:08.960 --> 09:10.560
You can run a bunch of applications on it.

09:10.560 --> 09:12.080
You throw a bunch of hard drives in

09:12.080 --> 09:14.280
and you've got local storage that you can serve

09:14.280 --> 09:17.360
to your network and it's nice to have

09:17.360 --> 09:19.280
because you don't have to rely on the cloud.

09:19.280 --> 09:21.480
You can have it local, it's fast

09:21.480 --> 09:22.960
and overall it's a great idea.

09:22.960 --> 09:27.960
However, companies like Synology or QNAP or WD,

09:29.400 --> 09:31.560
they have their own little NAS devices,

09:31.560 --> 09:33.840
but really they end up being very expensive

09:33.840 --> 09:35.280
for the hardware you get.

09:35.280 --> 09:38.840
And so the NAS killer was my vision

09:38.840 --> 09:43.480
of how you can build a NAS for the same price or cheaper

09:43.480 --> 09:46.520
and have the hardware be much more powerful.

09:46.520 --> 09:50.600
So I found some early E3 Xeons

09:50.600 --> 09:55.280
and the pass mark was like 7,000 compared to,

09:56.360 --> 09:59.560
even the high end Synology is only like 1900 pass mark.

09:59.560 --> 10:02.480
So you're getting four times the performance.

10:02.480 --> 10:06.160
You can build it yourself and then you have anywhere

10:06.160 --> 10:08.600
from eight to 15 to 30 drive bays,

10:08.600 --> 10:11.400
just depending on what your setup's like,

10:11.400 --> 10:13.640
but really the NAS killer series has evolved

10:13.640 --> 10:15.480
and currently we're on NAS killer four,

10:15.480 --> 10:17.840
NAS killer five is in the works.

10:17.840 --> 10:20.640
The hardware is getting newer and newer as time passes

10:20.640 --> 10:23.520
and stuff starts to go again, like off lease.

10:23.520 --> 10:26.560
So you start to see the hardware,

10:26.560 --> 10:28.360
even though it's a little bit older,

10:28.360 --> 10:30.920
starts to come through and prices start to drop

10:30.920 --> 10:32.320
a little bit more.

10:32.320 --> 10:36.120
But yeah, the NAS killer is our most popular guide

10:36.120 --> 10:38.800
and I think there's like 30,000 views or something

10:38.800 --> 10:41.000
is just on the forum post alone.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.520
But yeah, it's just designed to be the all in one home NAS.

10:44.520 --> 10:46.360
You can run any software you want,

10:46.360 --> 10:49.120
but it's designed to give you that starting point.

10:49.120 --> 10:50.440
Now you're gonna make me wanna build one of those,

10:50.440 --> 10:52.600
but I can't figure out how to fit it in the RV.

10:52.600 --> 10:54.320
I could make that work for sure.

10:54.320 --> 10:57.240
Do you have any advice for anyone who's looking to build

10:57.240 --> 11:01.680
a low power box that's gonna be on 24 seven?

11:01.680 --> 11:05.040
So I mean, something that could form the basis

11:05.040 --> 11:08.600
of a self hosted router, for example,

11:08.600 --> 11:11.200
running open sense or PF sense, something like that.

11:11.200 --> 11:14.800
What's really interesting about computer hardware,

11:14.800 --> 11:18.560
especially I would say within the past five to seven years,

11:18.560 --> 11:20.760
performance hasn't increased a whole lot.

11:20.760 --> 11:24.960
So like IPC instructions per clock, yes, it's improving,

11:24.960 --> 11:28.320
but really where the improvements have come about

11:28.320 --> 11:30.760
is through power usage.

11:30.760 --> 11:34.800
If you look at the modern 1151 socket from Intel,

11:34.800 --> 11:38.760
for example, Intel's eighth and ninth gen CPUs,

11:38.760 --> 11:40.200
they're extremely power efficient.

11:40.200 --> 11:43.360
For example, the HP 290,

11:43.360 --> 11:46.760
it's a little like all in one consumer grade device,

11:46.760 --> 11:48.360
but it idles at like seven Watts

11:48.360 --> 11:52.680
and there's a 54 watt TDP seller on it.

11:52.680 --> 11:55.320
And that's the TDP, not the power usage.

11:55.320 --> 11:57.920
But at idle, it's only about seven Watts.

11:57.920 --> 11:59.840
I use one for my PF sense.

11:59.840 --> 12:02.160
And I think that box was only a hundred dollars

12:02.160 --> 12:03.660
on eBay shipped.

12:03.660 --> 12:06.000
But we just look for like little deals like that.

12:06.000 --> 12:10.360
And it really just depends on what your needs are.

12:10.360 --> 12:11.840
But like you said, for PF sense,

12:11.840 --> 12:13.880
it's not gonna be super high.

12:13.880 --> 12:16.840
PF sense or for home assistant or something like that,

12:16.840 --> 12:19.480
that's just gonna be always on.

12:19.480 --> 12:21.720
You know, if you don't wanna build a huge box like I did

12:21.720 --> 12:24.520
and run them all as VMs with pass through

12:24.520 --> 12:26.000
and stuff like that,

12:26.000 --> 12:28.120
it's a really good idea to consider

12:28.120 --> 12:32.680
one of these smaller lower power x86 based systems

12:32.680 --> 12:35.920
because, you know, legacy software is gonna support it.

12:35.920 --> 12:39.400
And one of the issues with using the Raspberry Pi

12:39.400 --> 12:41.180
for all of this type of stuff

12:41.180 --> 12:44.200
is that you have to hang everything off the USB bus,

12:44.200 --> 12:45.280
number one.

12:45.280 --> 12:49.420
And then number two, every ARM CPU is different.

12:49.420 --> 12:51.320
So there's no guarantee that

12:51.320 --> 12:53.400
just because a vendor says they support ARM

12:53.400 --> 12:54.920
through, you know, a Docker container

12:54.920 --> 12:56.120
or something like that,

12:56.120 --> 12:57.680
there's no guarantee it's actually gonna run

12:57.680 --> 12:58.600
on your setup.

12:58.600 --> 13:00.920
So, I mean, that could be proved by

13:00.920 --> 13:03.440
the recent Raspberry Pi 4.

13:03.440 --> 13:05.280
And if you look at the software support for that

13:05.280 --> 13:08.040
compared to the three and any model below,

13:08.040 --> 13:09.160
it's totally different.

13:09.160 --> 13:12.600
The Pi 4 went through some more significant changes

13:12.600 --> 13:14.800
with the video that are for the better

13:14.800 --> 13:16.660
and a couple of other areas with the bootloader,

13:16.660 --> 13:18.220
which has caused that lag.

13:18.220 --> 13:19.920
But the two to three series,

13:19.920 --> 13:22.080
and there was lots of iterations in between there,

13:22.080 --> 13:24.120
was pretty successful.

13:24.120 --> 13:26.360
I look at it like this, Alex,

13:26.360 --> 13:28.760
it's early days still with the platform

13:28.760 --> 13:30.640
and like any early adoption,

13:30.640 --> 13:35.640
there's a series of trade-offs, but also benefits.

13:35.760 --> 13:39.020
Like for example, the USB bus,

13:39.020 --> 13:41.700
it is a limitation of the Raspberry Pi platform,

13:41.700 --> 13:44.400
but there are several small board computer platforms

13:44.400 --> 13:49.120
that now either have eMMC in addition to PCI

13:49.120 --> 13:50.760
or SATA even.

13:50.760 --> 13:52.360
And then of course with the Raspberry Pi 4,

13:52.360 --> 13:53.800
a guy like yourself,

13:53.800 --> 13:55.500
you really could do all of the storage

13:55.500 --> 13:56.560
over the gigabit ethernet,

13:56.560 --> 14:00.120
which is now on its own dedicated connection.

14:00.120 --> 14:02.280
You know, you could iSCSI everything really.

14:02.280 --> 14:04.440
I might have bought a Raspberry Pi this week.

14:04.440 --> 14:06.020
I think you should try using the network

14:06.020 --> 14:07.480
as your primary storage location.

14:07.480 --> 14:09.140
I think that'd be an interesting experiment.

14:09.140 --> 14:10.480
It's in England.

14:10.480 --> 14:12.740
So I bought one of those brand new eight gigabyte

14:12.740 --> 14:17.740
Raspberry Pi 4s to use as a remote ZFS storage endpoint.

14:17.740 --> 14:20.020
I was gonna ask if you got the eight gig one.

14:20.020 --> 14:20.860
Yeah, I did.

14:20.860 --> 14:23.020
I mean, I really don't need eight gigs on a Pi,

14:23.020 --> 14:24.420
but why not?

14:24.420 --> 14:26.900
Why not have the headroom for future tasks?

14:26.900 --> 14:28.740
Because that means in the future,

14:28.740 --> 14:31.580
you could also throw something on there like sync thing.

14:31.580 --> 14:33.460
You have plenty of overhead

14:33.460 --> 14:35.620
for all kinds of additional applications

14:35.620 --> 14:36.940
that are just a container away.

14:36.940 --> 14:38.860
I mean, it's not necessarily a bad idea.

14:38.860 --> 14:42.180
And I would also just say in my hands-on experience

14:42.180 --> 14:46.660
with say the Pine 64, Rock Pro 64 and the Pi 4,

14:46.660 --> 14:51.220
I could run everything in every container on either.

14:51.220 --> 14:53.700
I didn't run any particular compatibilities.

14:53.700 --> 14:55.900
The OS kind of abstracts that aspect.

14:55.900 --> 14:58.460
Once you have the core OS,

14:58.460 --> 15:00.540
as long as it's a mainstream Linux,

15:00.540 --> 15:04.420
like Archbase or Debian base, you're pretty much good.

15:04.420 --> 15:07.100
Yeah, cause you were talking about Raspberry Pi OS

15:07.100 --> 15:10.820
for a little bit on LUP 357 and how they've,

15:10.820 --> 15:14.500
I mean, they've just renamed Raspberry into Raspberry Pi OS.

15:14.500 --> 15:18.260
And talk a little bit about why you don't really rate it

15:18.260 --> 15:19.740
versus say an Ubuntu.

15:19.740 --> 15:21.780
Well, that's a good question because I think the,

15:21.780 --> 15:24.020
for me and it's something maybe I haven't made

15:24.020 --> 15:27.020
implicitly clear on this show is the transition

15:27.020 --> 15:29.340
for treating the Raspberry Pi a little more seriously

15:29.340 --> 15:32.460
came when Canonical announced that they were going to make it

15:32.460 --> 15:34.820
a first-class Linux platform for them.

15:34.820 --> 15:38.180
Like it's actually got staff that are working

15:38.180 --> 15:40.580
to support future Raspberry Pis.

15:40.580 --> 15:43.260
And that resonated with me pretty strongly

15:43.260 --> 15:45.700
because the Raspberry Pi models tend to stick around

15:45.700 --> 15:46.980
for at least five years.

15:46.980 --> 15:49.700
You know, you can still buy older Pis.

15:49.700 --> 15:53.260
And Ubuntu LTS is a professional grade operating system.

15:53.260 --> 15:55.540
It might not be everyone's favorite,

15:55.540 --> 15:57.620
but it's a professional operating system

15:57.620 --> 16:01.340
that is designed to run in production environments.

16:01.340 --> 16:04.340
Raspbian to me, or I'm sorry, Raspberry Pi OS,

16:04.340 --> 16:06.940
there are just formerly known as Raspbian.

16:06.940 --> 16:07.780
I think it's great.

16:07.780 --> 16:08.980
And I think it's really well suited

16:08.980 --> 16:10.820
for new users of the platform.

16:10.820 --> 16:12.260
And I think it's really well suited

16:12.260 --> 16:13.940
for people who want a lightweight desktop

16:13.940 --> 16:15.380
with a web browser.

16:15.380 --> 16:18.580
But for those of us that want to use it as a home server

16:18.580 --> 16:21.420
or like a backup server, even like in your case, Alex,

16:21.420 --> 16:23.100
which is a great use case,

16:23.100 --> 16:24.740
I think you need something on there

16:24.740 --> 16:27.020
that is a little more production grade.

16:27.020 --> 16:30.260
And just to the point of low power consumption,

16:30.260 --> 16:33.140
just keep in mind that with low power consumption

16:33.140 --> 16:36.780
generally comes low performance as well.

16:36.780 --> 16:38.620
And it may be relatively higher performance

16:38.620 --> 16:40.580
compared to another model.

16:40.580 --> 16:42.780
But if you compare it to, for example,

16:42.780 --> 16:44.980
a low power consumption Xeon

16:44.980 --> 16:47.500
that has eight cores, 16 threads,

16:47.500 --> 16:49.220
Raspberry Pi is never gonna touch it.

16:49.220 --> 16:52.260
Even though maybe the power consumption's,

16:52.260 --> 16:56.620
let's say 50 watts at idle on the Xeon,

16:56.620 --> 16:58.660
yes, it's more power for sure,

16:58.660 --> 17:01.900
but how much more compute horsepower do you have?

17:01.900 --> 17:04.580
Here's a really interesting consideration though.

17:04.580 --> 17:07.620
So my sister is not a techie.

17:07.620 --> 17:10.500
In fact, she works in pharmaceuticals.

17:10.500 --> 17:14.900
And when the Pi for eight gig came out this weekend,

17:14.900 --> 17:17.780
I ordered one and sent it to her.

17:17.780 --> 17:19.460
She put it together,

17:19.460 --> 17:22.060
plugged in the USB hard drive in half an hour

17:22.060 --> 17:23.780
over a Skype call.

17:24.660 --> 17:26.420
I can't imagine asking her

17:26.420 --> 17:29.660
to put together a remote Xeon system for me.

17:29.660 --> 17:34.020
I know that building computers is just like adult Lego,

17:34.020 --> 17:36.700
but I've been doing it since I was 13.

17:36.700 --> 17:38.660
She's never even so much as, I mean,

17:38.660 --> 17:39.500
when her Mac breaks,

17:39.500 --> 17:41.900
she goes to the Apple store and takes it there.

17:41.900 --> 17:43.660
It's someone else's problem.

17:43.660 --> 17:46.100
So the Pi, for me at least,

17:46.100 --> 17:48.820
fulfills a really great need of being like a computer

17:48.820 --> 17:53.260
in a box that I can still mostly own every piece of,

17:53.260 --> 17:54.900
like I can choose the case,

17:54.900 --> 17:57.900
I can choose the bootloader and that kind of thing

17:57.900 --> 18:01.220
without having to install a CPU or a power supply

18:01.220 --> 18:02.260
or something like that.

18:02.260 --> 18:03.100
I totally agree.

18:03.100 --> 18:07.060
And I think that it absolutely has a purpose

18:07.060 --> 18:10.460
and I'm not against a Pi or anything like that,

18:10.460 --> 18:13.620
but you do have to consider that it's still not x86.

18:13.620 --> 18:16.660
So if there's applications that you wanna run there,

18:16.660 --> 18:18.460
you do run into that hard limitation.

18:18.460 --> 18:19.460
I think that's very fair.

18:19.460 --> 18:21.660
You have to go into it with the acknowledgement

18:21.660 --> 18:24.500
that there's just not the level of software compatibility

18:24.500 --> 18:26.020
to both the point you guys have both made

18:26.020 --> 18:27.300
and I have to agree with.

18:27.300 --> 18:30.020
And you are probably not gonna get

18:30.020 --> 18:31.700
quite the right bang for your buck.

18:31.700 --> 18:33.180
I wonder though,

18:33.180 --> 18:36.220
because I run three right now is what I have remaining,

18:36.220 --> 18:38.700
Raspberry Pis that are currently running

18:38.700 --> 18:43.700
and even with the overhead of being inverted from DC power,

18:43.700 --> 18:48.100
I think all three of them are maybe drawing 30 Watts.

18:48.100 --> 18:50.500
I'm not sure cause it's mixed in with my router,

18:50.500 --> 18:52.900
my switch and a wifi access point in there,

18:52.900 --> 18:56.060
but the draw is so substantially low

18:56.060 --> 19:00.140
that I can run them for days off the battery power.

19:00.140 --> 19:00.980
That's pretty great.

19:00.980 --> 19:03.900
Yeah, so Chris, your server seat,

19:03.900 --> 19:06.300
I think that's what we're gonna dub it now.

19:06.300 --> 19:08.500
JDM had potentially some ideas

19:08.500 --> 19:11.980
for what we could do to maybe replace,

19:11.980 --> 19:13.460
I don't know if we can replace the Pi,

19:13.460 --> 19:15.540
obviously you love yours,

19:15.540 --> 19:18.220
but yeah, maybe we could do something a bit different.

19:18.220 --> 19:19.820
I'm open to the idea, I gotta be honest.

19:19.820 --> 19:21.660
I think the Raspberry Pi would be a good

19:21.660 --> 19:24.540
like one year experiment right now,

19:24.540 --> 19:27.860
but I really wish at the end of the day,

19:27.860 --> 19:31.900
all of this was virtualized, that everything was in a VM.

19:31.900 --> 19:34.540
So I'm trying to stage a Pi intervention here, JDM,

19:34.540 --> 19:35.380
help me out.

19:35.380 --> 19:40.380
So what has built in KVM, a battery backup

19:41.100 --> 19:44.580
and is X86 and low power?

19:44.580 --> 19:45.420
Do you know?

19:45.420 --> 19:46.900
A ghost.

19:46.900 --> 19:49.100
I was gonna say, it sounds like a SuperNUC.

19:50.180 --> 19:51.140
It's a laptop.

19:51.140 --> 19:52.380
Oh, very fair.

19:52.380 --> 19:53.900
Yeah, okay, all right.

19:53.900 --> 19:57.500
So I have actually found great success

19:57.500 --> 20:02.500
using even low end consumer refurbished laptops

20:02.500 --> 20:04.420
for situations like yours,

20:04.420 --> 20:08.020
because a lot of times they have NVME slots.

20:08.020 --> 20:09.980
So you can have one or two NVME slots,

20:09.980 --> 20:12.660
even on like, let's say a $300 laptop.

20:12.660 --> 20:15.460
And maybe it has like an Intel Pentium Gold,

20:16.500 --> 20:21.500
I believe the model is like the G5405 or something like that.

20:21.540 --> 20:24.260
It's a two core, four thread, it's got Intel quick sync.

20:24.260 --> 20:25.820
So if you wanna do Plex transcoding,

20:25.820 --> 20:28.820
you can do 15 trans codes easily.

20:28.820 --> 20:32.700
It's got an X86 CPU, so you can run Linux,

20:32.700 --> 20:33.540
you can run Windows,

20:33.540 --> 20:35.580
you can run basically anything you want.

20:36.620 --> 20:39.180
You can do 16, 32 gig of RAM,

20:39.180 --> 20:42.220
and it's got ethernet wifi,

20:42.220 --> 20:44.020
again, built in battery backup.

20:44.020 --> 20:45.380
You can leave the lid closed,

20:45.380 --> 20:47.780
tuck it away somewhere on a shelf.

20:47.780 --> 20:49.660
That screams to me, laptop.

20:49.660 --> 20:53.060
You know, I didn't expect this line.

20:53.060 --> 20:54.460
I gotta say, that's pretty interesting.

20:54.460 --> 20:56.500
Did you have a specific laptop in mind?

20:57.540 --> 21:00.180
The ones that come on eBay that I've been eyeing

21:00.180 --> 21:01.340
and I've used personally,

21:01.340 --> 21:03.980
like right now at my home,

21:03.980 --> 21:06.860
I have an LTE network that's completely separate.

21:06.860 --> 21:09.900
It's a, I kind of jokingly call it a PLAN.

21:09.900 --> 21:12.780
It's a physical LAN, it's not a VLAN,

21:12.780 --> 21:14.620
it's totally separate.

21:14.620 --> 21:17.940
But right now I'm running that off of a router OS

21:17.940 --> 21:21.020
on a Lenovo,

21:21.020 --> 21:22.700
I have to look at the exact model number.

21:22.700 --> 21:23.940
Maybe you can put it in the show notes,

21:23.940 --> 21:25.500
but it's just a Lenovo.

21:25.500 --> 21:27.300
Like I said, it's got the Pentium Gold,

21:27.300 --> 21:31.220
and then it runs a USB LTE connection,

21:31.220 --> 21:33.900
and that is just for my smart home devices,

21:33.900 --> 21:37.500
so it's totally separate from my regular LAN.

21:37.500 --> 21:39.460
But you could do something similar

21:39.460 --> 21:41.380
where if you wanna run Docker

21:41.380 --> 21:44.300
and containerize everything on the laptop,

21:44.300 --> 21:45.140
you could do that.

21:45.140 --> 21:46.940
Yeah, I was thinking the ThinkPad.

21:46.940 --> 21:49.060
Yeah, and the other advantage

21:49.060 --> 21:51.180
is if I have to go into crash cart mode,

21:51.180 --> 21:52.780
it has a built-in screen and keyboard.

21:52.780 --> 21:53.780
Absolutely.

21:53.780 --> 21:58.260
And that has saved my butt quite a few times,

21:58.260 --> 22:00.740
and especially in your situation,

22:00.740 --> 22:02.540
leave the lid closed, leave it plugged in,

22:02.540 --> 22:05.340
and then you can actually run it off of a UPS

22:05.340 --> 22:07.220
or whatever battery you have,

22:07.220 --> 22:09.460
and then you also have the laptop's internal battery.

22:09.460 --> 22:11.980
So the possibilities are endless,

22:11.980 --> 22:13.820
and you obviously don't have to go that route.

22:13.820 --> 22:15.340
You could go for a NUC.

22:15.340 --> 22:16.820
Those are a little bit more expensive

22:16.820 --> 22:19.300
for the performance you get, actually.

22:19.300 --> 22:21.140
But again, you don't have the screen

22:21.140 --> 22:22.980
and KVM and all that.

22:22.980 --> 22:23.820
Right?

22:23.820 --> 22:25.260
I mean, it's hard to argue with a used ThinkPad

22:25.260 --> 22:27.740
because honestly, it's still gonna be more powerful

22:27.740 --> 22:28.580
than the Raspberry Pi.

22:28.580 --> 22:30.900
And what I'm using these Pis for

22:30.900 --> 22:32.860
is gonna work great on a laptop

22:32.860 --> 22:35.980
if it's just a headless Linux with KVM.

22:35.980 --> 22:39.820
Home Assistant, of course, Plex, obviously.

22:39.820 --> 22:41.700
SyncThing's a big deal for me.

22:41.700 --> 22:44.980
I have a very simple Markdown viewer application

22:44.980 --> 22:46.420
that I like to use.

22:46.420 --> 22:47.820
Those things will be no problem.

22:47.820 --> 22:48.860
The one that's tricky,

22:48.860 --> 22:51.300
and I don't know exactly what to do with, is Shinobi,

22:51.300 --> 22:53.380
because that's a lot of disk I.O.,

22:53.380 --> 22:54.900
and it's a lot of network I.O.,

22:54.900 --> 22:56.680
and Shinobi's one of those applications

22:56.680 --> 22:59.300
that just wants to have the entire OS,

22:59.300 --> 23:00.800
which either means I gotta virtualize it,

23:00.800 --> 23:02.820
or I gotta put it on dedicated hardware.

23:02.820 --> 23:05.180
Could you give me a quick rundown of Shinobi and what the...

23:05.180 --> 23:09.820
Yeah, it's basically just a closed-circuit,

23:09.820 --> 23:13.220
self-hosted capture system for RTSP camera feed.

23:13.220 --> 23:15.680
So I have a bunch of Wwise cameras

23:15.680 --> 23:17.020
that have a firmware on them

23:17.020 --> 23:18.820
that just lets me capture the video off them

23:18.820 --> 23:19.940
directly over the network.

23:19.940 --> 23:23.140
And this thing provides recording of those videos

23:23.140 --> 23:24.940
and playback and viewing,

23:24.940 --> 23:26.540
kind of like a DVR system,

23:26.540 --> 23:27.860
and you can pull up all the feeds

23:27.860 --> 23:29.340
and look at them in a dashboard

23:29.340 --> 23:31.020
and cut out clips and segments.

23:31.020 --> 23:32.380
And it's great,

23:32.380 --> 23:34.700
because sometimes I take my RV in wild places

23:34.700 --> 23:36.660
and I wanna have surveillance when I'm not there,

23:36.660 --> 23:38.100
or like right now it's in a shop

23:38.100 --> 23:41.240
and I wanna check in on what's going on every now and then.

23:41.240 --> 23:44.100
I found that it basically keeps the box

23:44.100 --> 23:45.940
totally busy the entire time.

23:45.940 --> 23:47.820
I don't wanna run two laptops.

23:47.820 --> 23:50.560
Well, okay, that's fair.

23:50.560 --> 23:52.580
Are you aware of what QuickSync is?

23:52.580 --> 23:54.220
Yeah, like Intel's built-in,

23:54.220 --> 23:57.780
improved H.264 encoding accelerator.

23:57.780 --> 24:02.620
Correct, and it's seen huge generational improvements.

24:02.620 --> 24:05.020
So this is something that's been very popular

24:05.020 --> 24:06.100
on serverbuilds.net.

24:06.100 --> 24:07.980
We've been recommending QuickSync

24:07.980 --> 24:10.300
transcoding boxes for Plex.

24:10.300 --> 24:15.140
A seventh-gen Celeron two-core can do 20 transcodes

24:15.140 --> 24:19.060
from 1080p to 1080p or 720p.

24:19.060 --> 24:19.900
Without us, what?

24:19.900 --> 24:21.580
Did you just say 20?

24:21.580 --> 24:22.880
20.

24:22.880 --> 24:24.300
Wow. Wow.

24:24.300 --> 24:28.160
Okay, so that's a scale I just did not appreciate.

24:28.160 --> 24:30.520
That's including laptop CPUs.

24:30.520 --> 24:32.700
The biggest performance increase

24:32.700 --> 24:34.020
that we've seen with QuickSync

24:34.020 --> 24:37.300
and through my testing has been generational.

24:37.300 --> 24:40.900
So you go from seventh-gen to eighth-gen to ninth-gen Intel,

24:40.900 --> 24:42.980
and currently we're on 10th-gen.

24:42.980 --> 24:45.420
You can get a 10th-gen Intel QuickSync laptop

24:45.420 --> 24:48.100
for about 300 bucks off of eBay,

24:48.100 --> 24:51.100
but it really doesn't really matter what the processor is.

24:51.100 --> 24:54.880
It's more about, again, the generation.

24:54.880 --> 24:58.780
There's some indication that faster processors are faster

24:58.780 --> 25:00.180
and do support more transcodes,

25:00.180 --> 25:05.000
but even the very baseline models support a ton.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.380
And you were talking about Shinobi.

25:07.380 --> 25:09.860
I'm not sure if that can leverage QuickSync.

25:09.860 --> 25:10.740
It might be able to,

25:10.740 --> 25:13.060
but I know that its competitor Blue Iris,

25:13.060 --> 25:15.020
which is a Windows-based application,

25:15.020 --> 25:16.660
can absolutely leverage QuickSync.

25:16.660 --> 25:18.900
And they just had a recent update

25:18.900 --> 25:23.900
where it almost completely removes the CPU usage entirely.

25:24.420 --> 25:28.620
I actually use QuickSync for Twitch streaming and recording.

25:28.620 --> 25:33.020
So I have an i9-9900K in my desktop,

25:33.020 --> 25:34.260
but if I were to use NVENC,

25:34.260 --> 25:36.900
which is NVIDIA's encoding on the GPU,

25:36.900 --> 25:38.700
I would lose a little bit of performance,

25:38.700 --> 25:41.380
and there is some indication that it does mess

25:41.380 --> 25:43.040
with your frame times a little bit.

25:43.040 --> 25:45.940
Whereas if I use the iGPU,

25:45.940 --> 25:48.820
which you do have to enable manually in your BIOS,

25:48.820 --> 25:52.440
but that iGPU is not doing anything.

25:52.440 --> 25:53.860
There's no monitors plugged into it or anything.

25:53.860 --> 25:55.100
It's just sitting there idle.

25:55.100 --> 26:00.100
So using it to encode a Twitch stream, for example,

26:00.220 --> 26:03.060
or a YouTube video, it works fantastically.

26:03.060 --> 26:06.060
The quality's amazing.

26:06.060 --> 26:09.900
It sees about 0.6% CPU usage while it's doing it.

26:09.900 --> 26:10.820
Wow.

26:10.820 --> 26:12.100
That's pretty great.

26:12.100 --> 26:13.780
Hardware circuitry, huh?

26:13.780 --> 26:15.100
Yeah, that is really great.

26:15.100 --> 26:16.740
And the other thing that's tricky for me

26:16.740 --> 26:19.600
along with this is heat, because it is in this seat.

26:20.860 --> 26:22.980
It's tricky to keep my ambient temperature

26:22.980 --> 26:25.540
below 80 degrees Fahrenheit.

26:25.540 --> 26:28.400
I wouldn't worry about it too much with the laptop.

26:28.400 --> 26:29.240
They can handle it.

26:29.240 --> 26:32.620
And like I said, QuickSync is very power efficient.

26:32.620 --> 26:35.860
It doesn't really require too much of a CPU resource.

26:35.860 --> 26:39.500
So for example, if you were to run that original setup

26:39.500 --> 26:41.320
like we were talking about,

26:41.320 --> 26:45.620
you could run Docker on Linux on the laptop.

26:45.620 --> 26:47.660
And then if you were to run Plex on it and you say,

26:47.660 --> 26:50.760
okay, we'll want Plex to leverage that CPU transcoding,

26:50.760 --> 26:55.760
you can actually pass just the iGPU through to Plex,

26:56.300 --> 26:59.940
through the Plex container and leverage it that way.

26:59.940 --> 27:03.180
But if you were to do a separate NVR build,

27:03.180 --> 27:04.220
like you said with Shinobi,

27:04.220 --> 27:06.720
or I would prefer Blueiris

27:06.720 --> 27:09.260
because I know it can leverage QuickSync very well.

27:09.260 --> 27:11.220
I would recommend a separate box.

27:11.220 --> 27:12.780
And maybe I just keep a Pi doing that

27:12.780 --> 27:13.740
and then move everything else.

27:13.740 --> 27:15.180
The laptop idea is a good one.

27:15.180 --> 27:17.740
I'm trying to ride the Raspberry Pis out for a year

27:17.740 --> 27:20.180
just as like a self-education program.

27:20.180 --> 27:22.060
And I know that a lot of people out there in the community

27:22.060 --> 27:22.900
are trying to use Pi.

27:22.900 --> 27:25.860
So I just, I wanna be well versed in them.

27:25.860 --> 27:27.620
And I definitely am now.

27:27.620 --> 27:29.500
I'm definitely deep.

27:29.500 --> 27:32.720
I'm like tribbles with the Raspberry Pis

27:32.720 --> 27:34.060
in the RV these days.

27:34.060 --> 27:36.660
But I could see this probably,

27:36.660 --> 27:37.820
I don't know, I'd have to go look back

27:37.820 --> 27:40.660
when we started this, see where my year mark is.

27:40.660 --> 27:41.980
I could see switching to this.

27:41.980 --> 27:44.020
This is how it goes with JDM, Chris.

27:44.020 --> 27:46.980
He has these little nuggets of ideas

27:46.980 --> 27:48.340
that kind of sprinkle into your brain.

27:48.340 --> 27:50.440
You go away for a couple of weeks and you're like,

27:50.440 --> 27:51.780
damn it, that's what I need to do.

27:51.780 --> 27:53.220
I need to buy an old ThinkPad now.

27:53.220 --> 27:57.300
Well, you know what's funny is for like a hot half a second,

27:57.300 --> 28:00.980
I think I glanced at an old laptop in the studio

28:00.980 --> 28:02.060
and I looked at that and I went,

28:02.060 --> 28:04.500
huh, I wonder if that'd work as a server.

28:04.500 --> 28:06.580
And then I thought, nah, not a laptop.

28:06.580 --> 28:09.300
Especially if you could power it directly off DC

28:09.300 --> 28:10.660
if you got the voltage right.

28:10.660 --> 28:13.660
Absolutely you can, they're mostly 19 volt DC.

28:14.660 --> 28:16.180
Yeah, I bet I could make it work.

28:16.180 --> 28:18.540
The other thing that I want you to think about,

28:18.540 --> 28:21.260
and I don't know, this is for me personally,

28:21.260 --> 28:22.780
this is the way I work.

28:22.780 --> 28:25.300
But you said that you're using Pis

28:25.300 --> 28:27.760
because you like to play and you like to learn

28:27.760 --> 28:30.260
and that's something you're trying to learn.

28:30.260 --> 28:32.620
For me, I don't like to play with things

28:32.620 --> 28:34.260
that I just want to play and work.

28:34.260 --> 28:35.820
Yeah, there is that, yeah.

28:35.820 --> 28:38.220
So if you can get your baseline set up

28:38.220 --> 28:40.340
where you've got your router virtualized

28:40.340 --> 28:44.220
and all of your services that you need to work work

28:44.220 --> 28:46.660
on like, let's say the laptop setup we're talking about

28:46.660 --> 28:49.700
or something else, then you would actually have

28:49.700 --> 28:51.740
more freedom to play with the Pis

28:51.740 --> 28:56.220
where you don't necessarily have that back of your head

28:56.220 --> 28:59.520
saying, oh, well, if I mess this up,

28:59.520 --> 29:01.620
then I need to redo everything.

29:01.620 --> 29:04.740
Yeah, there's advantages to,

29:04.740 --> 29:06.660
like I don't want to be too critical of the Pis

29:06.660 --> 29:09.480
because I'm impressed that the advantage to me

29:09.480 --> 29:11.660
diving into this and really using them

29:11.660 --> 29:13.940
is I truly am learning what they're capable of and not.

29:13.940 --> 29:18.320
And I have to say, they really have run pretty solidly.

29:18.320 --> 29:20.980
The biggest mistake I made early on was I used Raspbian

29:20.980 --> 29:22.880
and I had to rebuild a couple of things.

29:22.880 --> 29:25.580
But now I'm quite happy.

29:25.580 --> 29:28.380
In fact, having my storage on the USB bus

29:28.380 --> 29:29.920
hasn't really been an issue because I'm getting

29:29.920 --> 29:31.740
these Samsung T5 disks.

29:31.740 --> 29:34.380
They transfer it like 280 megabytes a second,

29:34.380 --> 29:36.240
which is as good as my wifi is gonna do

29:36.240 --> 29:37.940
for the Plex playback.

29:37.940 --> 29:40.700
So even the disk IO, I've been fairly happy with.

29:40.700 --> 29:42.780
And then I'm gonna also add in there because of the cost,

29:42.780 --> 29:45.620
what I'm doing now on this trip I'm taking

29:45.620 --> 29:50.100
is I've brought a cold Pi ready to go in a case all set up

29:50.100 --> 29:53.060
and I have them installed in Velcro

29:53.060 --> 29:54.500
to the inner walls of the seat.

29:54.500 --> 29:56.420
So if one of these Pis dies,

29:56.420 --> 29:59.420
I just grab the cold standby, literally just pull

29:59.420 --> 30:01.540
the one Velcroed in, pop the new one in,

30:01.540 --> 30:04.900
it has Velcro on it already, put all the same connections in

30:04.900 --> 30:06.740
and power it up, it's good to go.

30:06.740 --> 30:08.980
Oh, but cold Pi is not as tasty.

30:08.980 --> 30:10.060
It's true.

30:10.060 --> 30:14.300
But I do feel like I am constantly walking on eggshells.

30:14.300 --> 30:16.380
I will acknowledge that aspect of it.

30:16.380 --> 30:18.900
But that could also just be because it's such a new platform

30:18.900 --> 30:19.740
to me.

30:19.740 --> 30:22.220
Right, but I think that you would gain

30:22.220 --> 30:26.380
a lot more experience where you can sort of

30:26.380 --> 30:29.860
piecemeal implement things that you're testing with the Pi

30:29.860 --> 30:31.420
if you have a good backbone.

30:31.420 --> 30:34.260
Yeah, I could be riskier if it wasn't my production device.

30:34.260 --> 30:36.060
And that's the same reason I ended up splitting out

30:36.060 --> 30:36.900
my PFSense.

30:36.900 --> 30:38.780
I mean, I used to run it on top of Proxmox

30:38.780 --> 30:43.220
with a quad Intel gigabit NIC card in the main hypervisor

30:43.220 --> 30:44.980
in that anniversary build.

30:44.980 --> 30:48.580
I ended up building a separate PFSense box.

30:48.580 --> 30:50.740
I've since switched it to OpenSense,

30:50.740 --> 30:52.860
but I ended up building a separate box

30:52.860 --> 30:55.500
because I didn't want my internet to go down

30:55.500 --> 30:58.540
every time I rebooted my server, right?

30:58.540 --> 31:02.180
The uptime now is 115 days or something.

31:02.180 --> 31:05.540
But when it happens, or what was happening with me

31:05.540 --> 31:09.620
with Proxmox was I was getting hard lockups,

31:09.620 --> 31:11.500
kernel panics, basically.

31:11.500 --> 31:12.700
And so every time that happened,

31:12.700 --> 31:15.140
I had to walk down to the basement and push the button

31:15.140 --> 31:17.460
because IPMI wasn't working or something.

31:17.460 --> 31:19.100
It was completely weird.

31:19.100 --> 31:21.740
And I just ended up thinking, right,

31:21.740 --> 31:24.500
my internet needs to be separate from my server.

31:24.500 --> 31:26.500
That's just something that needs to happen.

31:26.500 --> 31:28.820
Part of building a home lab is identifying

31:28.820 --> 31:32.860
those key points of this needs to not fail.

31:32.860 --> 31:36.140
What do I need to do to make it perfectly reliable?

31:36.140 --> 31:37.860
And then on the other hand,

31:37.860 --> 31:40.140
what kind of hardware do I want to play with

31:40.140 --> 31:43.300
where I have that freedom and the flexibility?

31:43.300 --> 31:46.580
Yeah, a home lab, and this is a bugbear of Morgan, actually.

31:46.580 --> 31:48.620
He was on the show a couple of episodes ago.

31:48.620 --> 31:49.900
He and I were talking the other day,

31:49.900 --> 31:52.700
and he was like, a home lab is not just someone's server.

31:52.700 --> 31:56.700
A home lab is an actual thing with multiple switches

31:56.700 --> 31:57.940
and multiple servers and whatever.

31:57.940 --> 32:01.500
So the purists out there will be probably cringing

32:01.500 --> 32:04.340
a little bit at my definition of a home lab as one box,

32:04.340 --> 32:05.180
but-

32:05.180 --> 32:06.700
Hey, home labs can be virtual too.

32:06.700 --> 32:08.420
They don't have to be just physical.

32:08.420 --> 32:10.140
It's true. That is true.

32:10.140 --> 32:13.060
So I have a question for you, JDM, about your setup

32:13.060 --> 32:15.260
and how many terabytes you have

32:15.260 --> 32:17.740
and what does your home lab look like?

32:17.740 --> 32:22.100
Being a hardware guy, I'm expecting some good stuff here.

32:22.100 --> 32:25.100
Yeah, it's been an interesting process

32:25.100 --> 32:27.820
because we just recently moved to Denver

32:27.820 --> 32:30.860
and that was a cross country move for us.

32:30.860 --> 32:33.260
But as some of you may know,

32:33.260 --> 32:35.020
I do stream occasionally on Twitch.

32:35.020 --> 32:37.300
And in the past couple of streams,

32:37.300 --> 32:40.060
I've been implementing a storeinator.

32:40.060 --> 32:45.060
So that was kindly given to us by a fellow

32:45.580 --> 32:48.500
server builds member who works at Backblaze.

32:48.500 --> 32:51.340
And I spent a little bit of time implementing that

32:51.340 --> 32:56.060
and I've got 30 drives of mixed eight and 10 terabytes

32:56.060 --> 32:57.940
running Unraid on that box.

32:57.940 --> 32:59.340
I have to wipe the pool of drool

32:59.340 --> 33:00.780
from underneath my chin right now.

33:00.780 --> 33:04.420
A storeinator, oh, that's the stuff of dreams.

33:04.420 --> 33:06.300
I just recently posted about it on Twitter

33:06.300 --> 33:08.900
and it was nice to have Unraid retweet me,

33:08.900 --> 33:13.900
but it's been an interesting challenge to get that to work.

33:14.340 --> 33:18.380
In the past, I've run pretty much all super microservers,

33:18.380 --> 33:22.100
a couple of 3Us, 16 bays, and then a 45 bay DAS,

33:22.100 --> 33:24.300
which is a direct attached storage.

33:24.300 --> 33:29.060
It's just basically a JBOD, just a bunch of disks

33:29.060 --> 33:31.860
and that connects to the main server.

33:31.860 --> 33:35.140
So in the past, I've run that and I've condensed down

33:35.140 --> 33:36.620
a little bit into the storeinator

33:36.620 --> 33:40.260
where I can have 45 bays in for you.

33:40.260 --> 33:41.900
So are you running Unraid on that?

33:41.900 --> 33:45.780
Yes, I run Unraid mostly and shout out to you guys

33:45.780 --> 33:47.540
for having the best Docker containers.

33:47.540 --> 33:51.700
I run exclusively LSIO when possible.

33:51.700 --> 33:53.020
Oh, we'll have to change that

33:53.020 --> 33:54.860
because I'm not part of them anymore.

33:54.860 --> 33:57.540
Are you officially not part of them?

33:57.540 --> 33:58.860
I'm officially not, no.

33:59.860 --> 34:00.820
Oh, okay, well.

34:00.820 --> 34:02.700
I use them too and I still think they're great.

34:02.700 --> 34:04.740
Thanks for any work that you did do on them

34:04.740 --> 34:07.380
because they've been pretty great.

34:08.340 --> 34:10.780
But aside from that, yeah, I do run Unraid

34:10.780 --> 34:13.380
and of course, Plex and all that.

34:13.380 --> 34:16.260
That's kind of where I got started was the Plex subreddit

34:16.260 --> 34:17.900
and I was a mod there and helped out

34:17.900 --> 34:19.420
the team there for a while.

34:19.420 --> 34:21.540
I started doing a couple of hardware builds

34:21.540 --> 34:23.620
and split off into serverbuilds.net

34:23.620 --> 34:26.780
because we just really took over the Plex subreddit

34:27.660 --> 34:30.260
and I didn't really want to continue to do that.

34:30.260 --> 34:33.100
Right, it's fascinating because it's a theory.

34:33.100 --> 34:35.300
I think we probably said on the show a couple of times

34:35.300 --> 34:38.140
but Alex and I talk about it off air all the time

34:38.140 --> 34:42.980
that a lot of this journey starts at Plex

34:42.980 --> 34:45.500
and sometimes our audience kind of hates to hear that

34:45.500 --> 34:48.820
because we got a pretty hardcore open source aficionados

34:48.820 --> 34:51.980
out there and they prefer we talk about other things

34:51.980 --> 34:54.860
but I think you really gotta give Plex credit.

34:54.860 --> 34:56.700
It draws a lot of people into this space

34:56.700 --> 34:59.980
and it's kind of like the toe in the water

34:59.980 --> 35:01.940
that leads to bigger and bigger things.

35:01.940 --> 35:03.900
So JDM, I'm curious, now that you've kind of got

35:03.900 --> 35:08.400
a fairly sophisticated setup, what do you find to be

35:08.400 --> 35:11.180
the most frustrating or troubling aspect of the setup?

35:11.180 --> 35:13.980
Like what's the thing that you have to constantly deal with

35:13.980 --> 35:15.460
or manually fix?

35:15.460 --> 35:20.460
Luckily, not much because I choose my hardware

35:20.540 --> 35:24.220
in a way that I don't need to do anything with it

35:24.220 --> 35:27.540
once it's implemented and now I'm more geared

35:27.540 --> 35:29.500
at helping other people find hardware

35:29.500 --> 35:31.660
or I can start playing around with software

35:31.660 --> 35:35.100
because everyone has their specialties.

35:35.100 --> 35:38.020
I love hardware, I love working with hardware

35:38.020 --> 35:40.260
but software is definitely one of my weaker points

35:40.260 --> 35:42.260
so if I can start to gain experience with that

35:42.260 --> 35:44.980
because I have that solid hardware base

35:44.980 --> 35:48.740
where I have the freedom to do whatever I want basically.

35:48.740 --> 35:51.180
That is my goal really is just to start moving

35:51.180 --> 35:54.580
into more software, developing my own experience with that

35:54.580 --> 35:57.860
and relaying those experiences to other people

35:57.860 --> 36:00.820
because everyone has their own way of doing things

36:00.820 --> 36:04.260
and not to say my way is any better than anyone else's

36:04.260 --> 36:08.940
but we both, you guys and server builds,

36:08.940 --> 36:10.660
we have our own communities

36:10.660 --> 36:12.880
and I'm sure that there's a crossover there

36:12.880 --> 36:15.260
but we do have our own ways of doing things

36:15.260 --> 36:17.860
and if there's more information out there

36:17.860 --> 36:20.940
on how to do something or if there's a gap in knowledge,

36:20.940 --> 36:23.520
I'd like to try to fill that.

36:23.520 --> 36:25.260
But as far as challenges go,

36:25.260 --> 36:27.600
I don't really have a whole lot.

36:27.600 --> 36:31.000
Right now it's kind of getting everything

36:31.000 --> 36:36.000
to where it is what I would say like peak efficiency

36:36.620 --> 36:40.540
so I'm trying to cut down power usage where I can

36:40.540 --> 36:43.020
if it's downgrading a processor or moving

36:43.020 --> 36:44.180
to a different system.

36:44.180 --> 36:46.040
Dialing it in in a sense.

36:46.040 --> 36:47.980
That's great, that's a great, I love that phase.

36:47.980 --> 36:50.820
And unfortunately, I kind of live by the motto.

36:50.820 --> 36:53.360
It's like, oh, I have a spare part.

36:53.360 --> 36:54.380
It's not really a spare part.

36:54.380 --> 36:56.060
It's an unfinished build now

36:56.060 --> 36:57.440
so now I have to do something with it.

36:57.440 --> 36:59.500
That could get expensive real fast.

36:59.500 --> 37:00.380
Oh, absolutely.

37:02.300 --> 37:04.180
So back when we had Wendell on the show,

37:04.180 --> 37:05.940
I asked him how many terabytes he had

37:05.940 --> 37:09.140
and I had this vision of like a top gear style leaderboard

37:09.140 --> 37:11.780
for guests as to how many terabytes they have.

37:11.780 --> 37:12.780
Oh, sweet, yeah.

37:12.780 --> 37:14.620
I don't know if I've asked every guest

37:14.620 --> 37:17.460
but I'm gonna ask you, how many terabytes do you have?

37:17.460 --> 37:19.420
Raw or formatted?

37:19.420 --> 37:22.740
Oh, I don't think we've ever clarified.

37:22.740 --> 37:27.740
I guess, I mean, I think we should consider raw potential

37:27.820 --> 37:30.660
versus available.

37:30.660 --> 37:32.820
Yes, because Wendell just dropped the petabyte bomb

37:32.820 --> 37:35.260
so I mean, I don't think we're gonna compete with that

37:35.260 --> 37:36.580
but maybe.

37:36.580 --> 37:38.260
I'm not quite there.

37:38.260 --> 37:39.940
I do have multiple unrated setups

37:39.940 --> 37:41.780
so I do have the one in the store inator.

37:41.780 --> 37:43.260
I have one that's in a 15 bay

37:43.260 --> 37:46.460
and I have another one that I'm prepping for another 15 bay

37:46.460 --> 37:49.100
but I'm nearing half a petabyte.

37:49.100 --> 37:51.460
Wow, okay, that's pretty cool.

37:51.460 --> 37:52.580
Where do you buy your drives from

37:52.580 --> 37:54.100
and what sort of things do you look for

37:54.100 --> 37:55.540
when you're buying hard drives?

37:55.540 --> 38:00.380
I exclusively buy WD Shuckables and.

38:00.380 --> 38:01.220
Me too.

38:01.220 --> 38:02.420
Exclusively.

38:02.420 --> 38:03.460
They're fantastic

38:03.460 --> 38:06.260
because they're really just HDST Helium drives

38:06.260 --> 38:11.020
to the most part with a little bit of firmware trickery

38:11.020 --> 38:13.540
but there's really not a whole lot to consider.

38:13.540 --> 38:16.220
Buy eight terabyte WDs or higher,

38:16.220 --> 38:20.780
so eights, tens, 12s, 14s, soon to be coming out 16s

38:20.780 --> 38:22.900
and they're the best value for the money

38:22.900 --> 38:25.220
and nothing can touch them right now.

38:25.220 --> 38:26.820
That's a great tip.

38:26.820 --> 38:30.580
Alex is a Shucking fan and it's his favorite thing

38:30.580 --> 38:32.540
so I don't think you could have had a more perfect answer

38:32.540 --> 38:33.580
for this show.

38:33.580 --> 38:35.660
Yep, yep, yep, yep, I love it.

38:35.660 --> 38:36.980
There's a couple different models.

38:36.980 --> 38:40.700
There's the Elements, there's the Easy Stores

38:40.700 --> 38:43.300
which are a Best Buy exclusive but it doesn't matter.

38:43.300 --> 38:45.460
They're all the same drives inside.

38:45.460 --> 38:46.900
The only thing that you have to consider

38:46.900 --> 38:48.580
just like SAS hard drives,

38:48.580 --> 38:50.620
if anyone's familiar with SAS hard drives,

38:50.620 --> 38:53.540
they have a 3.3 volt standby.

38:53.540 --> 38:56.780
There's a guide on our forum on how to surpass this issue.

38:56.780 --> 39:00.540
A lot of people use Kapton tape to just tape off the pins

39:00.540 --> 39:03.340
but you can just simply remove the correct SATA wire

39:03.340 --> 39:04.540
and it'll function.

39:04.540 --> 39:07.780
Just cut the wire, yeah, cut the green one.

39:07.780 --> 39:08.620
I don't know if it's green.

39:08.620 --> 39:10.220
Please don't cut the green wire.

39:10.220 --> 39:12.220
Check which one you're cutting.

39:12.220 --> 39:13.580
If you're using like a server backplane,

39:13.580 --> 39:14.420
like a Super Micro,

39:14.420 --> 39:17.620
they already have the 3.3 volt standby taken care of

39:17.620 --> 39:19.780
so you don't even need to worry about it.

39:19.780 --> 39:21.580
But yeah, they're extremely versatile.

39:21.580 --> 39:24.740
They're even great in their own USB 3.0 enclosure

39:24.740 --> 39:27.500
for those Raspberry Pi guys that we won't talk about.

39:30.060 --> 39:32.380
All right, well JDM, thank you very much for joining us.

39:32.380 --> 39:34.300
It's been a real pleasure to talk to you.

39:34.300 --> 39:36.500
Is there any way you'd like to send folks?

39:36.500 --> 39:38.980
Yeah, you can check out serverbuilds.net.

39:38.980 --> 39:40.220
Like I said in the intro,

39:40.220 --> 39:42.420
the website's a little stale right now.

39:42.420 --> 39:44.860
Really everything's happening on the forums,

39:44.860 --> 39:47.180
which is forums.serverbuilds.net.

39:47.180 --> 39:48.460
And you're on Twitter, aren't you?

39:48.460 --> 39:49.300
I'm on Twitter.

39:49.300 --> 39:51.380
I don't really do a whole lot on there.

39:51.380 --> 39:53.980
Apart from give me grief about my TV stand.

39:53.980 --> 39:54.820
That's true.

39:55.940 --> 39:59.460
At JDM underscore what with three A's.

39:59.460 --> 40:01.060
You can also just hit me on Discord.

40:01.060 --> 40:03.020
Everyone bothers me on Discord.

40:03.020 --> 40:05.260
I think we've got about 8,000 members in our server.

40:05.260 --> 40:07.620
So it's growing and it's pretty large.

40:07.620 --> 40:08.780
We'll put a link to the Discord

40:08.780 --> 40:10.620
and the forums in the show notes.

40:10.620 --> 40:13.620
And I think it's a great companion Discord to our own.

40:13.620 --> 40:16.500
Those are two Discords in a pod.

40:16.500 --> 40:18.180
Is that a thing?

40:18.180 --> 40:19.200
Can we make that a thing?

40:19.200 --> 40:20.040
Oh, absolutely.

40:20.040 --> 40:23.640
I think we should do like a partnered Discord something

40:23.640 --> 40:26.060
and maybe just cross link or something like that.

40:26.060 --> 40:26.900
I love it.

40:26.900 --> 40:28.780
And you've given me a lot to think about.

40:28.780 --> 40:30.940
I think the laptop is a serious route

40:30.940 --> 40:33.420
that I'm gonna consider when the Pi experiment ends.

40:33.420 --> 40:35.220
And now it's just a matter of how soon

40:35.220 --> 40:36.580
does the grand experiment end

40:36.580 --> 40:39.900
and can I find the right ThinkPad on eBay?

40:39.900 --> 40:42.820
I'm kind of hoping I can stretch it out long enough

40:42.820 --> 40:44.600
to get a great deal on a 10th gen

40:44.600 --> 40:46.460
to really take advantage of QuickSync.

40:46.460 --> 40:48.020
Think about it this way.

40:48.020 --> 40:49.140
You don't need a ThinkPad

40:49.140 --> 40:52.580
because that is their sort of mid to upper tier laptop.

40:52.580 --> 40:54.420
You just need the hardware.

40:54.420 --> 40:55.700
The screen doesn't matter.

40:55.700 --> 40:56.540
Keyboard doesn't matter.

40:56.540 --> 40:57.740
Mouse doesn't matter.

40:57.740 --> 41:00.100
It's really just what CPU does it have?

41:00.100 --> 41:02.620
Does it have the NVMe slots that I need

41:02.620 --> 41:04.580
or hard drive slots?

41:04.580 --> 41:05.600
How much RAM can it support?

41:05.600 --> 41:06.440
And that's about it.

41:06.440 --> 41:07.980
It makes a good point, Chris.

41:07.980 --> 41:08.940
Wise words, JDM.

41:08.940 --> 41:11.980
Maybe we'll have you back when I do make the switch.

41:11.980 --> 41:12.800
Oh, awesome.

41:12.800 --> 41:13.640
I would look forward to it.

41:13.640 --> 41:14.540
And just one other thing.

41:14.540 --> 41:19.100
There is one guide that I do want you to check out, Chris.

41:19.100 --> 41:21.260
I wrote it about a year ago.

41:21.260 --> 41:23.780
It's called how to create a mobile media server

41:23.780 --> 41:26.780
with Plex's new app for Windows.

41:26.780 --> 41:30.580
So right now it's a Windows thing only,

41:30.580 --> 41:35.300
but it would be somewhat interesting to you particularly

41:35.300 --> 41:39.300
because what you can do is, just to give a TLDR,

41:39.300 --> 41:40.780
you can use Plex's new app,

41:40.780 --> 41:45.780
download media from any shared server onto the app,

41:45.940 --> 41:47.880
like you're syncing it locally,

41:47.880 --> 41:51.140
and then also run Plex Media Server on that computer

41:51.140 --> 41:52.820
and then share that media out.

41:52.820 --> 41:53.980
Oh, sure, sure.

41:53.980 --> 41:57.220
It's really easy and it's got a nice UI.

41:57.220 --> 42:00.020
It's not an intended use for the app, but it does work.

42:00.020 --> 42:01.400
So check that one out.

42:01.400 --> 42:02.240
I just found it.

42:02.240 --> 42:03.080
I will.

42:03.080 --> 42:04.500
Thanks very much, JDM, for joining us.

42:04.500 --> 42:05.540
Thanks, guys, for having me.

42:05.540 --> 42:07.060
I hope I could, I mean,

42:07.060 --> 42:08.740
I know we talked about a lot of different things,

42:08.740 --> 42:10.700
but the rabbit hole goes way deeper.

42:10.700 --> 42:11.660
We'll have to chat more.

42:11.660 --> 42:13.100
Well, I look forward to chatting on Discord,

42:13.100 --> 42:14.980
but I look forward to having you back on the show too.

42:14.980 --> 42:15.820
Of course.

42:15.820 --> 42:16.640
Thanks for having me, guys.

42:16.640 --> 42:17.480
Appreciate it.

42:17.480 --> 42:22.480
I'll see you guys next time.
