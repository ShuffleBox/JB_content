00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Coming up on this week's show we discuss how listener Morgan was almost outsmarted by a not-so-smart doorbell

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,480
jellyfin makes Alex's prediction dreams come true and

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,500
I try out QO notes

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:17,480
Again, I'm Chris and I'm Alex and this is episode 18

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:23,720
Well, Chris I went and did it. I bought myself a smoker. My Americanization is complete

6
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:32,320
This truly is the completion of a journey that has been a multi-year journey. I'm so so proud of you Alex the

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,080
Culmination reminds me that American Pie moment. You remember where the coach is on the field? I

8
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,080
Don't want to take this from you, but Alex, you know, you got to automate this

9
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:45,960
We got it. We got to integrate this somehow into Grafana. I got expectations, you know, it's coming

10
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:53,600
I want to see average cook time built into graph on it something like that. What about average temperatures that you use?

11
00:00:53,600 --> 00:01:00,020
I want all the data average temperature per probe. I think is really the sweet spot per probe

12
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:04,760
How many how many probes are we talking about? I don't know. This sounds like an episode of South Park

13
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,780
Doesn't it where Cartman's getting probed or something?

14
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:11,840
But I don't know you like for four probes is a good number of probes

15
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,160
Have you looked into it though the possibilities what I have and actually joining us on the show

16
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:20,440
This week is a friend and colleague of mine Morgan Peterman. He works with me at Red Hat

17
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:26,560
he's a technical account manager working on OpenShift and he has an extensive home lab and

18
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,240
He was the benefactor of a certain doorbell that you ordered Chris without researching it properly

19
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:38,920
Yeah during the show actually I ordered a smart doorbell. So Morgan, it's great to have you here and how is my doorbell turned out?

20
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,600
Thank you so much for having me. Yeah, the doorbell actually worked out pretty good

21
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:47,900
Once I finally got it set up wired properly and connected running on Shinobi

22
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,360
It's a little difficult

23
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:55,320
especially if you watch their YouTube video and then you see that they use one application and then you go to their website and

24
00:01:55,420 --> 00:02:00,240
They recommend a completely different application. So that was a lot of the hassles that I went through

25
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,620
I I spent quite a bit of time using the easy viz app, you know

26
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:11,720
It's standard scan the QR code it connects to the Wi-Fi and ad hoc mode and it's supposed to work connect

27
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,880
Configure Wi-Fi and then you get your video and it didn't do that

28
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:21,440
I had a series of texts that were getting progressively more and more frustrated over the course of what six hours

29
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,160
You were installing this thing. Yes. It took a couple hours to get it working. I

30
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,600
Replaced the transformer because I didn't know if it was a power issue

31
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:32,720
I changed the wiring cleaned up some terminals and in the end

32
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:40,120
It just came down to the fact that the application was just awful. So I went to the website I found out

33
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,160
That they offer a batch configuration tool

34
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:48,940
So I downloaded the batch configuration tool put it on the Mac loaded it up found the you know

35
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,000
The camera and I couldn't configure it

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,580
So then became the hunt to find a Windows machine in my house

37
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:01,760
That I could actually tolerate long enough to get the batch tool on. Oh my goodness. That was the easiest for me

38
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,680
you know again, there's

39
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,320
Easy viz guardian vision and then there's their actual batch tool the easy viz

40
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:16,840
Did not work at all. They just could not connect couldn't configure and this is after I created a new SS ID

41
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,760
Just something simple. I called it IOT with a password a password still couldn't connect

42
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:27,440
Guardian vision wasn't working at all for me and ended up using the batch tool. The batch tool was great. I found it

43
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:35,200
It's gooey based, you know on Windows. You configure the SS ID in the password and it connected instantly and I was up and running

44
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,760
And then I found out that my doorbell didn't work had to go over to Home Depot stood in line for about an hour to get

45
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,840
into Home Depot

46
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,920
Came home hooked up the doorbell and then it was a fun game of picking which one of the 16 songs

47
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:52,320
We wanted to hear whenever the doorbell rang. Does this thing trigger a built-in doorbell that's in the house already

48
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,240
So if you had something installed it'll trigger that

49
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,960
Yeah, so what I found out was my old mechanical doorbell was actually broken

50
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:03,640
One of the springs had popped and it just wasn't worth trying to repair it. So I had two options

51
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:07,360
I had a regular mechanical style doorbell or that you know

52
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:14,680
The 16 song doorbell is standard off-the-shelf from Home Depot came home wired it inside of the easy vis app

53
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,440
Which is what you want to use after you get a configure this very important after you get it configured

54
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:25,560
You want to keep the easy vis app because it is the best app of the two that they recommend you just go into the settings

55
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,720
you configure it you tell it you have a

56
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,960
You have an electronic

57
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,600
Doorbell and then you're set

58
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:37,360
So whenever you come up you push the button your doorbell rings and what's nice is you can configure it if you want it to

59
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,280
Be two seconds or ten seconds. You have you have configuration options just to be clear

60
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,280
Does it require like an account or a service?

61
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:50,360
Any kind of any kind of login that you have to go into a service to get this thing to be configured or functional or?

62
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:56,240
Anything you have to pay for so no you do not need to sign up for an account to get it to configure it

63
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,680
You can download the batch program the batch tool off of their website and you can get it configured

64
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,040
But if you want to use the easy vis app

65
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:08,000
From my for what I found you you do have to log in so I use my standard Google account

66
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,200
And if you're an iPhone user, which I am you definitely want it when somebody comes up and rings my doorbell

67
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:19,080
I get a phone call. I answer the phone call and it's audio you hit the easy vis button and then it does

68
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,720
Video so I can actually see them and I can talk to them and it's a great app

69
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,120
It's not a hundred percent self-hosted

70
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,040
But it's it's a good option that they give you

71
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,440
so I

72
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:37,800
Also configured shinobi. It's view only or watch only I configured my motion detection

73
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,520
and I had to toggle a little bit with the audio detection because

74
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:48,960
It was too low and crickets were setting off the recording and then obviously if you set it too high, it doesn't pick anything up

75
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,880
So again, I used shinobi. I got it set up. I got it recording. I

76
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:58,080
Caught myself mowing the lawn picking up the grass, you know

77
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:04,680
My neighbor at 830 in the morning revving his motorcycle wanting to wake everybody else up. So it works great with shinobi

78
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,760
I was really happy with it and that actually didn't take very long to get set up

79
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:16,000
All right, and to be clear, we're talking about the Nellie's security camera that was on Amazon for around $130

80
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,560
It's currently not available, but there's different iterations of it

81
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,240
I bought this back in January while we were recording the show and I had a sense

82
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:28,160
It was a project and so I never I just kept putting it off and then I realized I didn't have the proper wiring

83
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:33,320
So Alex suggested we ship it to Morgan and so Morgan did all of this testing did the whole install

84
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:37,120
but the one thing we haven't asked you about on this Nellie security camera is

85
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:43,800
How's the picture quality? Does it actually do the job and give you a clear picture of what's going on around your porch?

86
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,560
So the picture is actually really nice

87
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,440
I took some videos and I sent it to Alex so he could see and it was super clear

88
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,960
one of the issues I did have with it is

89
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:57,120
It's more of a fisheye style lens and they advertise this as a feature

90
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,360
So you get the full height of the individual standing in front of the camera

91
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,420
But that also distorts the image just a little bit

92
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:08,120
So for example, if you're a little little big around the belly, you're gonna look a lot bigger in the video

93
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,140
But the the picture is crystal clear. The audio is actually really amazing

94
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,140
I was quite surprised how well it picks up audio

95
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:20,260
Especially for conversations if you're if you're not standing directly in front of the camera for $139

96
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:27,000
I would definitely recommend it to any individual who's looking for a good camera and you want to get out of the ring

97
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:31,000
You know or one of the ones that maybe comes with Comcast, etc

98
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,460
Have you tried the ring doorbell? How does it compare to that?

99
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:40,140
So I had the ring doorbell when I purchased this house and it was transferred over to me

100
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:43,560
My big issue was the fact that I was paying monthly for it

101
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:46,420
You know, there are some features that ring has is really nice

102
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:49,820
But I didn't like the idea of a reoccurring monthly payment

103
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:53,460
And as you guys know monthly payments always go up every year

104
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:58,860
They adjust it and the total cost of ownership for these doorbells just skyrocket on top of that

105
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:05,220
It didn't look very good. That's such a 2020 sentence the total cost of ownership of this doorbell

106
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,340
Yeah

107
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:15,880
Unfortunately, you're right and and the fact that we're even considering does does your doorbell have a subscription service?

108
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,640
one of the upsides that I really liked about the Nelly was

109
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:25,280
The fact that it's hardwired. You don't have to worry about a battery, you know, I know people that bought

110
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:31,360
rings and then they were charging their doorbell battery every couple of days, which is ridiculous, you know

111
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,180
The Nelly is hardwired, which is nice. It doesn't offer a battery as Chris, you know

112
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:39,800
The downside to it though, and this is something I mentioned to Alex. It does get very hot

113
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,240
Whenever I was just plugging it in just to test it

114
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:47,520
It got to the point where I couldn't hold it for more than a couple seconds to the point where it could burn me

115
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:53,700
I don't know if this is gonna affect overall longevity of the device, but you definitely don't feel it if you touch it

116
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:58,440
It's only the back where the camera and the electronics are but that is something to consider obviously

117
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:04,280
You know as longevity is how is the heat going to affect this device over multiple years?

118
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,640
Particularly for you down in Florida where it's you know hot

119
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:12,360
Always so you now have it going into shinobi and then in there you're using

120
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,320
the

121
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:20,720
Plugin system to do motion capture. So it's only it's always streaming but it's only recording when there's motion capture

122
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,840
That's correct. And then what's really great since it uses

123
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:30,480
RTSP I have VLC running at all times, especially when I'm expecting an Amazon package

124
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:33,320
Because what I've noticed is shinobi doesn't pick up

125
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:40,020
The real quick toss of the box that most Amazon deliveries do, you know, ups and FedEx are really nice

126
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,780
They seem to always ring my doorbell

127
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:47,060
but I get Amazon who stands just outside of the view of the camera and they toss it on my on my

128
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:51,540
On my porch so with VLC having it streaming at all time

129
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,860
I can see that nice camera land the same thing with Amazon

130
00:09:54,860 --> 00:10:00,020
I can see the Amazon truck drive by and the video stays connected. It doesn't drop. Yeah, I haven't had any issues

131
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:05,780
I've actually had it running for two days straight without even realizing I had it connected and it doesn't use a lot of video

132
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:10,780
I use unified to track how much data it uses and it's not very high cool

133
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,040
I mean

134
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:18,180
so it sounds like if you're willing to wire it and you're willing to deal with some half-baked apps for some of the initial setup and

135
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:24,780
configuration changes which can be sounds like a little frustrating the end result is you still have something you can

136
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:30,100
RTSP stream on your LAN without any cloud service required and what happens if

137
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:36,020
Nelly go away because you found some you know generic clones of this thing, right?

138
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:41,020
The only difference between every other one of these clones and Nelly is the fact that Nelly sells it

139
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:45,420
There are some comments on the internet that they run different firmware

140
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:51,300
But from what I can tell all it is is a clone of the easy vis camera

141
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:56,660
And that's why you use the easy vis application. So if Nelly goes away, the only thing you lose is support

142
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:00,180
What's great is it's not necessarily connected to a cloud

143
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:03,220
They give you instructions how to remove it from being connected to the cloud

144
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:09,820
So you can set this up with the batch tool never connected to the cloud and use home assistant

145
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,540
You can use shinobi

146
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:18,260
I'm sure blue iris would work as well. And that's what's great and it stores everything right on that SD card

147
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,580
so if you're not streaming it to a

148
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:26,100
You know a DVR or an NVR you can still pull out

149
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:31,660
You know the guardian vision app and view the data without ever logging into anything

150
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:36,140
Morgan I'm sure you didn't do a full penetration test analysis

151
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:39,820
But did you get a sense of what the security is like on this thing if you're comfortable with it?

152
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:43,480
So one of the things I actually did do was I completely disabled it

153
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:47,020
Internet access so it could not go out. I set it up

154
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:51,780
So it had no internet access and it still worked great internally in my land now

155
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:56,440
Obviously the phone home version of the easy vis application wasn't working

156
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:01,540
But shinobi still works RTSP still works. I was still getting alerts

157
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:07,700
Through those applications, but the easy vis application wasn't working, right?

158
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:13,140
So then I guess that would mean you wouldn't get the push notification video sent to your phone if somebody was at the door

159
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:15,100
Correct, correct

160
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:19,980
But you could still have the VLC stream up watching the door all the time and it could be over your land

161
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:24,340
No cloud service required. So that checks my box. One of the other options is

162
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:31,220
Motion eye and home assistant which was shared with me by Alex. I did not get a chance to set it up yet

163
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,580
That's my next project

164
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:37,260
But to get alerts via telegram bot and or a discord bot

165
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:41,380
So there are options out there where you can set up an alerting service

166
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:47,900
Again, since this is a doorbell app, I would keep it available to the internet just for the easy vis

167
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:54,700
Application because I want to be able to answer the phone from my couch or from my bed and see who's there

168
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:58,220
All right. I don't want to get a video sent to me that may be delayed

169
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:03,820
it's nice to have a communication and we actually use that on Sunday morning whenever a

170
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:08,500
You know the Jehovah Witnesses came by thanks, but no, thanks. Have a great time

171
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:13,540
It was a lot better than waiting for a notification on the phone then viewing the video to see who it was

172
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:14,620
Yeah, absolutely

173
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:15,140
Yeah

174
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:20,340
the real time when someone's at the door like that really makes a difference and that does seem like a great way to

175
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:28,860
Politely say thank you, but no, thank you and not get stuck in a conversation. I just blame coronavirus these days. That's the general go-to

176
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,020
Well Morgan

177
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:37,300
I'm really glad that we sent it your way so that way you could give us the full test on it and it it sounds

178
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:40,580
Like if I had if I could have wired it in which I couldn't do in lady tubes

179
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:44,300
But I could have essentially gotten the functionality I was looking for

180
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:47,900
So I'm gonna keep an eye on this category because if they make one with a battery

181
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:52,980
That could be the route I would go. Yeah, I agree. It's like I said, it's great application. Thank you

182
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:56,700
I really appreciate you giving me the opportunity to test it out for you

183
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,560
Now before we let you go Morgan

184
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:06,620
You have an embarrassing data loss story. You want to share with the class, don't you? Oh, no as Alex mentioned

185
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:11,140
I am a Red Hatter and one of the great options that Red Hat gives you is the ability to

186
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:19,340
To install the full stack and I love home labbing and as a home labber, you should really practice good backups

187
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:23,780
Because if you're supposed to be replicating what you do at home for your what you do at work

188
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:31,500
You should practice what you preach. I unfortunately ran afoul of that this weekend installing some new SSD drives. Oh

189
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:40,100
Oh popped open the the home lab install some SSD drives configured the raid and I initialized the long

190
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,940
raid array

191
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,660
system reboots

192
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:47,060
Can't connect a vCenter can't connect to my VMs

193
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:54,620
Login to the ESXi hosts and all my VMs just have VM dash number and they're all gone

194
00:14:54,620 --> 00:15:00,620
Oh, no, and then I realized instantly what I did that I just wiped out all of my data

195
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:07,020
How awful did that feel cheese, but it's okay Morgan because you and I were talking and you wrote

196
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:12,100
loads of automation to rebuild this stuff right and you put it in git was fine, right

197
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:20,660
Alex has been hounding me to document the entire process to automate everything and I took his word for it

198
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:24,240
I love ansible ansible is a great tool and I wrote

199
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:31,920
Thousands of lines of ansible playbooks to replicate my entire environment outside of ESXi in vCenter

200
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,040
To the point where I actually deleted a bunch of my VMs and I redeployed them

201
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:42,040
Unfortunately that was in my git lab server, which was on my home lab that I erased

202
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:48,720
Right. I mean, I'll be honest. I laughed pretty hard when he told me the story the first time. Yeah, cuz it's not you

203
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,660
Yeah, I mean I've done that. I've wiped out three terabytes worth of stuff

204
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:57,820
Numerous times probably but wiping out data and the VMs is like a double blow

205
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:04,420
But I've never not had my configuration in github as opposed to it local git lab. So yes, I learned

206
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:09,000
So once I redo all that work, it'll all be stored externally

207
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:15,500
So a nice little tip for you if you've heard of git t that is a self-hosted local

208
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:19,180
github server clone thing and

209
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:26,220
Git T will automatically clone any commits you make to github

210
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:32,380
So I have a local copy of all of my github stuff is locally saved by git T

211
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:38,360
Now the motivation for that was what if they get bought out by some evil company? Oh wait, they maybe did

212
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:41,060
What if they did something crazy with my data?

213
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:47,280
but obviously the same is true in both directions if if I accidentally initialized the wrong SSD array and

214
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,280
Wipe my local

215
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:55,840
Git server, it's all in github too. So yeah, so I spent Saturday night rebuilding the most important VMs

216
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:59,840
And I'm sure sadly it won't be the last time I accidentally delete everything

217
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:04,400
But I'll make sure that this will be the last time I delete everything without proper backups

218
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:11,540
So your post-mortem is off-site off-site off-site. Do you know what you're gonna use? I have not looked into it yet

219
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:19,520
Back please is obviously one that I do like, you know unlimited storage the downside of I've used it before and it does take

220
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,560
A long time to pull everything down. We've got gigabit symmetrical internet though

221
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:29,480
So, you know the actual upload part, which is normally the problem. You've got that licked. Yeah, I have symmetrical one gig

222
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:36,840
So it's pretty nice. But most likely what I'm gonna do is write some scripts using PowerShell that'll export the VMT case

223
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:41,480
Except for you know, the things that I can easily download quickly

224
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:49,160
And then I'll just zip those up and set them up to back place and just have that like on a 24 every 24 hours

225
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:53,680
That'll go that's what I actually used to do in my previous job is a site consultant

226
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,320
But you know

227
00:17:54,320 --> 00:18:00,000
As I said, you're supposed to practice what you preach and very rarely do we practice what we preach and we end up

228
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:04,680
You know with egg on our face. Amen to that. Well, thanks for joining us Morgan

229
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:08,240
It was a lot of fun and I'll see what other free stuff I can get you in the future

230
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:14,080
Pleasure. Thanks a lot guys. Have a good one. Thanks Morgan. I have a data loss story of my own this week

231
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,200
It's not quite my fault. Although it could be I'm not sure it is though

232
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:23,960
I was using Joplin and I've started work on the 2020 version of perfect media server

233
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:29,480
And I was writing away one evening for about three or four hours and I went to bed

234
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:34,600
I just finished a huge section which I was really pleased with and I thought I'd gone through it

235
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:39,040
I'd proofread it and I'd edited it and I'd tweaked it and it was I was really happy with it

236
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:43,480
And I came back in the morning to my desktop and it was gone gone

237
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:47,160
I was just like what the hell has happened here?

238
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:53,520
And it turns out that Joplin had decided that the version of the note that was on the server

239
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:58,520
Was more important than the version of the note that I just edited and I overwrote it

240
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:04,640
mm-hmm, then I started going to try and look through the SQLite database that Joplin has and

241
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,360
It's gone. It's too late. It's dead Wow

242
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:14,440
So you and I were talking about notes and I think Joplin unfortunately was so close

243
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,600
It was really good. It's been working well for about a month

244
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:22,280
But you found an alternative for me. Yeah, you know funny enough. It's one that you and I have used before

245
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:28,280
But I just I kept coming back to it. And so I wanted to share it with the class

246
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,120
It's it's a classic

247
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:35,440
It's Q own notes and I think it holds up to be the biggest and best

248
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:40,920
Contender to Evernote that I can find there's a couple of fundamentals that I really like about it

249
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:49,060
Number one all of the notes are stored in plain text files markdown files. You can just go cap them on the command line

250
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:52,340
You can also you can put notes in multiple folders

251
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:56,260
You can have them one in Dropbox one on your local file system one on

252
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:58,620
Same thing another one in next cloud

253
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:05,540
It also will use the own cloud next cloud API to actually take advantage of the notes in next cloud if you have that and then

254
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:08,700
That gives you a web viewer for your notes, which is really nice

255
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:12,660
It can also integrate with some of the calendar stuff there. And then the one that you

256
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:18,700
Sounded like you were kind of excited about this isn't something I've played with before but I think I'm going to now is I

257
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:24,260
Realized it also supports get versioning. Yeah, that's a game changer. I mean I use get

258
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:28,820
Version manage all of my code. So why not version manage all of my notes and

259
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:35,060
normally the process of doing a you know a git add git commit or whatever every time I get to

260
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,980
You know a new paragraph would be a bit too cumbersome

261
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:45,260
Sure, but QO notes seems to handle that for you on on the most part and I've kind of written it off as being a bit

262
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:50,900
Ugly and a bit clunky, but I really started to dig through some of the menu settings today, you know, I was wrong

263
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:57,100
I think honestly, it's it's a really great looking app and this speaks to a larger principle

264
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:01,520
I think you and I have been kind of circling around with notes for quite a while really

265
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:06,660
We're going to use next cloud to actually sync the notes between devices

266
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:12,740
So, you know between an iPad and a Linux server and a MacBook and a you know an XPS whatever running

267
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:19,660
Whatever flavor of Linux this week. We're using we use next cloud to handle the sync and then on each

268
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:26,060
System, I mean QO notes runs on Mac Windows and Linux but on mobile we can use whatever apps

269
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:32,740
We want to edit those files where QO notes doesn't exist. And I think that's the key really is it's a bit like Wi-Fi

270
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,860
Really you're separating your firewall from your

271
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:40,260
Wi-Fi you're separating the sync of the notes from the editing of the notes and I think hopefully

272
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:46,540
Hopefully that's going to result in a really reliable robust solution. I've been playing around with it. I have

273
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:53,720
I a writer on iOS on the iPad with the new keyboard and I use that to edit some notes

274
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:59,340
And then I go back to my desktop and it's right there in QO notes. I really like that so far. It's worked really well

275
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:03,540
I do think maybe eventually I could see some sort of conflict, you know

276
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:08,900
Maybe I have QO notes open and I added a Dropbox directly. So I'm gonna wait and see how that plays

277
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:14,260
We'll see eventually if I create my own problem with that one or not, but so far

278
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:20,100
It's it's worked and QO notes also has support for adding an external editor

279
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:26,020
So you can double click a note and now it opens in VS code, which is my preferred markdown editor. Really? Oh

280
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,140
Didn't know that. Mm-hmm

281
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:34,340
Yeah, and it's pretty nice because then if you have some more complex stuff or some just things the VS code does that you want

282
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:38,020
To do in your notes really simple to do that now and then the other little tip

283
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:45,940
I'll pass along is if you rock a dark theme like I do if you play around in the settings for QO notes

284
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,180
It's not enabled by default

285
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:52,780
But they have a dark mode that they call it and you can turn that on and it just looks a lot better

286
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,540
It just simply it just looks a lot better

287
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:59,700
But also if you're running a dark theme, it's more usable. Some of the stuff won't show up unless you turn that on

288
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:03,940
Yeah, it's it's much better than I remember. I used it maybe

289
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:05,940
Was around the time I was emigrating

290
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:09,140
I think because that's when I was getting into next cloud big time for the first time and

291
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:12,500
Then it just sort of faded away and I stopped using it for some reason

292
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:18,020
Yeah, all of the kind of controversy surrounding snaps at the moment. Like I can't quite put my finger on

293
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:24,340
What it is. I don't fully like about them, but I never end up sticking with them

294
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:30,900
I couldn't give you a concrete reason why but it just sort of happens and the same thing happened with QO notes before

295
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:34,780
so hopefully this time is different now I've dug into the settings a little bit and

296
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:40,460
We'll see I guess, you know, what I think it might be for me is I changed

297
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:47,180
next cloud servers a couple of times and I sort of hit the reset button on my notes and I wanted something that was

298
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:53,500
Separate from that and not really wrapped up and I didn't really appreciate the QO notes

299
00:23:53,580 --> 00:24:00,220
Doesn't even need next cloud at all to function using what like sync thing or something like that. That's what I'm thinking

300
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:03,780
Mm-hmm. Yeah, I mean I actually have next cloud now, so I'm just using that

301
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:07,580
Yeah without without the API and just using the file sync right now

302
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:12,780
and then I have another folder that I think I'm gonna keep as like a backup copy and then

303
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:16,060
Maybe I might eventually throw sync thing at that

304
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:20,420
I want to do an episode where you and I talk about sync thing a little more because I'm using that for a lot

305
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:27,540
Of things I never really expected. It's kind of in a way. It's become like a global file system for me. It's it's really cool

306
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:29,620
Oh, that's interesting. I'll look forward to that one

307
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:37,040
I've used bit torrent sync since you were using it on the young filter show years ago now called Brazilio sync

308
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:41,380
But I'll be interested to hear about sync thing. Yeah, it's different definitely different

309
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:45,740
It's and it's not like a torrent like protocol. It's its own protocol. I was just the other day

310
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,740
I was reading their comparison of the two and

311
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:54,660
They assert that their security is superior sync thing does and they also point out that all of their code is open source

312
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:57,140
Yes, well, we can't argue that one

313
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:00,100
The open source angle. Anyway, that's just a fact

314
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:08,660
All right, so last episode we talked a little bit about Plex amp and I gave it a bit of a rough review

315
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:14,860
I'd like to change my assessment slightly. I had a lot more time to play with it over the last week or two and

316
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:21,940
Fixed some issues with my Plex library that were causing it to act out if you remember from last episode

317
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:25,820
I I put on heavy metal radio and it played tool and then M&M

318
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:34,180
One after another which was not right and it turned out that actually the slash temp directory for my Plex media server container

319
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:40,900
Was not writable and that is why I was having these issues. So if you're having lots of

320
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:45,780
Random weirdness when you're scanning your library, for example when I was going to do

321
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:51,220
You know fixed match for you know, a really mainstream album like Green Day American Idiot

322
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:54,140
It tried to tell me it was by the Beastie Boys

323
00:25:57,060 --> 00:26:00,740
And you're telling me this is because your slash temp wasn't writable correct

324
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:06,660
What after we talked to Elan in one of the earlier episodes of self hosted from Plex

325
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:12,940
he invited me to one of their internal slack channels where they've been doing the development of Plex amp for the last six months and

326
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:16,740
So I reached out to him on there and said hey, I've got this really strange issue

327
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:21,420
That's preventing me from using Plex amp. So he and I spent a couple of hours going back and forth on slack

328
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:26,700
Trying to debug this thing and I learned a lot about all the different log files that Plex keeps

329
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:33,580
When Plex does a scan for a media file it writes something to temp very very briefly for less than a second

330
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:39,020
And so he was asking me to try and capture that file and in the process. I just tried to do a touch test

331
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:45,140
File in that directory when I was exacting to the container and it wouldn't work and I'm like, well, there we go

332
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,540
Temps not writable

333
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:51,540
Did a change mod and then it was fine. So I just removed the mapping altogether

334
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:55,380
I don't even remember really why I had that volume mapping in my container, but

335
00:26:55,380 --> 00:27:02,020
Anyway, I removed it and it worked and I've just been in love with Plex amp. It's great. It's beautiful

336
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,220
It works really really well it

337
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:09,860
You know handles the caching of the tracks ahead really well. I found the recommendations now

338
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:13,460
I've got temp working to be really quite good, you know, so

339
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,500
I'm sorry Plex amp. I was rude about you to start with

340
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:20,660
But I kind of love you now. So a little more time within you're liking it, huh?

341
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:25,860
Isn't it interesting that the recommendations aspect of it seems to play a pretty central role for you

342
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,860
Yeah, I mean that's what kind of what I use

343
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:33,300
Spotify for really is I I go to a particular artist and I'll search and I'll just play the top tracks or whatever

344
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:40,340
Most of the time and then I look for you know recommended artists or a discover weekly playlist that uses like machine learning to generate

345
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:43,700
Who it thinks I'm gonna like but of course with your own music library

346
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:49,300
Most of the time, you know, what's in there? You've generally curated it to the point where you know

347
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:52,100
Most of the tracks on an album because you've listened to it at least two or three times

348
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:56,820
And so what I found the most interesting was when I was scanning the

349
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:59,460
albums to

350
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:00,980
Plex in the first place

351
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:06,420
I was going through metadata madness trying to fix it trying to make sure that that green day American Idiot album was absolutely

352
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:09,860
Pristine it had the correct cover. It had the correct tags

353
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:14,660
It had everything was perfect in the metadata of the files and it still thought it was the beastie boys

354
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:20,340
So I started looking at ways to make sure the metadata was correct and I used a program called beats to do that

355
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:23,700
Now there's a post over on the linux server blog written by josh stark

356
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:29,220
And he covers a bunch of interesting stuff about beats in there, which is a it's a command line

357
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,860
music metadata management tool

358
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:37,620
And that's it. I mean it can import music from a download directory or a ripped cd directory or whatever

359
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:40,980
and then goes through and tags it against a whole bunch of databases and

360
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:46,820
It's very command line driven, which means it's scriptable. So if you want to do some automation around the imports of your

361
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:49,380
Music you can do it that way

362
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,380
But that led me on to another

363
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:57,140
Uh problem I was hitting api rate limits of one a second on the music brains api

364
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:01,060
Which meant that beats was running really really really slowly

365
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:03,380
I'm talking

366
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:06,500
It would have probably taken several days to import my entire library

367
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:11,380
So linux server also make a self-hosted music brains mirror

368
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:17,220
So i'm now running on my server a local mirror of music brains, which is kind of cool

369
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:19,460
So then you just point beats to that local mirror

370
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:25,380
And you can rate limit to you know, 100 requests a second instead of one so it goes much much faster

371
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:30,660
Oh, that's really cool. I didn't even know you could host that that is a rad little discovery alex

372
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:32,820
Isn't it interesting that you can do that?

373
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:38,580
That is a rad little discovery alex. Isn't it interesting the rabbit hole you ended up going down for this?

374
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:41,460
Just trying to fix metadata to get plexam working

375
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:45,620
anyway, it turned out it was slash temp and all the metadata was fine anyway, so

376
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:48,180
There you go

377
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:52,900
I wonder why people use spotify. I wonder hey while we're talking about you going down rabbit holes

378
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:55,380
traffic 2.2 came out back in march

379
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:58,420
And I think you just recently had a chance to deep dive

380
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:04,020
But I didn't hear how that went the reverse proxy of choice in the kretschmar household for the last

381
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:06,660
Several years has been nginx

382
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:12,260
Um, I don't know sometimes I get itchy feet and I think to myself. Oh the grass is greener over there

383
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:14,820
What if I just use traffic with its super cool?

384
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:21,060
Labels and and I could just define everything in my docker compose file and not have to worry about nginx configs

385
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:26,420
It works great in the studio and it was it was working really really well. I was having a great time until

386
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:31,780
Until and i'm afraid to say until because this is going to be a showstopper for me

387
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:36,340
Until I went to use any container that was in host mode

388
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:38,420
Soon as I did that

389
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:45,140
The container is no longer on the docker network, which is what traffic uses for internal, you know dns

390
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:47,380
It's what it uses for internal communications

391
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,180
It's actually on the host

392
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,980
Network so hence host mode

393
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:59,780
So docker basically can't see it anymore. And as such you can't route any traffic through traffic to the container

394
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:06,260
Which unfortunately means it's no good to me. How many containers are you running in host mode networking plex being one

395
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:10,100
Mostly for some of the upnp stuff it does around the hd home run

396
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:16,100
Yeah, I mean when possible I suppose it's best not to use host networking, but I guess on your lan media box

397
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:20,100
It's not really the end of the world. No, I thought I had more than that. The only one is plex apparently

398
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:24,580
so maybe I should just expose a bunch of individual ports instead of

399
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:30,340
relying on host mode it might not be worth it, but there are a lot of nice advantages to using traffic and

400
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:33,620
If that's all it took I did really like it

401
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:38,580
it took quite a bit to get my head around the kind of concepts of their front ends and back ends and

402
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:41,480
How to get the labels just right specifically

403
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:46,740
An issue I ran into was because v2 only came out in autumn last year

404
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:52,820
An issue I ran into was a lot of the documentation is around v1 and when you're googling for stuff you find syntax

405
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,980
for v1 rather than v2

406
00:31:55,700 --> 00:32:00,340
That's obviously going to improve with time and it's not really a fair criticism of a project that it's you know

407
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,900
developing and changing and improving but

408
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:05,620
what really drew me to traffic was the

409
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,940
kubernetes kind of

410
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:15,220
Cloud router of the future type sales pitch that they're going for at the moment, but I must say it's it's pretty cool

411
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:19,460
you know five or six labels in the compose file that define how the traffic gets routed and

412
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:24,740
It's all in one place and you know from a quick scan. I can see exactly what's going on and

413
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,620
I really like that concept. It's just

414
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,980
Don't know. Maybe I should try to give a bit more of a try chris

415
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:38,260
I'd be curious to hear what you think. I think it'd be interesting to follow up on it. It's also sort of I think good

416
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:41,700
Market research for a guy in your day job position

417
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:45,780
I did see that caddy v2 had a release today as well. So I might go check that out this week

418
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:51,300
Maybe i'll do a little reverse proxy round up next week. Okay. Yeah, that would be great. Totally

419
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:54,500
I would I would be I mean, it's we're nerds, but I'm totally down for that

420
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:58,740
But before we go speaking of new releases pretty excited to see that a roku app

421
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:02,340
Has landed for jellyfin. We'll have a link to that in the show notes

422
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:06,900
I'm super duper excited because this is my second jb prediction that's come true this year

423
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:10,500
I predicted number one that wire guard would be back ported to the

424
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:15,140
Colonel that released with uh, ubuntu 2004. Yep. You did indeed

425
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:21,300
I predicted that jellyfin and mb would start upping their app game and start shipping on some major platforms

426
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:23,540
And I think this is evidence of that so

427
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:29,300
It's down to the referee, you know, i'm not saying i've won the race yet, but it's looking good

428
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:31,700
Well, if you want to be impressed by future alex predictions

Pictures of my delicious barbecue meat smoking adventures. I'm on twitter at ironic badger. Yeah, and they are

436
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:11,540
Very tasty looking I am at chris las

437
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:16,100
Oh, I didn't mention it in the show, but this entire episode is solar powered completely off grid

438
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:20,500
I have a little bit of just enough cell connection to do this

439
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:24,900
And we're watching all of our offline media on my local raspberry pies

440
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:30,020
It's happened gretta thunberg somewhere is is really happy with you. Good job

441
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:34,980
I know project off grid is a resounding success even with an overcast sky

442
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:41,140
We're generating enough solar to top off our battery bank by the end of the day. So no generator

443
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:46,020
Just solar 100 percent. It's so awesome. So i'll have to maybe i'll post a picture

444
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:49,940
Up on twitter. That is really cool. I want to buy solar so bad

445
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:57,540
It's just expensive, you know solar powered self-hosted. So I am at chris las and the show is at self-hosted show

446
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:15,640
On twitter. Thanks for listening everyone. That was self-hosted 18
