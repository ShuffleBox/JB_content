WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.220
We're doing the show from Cheyenne Wyoming and Brent is here in Lady Dupes with me Alex. Hello Brent

00:06.440 --> 00:12.080
Hello guys, I brought him with you know, he's been with us the whole trip Alex. We're in for such a treat tonight

00:12.080 --> 00:14.520
I have two of my best friends in the whole world

00:15.120 --> 00:20.960
My one of my favorite beverages and a self-hosted podcast. This is this is gonna be a perfect episode

00:21.600 --> 00:26.120
Wow, wait a minute though. What's the favorite beverage? I feel like you gotta gotta give us more information

00:26.520 --> 00:28.520
Well, this particular one is non-alcoholic

00:28.520 --> 00:33.880
It's an import. Okay, so I've gone to a lot a lot of effort for this particular beverage

00:34.480 --> 00:39.920
Import from Canada or somewhere further the British people in the audience are gonna laugh their faces off in a minute

00:39.920 --> 00:42.260
It's it's Robinson's squash

00:43.360 --> 00:47.880
You know what that is? No, I gotta look it up. Tell me about it. Okay, so it's just flavored water

00:47.880 --> 00:49.880
Essentially, it's a bit of it's a bit of sugar

00:50.760 --> 00:52.000
with

00:52.000 --> 00:55.840
Apple and blackcurrant flavoring in it and every six months or so

00:55.840 --> 01:00.520
Someone in my family sends me a care package with a few British treats in so some you know

01:00.640 --> 01:08.720
British style Kit Kats because the Kit Kats you have over here a garbage. Mm-hmm. And then also a few of these Robinson's squashed

01:10.240 --> 01:15.160
The this the word squash with an apostrophe and D after the end these little you know

01:15.600 --> 01:20.640
Water flavoring packets you can get and I end up with a you know, the taste of home

01:20.640 --> 01:24.400
It's it's just a little treat. I have every now and again that does sound kind of nice

01:24.400 --> 01:28.560
We have we have we have some some things just like that on board today

01:28.760 --> 01:33.600
Actually, the kids love to drink it while we're going down the road. We've been off grid and to killing it

01:33.600 --> 01:39.440
In fact in some ways, I think I've been not in some ways in every single way. I've enjoyed our off-grid

01:40.040 --> 01:43.560
Random spots that we've stayed along the way more than any of the campgrounds

01:43.720 --> 01:47.040
Some have been forced and some have been planned, but they've all been good

01:47.040 --> 01:50.400
you know there was there was a time where we had to pull over for a bit and

01:50.400 --> 01:54.520
You know, the power system was great. Although we were a little we were a little short on water

01:54.520 --> 01:58.160
The mobile internet system has been killing it though. It's been fantastic

01:58.160 --> 02:05.160
We've had connectivity the entire time everywhere. We've went sometimes better or worse connectivity like here in Cheyenne, Wyoming. We have kind of

02:06.680 --> 02:08.680
Moderate connectivity right now

02:09.120 --> 02:14.080
but even with moderate connectivity you can still use a cloud guru and become a

02:14.080 --> 02:21.360
A cloud guru go over to club guru comm the leader and learning for cloud and Linux and other modern tech skills hundreds of courses

02:21.360 --> 02:26.600
Thousands of hands-on labs get certified get hired get learning at a cloud guru comm

02:27.040 --> 02:34.320
So Alex with our special guest in studio as it were do you have any questions for our our exclusive?

02:34.760 --> 02:38.480
Access to Brent. I mean, when's the last time we've had a chance to sit down and ask him a question

02:38.480 --> 02:42.120
it's been too long for those of you that don't know Brent is the host of

02:42.120 --> 02:45.520
Brunch with Brent which you can find over extras dot show

02:45.920 --> 02:50.680
Now I wanted to ask you Brent you spent a few days now in lady dupes with Chris and the fam

02:51.440 --> 02:53.440
He often goes on about

02:54.280 --> 02:56.880
Accessibility of the home assistant interface and how he's got these

02:57.520 --> 03:00.960
Tablets mounted to the wall and how easy it is to use and blah blah blah

03:00.960 --> 03:07.100
I was curious as to how you found using someone else's automation system

03:07.420 --> 03:11.160
Well, as you know, I don't have an automation system at home

03:11.160 --> 03:14.840
So I'm pretty fresh when it comes to experiencing these things

03:15.400 --> 03:19.400
However, I will say my experience on day one started actually in the studio

03:19.720 --> 03:26.200
He very kindly set up the exact same tablet system in the studio as he did here in lady dupes

03:26.200 --> 03:32.920
So night one I slept over there and had to figure it out. He gave me a 37 second tour

03:33.360 --> 03:37.440
But actually that was enough. It had a familiar enough

03:37.440 --> 03:43.760
On off switch interface with very kind labels that were identical to the voice commands

03:43.760 --> 03:47.360
and so I was able to play a little bit actually I could sort of

03:47.760 --> 03:52.520
Run over there and go see the tablet and what things were named and then use some of the voice commands

03:53.000 --> 03:55.360
And I guess learn myself

03:55.760 --> 04:00.080
The other thing I did is I got one of those wall mount socket mounts for the HomePod mini

04:00.240 --> 04:05.600
So it's plugged in and mounted right there at the wall socket. And so it's in that guest room

04:05.600 --> 04:10.800
So once you learn the names, you can just ask the HomePod to turn things on and off

04:10.800 --> 04:15.080
I do remember when my mother-in-law came to stay once a couple of years ago now

04:15.080 --> 04:19.080
I was just in the throes of doing home assistant, you know, the first few months

04:19.920 --> 04:27.840
Everything I could possibly put behind automation was behind automation including, you know, the light switches the light switches no longer worked and

04:27.840 --> 04:35.320
I just remember hearing through the wall. Hey Google turn off the sodding lights. Yeah

04:37.760 --> 04:41.640
Yeah, you got it the memorizing the names is the hardest part I mean

04:42.120 --> 04:45.080
My wife's been using the automation system for a couple of years now

04:45.080 --> 04:51.640
She still has some troubles with the verbal syntax and in part that's because I've tried all the different

04:52.000 --> 04:56.880
Assistant tubes and so they sometimes have various different syntaxes, but the real systems in the RV

04:56.880 --> 05:02.240
That's like the bigger system. Mm-hmm. I feel like that system in the studio was really the training. It was like

05:02.960 --> 05:04.440
step one

05:04.440 --> 05:10.160
To the system in the RV. And so what was nice about that was that getting here into the RV?

05:10.160 --> 05:12.240
It was like, oh, yeah, you know this tablet thing

05:12.240 --> 05:18.160
It just has a heck of a lot more on the screen, but the same kind of systems apply

05:18.160 --> 05:23.160
and so what I appreciate I think the most about that interface is its simplicity and

05:23.160 --> 05:29.480
It's categorization. So Chris has the systems categorized by either living space or

05:30.200 --> 05:32.200
what their use is and

05:33.040 --> 05:38.080
So the first few nights I would walk all the way back there just to turn the lights on but these days

05:38.400 --> 05:42.800
Feels a lot easier now, you know the names and they can just bark it into the air

05:44.200 --> 05:50.080
Are you tempted at all to retrofit the cabin that you live in with with any of this stuff?

05:50.080 --> 05:53.960
That's a very good question. So that hadn't quite hit me yet

05:53.960 --> 05:58.600
But now I'm beginning to realize all of the advantages

05:58.920 --> 06:03.880
So for instance Chris has shown me, you know, he gave me the geek tour and he's given other people the geek tour

06:03.880 --> 06:09.360
So I've been on it a few times and there are sensors in various bays on the RV

06:10.080 --> 06:13.000
That give temperature and in my home

06:13.000 --> 06:16.280
I'm got these thermometers all over the place

06:16.280 --> 06:20.600
But I got to actually, you know go up the stairs into my loft to go check out if the fire is too hot up

06:20.600 --> 06:22.600
There and like an animal

06:23.680 --> 06:27.840
So, yeah, I know I could see now

06:29.120 --> 06:32.400
The two systems in juxtaposition where I could really gain some

06:33.120 --> 06:37.560
Some currency there because we've talked a lot about how you in particular

06:38.040 --> 06:41.640
can dip your toes into more self-hosting stuff and I feel like you're

06:41.640 --> 06:48.640
Curious and you want to do this stuff, but you just don't quite know how to break down that first barrier and kind of

06:49.000 --> 06:56.480
Get going. I think if I had to pick the very first barrier that's keeping me from it the most it would be the server side

06:56.960 --> 07:02.680
It would be getting in there and creating a server that's stable enough and safe enough that I feel like

07:03.240 --> 07:06.160
I'm not getting myself in more trouble than not. Mm-hmm

07:06.160 --> 07:12.840
This is where I think the home assistant blue or something like it eventually is gonna be it's such an easy

07:13.280 --> 07:18.920
on-ramp for a guy like you because you know about home assistant now you've you've seen my home assistant setup and

07:19.560 --> 07:23.880
The fact that there is a an official home assistant device that runs the whole stack

07:24.440 --> 07:25.720
That's that's pretty compelling

07:25.720 --> 07:29.880
I don't know if the price points right yet or you know if it's quite the right device yet

07:29.880 --> 07:33.440
But I could definitely see that being a good starting spot though, you know

07:33.440 --> 07:36.320
I think that maybe you guys are on to something I have

07:36.960 --> 07:44.360
At least two very good mentors who can walk me through some of the glitches if any but it sounds also like these days

07:44.360 --> 07:49.400
You know, I've been hearing you guys talk about this for years, but it sounds like these days things are pretty solid

07:49.400 --> 07:53.440
So I feel like for me, maybe then that was a nice time to jump in

07:53.640 --> 07:55.000
Yeah, and you could always start small

07:55.000 --> 08:01.360
Um, you'd be surprised to how many things homo system might just pick up on a LAN automatically and suggest integrations for and it's never

08:01.360 --> 08:04.600
Been a better time to take local stuff. Seriously

08:04.600 --> 08:04.800
I mean

08:04.800 --> 08:11.360
I don't know if you saw the Apple news that broke over the last week or two about their expanded protections for children

08:11.360 --> 08:15.240
In other words, they're going to scan all of your pictures for kiddie porn, right?

08:15.240 --> 08:19.480
and it always starts this way and I I really hate this kind of

08:21.080 --> 08:24.100
Insidious way that big companies will roll out

08:24.100 --> 08:32.020
Overreaching egregious things like this in the name of you know, child porn because who could possibly disagree with child porn

08:32.020 --> 08:36.900
The other thing about those integrations. It feels to me like it is

08:37.900 --> 08:44.100
Affecting many people to solve the problems of few. Absolutely. No wonder about that

08:44.100 --> 08:51.100
Yeah, I mean so as Apple put it our goal is to create technology that empowers people and enriches their lives

08:51.100 --> 08:59.100
We want to help protect children from predators and those who use communication tools to recruit and exploit them and limit the spread of

08:59.100 --> 09:02.100
CSAM, you know child sexual abuse material

09:02.100 --> 09:08.100
Obviously, that's a laudable goal and we can't legitimately sit here and say that that is not a laudable goal

09:08.100 --> 09:14.100
However, the way in which they're doing it. I have significant issues with so

09:14.100 --> 09:23.100
What they're doing is they're taking every photo that you have on your iPhone or iPad that is linked to an iCloud account and

09:23.100 --> 09:32.100
Scanning it on your local device and this entire announcement has been extremely complicated and confusing because they've really announced three things

09:32.100 --> 09:40.100
They've announced iMessage image detection for child accounts in a family plan. They've announced iCloud

09:40.100 --> 09:44.100
Photo library scanning on your local device

09:44.100 --> 09:49.100
In other words, if you have iCloud photo library turned on locally on your device

09:49.100 --> 09:56.100
It will scan and check for matches in the CSAM database. And then the third thing they've announced is they're also going to start censoring

09:56.100 --> 10:05.100
Results in Siri search. So if you search for something like child porn and it matches that stuff series going to block that and this is all happening

10:05.100 --> 10:11.100
Using that new neural processing area in the Apple processors that they love to break so much

10:11.100 --> 10:16.100
It's accelerating this and I find this to be an extremely extremely slippery slope

10:16.100 --> 10:20.100
And I know that the other side of the argument is is that child harm is real

10:20.100 --> 10:29.100
So one interesting stat you've probably seen this floating around is Apple reports a couple of hundred incidents of child porn and iMessage a year

10:29.100 --> 10:38.100
A couple hundred a year and Facebook Messenger because they are already using the CSAM scanner reports 20 million

10:38.100 --> 10:45.100
It's a huge difference and you've got to figure people that are using Facebook are probably on iPhones or Android devices

10:45.100 --> 10:52.100
So there's probably a lot of iPhone users if 20 million Facebook messaging flags have happened

10:52.100 --> 10:59.100
Whatever that is whatever that metric is there's a good chance that they were using iPhones and that that stuff's on their phone

10:59.100 --> 11:03.100
Now the thing is is it's not going to matter if they don't turn on iPhoto library

11:03.100 --> 11:10.100
And if you are a big child porn collector I wouldn't imagine you're probably using iCloud's photo library feature

11:10.100 --> 11:14.100
You probably wouldn't be auto uploading your child porn to their server right

11:14.100 --> 11:18.100
I think you might be surprised actually I bet you there's a lot of people out there

11:18.100 --> 11:24.100
Using technology just with for the bare minimum just to get what they need done and not understanding like we do the underlying principles

11:24.100 --> 11:30.100
And yeah I guess and I suppose it's so easy to turn that stuff on you turn on iCloud when you get your phone

11:30.100 --> 11:35.100
You don't realize every picture you're taking I suppose especially if you're taking the pictures with the phone

11:35.100 --> 11:42.100
But an important thing to realize is the CSAM detection is only looking for images that are in the database

11:42.100 --> 11:50.100
It's not doing like some sort of flesh recognition algorithm and detecting 80 percent nakedness on a 10 year old like it's not doing that

11:50.100 --> 11:58.100
It is looking at a hash that has been provided by CSAM which they then only look for those images

11:58.100 --> 12:04.100
And so it doesn't really feel that effective if you combine the fact that people can just turn off iCloud photo library

12:04.100 --> 12:08.100
And it's only looking for the CSAM photos that exist today

12:08.100 --> 12:16.100
It seems like a limited reach, limited return for a massive increase in surveillance on people's devices

12:16.100 --> 12:21.100
And Alex I think it sounds like it bothers you that it's actually happening on device

12:21.100 --> 12:24.100
Like you'd almost be more comfortable if it was happening up in the cloud it sounds like

12:24.100 --> 12:33.100
I think I would and for me this feels like a capitulation to wider pressures that are at play

12:33.100 --> 12:41.100
If you're Apple you probably get a lot of requests from different governments, different organizations

12:41.100 --> 12:45.100
To put back doors into your end-to-end encryption algorithms

12:45.100 --> 12:50.100
And for me I think this is their way of saying no we're not going to do that

12:50.100 --> 12:57.100
But what we are going to do is say we have some protections in place for the stuff that you say is actually bad

12:57.100 --> 13:02.100
As opposed to terrorists or whatever the next excuse is going to be

13:02.100 --> 13:08.100
Right, you say you need a backdoor for child porn so we are going to build a system that automatically detects it

13:08.100 --> 13:12.100
And then your excuse for a backdoor goes away, it's nullified

13:12.100 --> 13:14.100
And then you have to move on to the next one

13:14.100 --> 13:18.100
But what bothers me most is there was an ad campaign not that long ago that says

13:18.100 --> 13:24.100
What happens on your iPhone stays on your phone as part of their privacy message

13:24.100 --> 13:29.100
This feels to me like it crosses a line because the scanning is happening on the local device

13:29.100 --> 13:37.100
I don't necessarily opt in quite as obviously as I would if say my stuff was being uploaded to a remote server

13:37.100 --> 13:44.100
Like Facebook is a good example, if I upload something to Facebook in my mind I consider that now public domain

13:44.100 --> 13:48.100
Whatever the privacy controls that Facebook say is there

13:48.100 --> 13:52.100
And it was an implicit action as well, you're choosing to upload to Facebook

13:52.100 --> 13:57.100
It's a manual action you're taking where iCloud photo library is kind of a built-in default

13:57.100 --> 14:01.100
You have to be an iCloud user and you can go in there and turn it on and off

14:01.100 --> 14:07.100
But if you sign up for the whole shebang you're going to get iCloud photo and every photo you take goes in there

14:07.100 --> 14:11.100
Like you said it's just a very, very slippery slope

14:11.100 --> 14:15.100
This year it's child pornography, next year it's terrorists

14:15.100 --> 14:22.100
In 20 years time it's monitoring a social credit score because you said something bad about the president

14:22.100 --> 14:23.100
That's what I worry about

14:23.100 --> 14:27.100
It's also true that these are only the things that they're saying they're scanning for

14:27.100 --> 14:29.100
We don't know about the things they are not saying

14:29.100 --> 14:36.100
Right and if you go by the docs that Apple has released they don't even have input in that CSAM database

14:36.100 --> 14:41.100
They're basically just being handed a list of hashes, here put this in your database

14:41.100 --> 14:45.100
Now I have to say I am actually more comfortable with this being on device

14:45.100 --> 14:50.100
I think because it limits the scale and scope of something when it's on device

14:50.100 --> 14:54.100
A big database update or a feature like this is going to have to come through a software update

14:54.100 --> 14:58.100
Where if it was a cloud service they would just push the update and one day I would be subject to it

14:58.100 --> 15:04.100
So I kind of prefer those aspects and I think it also does help with the privacy aspect

15:04.100 --> 15:07.100
They're not having to unencrypt everything on iCloud to do this

15:07.100 --> 15:09.100
They're doing it on your device that already has access

15:09.100 --> 15:14.100
And then they're pinging Apple with a hey we think we found a match here

15:14.100 --> 15:18.100
Apple then has to have some sort of human interact with that alert

15:18.100 --> 15:21.100
There's various descriptions of what kind of alert they get

15:21.100 --> 15:23.100
And then Apple flags the authorities

15:23.100 --> 15:25.100
And it does seem like they've taken a lot of steps here

15:25.100 --> 15:29.100
They've limited the way they check this, they're looking for specific fingerprints

15:29.100 --> 15:33.100
And then they have this cryptographic signature that they assign to it when they think they have found one

15:33.100 --> 15:35.100
And that's what they send up to Apple

15:35.100 --> 15:37.100
Then it's reviewed by a human

15:37.100 --> 15:39.100
It's happening on your device instead of at cloud

15:39.100 --> 15:43.100
And you can turn it off by turning off iCloud photo library

15:43.100 --> 15:49.100
Is this a reasonable compromise if the platform, let's just say for the sake of argument

15:49.100 --> 15:55.100
Is really being used for child abuse at some massive scale because of the popularity of the platform

15:55.100 --> 15:57.100
Is this a reasonable thing for them to do?

15:57.100 --> 16:02.100
Do they have some responsibility as a platform owner with a billion devices out there

16:02.100 --> 16:06.100
To take some action to try to maybe stop something like this?

16:06.100 --> 16:10.100
Well I look at that 20 million figure that you came out with for Facebook

16:10.100 --> 16:15.100
And divide that by 365 and that's 55,000 flags a day

16:15.100 --> 16:19.100
Who is reviewing 55,000 flags a day?

16:19.100 --> 16:23.100
That's just a crazy amount of signal to noise ratio isn't it?

16:23.100 --> 16:24.100
No kidding

16:24.100 --> 16:27.100
Well and can you imagine when they turn this on

16:27.100 --> 16:31.100
The initial, if this is going to be a thing and it's a real big problem

16:31.100 --> 16:36.100
You would think they're going to have just this massive deluge of alerts

16:36.100 --> 16:38.100
And I just wouldn't want that job

16:38.100 --> 16:44.100
Well I've certainly been on the other end of logging overload or alert overload

16:44.100 --> 16:46.100
You just stop looking after a while

16:46.100 --> 16:49.100
And you know the other reality is several cloud providers

16:49.100 --> 16:52.100
I think many, I don't want to name them off the top of my head

16:52.100 --> 16:56.100
But I know Facebook and Microsoft are already doing this scanning

16:56.100 --> 16:58.100
They're already doing this

16:58.100 --> 17:00.100
Apple was one of sort of the holdouts here

17:00.100 --> 17:03.100
So it really comes back to if you're not comfortable with this

17:03.100 --> 17:06.100
You really have to self host

17:06.100 --> 17:08.100
And you have to advocate self hosting

17:08.100 --> 17:11.100
Because that's the only way you can avoid this kind of content scanning

17:11.100 --> 17:14.100
And if you're worried about the slippery slope of what could be added to this database

17:14.100 --> 17:18.100
Then I think people should really be, I don't know like

17:18.100 --> 17:20.100
When you can, self host

17:20.100 --> 17:24.100
Like invest in self hosting, use it, make an audience for it out there

17:24.100 --> 17:27.100
Absolutely and on that note actually

17:27.100 --> 17:30.100
I thought we might try doing a new challenge in the show

17:30.100 --> 17:34.100
The de-Googlification challenge

17:34.100 --> 17:37.100
I need to come up with a better name than that, don't I?

17:37.100 --> 17:39.100
I don't know, I actually kind of like it

17:39.100 --> 17:41.100
Because I know what you mean immediately

17:41.100 --> 17:43.100
Yeah, so the idea is

17:43.100 --> 17:47.100
I'm not going to be able to just cold turkey drop Google from my life

17:47.100 --> 17:51.100
Because I use Gmail and I have done for 15 years or however long

17:51.100 --> 17:54.100
I've been using it a long time, since the beta anyway

17:54.100 --> 17:56.100
I use Google Photos a lot

17:56.100 --> 17:59.100
I use Google, you know, it's going to be tricky

17:59.100 --> 18:01.100
I'm not going to pull any punches

18:01.100 --> 18:03.100
It's going to be very difficult

18:03.100 --> 18:06.100
But the idea is, one day a week

18:06.100 --> 18:09.100
I am going to go completely cold turkey from Google

18:09.100 --> 18:11.100
That's DuckDuckGo

18:11.100 --> 18:13.100
That's a self hosted note service

18:13.100 --> 18:16.100
A self hosted photo service completely

18:16.100 --> 18:18.100
No Google photo backup etc etc

18:18.100 --> 18:20.100
No Gmail

18:20.100 --> 18:22.100
And no Android

18:22.100 --> 18:25.100
Well, technically I'm going to be using LineageOS

18:25.100 --> 18:29.100
And I think the only thing that I will allow in terms of de-Googlifying

18:29.100 --> 18:34.100
Is the micro Gapps thing through

18:34.100 --> 18:38.100
So for the very first iteration of this

18:38.100 --> 18:41.100
It will probably be in episode 53

18:41.100 --> 18:44.100
This is 51, just because I'm going to Denver next week

18:44.100 --> 18:46.100
To see you two fine gentlemen

18:46.100 --> 18:49.100
And I probably won't have time to do the full research on this

18:49.100 --> 18:51.100
But I have an old OnePlus 6 in a drawer

18:51.100 --> 18:57.100
I'm going to designate that as my de-Googlify device

18:57.100 --> 18:58.100
What do you think?

18:58.100 --> 19:00.100
I mean, I love this idea

19:00.100 --> 19:03.100
I have an Android device, it's a Pixel 3

19:03.100 --> 19:07.100
But I've always struggled with replacing the ROM on there

19:07.100 --> 19:09.100
Because the reason I have it

19:09.100 --> 19:11.100
Is to kind of know what the Google experience is like

19:11.100 --> 19:13.100
But I'd be down for it

19:13.100 --> 19:15.100
I'd give it a try

19:15.100 --> 19:17.100
I'm trying to run through my head

19:17.100 --> 19:20.100
My biggest area where I worry this is going to lead to

19:20.100 --> 19:24.100
Is I use Google Apps for Jupiter broadcasting

19:24.100 --> 19:27.100
For like email and calendar and stuff like that

19:27.100 --> 19:30.100
And I think it's kind of a decent service

19:30.100 --> 19:31.100
I hate to say it

19:31.100 --> 19:33.100
Oh right, calendar

19:33.100 --> 19:36.100
I'd forgotten about calendar, I use that all the time

19:36.100 --> 19:38.100
Even stupid stuff like contacts

19:38.100 --> 19:41.100
You kind of forget that they're just managing my contacts for me on that

19:41.100 --> 19:44.100
Oh gentlemen, you guys are so behind the times

19:44.100 --> 19:45.100
Oh, oh what?

19:45.100 --> 19:47.100
You all in our next cloud over there?

19:47.100 --> 19:51.100
Well, I ran through this very experiment many years ago

19:51.100 --> 19:52.100
I'll have you know

19:52.100 --> 19:54.100
Could you sound any more smug right now?

19:54.100 --> 19:58.100
Well, it's only because you guys are both

19:58.100 --> 20:01.100
Typically far ahead of me in most other realms

20:01.100 --> 20:04.100
He's enjoying this moment too much Alex

20:04.100 --> 20:06.100
He's enjoying this

20:06.100 --> 20:08.100
Well good, I want to hear it

20:08.100 --> 20:10.100
I did a similar challenge

20:10.100 --> 20:12.100
I didn't have anyone else to challenge

20:12.100 --> 20:14.100
I just challenged myself

20:14.100 --> 20:18.100
And I will say it's been actually a few years now

20:18.100 --> 20:21.100
I think two, two and a half, something like that

20:21.100 --> 20:25.100
And next cloud I will say is the underpinning of most of it

20:25.100 --> 20:29.100
Most of the hard stuff which was calendaring and contact syncing

20:29.100 --> 20:31.100
You know when it comes to file syncing

20:31.100 --> 20:34.100
I can figure that out in a whole bunch of different ways

20:34.100 --> 20:38.100
But I will strongly encourage you both to take it pretty seriously

20:38.100 --> 20:42.100
Because on the other side is a fairly liberating feeling

20:42.100 --> 20:48.100
To know that you have control of all of your own deeply personal information

20:48.100 --> 20:50.100
I mean something like contacts

20:50.100 --> 20:52.100
If you think about the people you know

20:52.100 --> 20:54.100
And the sensitive information that's in there

20:54.100 --> 20:58.100
It's a little bit surprising to think about what might happen

20:58.100 --> 21:00.100
If that got into someone else's hands

21:00.100 --> 21:03.100
That would like to mix up your life a little bit

21:03.100 --> 21:05.100
Well you heard it here first ladies and gentlemen

21:05.100 --> 21:08.100
Brent is our de-Googlification referee

21:08.100 --> 21:12.100
Yeah, he'll be our correspondent in the de-Googled universe

21:12.100 --> 21:15.100
Reporting live from an alternative universe

21:15.100 --> 21:18.100
So the thing is, I mean there's so many things to this

21:18.100 --> 21:22.100
There's maps, Google Maps is so priceless

21:22.100 --> 21:25.100
Maps? Oh no

21:25.100 --> 21:26.100
I know

21:26.100 --> 21:28.100
And you could, like if you're on the iPhone

21:28.100 --> 21:30.100
You could use Apple Maps, you could

21:30.100 --> 21:32.100
And in the RV I've got a Garmin

21:32.100 --> 21:35.100
But I tell you what, when I get to a new town

21:35.100 --> 21:39.100
And like legitimately has happened several times on this road trip

21:39.100 --> 21:42.100
I trust Google Maps to have the most up to date information

21:42.100 --> 21:44.100
That's going to be really hard for me to kick

21:44.100 --> 21:47.100
I really haven't thought this through, this is going to be so hard

21:47.100 --> 21:51.100
Well I can give you a few pointers based on what I've gone through

21:51.100 --> 21:53.100
Are you not using Google Maps?

21:53.100 --> 21:58.100
Well, so that's a really good example of I think the concept I'm about to explain

21:58.100 --> 22:07.100
And so I'll start with saying that I use the exact same concept with my dietary choices

22:07.100 --> 22:10.100
So when people say, oh how do you eat Brent?

22:10.100 --> 22:17.100
I say well, I'm like trying my very best to eat as vegan as possible

22:17.100 --> 22:19.100
But that never always works out

22:19.100 --> 22:22.100
So what I would say for you both in de-Googlifying

22:22.100 --> 22:26.100
Is you'll never likely get to 100%

22:26.100 --> 22:29.100
And you need to be okay with that

22:29.100 --> 22:34.100
Because if you can do it even 80, 90, 95% of the time

22:34.100 --> 22:38.100
And only rely on Google in certain instances

22:38.100 --> 22:45.100
Maybe when Maps in Google has the only updated information on this new ring road around your city

22:45.100 --> 22:47.100
And nobody else does or something like that

22:47.100 --> 22:50.100
Then I think you're already making a massive difference in your life

22:50.100 --> 22:54.100
And you shouldn't feel bad about that 5% or whatever it may be

22:54.100 --> 22:56.100
Amen, yeah absolutely

22:56.100 --> 23:00.100
So the idea behind this challenge is to do exactly what we've just done

23:00.100 --> 23:03.100
Pick a service, in this case it was Google as a whole

23:03.100 --> 23:06.100
But let's take Maps as an example

23:06.100 --> 23:09.100
Discuss what would be required to drop that service

23:09.100 --> 23:11.100
Figure out in the intervening two weeks

23:11.100 --> 23:15.100
Some options we could use to try and replace it with

23:15.100 --> 23:19.100
And then in the following episode repeat that cycle

23:19.100 --> 23:21.100
Pick a new service and report back on how the old one went

23:21.100 --> 23:24.100
I mean I kind of feel like if I was going to do it

23:24.100 --> 23:26.100
I could try Maps while I'm on the road

23:26.100 --> 23:31.100
Like this is an opportunity to try alternative mapping and routing

23:31.100 --> 23:33.100
I know there's a few apps I could give a go

23:33.100 --> 23:36.100
Maybe I'll try, this is going to be crazy, but while I'm on the road trip

23:36.100 --> 23:39.100
I'll try for the next two weeks not to use Google Maps

23:39.100 --> 23:40.100
See how that goes

23:40.100 --> 23:41.100
Go for it, yeah

23:41.100 --> 23:44.100
I have a question about your choices of alternatives

23:44.100 --> 23:47.100
Will you try to make them free and open source

23:47.100 --> 23:51.100
Or just try to be an equivalent replacement?

23:51.100 --> 23:54.100
What's the name of the show, Brent?

23:54.100 --> 23:58.100
I'm thinking like for mapping, I don't know what would be even equivalent

23:58.100 --> 24:02.100
I think it's not so much equivalent, it's about just core functionality

24:02.100 --> 24:03.100
There's always MapQuest

24:03.100 --> 24:06.100
Yeah, and I feel like switching to Google Search to look things up

24:06.100 --> 24:08.100
Isn't an alternative that I can accept either

24:08.100 --> 24:09.100
So I'll have to give it some thought

24:09.100 --> 24:10.100
I will have to give it some thought

24:10.100 --> 24:12.100
I'm going to look into a couple of different apps for it

24:12.100 --> 24:15.100
And I'm also going to look into how Apple Maps works

24:15.100 --> 24:17.100
And see what the privacy situation is there

24:17.100 --> 24:19.100
Because that's also already on my device

24:19.100 --> 24:20.100
That's a factor too

24:20.100 --> 24:22.100
It's like you're saying, I love your point about

24:22.100 --> 24:25.100
You could just reduce your footprint at Google

24:25.100 --> 24:28.100
If that's the goal, I think that's something I could get behind

24:28.100 --> 24:32.100
But it doesn't necessarily mean I want to increase my footprint somewhere else

24:32.100 --> 24:34.100
So that's the math I'm going to have to do

24:34.100 --> 24:37.100
I don't mind taking two steps forward and one step back

24:37.100 --> 24:39.100
With this over the next few years

24:39.100 --> 24:41.100
Because that's how long I genuinely think it will take

24:41.100 --> 24:43.100
I just worry, you know, you see people like Apple

24:43.100 --> 24:50.100
Who were genuinely supposed to be the privacy first people

24:50.100 --> 24:52.100
Rolling out stuff like this CSAM protections

24:52.100 --> 24:56.100
And you just think, yeah, it's never going to get any better

24:56.100 --> 24:58.100
It's up to me to take control

24:58.100 --> 25:00.100
It's up to me to host this stuff

25:00.100 --> 25:04.100
And if I take my daughter, for example

25:04.100 --> 25:07.100
I think there's one photograph of her on Facebook

25:07.100 --> 25:09.100
One in the last six months

25:09.100 --> 25:11.100
And I want to keep it as low as that

25:11.100 --> 25:12.100
One every six months

25:12.100 --> 25:16.100
I mean, why does Facebook need all of that data to mine on her?

25:16.100 --> 25:18.100
So it's not her choice

25:18.100 --> 25:19.100
She can't make that choice yet

25:19.100 --> 25:21.100
Because she's six months old, you know

25:21.100 --> 25:23.100
When she's old enough to make that choice for herself

25:23.100 --> 25:24.100
And understand the implications

25:24.100 --> 25:26.100
Then fair enough

25:26.100 --> 25:29.100
But it's not really my place to share her pictures everywhere, is it?

25:31.100 --> 25:33.100
Linode.com slash SSH

25:33.100 --> 25:36.100
Go there to get $100 in 60-day credit on a new account

25:36.100 --> 25:39.100
And you go there to support this here podcast

25:39.100 --> 25:40.100
You know, this show is made possible

25:40.100 --> 25:42.100
Independent content like this

25:42.100 --> 25:46.100
By our listeners taking advantage of our sponsors' offer

25:46.100 --> 25:49.100
And Linode is one that we can enthusiastically endorse

25:49.100 --> 25:51.100
We use it, we love it

25:51.100 --> 25:53.100
It is powering our live tracker right now

25:53.100 --> 25:54.100
As we go down the road

25:54.100 --> 25:56.100
Linode started in 2003

25:56.100 --> 25:58.100
As one of the very first companies in cloud computing

25:58.100 --> 26:00.100
You know, that was 18 years ago

26:00.100 --> 26:03.100
That's like a whole other internet

26:03.100 --> 26:05.100
And the entire time they've stayed competitive

26:05.100 --> 26:08.100
They've increased the capabilities

26:08.100 --> 26:09.100
The performance

26:09.100 --> 26:11.100
The smooth slickness of the dashboard

26:11.100 --> 26:14.100
Over time, they became their own ISP

26:14.100 --> 26:16.100
They've built out to 11 data centers around the world

26:16.100 --> 26:18.100
Super crazy fast systems

26:18.100 --> 26:21.100
They're always investing in the disk I.O.

26:21.100 --> 26:22.100
In the CPUs

26:22.100 --> 26:23.100
In the network connections

26:23.100 --> 26:25.100
And now, they've got nearly a million customers

26:25.100 --> 26:27.100
And businesses around the globe

26:27.100 --> 26:30.100
But yet, Linode's core focus remains

26:30.100 --> 26:33.100
They're making cloud computing simple

26:33.100 --> 26:35.100
Affordable

26:35.100 --> 26:36.100
And really accessible to all of us

26:36.100 --> 26:38.100
If you're a sys admin that's been doing this for years

26:38.100 --> 26:40.100
Or if you've never set up a server

26:40.100 --> 26:42.100
You can get started at Linode

26:42.100 --> 26:45.100
And I think that focus has really led to the best-in-class

26:45.100 --> 26:46.100
Dashboard

26:46.100 --> 26:47.100
Speed

26:47.100 --> 26:48.100
And more importantly, customer service

26:48.100 --> 26:50.100
When you do need it

26:50.100 --> 26:52.100
They've got the very best in the business

26:52.100 --> 26:54.100
And then, as you start to use Linode

26:54.100 --> 26:56.100
Or something you could use that $100 credit to check out

26:56.100 --> 26:58.100
Is some of their nice features

26:58.100 --> 27:01.100
Like the S3-compatible object storage

27:01.100 --> 27:03.100
Think about all of the software

27:03.100 --> 27:04.100
Like the backup software you have

27:04.100 --> 27:06.100
Or different ways you can mount file systems

27:06.100 --> 27:09.100
That support S3-compatible object storage

27:09.100 --> 27:11.100
Start thinking about what you could do with that

27:11.100 --> 27:13.100
Not even from like a server standpoint

27:13.100 --> 27:15.100
But just like a cloud storage standpoint that you control

27:15.100 --> 27:16.100
You encrypt

27:16.100 --> 27:17.100
And then you upload

27:17.100 --> 27:18.100
Plus, they have cloud firewalls

27:18.100 --> 27:19.100
VLAN support

27:19.100 --> 27:21.100
They support a very powerful DNS manager

27:21.100 --> 27:23.100
Block storage as well

27:23.100 --> 27:25.100
I know some of you still prefer the traditional disk

27:25.100 --> 27:26.100
They've got that

27:26.100 --> 27:29.100
And then they also support things like Terraform and Kubernetes

27:29.100 --> 27:30.100
If that

27:30.100 --> 27:31.100
Kubernetes

27:31.100 --> 27:32.100
I say Kubernetes

27:32.100 --> 27:33.100
If that's the direction you're going

27:33.100 --> 27:34.100
They've got all of that

27:34.100 --> 27:36.100
And you combine that with the fact that you can get $100

27:36.100 --> 27:39.100
And support the self-hosted podcast

27:39.100 --> 27:42.100
Well, what kind of maniac wouldn't go to linode.com

27:42.100 --> 27:43.100
Slash SSH

27:43.100 --> 27:46.100
Get that $100 60-day credit on your new account

27:46.100 --> 27:47.100
And you support the show

27:47.100 --> 27:48.100
And by the way

27:48.100 --> 27:51.100
If you're coming to our Denver meetup next week

27:51.100 --> 27:52.100
Linode will be there

27:52.100 --> 27:54.100
They're going to be giving out prizes

27:54.100 --> 27:55.100
Linode credit

27:55.100 --> 27:56.100
Raspberry pies

27:56.100 --> 27:59.100
I mean, Linode is going all in on our road trip

27:59.100 --> 28:00.100
And they're helping support it

28:00.100 --> 28:01.100
It's great

28:01.100 --> 28:02.100
And we'd love to see you at the meetup

28:02.100 --> 28:04.100
That's linode.com slash SSH

28:04.100 --> 28:07.100
To get $100 in 60-day credit on a new account

28:07.100 --> 28:08.100
And to support the show

28:08.100 --> 28:11.100
Linode.com slash SSH

28:13.100 --> 28:16.100
I know you've got this whole road trip prep ritual

28:16.100 --> 28:18.100
Where you update things a couple of nights before

28:18.100 --> 28:20.100
In critical systems the week before

28:20.100 --> 28:22.100
And all this kind of stuff

28:22.100 --> 28:24.100
What did you upgrade this time?

28:24.100 --> 28:25.100
You are correct

28:25.100 --> 28:29.100
And yes, I did do some updates

28:29.100 --> 28:31.100
This time, you know what I wanted to do

28:31.100 --> 28:33.100
Is I wanted to try out the new Pi-hole

28:33.100 --> 28:35.100
Because I was sniffing around

28:35.100 --> 28:36.100
Pi-hole is one of these things

28:36.100 --> 28:38.100
For those of you who maybe are not familiar

28:38.100 --> 28:39.100
Pi-hole is

28:39.100 --> 28:41.100
It's like a nice DNS manager that can block ads

28:41.100 --> 28:44.100
Maybe block adult material

28:44.100 --> 28:46.100
Has a lot of advantages

28:46.100 --> 28:47.100
It's also a DHCP server

28:47.100 --> 28:49.100
So it can hand out addressing

28:49.100 --> 28:51.100
And then give your systems on your network names

28:51.100 --> 28:53.100
And it gives you a beautiful dashboard

28:53.100 --> 28:54.100
To see everything on there

28:54.100 --> 28:56.100
It just checks all my boxes

28:56.100 --> 28:58.100
And you can run it as a Docker container

28:58.100 --> 29:00.100
Which is what I'm doing on a Raspberry Pi

29:00.100 --> 29:03.100
And I have version 4 on there forever

29:03.100 --> 29:05.100
Since I talked about it on the show

29:05.100 --> 29:06.100
And it's just been running

29:06.100 --> 29:07.100
I don't even mess with it

29:07.100 --> 29:08.100
But I thought

29:08.100 --> 29:10.100
You know what I want to do on this road trip

29:10.100 --> 29:12.100
Because I'm an old man

29:12.100 --> 29:14.100
And I go to bed, as Brent could attest

29:14.100 --> 29:15.100
Really early

29:15.100 --> 29:16.100
Quite

29:16.100 --> 29:18.100
I've had to change my schedule

29:18.100 --> 29:19.100
When do you normally go to bed?

29:19.100 --> 29:21.100
Well, if left to my own devices

29:21.100 --> 29:24.100
I drift deep into the night

29:24.100 --> 29:27.100
But that doesn't serve most people around me

29:27.100 --> 29:28.100
Yeah, we're doing like what?

29:28.100 --> 29:30.100
9, 10 PM at the latest

29:30.100 --> 29:33.100
And so I don't want the kids up much later than that

29:33.100 --> 29:34.100
Browsing the internet

29:34.100 --> 29:36.100
Because they can just get their devices

29:36.100 --> 29:37.100
After dad nods off

29:37.100 --> 29:39.100
And start browsing the web

29:39.100 --> 29:41.100
Or watching YouTube more likely

29:41.100 --> 29:42.100
Let's be honest

29:42.100 --> 29:44.100
And so I wanted to be able to pause their devices

29:44.100 --> 29:46.100
And I had read that you could do that in PyHole

29:46.100 --> 29:48.100
But I logged into my PyHole setup

29:48.100 --> 29:50.100
And I had just done a Docker poll

29:50.100 --> 29:53.100
So it should be totally up to date

29:53.100 --> 29:54.100
And I log in

29:54.100 --> 29:56.100
And it's several versions behind

29:56.100 --> 29:59.100
And I'm looking at my Docker compose file

29:59.100 --> 30:01.100
And I see it's using the latest tag

30:01.100 --> 30:02.100
You know, for the latest image

30:02.100 --> 30:03.100
And I think

30:03.100 --> 30:04.100
Okay, well, why aren't I getting that?

30:04.100 --> 30:05.100
I'm starting to think

30:05.100 --> 30:07.100
Maybe there's some compatibility problem

30:07.100 --> 30:09.100
So I start looking into it

30:09.100 --> 30:10.100
And it turns out

30:10.100 --> 30:12.100
No, I'm using the wrong tag

30:12.100 --> 30:14.100
I was supposed to be using PyHole Master

30:14.100 --> 30:15.100
Arm64 Buster

30:15.100 --> 30:17.100
Because I'm on a Buster-based Debian

30:17.100 --> 30:19.100
And so I set the right tag in there

30:19.100 --> 30:20.100
I get the right image

30:20.100 --> 30:22.100
I pull down version 5

30:22.100 --> 30:24.100
It's like version 5.3 or whatever

30:24.100 --> 30:25.100
Working great

30:25.100 --> 30:26.100
The upgrade goes super smooth

30:26.100 --> 30:28.100
You know, congrats to the PyHole team

30:28.100 --> 30:29.100
For making that easy

30:29.100 --> 30:31.100
And yet I can't pause the devices

30:31.100 --> 30:33.100
Like I read like I should be able to

30:33.100 --> 30:36.100
I grouped up the kids' devices by Mac addresses

30:36.100 --> 30:37.100
I go into their group

30:37.100 --> 30:38.100
I say disable

30:38.100 --> 30:40.100
And I think what I'm just doing is disabling

30:40.100 --> 30:41.100
The PyHole filtering

30:41.100 --> 30:43.100
I don't think I'm disabling their internet access

30:43.100 --> 30:45.100
So I went through this whole rigamarole

30:45.100 --> 30:46.100
Getting this whole system updated

30:46.100 --> 30:48.100
So that way we'd have the latest PyHole

30:48.100 --> 30:49.100
While we're going down the road

30:49.100 --> 30:50.100
Because my theory is

30:50.100 --> 30:52.100
Let's block the ads at the network level

30:52.100 --> 30:54.100
So that way I'm not wasting network bandwidth

30:54.100 --> 30:56.100
You know, because we have limited network bandwidth

30:56.100 --> 30:57.100
Anything I can do

30:57.100 --> 30:59.100
So PyHole, it's working great

30:59.100 --> 31:01.100
But it's not giving me the results I wanted

31:01.100 --> 31:03.100
I wanted to be able to pause the kids' internet

31:03.100 --> 31:04.100
When I go to bed

31:04.100 --> 31:05.100
And I cannot do it

31:05.100 --> 31:07.100
If anybody out there knows a way

31:07.100 --> 31:08.100
To do this with PyHole

31:08.100 --> 31:10.100
Or a relatively straightforward way

31:10.100 --> 31:11.100
To just accomplish this

31:11.100 --> 31:14.100
That doesn't require a specific router software

31:14.100 --> 31:15.100
Or whatever

31:15.100 --> 31:16.100
I'd love to know

31:16.100 --> 31:18.100
Selfhost.show.com

31:18.100 --> 31:19.100
But the upshot is

31:19.100 --> 31:23.100
Upgrading from PyHole 4 to PyHole 5.3.whatever

31:23.100 --> 31:24.100
Super smooth

31:24.100 --> 31:26.100
Totally flawless

31:26.100 --> 31:28.100
Once I got the right tag in there

31:28.100 --> 31:29.100
I have a question

31:29.100 --> 31:31.100
Would you be able to tie that into your

31:31.100 --> 31:35.100
Home Assistant Goodnight Kids recipe?

31:35.100 --> 31:36.100
Oh, I could imagine

31:36.100 --> 31:38.100
I do pull in Home Assistant

31:38.100 --> 31:40.100
There is a PyHole integration

31:40.100 --> 31:43.100
And so I do pull into Home Assistant

31:43.100 --> 31:46.100
The amount of active network clients

31:46.100 --> 31:49.100
And some DNS stats for the day

31:49.100 --> 31:51.100
And I graph them in Home Assistant

31:51.100 --> 31:52.100
On the dashboard

31:52.100 --> 31:54.100
Just for my own fun

31:54.100 --> 31:55.100
And I don't know

31:55.100 --> 31:56.100
But I bet you

31:56.100 --> 31:58.100
There is a way you could totally do that

31:58.100 --> 32:00.100
When I run that script

32:00.100 --> 32:02.100
It also would pause their devices

32:02.100 --> 32:03.100
Right

32:03.100 --> 32:04.100
Have a look in your Telegram

32:04.100 --> 32:05.100
I've just sent you a picture

32:05.100 --> 32:07.100
This is of the AdGuard home interface

32:07.100 --> 32:10.100
And just look at all the different services

32:10.100 --> 32:12.100
That you can toggle on and toggle off

32:12.100 --> 32:14.100
And then also look at the top of this page

32:14.100 --> 32:15.100
Where it says

32:15.100 --> 32:18.100
Select the tags that correspond to a specific client

32:18.100 --> 32:21.100
You know, the tag being child or whatever it is

32:21.100 --> 32:23.100
Doesn't this do what you need?

32:23.100 --> 32:24.100
Ah

32:24.100 --> 32:25.100
Yeah, you know

32:25.100 --> 32:26.100
The only thing that's

32:26.100 --> 32:28.100
The funny thing about it is

32:28.100 --> 32:29.100
It felt like

32:29.100 --> 32:30.100
This approach with AdGuard

32:30.100 --> 32:31.100
Because I actually gave AdGuard

32:31.100 --> 32:33.100
About a 20 minute try

32:33.100 --> 32:35.100
It didn't have like

32:35.100 --> 32:37.100
Just turn off everything

32:37.100 --> 32:39.100
You can go in and block individual services

32:39.100 --> 32:40.100
Like eBay

32:40.100 --> 32:41.100
Hulu

32:41.100 --> 32:42.100
Discord

32:42.100 --> 32:43.100
Amazon

32:43.100 --> 32:44.100
Instagram

32:44.100 --> 32:45.100
Facebook

32:45.100 --> 32:46.100
Telegram

32:46.100 --> 32:47.100
Twitch

32:47.100 --> 32:48.100
YouTube

32:48.100 --> 32:49.100
All which actually would basically do the job

32:49.100 --> 32:50.100
To be honest with you

32:50.100 --> 32:51.100
If I just turned off YouTube

32:51.100 --> 32:54.100
That'd do 90% of it

32:54.100 --> 32:55.100
But I just want

32:55.100 --> 32:56.100
Turn off internet access

32:56.100 --> 32:57.100
Like just

32:57.100 --> 32:58.100
Don't route them

32:58.100 --> 33:01.100
Could you send them to a dud DNS server?

33:01.100 --> 33:03.100
I was wondering about that

33:03.100 --> 33:04.100
You know, it would

33:04.100 --> 33:06.100
It would have to be a pretty short DHCP lease

33:06.100 --> 33:07.100
That somehow switched

33:07.100 --> 33:08.100
Around bedtime

33:08.100 --> 33:10.100
Or something like that

33:10.100 --> 33:11.100
I don't know

33:11.100 --> 33:13.100
Or maybe reboot the Wi-Fi access point

33:13.100 --> 33:14.100
Then every client

33:14.100 --> 33:15.100
Gets a new IP

33:15.100 --> 33:16.100
And at that point

33:16.100 --> 33:17.100
They all get routed to like

33:17.100 --> 33:18.100
Nowhere

33:19.100 --> 33:21.100
I mean, I think the AdGuard solution

33:21.100 --> 33:22.100
May be just simpler

33:22.100 --> 33:24.100
Because if you turn off

33:24.100 --> 33:25.100
It's funny that Cloudflare

33:25.100 --> 33:26.100
Is one of the services in here

33:26.100 --> 33:28.100
I mean, if you turn off Cloudflare

33:28.100 --> 33:29.100
You're going to break

33:29.100 --> 33:30.100
A lot of the internet

33:30.100 --> 33:31.100
Right there

33:31.100 --> 33:32.100
And then if I turn off YouTube

33:32.100 --> 33:33.100
That's going to do pretty much

33:33.100 --> 33:34.100
The rest of it for them

33:34.100 --> 33:35.100
Yeah

33:35.100 --> 33:36.100
So maybe I'll go back to AdGuard

33:36.100 --> 33:38.100
I think I liked the DHCP server

33:38.100 --> 33:39.100
Setup better in PyHole

33:39.100 --> 33:41.100
When I was looking at the two though

33:41.100 --> 33:42.100
One option might just be

33:42.100 --> 33:44.100
Throw them on a different

33:44.100 --> 33:45.100
Wi-Fi network

33:45.100 --> 33:46.100
And switch that off

33:46.100 --> 33:47.100
Yeah, that's true

33:47.100 --> 33:48.100
I could have a kid Wi-Fi network

33:48.100 --> 33:49.100
That's the one, Brent

33:49.100 --> 33:50.100
The simple solutions

33:50.100 --> 33:51.100
Are always the best

33:51.100 --> 33:53.100
Simplicity, gentlemen

33:53.100 --> 33:54.100
I, you know

33:54.100 --> 33:55.100
I do need another Wi-Fi network

33:55.100 --> 33:56.100
In this thing

33:56.100 --> 33:58.100
I've got like six or something

33:58.100 --> 33:59.100
I don't know

33:59.100 --> 34:00.100
It's ridiculous

34:00.100 --> 34:01.100
But yeah, that would probably work

34:01.100 --> 34:02.100
Huh?

34:02.100 --> 34:03.100
If you have a better idea

34:03.100 --> 34:04.100
Let us know at

34:04.100 --> 34:06.100
self-hosted.show slash contact

34:06.100 --> 34:07.100
Now, in the meantime

34:07.100 --> 34:09.100
OnePass would have been busy this week

34:09.100 --> 34:11.100
And released version 8

34:11.100 --> 34:13.100
Yeah, version 8 of what I used to think

34:13.100 --> 34:15.100
Was one of the best password managers

34:15.100 --> 34:16.100
Out there

34:16.100 --> 34:17.100
And they recently released

34:17.100 --> 34:19.100
A Linux desktop version

34:19.100 --> 34:22.100
And they announced that the backend

34:22.100 --> 34:23.100
Was written in Rust

34:23.100 --> 34:24.100
And I thought, hey

34:24.100 --> 34:26.100
Isn't that just fantastic?

34:26.100 --> 34:28.100
But version 8 is switching

34:28.100 --> 34:30.100
To a subscription-only service, Alex

34:30.100 --> 34:31.100
And I think there's kind of

34:31.100 --> 34:33.100
A big loss in functionality with that

34:33.100 --> 34:34.100
Three dollars a month

34:34.100 --> 34:36.100
To manage your passwords

34:36.100 --> 34:39.100
Why do we need a password manager

34:39.100 --> 34:41.100
To be a subscription service?

34:41.100 --> 34:42.100
Not only that

34:42.100 --> 34:44.100
Why do we need a password manager

34:44.100 --> 34:47.100
That can no longer handle local vaults?

34:47.100 --> 34:51.100
My mind is just blowing out right now

34:51.100 --> 34:52.100
When I read this news this week

34:52.100 --> 34:53.100
I just couldn't believe

34:53.100 --> 34:56.100
They would make such a dumb move

34:56.100 --> 34:58.100
And then I saw that they took

34:58.100 --> 35:00.100
A $200 million Series A funding

35:00.100 --> 35:02.100
Late in 2019

35:02.100 --> 35:04.100
And suddenly, all became clear

35:04.100 --> 35:05.100
Oh yeah, okay

35:05.100 --> 35:07.100
That does kind of connect the dots

35:07.100 --> 35:08.100
Doesn't it, unfortunately

35:08.100 --> 35:09.100
I hate to see it that way

35:09.100 --> 35:10.100
But that's...

35:10.100 --> 35:12.100
That's pretty tough not to see

35:12.100 --> 35:13.100
And then when you combine

35:13.100 --> 35:14.100
The changes they're making

35:14.100 --> 35:16.100
So that Linux Electron app

35:16.100 --> 35:18.100
They created with the Rust backend

35:18.100 --> 35:19.100
Surprise!

35:19.100 --> 35:20.100
Turns out to be what they're

35:20.100 --> 35:21.100
Switching everybody to

35:21.100 --> 35:23.100
So now the new Mac version's

35:23.100 --> 35:24.100
Also Electron

35:24.100 --> 35:26.100
And the Mac users are pissed

35:26.100 --> 35:28.100
Because 1Password started as

35:28.100 --> 35:30.100
Kind of an exclusive to the

35:30.100 --> 35:31.100
Apple ecosystem

35:31.100 --> 35:33.100
With native applications

35:33.100 --> 35:34.100
That was what 1Password

35:34.100 --> 35:35.100
Was special for

35:35.100 --> 35:36.100
And so now

35:36.100 --> 35:38.100
They switch over to Electron

35:38.100 --> 35:41.100
The Mac users are just pissed

35:41.100 --> 35:42.100
And I don't mean to laugh

35:42.100 --> 35:43.100
But Linux users

35:43.100 --> 35:44.100
We've had to live with that

35:44.100 --> 35:46.100
For a while already

35:46.100 --> 35:48.100
But it's two whammies at once

35:48.100 --> 35:50.100
An Electron Swaperoo

35:50.100 --> 35:54.100
And the removal of a local vault

35:54.100 --> 35:55.100
That's just...

35:55.100 --> 35:56.100
That's just...

35:56.100 --> 35:57.100
Well...

35:57.100 --> 35:59.100
That's game over right there

35:59.100 --> 36:01.100
I have 1Password installed

36:01.100 --> 36:02.100
On my machine because

36:02.100 --> 36:03.100
I was playing around with it

36:03.100 --> 36:04.100
To compare it to Bitwarden

36:04.100 --> 36:06.100
And they just disqualified themselves

36:06.100 --> 36:08.100
I remember 1Password

36:08.100 --> 36:09.100
I think was the first

36:09.100 --> 36:10.100
Password manager I used

36:10.100 --> 36:12.100
It must have been...

36:12.100 --> 36:13.100
Because I was still working

36:13.100 --> 36:14.100
At the Apple store at the time

36:14.100 --> 36:16.100
So it was 2013

36:16.100 --> 36:17.100
I want to say

36:17.100 --> 36:19.100
And at the time I thought

36:19.100 --> 36:20.100
It was absolutely crazy

36:20.100 --> 36:21.100
The idea of putting

36:21.100 --> 36:22.100
All my passwords in one place

36:22.100 --> 36:23.100
I thought

36:23.100 --> 36:24.100
How could that

36:24.100 --> 36:25.100
How can this possibly be

36:25.100 --> 36:26.100
More secure

36:26.100 --> 36:27.100
Than me remembering

36:27.100 --> 36:29.100
The password in my head

36:29.100 --> 36:30.100
Yeah

36:30.100 --> 36:31.100
I remember that

36:31.100 --> 36:32.100
I think I thought that way too

36:32.100 --> 36:33.100
Very early on

36:33.100 --> 36:34.100
I was very skeptical

36:34.100 --> 36:35.100
Yeah but over time

36:35.100 --> 36:36.100
I mean my

36:36.100 --> 36:37.100
Approaches matured

36:37.100 --> 36:38.100
And everything now lives

36:38.100 --> 36:39.100
In my Bitwarden

36:39.100 --> 36:40.100
And I do mean everything

36:40.100 --> 36:42.100
Wireguard configs live in there

36:42.100 --> 36:44.100
Bit of a tangent for a second

36:44.100 --> 36:46.100
We had a right old chat this week

36:46.100 --> 36:48.100
About encrypted storage

36:48.100 --> 36:50.100
Vaults on Discord

36:50.100 --> 36:52.100
With a couple of the guys on there

36:52.100 --> 36:53.100
One was talking about

36:53.100 --> 36:54.100
CryptoMator

36:54.100 --> 36:55.100
Which I'll talk about

36:55.100 --> 36:56.100
In a future episode

36:56.100 --> 36:58.100
And another one was talking about

36:58.100 --> 36:59.100
VeraCrypt

36:59.100 --> 37:02.100
And both of those are great fun

37:02.100 --> 37:03.100
But honestly nothing beats

37:03.100 --> 37:05.100
The simplicity of Bitwarden for me

37:05.100 --> 37:07.100
Just you can store files in there

37:07.100 --> 37:08.100
You can do all your

37:08.100 --> 37:09.100
Two factor stuff in there

37:09.100 --> 37:11.100
And all your passwords

37:11.100 --> 37:12.100
I mean if you know

37:12.100 --> 37:13.100
My master password

37:13.100 --> 37:15.100
I've never said it out loud

37:15.100 --> 37:16.100
Good for you

37:16.100 --> 37:17.100
Well done

37:17.100 --> 37:18.100
I mean you deserve to crack

37:18.100 --> 37:19.100
Some of my stuff I guess

37:19.100 --> 37:20.100
Bitwarden should totally

37:20.100 --> 37:21.100
Sponsor this show

37:21.100 --> 37:22.100
Because I am a big

37:22.100 --> 37:23.100
Bitwarden fan now too

37:23.100 --> 37:24.100
They totally won out

37:24.100 --> 37:25.100
In my test

37:25.100 --> 37:26.100
And the fact that there's that

37:26.100 --> 37:27.100
Rust implementation of the server

37:27.100 --> 37:28.100
That's super easy to get up

37:28.100 --> 37:29.100
And running

37:29.100 --> 37:30.100
I'm just all about it

37:30.100 --> 37:31.100
Have you tried Bitwarden?

37:31.100 --> 37:32.100
You know I will admit

37:32.100 --> 37:33.100
I haven't

37:33.100 --> 37:36.100
I got onto password managers

37:36.100 --> 37:38.100
Even earlier than Alex

37:38.100 --> 37:39.100
I will admit

37:39.100 --> 37:40.100
And

37:40.100 --> 37:41.100
Wow he's really taking

37:41.100 --> 37:43.100
This opportunity Alex

37:43.100 --> 37:44.100
You don't have me on the show

37:44.100 --> 37:45.100
That often

37:45.100 --> 37:47.100
So I got to take it all

37:47.100 --> 37:48.100
I love it

37:48.100 --> 37:49.100
So I landed on

37:49.100 --> 37:51.100
A great many years ago

37:51.100 --> 37:53.100
On the key pass databases

37:53.100 --> 37:55.100
And I will say that

37:55.100 --> 37:57.100
They are simpler

37:57.100 --> 37:59.100
And I have to sync them myself

37:59.100 --> 38:01.100
With some other solution

38:01.100 --> 38:03.100
However they've been solid

38:03.100 --> 38:05.100
And my father thinks they're

38:05.100 --> 38:07.100
His favorite application ever

38:07.100 --> 38:09.100
And that says something

38:09.100 --> 38:10.100
So everyone I've shown it to

38:10.100 --> 38:12.100
Has enjoyed their simplicity

38:12.100 --> 38:14.100
And hasn't needed to think about it

38:14.100 --> 38:15.100
Much more than that

38:15.100 --> 38:17.100
So I think Bitwarden

38:17.100 --> 38:18.100
If I was getting into it today

38:18.100 --> 38:20.100
Would be the perfect solution for me

38:20.100 --> 38:21.100
But I don't really have

38:21.100 --> 38:22.100
A reason to change

38:22.100 --> 38:23.100
Keypass and keypass

38:23.100 --> 38:24.100
Was it XC?

38:24.100 --> 38:25.100
I think

38:25.100 --> 38:26.100
Very popular options

38:26.100 --> 38:28.100
But you touched on the reason

38:28.100 --> 38:29.100
Why I won't consider it

38:29.100 --> 38:31.100
And that for me is the fact

38:31.100 --> 38:33.100
That you have to sync it

38:33.100 --> 38:34.100
With Voltwarden

38:34.100 --> 38:35.100
Which is a self hosted

38:35.100 --> 38:36.100
Bitwarden server

38:36.100 --> 38:38.100
And the hosted service

38:38.100 --> 38:40.100
That costs $12 a year

38:40.100 --> 38:42.100
I never have to think about it

38:42.100 --> 38:43.100
And for passwords

38:43.100 --> 38:45.100
When I have way too many devices

38:45.100 --> 38:46.100
In my life

38:46.100 --> 38:47.100
And I have often

38:47.100 --> 38:48.100
Got more than one phone

38:48.100 --> 38:49.100
And a tablet

38:49.100 --> 38:50.100
And a laptop

38:50.100 --> 38:51.100
And a desktop

38:51.100 --> 38:52.100
And a server

38:52.100 --> 38:53.100
And wife's phone

38:53.100 --> 38:54.100
And blah blah blah

38:54.100 --> 38:55.100
I just don't need that extra

38:55.100 --> 38:56.100
Complexity in my life

38:58.100 --> 38:59.100
Systemd has been around

38:59.100 --> 39:00.100
For a while

39:00.100 --> 39:01.100
And a lot of us

39:01.100 --> 39:02.100
Can muddle through

39:02.100 --> 39:03.100
But our friends at a cloud guru

39:03.100 --> 39:04.100
Have a course

39:04.100 --> 39:05.100
In systemd management

39:05.100 --> 39:06.100
For Linux

39:06.100 --> 39:07.100
That will take it

39:07.100 --> 39:08.100
To the next level for you

39:08.100 --> 39:09.100
You can get an idea

39:09.100 --> 39:10.100
Of how the components

39:10.100 --> 39:11.100
Work together

39:11.100 --> 39:12.100
How to configure

39:12.100 --> 39:13.100
This rather important

39:13.100 --> 39:15.100
Piece of system software

39:15.100 --> 39:16.100
It's a course that's designed

39:16.100 --> 39:17.100
To help demystify

39:17.100 --> 39:19.100
The sometimes difficult

39:19.100 --> 39:20.100
And deep topic

39:20.100 --> 39:21.100
Of systemd

39:21.100 --> 39:22.100
So go over to

39:22.100 --> 39:23.100
Acloudguru.com for that

39:23.100 --> 39:24.100
Or we will have a link

39:24.100 --> 39:25.100
In the show notes

39:25.100 --> 39:26.100
For systemd management

39:26.100 --> 39:27.100
For Linux

39:27.100 --> 39:28.100
At acloudguru.com

39:29.100 --> 39:30.100
And you're all familiar

39:30.100 --> 39:31.100
With cloudfree.shop

39:31.100 --> 39:32.100
At this point

39:32.100 --> 39:33.100
You can go over there

39:33.100 --> 39:34.100
And use the coupon code

39:34.100 --> 39:35.100
Self hosted

39:35.100 --> 39:36.100
To get $1 off a smart plug

39:36.100 --> 39:37.100
The version 2 smart plugs

39:37.100 --> 39:38.100
From cloudfree

39:38.100 --> 39:39.100
Have just launched

39:39.100 --> 39:41.100
With built in energy monitoring

39:41.100 --> 39:42.100
But some good news

39:42.100 --> 39:43.100
For the British people

39:43.100 --> 39:44.100
In the audience

39:44.100 --> 39:45.100
One of our other listeners

39:45.100 --> 39:46.100
On the other side of the pond

39:46.100 --> 39:47.100
Has launched

39:47.100 --> 39:48.100
A similar store

39:48.100 --> 39:49.100
In England

39:49.100 --> 39:50.100
This is at

39:50.100 --> 39:52.100
Mylocalbytes.com

39:52.100 --> 39:53.100
And to start with

39:53.100 --> 39:54.100
He has launched

39:54.100 --> 39:55.100
A couple of Zigbee devices

39:55.100 --> 39:56.100
As well as a

39:56.100 --> 39:57.100
Branded smart plug

39:57.100 --> 39:58.100
For Localbytes

39:58.100 --> 39:59.100
Again you can use

39:59.100 --> 40:00.100
The coupon code

40:00.100 --> 40:01.100
Self hosted

40:01.100 --> 40:02.100
To get a pound off that

40:02.100 --> 40:03.100
But if

40:03.100 --> 40:04.100
For all of those of you

40:04.100 --> 40:05.100
That have been asking me

40:05.100 --> 40:06.100
About cloudfree.shop

40:06.100 --> 40:07.100
Shipping to

40:07.100 --> 40:08.100
The UK

40:08.100 --> 40:11.100
Well here's your answer

40:11.100 --> 40:12.100
At mylocalbytes.com

40:12.100 --> 40:13.100
Wow that's so great

40:13.100 --> 40:14.100
Now we have no affiliation

40:14.100 --> 40:15.100
With them other than

40:15.100 --> 40:16.100
They are listeners

40:16.100 --> 40:17.100
But this is incredible

40:17.100 --> 40:18.100
They even have an LED

40:18.100 --> 40:19.100
Light strip thing there

40:19.100 --> 40:20.100
What a cool idea

40:20.100 --> 40:21.100
What a cool idea

40:21.100 --> 40:22.100
Mylocalbytes.com

40:22.100 --> 40:23.100
And I love that

40:23.100 --> 40:24.100
There's some Zigbee tech

40:24.100 --> 40:25.100
In there

40:25.100 --> 40:26.100
I've been thinking

40:26.100 --> 40:27.100
More and more

40:27.100 --> 40:28.100
I think I'm going to

40:28.100 --> 40:29.100
Quit getting wifi devices

40:29.100 --> 40:30.100
I'm going to go

40:30.100 --> 40:31.100
Z-Wave and Zigbee

40:31.100 --> 40:32.100
On stuff

40:32.100 --> 40:33.100
We got an email

40:33.100 --> 40:34.100
In about

40:34.100 --> 40:35.100
Two weeks ago

40:35.100 --> 40:36.100
We got an email

40:36.100 --> 40:37.100
In about

40:37.100 --> 40:38.100
My usage

40:38.100 --> 40:39.100
Of wall panel

40:39.100 --> 40:40.100
The linux trucker writes

40:40.100 --> 40:41.100
I was listening to

40:41.100 --> 40:42.100
Your last episode

40:42.100 --> 40:43.100
And heard you talking

40:43.100 --> 40:44.100
About wall panel

40:44.100 --> 40:45.100
Although it is

40:45.100 --> 40:46.100
Great software

40:46.100 --> 40:47.100
I feel there is

40:47.100 --> 40:48.100
A better option

40:48.100 --> 40:49.100
The fully kiosk browser

40:49.100 --> 40:50.100
Does everything

40:50.100 --> 40:51.100
That wall panel does

40:51.100 --> 40:52.100
Including motion detection

40:52.100 --> 40:53.100
Auto launch

40:53.100 --> 40:54.100
And will even function

40:54.100 --> 40:55.100
With the home button

40:55.100 --> 40:56.100
On android

40:56.100 --> 40:57.100
However

40:57.100 --> 40:58.100
For use with home assistant

40:58.100 --> 40:59.100
It takes it

40:59.100 --> 41:00.100
A step further

41:00.100 --> 41:01.100
Fully kiosk

41:01.100 --> 41:02.100
Will connect to

41:02.100 --> 41:03.100
MQTT

41:03.100 --> 41:04.100
And send battery

41:04.100 --> 41:05.100
Temperature and some of

41:05.100 --> 41:06.100
The other information

41:06.100 --> 41:07.100
To the home assistant

41:07.100 --> 41:08.100
I'm using this

41:08.100 --> 41:09.100
In combination with

41:09.100 --> 41:10.100
A smart outlet

41:10.100 --> 41:11.100
To cycle the battery

41:11.100 --> 41:12.100
In hopes it will

41:12.100 --> 41:13.100
Last a little bit longer

41:13.100 --> 41:14.100
Man, I've been talking

41:14.100 --> 41:15.100
About doing that

41:15.100 --> 41:16.100
That's awesome

41:16.100 --> 41:17.100
Linux trucker goes on

41:17.100 --> 41:18.100
To say

41:18.100 --> 41:19.100
It also gives you

41:19.100 --> 41:20.100
One more device

41:20.100 --> 41:21.100
You can use

41:21.100 --> 41:22.100
For automations

41:22.100 --> 41:23.100
And tinkering

41:23.100 --> 41:24.100
In home assistant

41:24.100 --> 41:25.100
This is a very small

41:25.100 --> 41:26.100
Five dollar fee

41:26.100 --> 41:27.100
To unlock all

41:27.100 --> 41:28.100
Of the features

41:28.100 --> 41:29.100
And I don't mind

41:29.100 --> 41:30.100
Supporting great software

41:30.100 --> 41:31.100
That I use every day

41:31.100 --> 41:32.100
Give it a look

41:32.100 --> 41:33.100
Before you settle

41:33.100 --> 41:34.100
For wall panel

41:34.100 --> 41:35.100
The linux trucker

41:35.100 --> 41:36.100
Is saying

41:36.100 --> 41:37.100
Hi Chris and Alex

41:37.100 --> 41:38.100
I recently bought

41:38.100 --> 41:39.100
My first apartment

41:39.100 --> 41:40.100
And construction

41:40.100 --> 41:41.100
Will take about

41:41.100 --> 41:42.100
Two years

41:42.100 --> 41:43.100
My wife is going to

41:43.100 --> 41:44.100
Focus on the kitchen

41:44.100 --> 41:45.100
The living room

41:45.100 --> 41:46.100
And the bathroom

41:46.100 --> 41:47.100
Whilst what I'm thinking about

41:47.100 --> 41:48.100
Are the tech parts

41:48.100 --> 41:49.100
Of the project

41:49.100 --> 41:50.100
Of course

41:50.100 --> 41:51.100
I have many things

41:51.100 --> 41:52.100
I'm wondering about

41:52.100 --> 41:53.100
And I'm not entirely sure

41:53.100 --> 41:54.100
What to prioritize

41:54.100 --> 41:55.100
I mean

41:55.100 --> 41:56.100
Laying cables

41:56.100 --> 41:57.100
And other electrical work

41:57.100 --> 41:58.100
Is probably going to be

41:58.100 --> 41:59.100
One of the more important things

41:59.100 --> 42:00.100
But I'm already wondering

42:00.100 --> 42:01.100
For example

42:01.100 --> 42:02.100
Whether POE

42:02.100 --> 42:03.100
Is the right tech

42:03.100 --> 42:04.100
Or not

42:04.100 --> 42:05.100
A totally different topic

42:05.100 --> 42:06.100
Is IOT

42:06.100 --> 42:07.100
And home appliances

42:07.100 --> 42:08.100
You can buy

42:08.100 --> 42:09.100
Washing machines

42:09.100 --> 42:10.100
And ovens

42:10.100 --> 42:11.100
And all sorts of things

42:11.100 --> 42:12.100
With wifi built in

42:12.100 --> 42:13.100
These days

42:13.100 --> 42:14.100
But some of this stuff

42:14.100 --> 42:15.100
Is going to be in a basement

42:15.100 --> 42:16.100
Where wifi

42:16.100 --> 42:17.100
Might not be

42:17.100 --> 42:18.100
The best choice

42:18.100 --> 42:19.100
I am hoping

42:19.100 --> 42:20.100
That there is some compromise

42:20.100 --> 42:21.100
For all this

42:21.100 --> 42:23.100
Can you help me?

42:23.100 --> 42:24.100
This is an opportunity

42:24.100 --> 42:25.100
Because he is so early

42:25.100 --> 42:26.100
In the stage

42:26.100 --> 42:27.100
Of planning

42:27.100 --> 42:28.100
He can run

42:28.100 --> 42:29.100
Cat 7

42:29.100 --> 42:30.100
He could run

42:30.100 --> 42:31.100
Fiber if he wanted to

42:31.100 --> 42:32.100
I mean

42:32.100 --> 42:33.100
He could really go

42:33.100 --> 42:34.100
All out

42:34.100 --> 42:35.100
And he could also run

42:35.100 --> 42:36.100
Ethernet

42:36.100 --> 42:37.100
To wifi

42:37.100 --> 42:38.100
Access points

42:38.100 --> 42:39.100
This is how you get

42:39.100 --> 42:40.100
Your wifi

42:40.100 --> 42:41.100
Rock solid

42:41.100 --> 42:42.100
By the way

42:42.100 --> 42:43.100
Is you have multiple

42:43.100 --> 42:44.100
Wifi access points

42:44.100 --> 42:45.100
That have ethernet

42:45.100 --> 42:46.100
Run to them

42:46.100 --> 42:47.100
And that stuff

42:47.100 --> 42:48.100
Just works like

42:48.100 --> 42:49.100
Nearly like

42:49.100 --> 42:50.100
Ethernet

42:50.100 --> 42:51.100
I won't say

42:51.100 --> 42:52.100
Like ethernet

42:52.100 --> 42:53.100
Because nothing works

42:53.100 --> 42:54.100
Like ethernet

42:54.100 --> 42:55.100
But it's pretty close

42:55.100 --> 42:56.100
And if you're in this

42:56.100 --> 42:57.100
Man if you're in this

42:57.100 --> 42:58.100
Stage right now

42:58.100 --> 42:59.100
Anonymous

42:59.100 --> 43:00.100
You are

43:00.100 --> 43:01.100
You are in such

43:01.100 --> 43:02.100
A great position

43:02.100 --> 43:03.100
Two years before

43:03.100 --> 43:04.100
Your house was even

43:04.100 --> 43:05.100
Finished building

43:05.100 --> 43:06.100
Like you

43:06.100 --> 43:07.100
What a great

43:07.100 --> 43:08.100
So many choices

43:08.100 --> 43:09.100
But what a great

43:09.100 --> 43:10.100
Position to be in

43:10.100 --> 43:11.100
Well it's the ultimate

43:11.100 --> 43:12.100
Conclusion of being

43:12.100 --> 43:13.100
A self-hoster

43:13.100 --> 43:14.100
Isn't it?

43:14.100 --> 43:15.100
Is to be a self-builder

43:15.100 --> 43:16.100
So

43:16.100 --> 43:17.100
I think in my life plan

43:17.100 --> 43:18.100
At some point

43:18.100 --> 43:19.100
It might be

43:19.100 --> 43:20.100
Ten years away

43:20.100 --> 43:21.100
But I really want

43:21.100 --> 43:22.100
To build my own house

43:22.100 --> 43:23.100
And do all of this stuff

43:23.100 --> 43:24.100
And make all these decisions

43:24.100 --> 43:25.100
And to that point

43:25.100 --> 43:26.100
Another one of our

43:26.100 --> 43:27.100
Listeners

43:27.100 --> 43:28.100
Is

43:28.100 --> 43:29.100
Embarking on a similar

43:29.100 --> 43:30.100
Journey himself

43:30.100 --> 43:31.100
Up in Vermont

43:31.100 --> 43:32.100
My name is Matt

43:32.100 --> 43:33.100
And they have a YouTube channel

43:33.100 --> 43:34.100
Called Adventurous Way

43:34.100 --> 43:35.100
There'll be a link to it

43:35.100 --> 43:36.100
In the show notes

43:36.100 --> 43:37.100
They've literally only

43:37.100 --> 43:38.100
Just closed on the

43:38.100 --> 43:39.100
40 acre plot of land

43:39.100 --> 43:40.100
Up in Vermont

43:40.100 --> 43:41.100
And currently Chris

43:41.100 --> 43:42.100
They live in an RV

43:42.100 --> 43:43.100
So you know

43:43.100 --> 43:44.100
There's a lot of stuff

43:44.100 --> 43:45.100
A lot of synergy

43:45.100 --> 43:46.100
Between his approach

43:46.100 --> 43:47.100
To stuff and yours

43:47.100 --> 43:48.100
Right now

43:48.100 --> 43:49.100
So I'm really curious

43:49.100 --> 43:50.100
To see what they're doing

43:50.100 --> 43:51.100
I've just watched

43:51.100 --> 43:52.100
A video tonight

43:52.100 --> 43:53.100
Where they're cutting back

43:53.100 --> 43:54.100
All the trees

43:54.100 --> 43:55.100
On the land for example

43:55.100 --> 43:56.100
So they're doing it

43:56.100 --> 43:57.100
All themselves

43:57.100 --> 43:58.100
Pretty much

43:58.100 --> 43:59.100
Right from the very beginning

43:59.100 --> 44:00.100
And man does that

44:00.100 --> 44:01.100
Give me some excitement

44:01.100 --> 44:02.100
I think

44:02.100 --> 44:03.100
In the future

44:03.100 --> 44:04.100
I've just

44:04.100 --> 44:05.100
You've got to do it

44:05.100 --> 44:06.100
I've just got to do it

44:06.100 --> 44:07.100
I feel the same way

44:07.100 --> 44:08.100
I feel exactly the same way

44:08.100 --> 44:09.100
So I'm definitely going to

44:09.100 --> 44:10.100
Check out their channel

44:10.100 --> 44:11.100
I could see parking

44:11.100 --> 44:12.100
Lady Dupes on some land

44:12.100 --> 44:13.100
And building from there

44:13.100 --> 44:14.100
I think that'd be the ultimate

44:14.100 --> 44:15.100
Final destination

44:15.100 --> 44:16.100
For Lady Dupes

44:16.100 --> 44:17.100
If I could

44:17.100 --> 44:18.100
It'd be some piece of land

44:18.100 --> 44:19.100
That we park her on

44:19.100 --> 44:20.100
I can imagine a JB

44:20.100 --> 44:21.100
Commune right now

44:21.100 --> 44:22.100
Brent

44:22.100 --> 44:23.100
In his little

44:23.100 --> 44:24.100
House in the corner

44:24.100 --> 44:25.100
Totally

44:25.100 --> 44:26.100
Yes

44:26.100 --> 44:27.100
Yep

44:27.100 --> 44:28.100
Yeah

44:28.100 --> 44:29.100
You'd be there

44:29.100 --> 44:30.100
It'd be great

44:30.100 --> 44:31.100
Yeah man

44:31.100 --> 44:32.100
You know I've retrofitted

44:32.100 --> 44:35.100
Many homes in the last few decades

44:35.100 --> 44:38.100
With the technologies of the day

44:38.100 --> 44:39.100
And I think

44:39.100 --> 44:41.100
Part of my advice would be

44:41.100 --> 44:43.100
To look at the cost

44:43.100 --> 44:44.100
Of laying a bunch of cable

44:44.100 --> 44:46.100
Versus what you think the future

44:46.100 --> 44:47.100
Might bring in the next

44:47.100 --> 44:48.100
Even five years

44:48.100 --> 44:49.100
Because

44:49.100 --> 44:51.100
Some of the homes that

44:51.100 --> 44:52.100
I've lived in

44:52.100 --> 44:54.100
That have been retrofitted with

44:54.100 --> 44:55.100
Ethernet to every room

44:55.100 --> 44:56.100
Actually

44:56.100 --> 44:57.100
My parents home right now

44:57.100 --> 44:58.100
We didn't do this

44:58.100 --> 44:59.100
Because there's

44:59.100 --> 45:01.100
Ethernet run to every toilet

45:01.100 --> 45:02.100
You know

45:02.100 --> 45:03.100
Just in case you need

45:03.100 --> 45:04.100
The best

45:04.100 --> 45:05.100
Speeds possible

45:05.100 --> 45:06.100
I don't know why

45:06.100 --> 45:08.100
But I love that idea actually

45:08.100 --> 45:09.100
I see nothing wrong with that

45:09.100 --> 45:12.100
That seems reasonable

45:12.100 --> 45:13.100
But it turns out

45:13.100 --> 45:14.100
They never get used

45:14.100 --> 45:16.100
And nothing ever gets plugged in

45:16.100 --> 45:17.100
Because the wifi

45:17.100 --> 45:19.100
Even in the basement

45:19.100 --> 45:20.100
Is good enough for

45:20.100 --> 45:21.100
Most of the activities

45:21.100 --> 45:23.100
That ever happen in that home

45:23.100 --> 45:26.100
So I would use some imagination

45:26.100 --> 45:27.100
And think about where

45:27.100 --> 45:28.100
That's going to be

45:28.100 --> 45:29.100
In the next

45:29.100 --> 45:30.100
Five to ten years

45:30.100 --> 45:31.100
And think about

45:31.100 --> 45:32.100
If the cost is worth it

45:32.100 --> 45:33.100
I know there are people

45:33.100 --> 45:34.100
Tapping in their keyboards

45:34.100 --> 45:35.100
Furiously right now

45:35.100 --> 45:37.100
Run conduit

45:37.100 --> 45:38.100
And I think that's probably

45:38.100 --> 45:39.100
The best future proof

45:39.100 --> 45:40.100
Thing you can do

45:40.100 --> 45:41.100
Is to make sure

45:41.100 --> 45:42.100
There's plenty of conduit

45:42.100 --> 45:43.100
So you can upgrade

45:43.100 --> 45:44.100
The cables later

45:44.100 --> 45:45.100
Without having to

45:45.100 --> 45:46.100
Fish through walls

45:46.100 --> 45:47.100
Jonas writes in

45:47.100 --> 45:48.100
Along the same line

45:48.100 --> 45:49.100
He says

45:49.100 --> 45:50.100
I know you guys talk

45:50.100 --> 45:51.100
About networking a lot

45:51.100 --> 45:52.100
We're renovating our house

45:52.100 --> 45:54.100
We ran Cat 7 cables

45:54.100 --> 45:55.100
Almost to every room

45:55.100 --> 45:57.100
But we've discovered

45:57.100 --> 45:58.100
To Brent's point

45:58.100 --> 45:59.100
We're still using

45:59.100 --> 46:00.100
Wifi a ton

46:00.100 --> 46:01.100
And so now I'm looking

46:01.100 --> 46:02.100
At what are the right

46:02.100 --> 46:03.100
APs and switches

46:03.100 --> 46:04.100
To use here

46:04.100 --> 46:05.100
I heard you guys

46:05.100 --> 46:06.100
Mention recently

46:06.100 --> 46:07.100
That you don't think

46:07.100 --> 46:08.100
You'd recommend

46:08.100 --> 46:09.100
Unified gear anymore

46:09.100 --> 46:10.100
So now I'm kind of stuck

46:10.100 --> 46:11.100
Do I go with cheap stuff?

46:11.100 --> 46:12.100
Do I do unmanaged?

46:12.100 --> 46:13.100
Do I do managed switches?

46:13.100 --> 46:14.100
You know I'm looking

46:14.100 --> 46:15.100
For stuff in the range

46:15.100 --> 46:18.100
Of maybe a thousand dollars

46:18.100 --> 46:19.100
Somewhere in there

46:19.100 --> 46:20.100
Slightly professional gear

46:20.100 --> 46:21.100
But not too crazy

46:21.100 --> 46:22.100
And he wants to know

46:22.100 --> 46:23.100
If we have any recommendations

46:23.100 --> 46:24.100
This is a good point

46:24.100 --> 46:25.100
Like what do you do

46:25.100 --> 46:26.100
If you want really

46:26.100 --> 46:27.100
Great Wifi right now?

46:27.100 --> 46:28.100
I mean the reality

46:28.100 --> 46:29.100
Of the situation is

46:29.100 --> 46:31.100
I bought the Unifi access point

46:31.100 --> 46:32.100
I'm looking at right now

46:32.100 --> 46:35.100
From my desk in 2015

46:35.100 --> 46:37.100
And it has just done the job

46:37.100 --> 46:39.100
Extremely well since then

46:39.100 --> 46:43.100
Despite all of Unifi's wackiness

46:43.100 --> 46:44.100
With their policies

46:44.100 --> 46:45.100
Over the last year or two

46:45.100 --> 46:47.100
The hardware and the performance

46:47.100 --> 46:48.100
Of what I put in

46:48.100 --> 46:51.100
Has just been great

46:51.100 --> 46:52.100
I can't really fault

46:52.100 --> 46:53.100
The actual device

46:53.100 --> 46:56.100
So with regards to

46:56.100 --> 46:57.100
Would I purchase it again?

46:57.100 --> 46:59.100
I'm already in the Unifi ecosystem

46:59.100 --> 47:01.100
The pragmatist in me is going

47:01.100 --> 47:02.100
Yes I probably would

47:02.100 --> 47:03.100
If I needed a third access point

47:03.100 --> 47:05.100
In this house for example

47:05.100 --> 47:06.100
Just to make sure it all meshed

47:06.100 --> 47:08.100
And talked together properly

47:08.100 --> 47:10.100
I'd probably just buy another one

47:10.100 --> 47:11.100
I know that TP-Link

47:11.100 --> 47:12.100
Makes some good devices

47:12.100 --> 47:14.100
And Jim Salters written about those

47:14.100 --> 47:16.100
On Ars Technica a little bit

47:16.100 --> 47:17.100
There are lots of people over

47:17.100 --> 47:18.100
At smallnetbuilder.com

47:18.100 --> 47:21.100
That regularly review this stuff

47:21.100 --> 47:22.100
So if you're looking at

47:22.100 --> 47:24.100
What the best mesh system is

47:24.100 --> 47:27.100
Or the best Ethernet backhaul system is

47:27.100 --> 47:29.100
That's where I'd go for all that advice

47:29.100 --> 47:31.100
Rather than listening to what I know

47:31.100 --> 47:33.100
Now I won't pretend to be an expert

47:33.100 --> 47:35.100
But I do know some people who are

47:35.100 --> 47:36.100
And I will notably say

47:36.100 --> 47:38.100
My older brother Chris

47:38.100 --> 47:42.100
He very, very, very strongly recommends

47:42.100 --> 47:45.100
The microtik hardware and software

47:45.100 --> 47:46.100
In this area

47:46.100 --> 47:48.100
He's explored a bunch of it

47:48.100 --> 47:50.100
And he has been very happy

47:50.100 --> 47:52.100
Over many years

47:52.100 --> 47:56.100
With just how powerful their software is

47:56.100 --> 47:57.100
But also how it can be simple

47:57.100 --> 47:58.100
If you need it to be

47:58.100 --> 48:01.100
And the software that's available

48:01.100 --> 48:02.100
Is their professional software

48:02.100 --> 48:04.100
That gets sent to all of their devices

48:04.100 --> 48:07.100
So even if you buy their low-end hardware

48:07.100 --> 48:08.100
You get the same software

48:08.100 --> 48:09.100
So I would recommend looking into that

48:09.100 --> 48:11.100
I can't make any specific recommendations

48:11.100 --> 48:13.100
But when I asked him

48:13.100 --> 48:15.100
That's what he told me

48:15.100 --> 48:17.100
So passing that along

48:17.100 --> 48:18.100
This is an area I'd love to hear

48:18.100 --> 48:19.100
What people are using

48:19.100 --> 48:21.100
What are you actually using out there

48:21.100 --> 48:23.100
And how has it worked for you

48:23.100 --> 48:26.100
Because I'm also trying to find something else

48:26.100 --> 48:28.100
And there's so many mesh options out there

48:28.100 --> 48:30.100
But so, I think all of them

48:30.100 --> 48:32.100
If I'm not mistaken

48:32.100 --> 48:34.100
Require cloud connectivity

48:34.100 --> 48:36.100
Or some sort of cloud account

48:36.100 --> 48:38.100
And I just don't want any of that

48:38.100 --> 48:40.100
Unifi, I feel like I've already made

48:40.100 --> 48:41.100
That concession once before

48:41.100 --> 48:43.100
For the stuff we have in the studio

48:43.100 --> 48:45.100
So okay, that's already a concession I've made

48:45.100 --> 48:47.100
But I'd love some tips

48:47.100 --> 48:48.100
And if you're sticking with Unifi

48:48.100 --> 48:50.100
I'd love to know why too

48:50.100 --> 48:52.100
Selfhosted.show.com

48:52.100 --> 48:54.100
Did you see that the Grand Tour

48:54.100 --> 48:56.100
Aired an episode this week in Scotland?

48:56.100 --> 48:58.100
We watched it on the road actually

48:58.100 --> 49:00.100
As a family, we all sat down and watched it

49:00.100 --> 49:01.100
And had a great time

49:01.100 --> 49:02.100
It was more of like a classic episode

49:02.100 --> 49:03.100
I felt, Alex

49:03.100 --> 49:04.100
Did you get that sense?

49:04.100 --> 49:06.100
Yeah, for my stag do actually

49:06.100 --> 49:08.100
A buddy of mine and my dad

49:08.100 --> 49:10.100
We rented three cars

49:10.100 --> 49:13.100
And we did our own mini top gear road trip

49:13.100 --> 49:15.100
From Edinburgh actually

49:15.100 --> 49:17.100
We started in Edinburgh and finished in Edinburgh

49:17.100 --> 49:20.100
But in the intervening three or four days

49:20.100 --> 49:21.100
We went up to Inverness

49:21.100 --> 49:23.100
Drove down the side of Loch Ness

49:23.100 --> 49:24.100
Out to the Isle of Skye

49:24.100 --> 49:26.100
And then back through the Trossachs

49:26.100 --> 49:28.100
Oh man, I tell you what

49:28.100 --> 49:30.100
Scotland has some of the best driving roads

49:30.100 --> 49:31.100
Not cliche

49:31.100 --> 49:32.100
In the world

49:32.100 --> 49:34.100
It was just a phenomenal trip

49:34.100 --> 49:36.100
And to watch that episode

49:36.100 --> 49:38.100
Feeling as homesick as I am

49:38.100 --> 49:39.100
At the moment

49:39.100 --> 49:40.100
You know

49:40.100 --> 49:41.100
Ah, dude

49:41.100 --> 49:44.100
It was just so perfectly timed

49:44.100 --> 49:46.100
Yeah, they really made it beautiful too

49:46.100 --> 49:48.100
Yeah, those had to be some of the same roads, right?

49:48.100 --> 49:49.100
Some of them were, yeah

49:49.100 --> 49:51.100
And I tell you what brought me onto this topic

49:51.100 --> 49:52.100
Was

49:52.100 --> 49:55.100
I've been looking at mechanical keyboards lately

49:55.100 --> 49:57.100
And I came across a podcast

49:57.100 --> 49:58.100
Named Top Clack

49:58.100 --> 49:59.100
You know, like Top Gear

49:59.100 --> 50:01.100
I just thought that was fun

50:01.100 --> 50:03.100
TopClack.com if you're a mech keyboard enthusiast

50:03.100 --> 50:05.100
Oh my goodness

50:05.100 --> 50:06.100
There is a podcast

50:06.100 --> 50:07.100
Are you kidding me?

50:07.100 --> 50:08.100
Of course there is

50:08.100 --> 50:09.100
Why am I surprised at all?

50:09.100 --> 50:10.100
Why am I surprised by that?

50:10.100 --> 50:11.100
I shouldn't be surprised by that

50:11.100 --> 50:12.100
Almost everyone we've met on this trip

50:12.100 --> 50:13.100
Has had a podcast

50:13.100 --> 50:14.100
That's true actually

50:14.100 --> 50:17.100
I was listening to your podcasting adventures

50:17.100 --> 50:19.100
About concrete in Idaho, so

50:19.100 --> 50:20.100
Yeah

50:20.100 --> 50:22.100
We did a couple of micro meetups

50:22.100 --> 50:25.100
And we had a group of five at one of them

50:25.100 --> 50:27.100
And literally every single person there had a podcast

50:27.100 --> 50:29.100
Then we did the Salt Lake City meetup

50:29.100 --> 50:31.100
And there was a handful of people there that had a podcast

50:31.100 --> 50:33.100
It's the influence you both had

50:33.100 --> 50:35.100
I don't know

50:35.100 --> 50:37.100
I don't know, but it was pretty crazy

50:37.100 --> 50:41.100
And Brent joined you for episode 418 of Linux Unplugged

50:41.100 --> 50:46.100
Where there was an absolutely excellent rundown of WireGuard user interfaces

50:46.100 --> 50:48.100
Yeah, and not only the tools to manage WireGuard

50:48.100 --> 50:52.100
But big news for people that want to use WireGuard on Windows

50:52.100 --> 50:54.100
There is an alternative to that user space implementation

50:54.100 --> 50:57.100
There is now a kernel space implementation

50:57.100 --> 51:01.100
And the performance difference is huge

51:01.100 --> 51:04.100
So Jim Salter from Ars Technica and Two and a Half Admins

51:04.100 --> 51:07.100
Joined us to talk about that on Unplugged 418

51:07.100 --> 51:09.100
At linuxunplugged.com

51:09.100 --> 51:13.100
That's huge with a Y at the beginning by the way

51:13.100 --> 51:15.100
Yeah, that's going to be a big deal for people that want to have

51:15.100 --> 51:17.100
Interconnected Windows and Linux machines

51:17.100 --> 51:19.100
Or just Windows to Windows machines

51:19.100 --> 51:21.100
And to be able to use WireGuard too

51:21.100 --> 51:23.100
You feel like this is probably going to take WireGuard up to the next level

51:23.100 --> 51:25.100
In the enterprise

51:25.100 --> 51:27.100
And you're going to see adoption now just across the board

51:27.100 --> 51:29.100
Once they get this code done

51:29.100 --> 51:31.100
It's early days, it's still experimental

51:31.100 --> 51:33.100
And Jim goes through all the details

51:33.100 --> 51:35.100
Also, we want to say a special thank you to our members

51:35.100 --> 51:37.100
Who support this show

51:37.100 --> 51:41.100
And to our reliability engineers who sign up at selfhosted.show.sre

51:41.100 --> 51:43.100
You are very special to us, in my heart

51:43.100 --> 51:45.100
Remember that? You are in my heart right now

51:45.100 --> 51:47.100
And I say thank you because as we're out here meeting people

51:47.100 --> 51:49.100
And we're doing a road trip like this

51:49.100 --> 51:51.100
And all of it, oh and we're also

51:51.100 --> 51:53.100
This is the other big part, is we're almost at a year now

51:53.100 --> 51:55.100
Of being independent again

51:55.100 --> 51:57.100
And all of this stuff about how critical our members have been

51:57.100 --> 51:59.100
And all of that has just been on my mind

51:59.100 --> 52:01.100
So thank you very much and if you'd like to support the show

52:01.100 --> 52:03.100
selfhosted.show.sre

52:03.100 --> 52:05.100
And don't forget if you're an SRE to listen to the post show

52:05.100 --> 52:07.100
There's going to be an exclusive discount code in there

52:07.100 --> 52:11.100
For the merch that we launched last episode

52:11.100 --> 52:13.100
The Chris and the Badger t-shirts are flying off the shelves

52:13.100 --> 52:17.100
And just to make sure that everybody that wants one gets one

52:17.100 --> 52:19.100
We're going to keep that up for another couple of weeks

52:19.100 --> 52:21.100
And then we're going to retire it

52:21.100 --> 52:23.100
And then after that it might make some future

52:23.100 --> 52:25.100
Special edition appearances, who knows

52:25.100 --> 52:27.100
But if you want one, make sure you go over there

52:27.100 --> 52:29.100
And pick one up now

52:29.100 --> 52:31.100
Because who knows when it will ever come back

52:31.100 --> 52:33.100
So we're going to extend that discount code

52:33.100 --> 52:35.100
For two more weeks

52:35.100 --> 52:37.100
