WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Well, I think my refrigerator's dying.

00:02.000 --> 00:04.080
Oh, no, I had a similar thing in England.

00:04.080 --> 00:10.320
We came back and we have a garage freezer and we came back and it was just slightly defrosted.

00:10.320 --> 00:14.080
Everything was cold, but there was, you know, water.

00:14.080 --> 00:16.800
There was juice in the bottom of the frozen chicken bag and stuff.

00:16.800 --> 00:17.760
It's no good.

00:17.760 --> 00:21.600
No, I got sort of like this weird sense that something was wrong.

00:21.600 --> 00:25.600
I was walking by the fridge and I heard this click, click, click.

00:25.600 --> 00:26.720
Oh, that ain't right.

00:26.720 --> 00:27.360
No.

00:27.360 --> 00:31.280
And I've been thinking about ways to put a temperature sensor in there for a while.

00:31.920 --> 00:34.400
You know, it's been on my mind and I hear this click.

00:34.400 --> 00:36.320
So I think, OK, my feeling that doesn't feel right.

00:36.320 --> 00:38.560
It feels like the tater tots are a little squishy.

00:38.560 --> 00:39.920
You know, shouldn't be like that.

00:40.800 --> 00:44.880
So the wife gets up this morning and I tell her, hey, look, this is what I think's going on.

00:44.880 --> 00:46.880
Although by this point, I'd heard the compressor kick in.

00:47.840 --> 00:49.120
So it was working again.

00:49.120 --> 00:51.120
I thought, hmm, and it definitely was cooling down again.

00:51.760 --> 00:53.520
But here's the moment that was a victory.

00:53.520 --> 00:57.200
Alex, you know, she says to me, she's like, hey, couldn't you put a temperature

00:57.200 --> 01:01.040
sensor in there and then we'd get historical trends at home assistant?

01:01.040 --> 01:02.080
The wife asked that.

01:02.080 --> 01:02.400
Yes.

01:03.200 --> 01:04.400
What a win is that, right?

01:04.400 --> 01:05.520
That is amazing.

01:05.520 --> 01:06.800
And I was like, right, you are.

01:06.800 --> 01:09.520
So then I was like motivated, even though I was running late to get down to the studio.

01:09.520 --> 01:12.080
I was like, no, I'm going to get this set up right now because she's on board.

01:12.080 --> 01:12.800
We're getting this done.

01:13.600 --> 01:16.000
I you know, so I did a similar thing this week.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.520
I know you've gone Zed wave.

01:17.520 --> 01:19.040
I actually went Zigbee.

01:19.040 --> 01:21.680
I bought a couple of the Akara sensors.

01:21.680 --> 01:22.080
Yeah.

01:22.080 --> 01:26.480
And I put a couple in the freezer and they're connected up to home assistant.

01:26.480 --> 01:31.600
Real easy time will tell how long batteries last at minus 17 Celsius, though.

01:32.400 --> 01:33.920
OK, so you are doing battery power.

01:33.920 --> 01:34.880
OK, interesting.

01:34.880 --> 01:36.080
Yeah, huh.

01:36.080 --> 01:38.640
I right now am getting after 24 hours.

01:38.640 --> 01:41.440
I am getting 54% battery remaining.

01:41.440 --> 01:42.080
Oh, my.

01:42.640 --> 01:46.640
And there are two little Duracell lithium batteries, two of them little lithium batteries.

01:46.640 --> 01:49.200
So I don't know how long this thing is going to last.

01:49.200 --> 01:55.440
My kitchen fridge sensor is at 100% and the freezer is at 98 and they were both powered

01:55.440 --> 01:57.280
up at exactly the same time yesterday.

01:57.280 --> 01:59.520
So, oh, we'll see.

01:59.520 --> 02:00.000
We'll see.

02:00.000 --> 02:05.280
Yeah, I'm hoping that mine stays at 54%, you know, like it just like the sensor just got

02:05.280 --> 02:07.200
a big drop because the cold who knows.

02:08.400 --> 02:13.760
But yeah, the Z wave does seem to be making it through the walls of the fridge, which

02:13.760 --> 02:15.600
I just wasn't so sure about.

02:15.600 --> 02:17.520
And, you know, I thought this would be a great way.

02:17.520 --> 02:18.640
The wife was completely right.

02:18.640 --> 02:21.920
Like, I got to know because to pull this fridge out.

02:21.920 --> 02:26.160
First of all, it's like built into the cupboards of the RV and it's bolted in.

02:26.160 --> 02:27.600
So it has it have to be.

02:27.600 --> 02:28.720
So I'd have to take it to a shop.

02:29.520 --> 02:32.320
They'd have to have a couple of guys remove this fridge.

02:32.320 --> 02:36.000
Then I'd have to have an RV tech come over or a fridge tech come over and try to repair

02:36.000 --> 02:36.240
it.

02:36.240 --> 02:40.960
And if they can't repair that fridge, they have to remove the slide or remove the windshield

02:40.960 --> 02:43.680
and take the fridge out that way because it's bigger than the door is wide.

02:43.680 --> 02:44.240
Oh, no.

02:44.240 --> 02:48.560
And it's just a regular old residential fridge they put in these things.

02:48.560 --> 02:51.840
It's not like it's been like prepared to go down the road or anything.

02:51.840 --> 02:54.480
It's just it's just a house fridge that they like.

02:54.480 --> 02:55.840
Hey, people like bigger fridges.

02:55.840 --> 02:56.320
Let's put it.

02:56.320 --> 02:57.680
Let's put a house fridge in the RV.

02:57.680 --> 02:59.760
You'd have to take it out the windscreen.

02:59.760 --> 03:00.480
Oh, my God.

03:00.480 --> 03:03.280
Yeah, that's like the stuff of nightmares.

03:04.080 --> 03:04.580
Yeah.

03:04.960 --> 03:06.560
So I'm going to watch it carefully for a bit.

03:07.680 --> 03:11.840
I may even get like a battery pack and just try to run a flat USB cord into there.

03:12.640 --> 03:16.240
When I was Googling online for this, people were really kind of coming up with a.

03:16.240 --> 03:20.400
Pretty clever DIY solutions for this, where essentially they come up with a really thin

03:20.400 --> 03:24.160
cable that goes to a remote sensor that they mount inside the fridge, and then they have

03:24.160 --> 03:26.480
the transmitter and the power source outside the fridge.

03:27.440 --> 03:30.880
You could do that with an ESP and ESP board pretty easily.

03:30.880 --> 03:33.360
Yeah, yeah, that would be pretty great.

03:33.360 --> 03:37.360
And then perhaps I'd build my own cloud after going to visit a cloud guru, the leader in

03:37.360 --> 03:40.080
learning for cloud, Linux and other modern tech skills.

03:40.080 --> 03:42.960
They have hundreds of courses and thousands of hands on labs.

03:42.960 --> 03:43.760
Go get certified.

03:43.760 --> 03:47.120
Go get hired and get learning the cloud guru dot com.

03:47.920 --> 03:50.560
It's been a busy week in the Kretschmar household.

03:50.560 --> 03:55.760
I'll tell you what you've accomplished, something that I have thought about doing a number of

03:55.760 --> 04:00.960
times, and that is I inherited, I think much like you did, a set of hues lights that my

04:00.960 --> 04:03.280
wife had at her office with its little hue hub.

04:04.320 --> 04:05.680
And it's not great.

04:05.680 --> 04:08.880
I don't like having a separate piece of equipment pulling power.

04:08.880 --> 04:11.120
And I think there's a way I could get rid of that sucker.

04:11.120 --> 04:15.440
So I know you did a lot of things this week, but one of them, I believe, was you eliminated

04:15.440 --> 04:17.200
the hues hub from your hue lights.

04:17.200 --> 04:17.920
Absolutely.

04:17.920 --> 04:18.400
Yes.

04:18.400 --> 04:24.960
So as part of the Zigbee fridge temperature sensor stuff, I bought myself one of these

04:24.960 --> 04:32.240
sewn off CC 2531 Zigbee sticks, USB sticks that goes into my home assistant box with

04:32.240 --> 04:32.880
Proxmox.

04:32.880 --> 04:35.600
It was a very easy pass through.

04:35.600 --> 04:37.840
You just plug the thing in and then click.

04:37.840 --> 04:41.120
Add USB device and it just shows up in home assistant.

04:41.120 --> 04:47.040
That bit couldn't have been easier, but I was finding that the range from the sewn off

04:47.040 --> 04:49.840
stick was pretty terrible.

04:49.840 --> 04:53.920
I'm talking 10, 12 feet terrible.

04:53.920 --> 04:56.000
Not good at all when it's in the basement.

04:56.000 --> 04:56.500
Yeah.

04:56.960 --> 05:02.240
So I sort of thought to myself, aren't these Philip Hue bulbs that I have already got 10

05:02.240 --> 05:03.440
of in the house?

05:03.440 --> 05:08.080
Because when I emigrated, I bought at Black Friday, I bought a 10 pack that came with

05:08.080 --> 05:09.920
the starter pack that came with a hub.

05:09.920 --> 05:11.600
It was a pretty good deal, as I recall.

05:11.600 --> 05:15.120
I can't remember how much it was, but I remember thinking at the time, oh, this isn't too bad.

05:15.840 --> 05:18.000
But anyway, so I've got a bunch of Zigbee devices.

05:18.720 --> 05:25.680
And as part of the stuff I did for my dad's in England last month, the guy behind my local

05:25.680 --> 05:33.440
bytes told me that any permanently powered Zigbee device act as a mesh repeater in the

05:33.440 --> 05:34.000
network.

05:34.000 --> 05:39.760
And I was like, I could use these lamps to increase the range of my little USB stick.

05:39.760 --> 05:44.480
So why don't I try unpairing from the Philips Hue app, just one bulb.

05:44.480 --> 05:46.720
I'm going to try just one, see how it goes.

05:47.440 --> 05:51.280
Within a minute, I'd unpaired and repaired it with ZHA and home assistant.

05:51.280 --> 05:53.920
And I was like, whoa, that was easy.

05:53.920 --> 05:57.680
So I thought to myself, well, okay, you've done one bulb in one minute.

05:57.680 --> 06:01.600
Why don't you go and do the next bulb in the rear hallway that's just next to the fridge?

06:01.600 --> 06:05.600
And then you've got two in a row that are then, and hopefully it'd be better for the

06:06.160 --> 06:06.960
fridge sensors.

06:07.680 --> 06:09.360
And then I thought, well, what you've done two.

06:12.000 --> 06:18.720
And I went all in and I did all 10 yesterday evening and the performance of the cheap sewn

06:18.720 --> 06:24.400
off CC2531 was good when I had two or three devices.

06:24.400 --> 06:28.080
But by the time I got to the 10th bulb, not so good.

06:28.880 --> 06:34.720
I'm talking, I'd press a button in home assistant and I'd wait and I'd wait and I'd be like,

06:34.720 --> 06:36.160
did that register?

06:36.160 --> 06:38.000
Is this working while we hit?

06:38.000 --> 06:38.480
Hello.

06:38.480 --> 06:39.360
Are we a light bulb?

06:39.360 --> 06:40.400
Are we a crisp packet?

06:40.400 --> 06:41.920
Are we a train?

06:41.920 --> 06:42.640
What are we?

06:42.640 --> 06:43.360
Oh yes, that's right.

06:43.360 --> 06:43.920
We're a light bulb.

06:43.920 --> 06:44.720
I'm going to turn off now.

06:44.720 --> 06:49.280
And yeah, so I've gone ahead and ordered one of these, what's it called?

06:49.280 --> 06:54.800
A Combee version two, based off a recommendation of one of the guys in discord.

06:54.800 --> 06:56.080
So that's going to show up tomorrow.

06:56.080 --> 06:58.560
So maybe I'll report on that in the next episode.

06:58.560 --> 07:03.280
But yeah, I mean, I've been, I've been pretty pleased with how easy Zigbee, you know, deep,

07:03.280 --> 07:07.520
the, the de-hue hub migration thing.

07:07.520 --> 07:11.040
I've been pleased with how easy that was, to be honest with you, you know, I've been

07:11.040 --> 07:16.320
experiencing some delays on occasion, not all the time, not consistently, but I've been

07:16.320 --> 07:19.120
experiencing delays on my Z-Wave network.

07:19.840 --> 07:25.680
And I just kind of put the, put it all together that, well, yeah, I've recently, I've recently

07:25.680 --> 07:30.800
added a couple of more sensors and a couple of more powered smart plugs that do power

07:30.800 --> 07:31.280
monitoring.

07:31.280 --> 07:34.640
And so they're chatting more over Z-Wave and Z-Wave isn't super high bandwidth.

07:35.600 --> 07:38.320
And, hmm, I don't know.

07:38.320 --> 07:41.840
That's interesting.

07:41.840 --> 07:45.120
I kind of just assumed it was my Pi, which controller do you use?

07:45.760 --> 07:50.400
I don't remember what it's been branded as, but it's based on the Sigma Designs Z-Wave

07:50.400 --> 07:51.600
USB adapter.

07:52.240 --> 07:56.400
And I've been pretty happy with it because it's got a big old antenna on it.

07:56.400 --> 07:57.920
And so it gets pretty good range.

07:57.920 --> 08:03.040
And then like Zigbee, each Z-Wave device also that's powered acts as a repeater.

08:03.760 --> 08:08.000
And so I didn't even really stop to consider that maybe I've overloaded my network.

08:08.000 --> 08:12.400
I've got, I've got 14 Z-Wave nodes now, which doesn't seem like a ton to me.

08:13.120 --> 08:16.320
But after hearing your experience, maybe I am kind of in the range.

08:16.320 --> 08:18.720
Maybe I, maybe I need a more robust controller.

08:19.280 --> 08:19.520
Yeah.

08:19.520 --> 08:25.840
I would say with the chatty devices in particular that are doing, you know, an update every

08:25.840 --> 08:31.680
second or so that's going to chew through the bandwidth that's available pretty quickly.

08:31.680 --> 08:31.840
Yeah.

08:31.840 --> 08:35.040
I mean, not to fanboy a bunch more about matter because it's not even here yet.

08:35.040 --> 08:39.600
But this is something I hope matter solves because matter is an IP-based protocol.

08:40.400 --> 08:44.640
And a couple of things that are nice about that is it means you could route it over an

08:44.640 --> 08:47.760
IP network where you could have a lot more bandwidth, right?

08:47.760 --> 08:48.960
You could, you could do that.

08:49.760 --> 08:54.240
But additionally, a lot of devices already have thread radios built in and pretty much

08:54.240 --> 08:57.760
all the vendors are going to use thread as the channel to communicate.

08:57.760 --> 09:00.160
And that has pretty good bandwidth too, compared to what we're used to.

09:00.960 --> 09:04.240
I hope we start to see more vendors support it.

09:04.240 --> 09:09.760
Uh, Amazon just kind of reaffirmed their commitment this week as we're recording that they're,

09:09.760 --> 09:12.880
that they're all in and that they're going to use thread and they're going to support

09:12.880 --> 09:14.320
matter with the echo devices.

09:15.280 --> 09:19.120
So my hope is to ride this out for like another year and a half, two years, and then switch

09:19.120 --> 09:22.080
over to matter-based devices for pretty much all this stuff.

09:22.080 --> 09:24.080
Could be just a dream though.

09:24.080 --> 09:27.040
Cynical old Alex over here doesn't believe a word of it.

09:27.040 --> 09:27.360
I know.

09:27.360 --> 09:29.040
I don't think matter is going to solve anything.

09:29.040 --> 09:31.760
It's just going to be yet another standard.

09:31.760 --> 09:32.800
Maybe I'll be wrong.

09:32.800 --> 09:34.240
Hopefully I'm wrong.

09:34.240 --> 09:35.600
I hope, but I don't know.

09:35.600 --> 09:39.200
You know, who's getting me all hyped is Paulus from Home Assistant.

09:39.200 --> 09:42.560
Like the last couple of live streams he's been talking about it and he makes it, he

09:42.560 --> 09:45.280
made an analogy that kind of worked for me.

09:45.280 --> 09:51.520
He said, you can think of matter as what USB was for PC peripherals back in the early aughts

09:51.520 --> 09:52.160
in the nineties.

09:52.160 --> 09:58.640
You remember when we had like colored, a colored green and purple for PS2 and, and printers

09:58.640 --> 10:02.240
had different types of connectors and they had SCSI on the Mac and you know,

10:02.240 --> 10:08.480
Mac and then USB came along and it was like a minimum base set of standards of connectivity

10:08.480 --> 10:10.000
that everything supported.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.520
And then vendors would build on top of that and they will just like that with matter as

10:13.520 --> 10:14.160
well.

10:14.160 --> 10:19.600
But you kind of just at least had a few fundamentals that everybody agreed on with USB and it,

10:19.600 --> 10:23.200
it really took things to the next level when it comes to plug in devices into your computer.

10:23.200 --> 10:27.920
And he thinks, and I hope he's right, that that's what matter will be for IOT devices

10:27.920 --> 10:28.320
in the home.

10:28.320 --> 10:34.560
As long as we don't end up with a USB-C style USB implementation, then we'll be okay.

10:35.120 --> 10:35.600
Yeah.

10:35.600 --> 10:38.320
Something tells me it's going to be a lot more like USB-C Alex.

10:38.880 --> 10:39.520
Huh.

10:39.520 --> 10:42.800
Well, that's a pretty good motivation for me to actually get off my Duff and get my

10:42.800 --> 10:44.000
Zigbee radio set up.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.920
Even if I don't have many Zigbee devices, I could get rid of my Hughes bridge, save

10:47.920 --> 10:48.480
a little power.

10:49.440 --> 10:49.760
Okay.

10:49.760 --> 10:53.520
So while we're kind of getting close to it, you know, we got to talk about it.

10:53.520 --> 10:56.000
You can almost feel it in the air Black Friday.

10:56.000 --> 11:00.720
It's like a holiday for you and I know you're always getting ready to shuck drives.

11:00.720 --> 11:03.920
For those of you who maybe are new to the show and you don't know, this is what Alex

11:03.920 --> 11:04.320
loves to do.

11:04.320 --> 11:07.680
He loves to get a great price on like a large external drive.

11:07.680 --> 11:11.280
Cause you know, sometimes they'll put some real monsters in there and then you shuck

11:11.280 --> 11:14.960
the external case and you load it up in your file server or something like that.

11:14.960 --> 11:17.280
So I imagine you must be getting prepared.

11:17.280 --> 11:19.040
There's my methodology, right?

11:19.040 --> 11:19.520
Okay.

11:19.520 --> 11:27.120
When I emigrated, I purchased about 10, 10 terabyte hard drives and they were all purchased

11:27.120 --> 11:31.600
on the same week from, you know, the three or four different best buys that we have in

11:31.600 --> 11:33.920
Raleigh because it was a limit of two or three per customer.

11:33.920 --> 11:35.040
So I was like, screw that.

11:35.040 --> 11:37.680
I'm just going to go and drive to the next one and buy two more over there.

11:38.960 --> 11:41.280
So I'm a little bit concerned about the bathtub curve.

11:42.640 --> 11:47.200
For those that don't know what that is, typically a drive will fail either right at the beginning

11:47.200 --> 11:52.960
of its life or right at the end of its life, you know, be that three, four, five, six years,

11:52.960 --> 11:53.520
whatever it is.

11:54.160 --> 11:58.080
But given that these drives have been exposed to the same environment, you know, they've

11:58.080 --> 12:03.600
all been in the same case, the same temperatures, they've been exposed to the same, you know,

12:03.600 --> 12:06.400
manufacturing potential problems.

12:06.400 --> 12:08.640
They've all got the same firmwares, et cetera, et cetera.

12:08.640 --> 12:16.800
The chance is if one or two go, that all 10 go seems higher to me than if I was to spread

12:16.800 --> 12:17.280
it out.

12:17.760 --> 12:19.840
Yeah, you're definitely going to, if you have one failure, you're probably going to have

12:19.840 --> 12:21.280
a couple of failures at least.

12:21.280 --> 12:22.000
At least.

12:22.000 --> 12:22.240
Yeah.

12:22.240 --> 12:27.840
So what I'm doing to kind of mitigate that is my primary media server, like I say, has

12:27.840 --> 12:28.960
has 10 drives in it.

12:28.960 --> 12:30.880
Two are used for a ZFS mirror.

12:30.880 --> 12:36.880
One is used for SNAT RAID parity, which leaves me seven drives for actual data.

12:36.880 --> 12:40.240
I've got a mixture now of 10 terabytes and 12 terabytes in there.

12:40.240 --> 12:46.320
So it's somewhere in the region of 70 to 80 terabytes of raw actual usable storage.

12:46.320 --> 12:51.680
So I'm not really hurting for space, but I've kind of set a benchmark of 200 bucks per drive

12:51.680 --> 12:58.560
as my kind of line in the sand to say, right, I'm not spending more than 200 per whatever

12:58.560 --> 13:00.240
size drive I can buy for that.

13:00.880 --> 13:02.080
That's what I'll buy this year.

13:02.640 --> 13:06.240
And obviously there are some considerations with that because with ZFS, you have to have

13:06.240 --> 13:07.360
the same size drives.

13:08.240 --> 13:12.240
Mismatched drives, you will lose a couple of terabytes here, a couple of terabytes there

13:12.240 --> 13:13.040
if you're not careful.

13:14.240 --> 13:21.040
And with SNAT RAID as well, the parity disk has to be as big or bigger than the largest

13:21.040 --> 13:21.600
data disk.

13:22.240 --> 13:26.720
So every time I change capacities, I've got to factor that into my mind.

13:27.440 --> 13:32.640
And so when I'm looking at what do I buy, I think, well, I have 10 drives.

13:32.640 --> 13:36.560
In my experience, hard drives last for about five years.

13:37.360 --> 13:40.320
Why don't I just buy two drives every year?

13:40.320 --> 13:45.680
And then that way, when I upgrade the parity drive, I actually also get a nice bump on

13:45.680 --> 13:46.880
my data disks as well.

13:47.600 --> 13:52.640
And then I can retire the existing drive to either go into my backup server, which is

13:52.640 --> 13:57.680
part of my home lab, or I can just wipe them and sell them on eBay for a few pennies.

13:57.680 --> 14:05.200
And this year, I was able to pick up a couple of 14 terabyte easy stores from Best Buy for

14:05.200 --> 14:06.560
$200 a pop.

14:07.440 --> 14:09.040
Wow, that's great.

14:10.240 --> 14:11.760
Now these are three and a half inch drives.

14:12.480 --> 14:15.680
Yeah, well, I mean, they come, it's just really annoying to be honest.

14:15.680 --> 14:21.200
I wish they would just sell these drives without the USB casing on them, but they don't.

14:21.200 --> 14:22.960
So, hey, here we are.

14:22.960 --> 14:28.320
What happens is you buy a retail box from Best Buy and it has a big plastic shell around

14:28.320 --> 14:34.480
the drives with a USB to SATA conversion drive and a power supply.

14:34.480 --> 14:38.320
And I've got to imagine there's quite a few dollars worth of extra cost in assembling

14:38.320 --> 14:42.240
these things, putting them in a nice fancy case with a power supply, et cetera.

14:43.360 --> 14:47.280
Why not just pass the saving on to me and say, look, you know, this is a drive that

14:47.280 --> 14:48.880
was destined for an easy store.

14:48.880 --> 14:53.120
Have it, but, you know, it's 20% cheaper than the retail model or something, I don't

14:53.120 --> 14:53.620
know.

14:54.160 --> 14:55.680
There's got to be a business reason, right?

14:55.680 --> 14:59.120
Somebody who, somebody out there listening must know, let us know, selfhosted.show slash

14:59.120 --> 15:00.080
contact.

15:00.080 --> 15:01.920
Why won't they just sell us these drives directly?

15:03.040 --> 15:07.440
I think it probably boils down to the fact that they know that the warranty claims are

15:07.440 --> 15:12.480
going to be less from people that have shut drives because, you know, you've got to take

15:12.480 --> 15:15.680
a few guitar picks and break some of the plastic tabs open.

15:15.680 --> 15:19.520
And it can be, if you've not done it before, quite an intimidating process.

15:19.520 --> 15:22.240
You're like, I've got $200 on my desk in front of me.

15:22.240 --> 15:23.280
I don't want to break it.

15:24.080 --> 15:25.440
I've heard a conspiracy.

15:25.440 --> 15:30.880
What I've been told is that they are drives that for some reason they suspect have lower

15:30.880 --> 15:31.920
quality to them.

15:31.920 --> 15:35.920
Like maybe the boards had QA issues or something like that.

15:36.480 --> 15:41.840
So they have the data that shows them that external drives don't run for as many hours

15:41.840 --> 15:45.440
as their internal drives do, and so they fail less.

15:45.440 --> 15:49.520
So they still think they're good enough for those use cases.

15:49.520 --> 15:55.120
So they package them up, and they sell them off, and they figure it's good enough because

15:55.120 --> 15:59.040
those users generally will run them for 80% less time than the people that have them built

15:59.040 --> 16:00.880
in, so they'll never notice.

16:00.880 --> 16:02.400
I've heard that, but I don't know if that's true.

16:03.040 --> 16:06.640
I mean, we're never going to know if it's actually true or not, are we?

16:06.640 --> 16:07.600
But it would make sense.

16:07.600 --> 16:11.600
There'd be some MBA in an office somewhere, worked out a way that they would never notice

16:11.600 --> 16:15.760
and worked out how can we bin these drives that have failed a certain level of QA testing.

16:15.760 --> 16:17.920
Yeah, but you haven't really seen that bear out.

16:17.920 --> 16:20.960
I mean, you've used quite a bit of shucks drives, and it's not like you have a lot of

16:20.960 --> 16:21.680
drive failures.

16:22.320 --> 16:22.960
Touch wood?

16:22.960 --> 16:24.640
No, I haven't had.

16:25.280 --> 16:30.480
I've had one actually fail, but I think that was a result of putting it into the Helios

16:30.480 --> 16:36.080
64 because the data pins snapped off and I had to solder and it was a bit messy.

16:36.080 --> 16:39.760
So that was an actual Alex booboo, not a drive booboo.

16:39.760 --> 16:45.760
That's anecdotal, but your anecdotal evidence would seem to suggest that it hasn't led to

16:45.760 --> 16:47.600
less reliable disk than I would say.

16:47.600 --> 16:49.040
So far, so good.

16:49.040 --> 16:52.000
Yeah, but then you've got to factor in that.

16:52.000 --> 16:55.840
How much is a 14 terabyte drive on Newegg right now?

16:55.840 --> 16:58.240
I'm going to go and look it up right now, real time.

16:58.240 --> 17:05.760
So a comparable 14 terabyte drive on Newegg, a Western Digital Ultra Star, 14 terabyte

17:05.760 --> 17:07.520
drive, three and a half inch drive.

17:07.520 --> 17:15.120
$280 without the shell on it versus $200 at Best Buy for one with the shell on it.

17:15.120 --> 17:16.640
There are some warranty differences.

17:16.640 --> 17:18.080
This one has a five year warranty.

17:18.080 --> 17:21.440
I think the drives that come in the case only have three years.

17:22.240 --> 17:23.600
Factor that in as you will.

17:24.320 --> 17:31.360
But even so, I mean, once you do the calculations over enough disks, you actually end up saving

17:31.360 --> 17:32.400
quite a bit of money.

17:32.400 --> 17:38.720
So even if a couple more fail, over time, you're still probably saving some cash.

17:39.280 --> 17:43.120
Now, do you find you're having to do many or any kind of tricks these days for the

17:43.120 --> 17:44.080
drives you're shucking?

17:45.200 --> 17:45.760
No, I don't.

17:45.760 --> 17:52.160
But that's simply because I built three years ago some custom SATA power connectors and

17:52.160 --> 17:54.800
I just snipped off the three volt rail in there.

17:54.800 --> 17:59.680
So whatever comes from my power supply may well have a three volt rail, but whatever

17:59.680 --> 18:03.200
I plug into the disks doesn't, so it doesn't matter to me.

18:04.080 --> 18:04.960
That is nice.

18:04.960 --> 18:05.760
That is nice.

18:07.280 --> 18:11.040
I'd like to mention our friends at a Cloud Guru have the Linux Web Services course.

18:11.520 --> 18:15.920
Learn the various software tools and utilities used to configure web services on a Linux

18:15.920 --> 18:16.400
host.

18:17.120 --> 18:21.440
You'll find out what the different use cases are for Apache, Squid, NGINX.

18:21.440 --> 18:26.240
You'll learn how to set up virtual hosts, proxies, when to use a reverse proxy and how

18:26.240 --> 18:28.560
to manage SSL and load balancing.

18:28.560 --> 18:33.840
You'll also get some insights in Apache metrics and the differences between Apache

18:33.840 --> 18:35.040
and NGINX.

18:35.040 --> 18:39.600
We'll have a link in the show notes to this course or go to a cloudguru.com and search

18:39.600 --> 18:44.960
for Linux Web Services, a cloudguru.com and the course Linux Web Services.

18:47.200 --> 18:51.920
So new drives, of course, mean that it's time to start figuring out where to plug

18:51.920 --> 18:58.480
stuff in and rebuild servers and just generally get my ducks in a row.

18:58.480 --> 18:58.960
Right?

18:58.960 --> 18:59.460
Sure.

19:00.240 --> 19:06.400
So before I went to England, I threw in the new motherboard, the ASRock Rack motherboard

19:06.400 --> 19:09.040
that I wrote the blog post about and I mentioned on the show.

19:09.040 --> 19:09.920
It looked really good.

19:09.920 --> 19:12.800
I think we talked about it for a bit and I almost wanted to order one.

19:12.800 --> 19:13.300
Yeah.

19:13.600 --> 19:18.320
Well, unfortunately, I've discovered what I think is quite a big flaw in that motherboard.

19:18.960 --> 19:19.460
Uh-oh.

19:19.460 --> 19:22.100
Yeah, it's to do with how the PCIe lanes get shared out.

19:22.100 --> 19:27.380
So it doesn't sound like a big deal except for the fact that I want to have about three

19:27.380 --> 19:35.620
or four different NVMe M.2 drives in there as well as a PCIe U.2 NVMe drive as well plus

19:35.620 --> 19:37.300
my HBA card.

19:37.300 --> 19:42.020
So by the time I've done that, I've used up quite a lot of PCIe lanes and the real

19:42.020 --> 19:46.100
kicker was I tested something called PCIe bifurcation.

19:46.100 --> 19:52.100
And what that means is I can take the 16x slot and split it into three or four different

19:52.100 --> 19:53.060
slices.

19:53.060 --> 20:01.140
So I could take, I have a PCIe card that has four M.2 slots on it and I can take my 16x

20:01.140 --> 20:06.260
basically graphics card slot and turn that into four M.2 slots.

20:06.260 --> 20:08.820
In this case, it was actually only three because of how the lanes worked.

20:09.860 --> 20:12.980
So when I did all the testing before I went to England, I plugged everything in and it

20:12.980 --> 20:17.060
all worked and I was like, oh, brilliant, I can use this motherboard in my server, replacing

20:17.060 --> 20:20.580
one that had a lot more PCIe lanes that was a dual Xeon, et cetera, et cetera.

20:21.140 --> 20:26.420
Trouble was I didn't actually put something in the fourth and final PCIe slot.

20:27.220 --> 20:29.060
Until now, what happened?

20:29.700 --> 20:30.260
Until now.

20:30.260 --> 20:35.540
So before I went to England, I did that and I noticed that one of the NVMe drives wasn't

20:35.540 --> 20:41.060
showing up as part of my ZFS mirror that I have for my Docker app data.

20:41.060 --> 20:44.580
And I was like, ah, screw it, I'm getting on a plane tomorrow.

20:44.580 --> 20:46.020
I'll deal with it when I get back.

20:46.980 --> 20:55.860
Turned out when you put something into that final slot, the PCIe switch inside the motherboard

20:55.860 --> 21:02.820
turns that first slot from a 16 to an 8x slot, which means that bifurcation doesn't work.

21:04.420 --> 21:06.500
But that took me all day to figure that out.

21:06.500 --> 21:12.100
Right, and it's not like there's a little LED light that comes on that says, by the

21:12.100 --> 21:14.020
way, bifurcation has been disabled.

21:15.860 --> 21:18.980
You just got to really know how that motherboard works to figure that out.

21:18.980 --> 21:23.300
So you must have assumed everything from hardware failure to firmware issues.

21:24.100 --> 21:26.900
Was it digging through the motherboard manual where you finally put it together?

21:27.460 --> 21:30.660
Yeah, I actually had to go and look at the flipping schematic

21:30.660 --> 21:32.420
of the motherboard chipset layout.

21:32.420 --> 21:36.980
It was only, honestly, once I plugged, so I went back to my Apple Genius Bar training

21:36.980 --> 21:41.060
and unplugged everything and was like, right, I'm going to do a minimum viable system, right?

21:41.060 --> 21:43.380
If I put something in this slot, does it work?

21:43.380 --> 21:45.700
If I put something in that slot, does it work?

21:45.700 --> 21:48.420
And everything on its own worked.

21:49.220 --> 21:53.060
It was only when I put something in the final slot and I was like, oh, no.

21:53.620 --> 21:56.660
And then did you try taking that thing in the final slot and putting it in its own

21:56.660 --> 21:58.180
slot and see if it works on its own?

21:58.180 --> 21:59.140
Yeah, it did.

21:59.140 --> 21:59.940
Yeah, it did.

21:59.940 --> 22:02.500
Yeah, that's what you got to do, that's what you got to do.

22:02.500 --> 22:07.860
And then I was just like, shit, this means that there's a bug in the BIOS

22:08.580 --> 22:12.900
or there's something wrong with how the PCIe routing works.

22:12.900 --> 22:17.780
So then I went and read the manual for far too long and figured it out and I was like, oh, crap.

22:17.780 --> 22:20.900
So, I mean, it's still a good motherboard, right?

22:21.620 --> 22:23.300
It's kind of an edge case.

22:24.260 --> 22:27.780
Yeah, but I mean, there's only three PCIe slots on the damn thing anyway,

22:27.780 --> 22:30.020
because it's a micro ATX board.

22:30.020 --> 22:30.500
Yeah.

22:30.500 --> 22:35.380
So would it have killed them to put an extra few lanes on it?

22:35.380 --> 22:41.300
I know the platform's capable because my consumer level board has enough lanes to have two PCIe

22:41.300 --> 22:45.540
slots and 2M.2 slots and 4M.

22:45.540 --> 22:51.700
What I'm trying to say is they've cheaped out somewhere and it's just a frustrating

22:51.700 --> 22:54.100
place to cheap out on a server grade motherboard.

22:54.100 --> 22:57.460
Yeah, you would think that's just it.

22:57.460 --> 22:58.020
That is just it.

22:58.020 --> 23:04.660
Like if there was going to be a situation where you end up using or needing as much PCIe possible,

23:05.300 --> 23:09.940
it's probably more likely to be in a server scenario than pretty much any desktop

23:09.940 --> 23:11.620
scenario, except for gaming machines.

23:13.140 --> 23:19.860
And the upshot is, right, I've gone from, instead of having a two terabyte MVME mirror,

23:19.860 --> 23:25.540
ZFS mirror for all my Docker app data, I've gone down to a single ZFS drive,

23:25.540 --> 23:27.060
two terabyte MVME drive.

23:27.620 --> 23:29.620
It's backed up to my backup server.

23:29.620 --> 23:36.100
So if anything happens, which funny story, I accidentally wiped one of the drives,

23:36.100 --> 23:41.540
one of the two terabyte drives that had a couple of VMs on it and my home assistant install on it.

23:41.540 --> 23:42.900
Oh no.

23:42.900 --> 23:47.460
That's part of my troubleshooting because I saw another PCIe MVME drive pop up and I was like,

23:47.460 --> 23:49.620
that's it, why isn't ZFS seeing it?

23:49.620 --> 23:51.700
I'll just try wiping the partition table.

23:51.700 --> 23:52.820
Like that's going to work.

23:54.100 --> 23:54.740
Oh no.

23:54.740 --> 23:56.580
So your home assistant was down for a while.

23:56.580 --> 23:58.100
Yeah, it was down for about a day.

23:58.100 --> 23:58.600
Yeah.

24:00.020 --> 24:00.980
Oh no.

24:00.980 --> 24:01.480
Yeah.

24:01.860 --> 24:06.180
And then it's a good test because I was able to test the backups of several different things.

24:06.180 --> 24:11.140
You know, I used Syncoid to replicate to my local backup and really it just vindicated

24:11.140 --> 24:14.900
why I have an onsite backup as well as offsite.

24:14.900 --> 24:21.460
Because restoring the three, 400 gigabytes over the LAN, over gigabit, was an hour.

24:22.180 --> 24:25.620
Whereas doing it from my dad's in England would have taken me weeks.

24:25.620 --> 24:26.120
Yeah.

24:26.120 --> 24:30.340
It's not complete just having one, but having both, that's really where I feel comfortable.

24:30.340 --> 24:36.100
And you're right, it's, oh man, I can't even imagine how stressed I would be if I wiped

24:36.100 --> 24:42.340
out home assistant because it's kind of become integral to how the RV functions these days.

24:42.340 --> 24:46.260
So it would be like systems are offline and everything's running on manual mode.

24:46.260 --> 24:46.760
I don't know.

24:46.760 --> 24:50.020
Well, we have motion sensor lights in the kitchen and I walked in the kitchen in the

24:50.020 --> 24:53.140
evening, I was like, why aren't the damn lights turning on?

24:53.140 --> 24:57.060
Oh, and then the conversation with the wife has to be pretty awkward too.

24:57.060 --> 25:00.020
Like that's, oh, she knew something was up.

25:00.020 --> 25:01.540
I think she calls it a nerd rage.

25:02.260 --> 25:02.760
Oh, sure.

25:02.760 --> 25:03.260
Yeah.

25:03.260 --> 25:03.760
Right.

25:03.760 --> 25:04.260
Of course.

25:04.260 --> 25:07.620
She must've been, she must've been aware something was going down just from that, but you know,

25:07.620 --> 25:12.900
I just like, uh, cause it's not, it's, it's the, the house isn't working.

25:12.900 --> 25:14.740
There's that factor, which is embarrassing.

25:14.740 --> 25:16.980
Then there's the fact that you're the one that set it all up.

25:16.980 --> 25:18.260
So it operates like that.

25:18.260 --> 25:21.380
And then there's the fact that you're the one that just broke the very thing that you

25:21.380 --> 25:26.340
set up that the whole house depends on to operate because I wrote a new partition table

25:26.340 --> 25:26.840
on a drive.

25:27.540 --> 25:28.660
Why would I do that?

25:28.660 --> 25:31.780
It's one of those things you do it in the moment and you're like, ah, be fine.

25:31.780 --> 25:32.280
You reboot.

25:32.280 --> 25:39.180
And then it says ZFS pool, Intel, two terabyte MVME not found, you know, like, oh no, oh

25:39.180 --> 25:39.680
no.

25:39.680 --> 25:43.180
Cause you know, instantly that that's just the rest of the evening gone.

25:43.980 --> 25:44.480
Yeah.

25:44.780 --> 25:45.280
Oh yeah.

25:45.280 --> 25:51.580
That, that is such a sinking feeling and it's, it's like, okay, I have backups, but in that

25:51.580 --> 25:56.380
very moment, like it's all on those backups, you know, are they up to date?

25:57.380 --> 25:59.180
No, actually a couple of them weren't.

25:59.180 --> 26:03.780
So I read IRC bouncer that I used to get on the Red Hat VPN and stuff like that.

26:04.380 --> 26:07.280
The last backup of that, that I had was actually from July.

26:08.580 --> 26:13.380
So I had to, uh, lose three or four months worth of history there with an IRC and stuff

26:13.380 --> 26:17.580
like that, which was a bit frustrating because quite often when I'm working a support case

26:17.580 --> 26:21.980
for a customer or something, um, tip bits will come through IRC when I'm talking to

26:21.980 --> 26:27.380
the support engineer and it's actually a very useful resource and I've lost four or five

26:27.380 --> 26:30.780
months of that now, so let that be a lesson to your kids.

26:30.780 --> 26:32.780
Make sure your backups are current.

26:33.380 --> 26:37.380
We should have like a tagline at the outro every episode and go check your backups.

26:37.380 --> 26:38.580
Cause you and I both been there.

26:38.580 --> 26:39.080
Yes.

26:39.780 --> 26:43.080
And thank God for the home assistant Google drive integration.

26:43.180 --> 26:43.880
Oh my goodness.

26:43.880 --> 26:44.380
Yeah.

26:44.580 --> 26:48.780
Just import a new home assistant image into Proxmox using a script that's on GitHub.

26:48.780 --> 26:55.480
So it takes literally a minute and then apply the full restore using the Google drive backup

26:55.480 --> 26:59.380
plugin and it says, if nothing happened, it's just amazing.

26:59.780 --> 27:00.780
That's sweet.

27:00.980 --> 27:01.280
That's nice.

27:01.280 --> 27:02.980
Now it's so easy to get working on Proxmox.

27:02.980 --> 27:04.180
I do want to try that someday.

27:06.180 --> 27:07.980
Backblaze.com slash SSH.

27:08.380 --> 27:13.380
Get peace of mind knowing your files are backed up securely in the cloud with Backblaze.

27:13.880 --> 27:17.980
If you have it on your laptop and your PC, and maybe you have it on a NAS, that's essentially

27:17.980 --> 27:19.180
only having one copy.

27:19.580 --> 27:21.780
That's what I love about this offer from Backblaze.

27:22.180 --> 27:23.980
You get a free trial, no fees.

27:23.980 --> 27:26.580
You get a free trial, no credit card required.

27:26.980 --> 27:29.680
Unlimited computer backup for Macs and PCs.

27:29.680 --> 27:31.280
Just $7 a month.

27:31.480 --> 27:34.380
Your documents, your music, your photos, your videos, your drawings, your projects.

27:34.980 --> 27:35.780
All your data.

27:36.380 --> 27:38.980
And the nice thing too, you can restore from anywhere.

27:39.180 --> 27:41.980
Not only is that just handy, but maybe one day even necessary.

27:42.180 --> 27:45.680
And if you've got a lot of data, they also offer a restore by mail option.

27:46.380 --> 27:47.680
It's a pretty slick system.

27:48.480 --> 27:50.780
And if you're worried about getting files from your phone, don't worry.

27:50.780 --> 27:51.780
They got you covered there.

27:51.780 --> 27:55.580
And if you want extended retention, they got you covered for $2 a month more right there too.

27:56.480 --> 28:00.080
Over 50 billion files have been restored for Backblaze customers.

28:00.280 --> 28:01.180
You know it works.

28:01.680 --> 28:06.280
So go get a fully featured, no credit card required trial at Backblaze.com.

28:06.280 --> 28:07.380
slash SSH.

28:07.680 --> 28:08.080
That's right.

28:08.080 --> 28:09.080
Backblaze.com.

28:09.080 --> 28:09.880
slash SSH.

28:09.880 --> 28:12.980
You know, that lets them know where you came from and it supports the show.

28:13.780 --> 28:15.080
Go there, check it out.

28:15.380 --> 28:16.780
You know Backblaze is legitimate.

28:16.780 --> 28:18.880
You know they are the best in the business.

28:18.880 --> 28:22.280
And now it's a great opportunity for you to support the show and get a free trial

28:22.280 --> 28:23.380
with no credit card required.

28:23.480 --> 28:24.280
It's a win-win.

28:24.580 --> 28:25.780
Backblaze.com.

28:25.780 --> 28:27.280
slash SSH.

28:28.880 --> 28:34.780
So it seems like a lot of reworking things and you were telling me before the

28:34.780 --> 28:39.380
show that you kind of use that opportunity to get your documentation game up.

28:40.080 --> 28:43.480
And you may have kind of put together what you could almost call a self-hosted

28:43.480 --> 28:44.280
Notion setup.

28:44.680 --> 28:48.380
Yeah, I think we'll cover this in a lot more detail probably next episode.

28:48.380 --> 28:52.380
I'm still working out some of the rough corners, but the rough gist is this.

28:52.380 --> 28:57.780
I've been using a documentation app called Obsidian recently as part of this

28:57.780 --> 29:03.880
whole new Zettelkasten Rome research foam in VS code.

29:04.880 --> 29:06.180
Don't forget Emacs org mode.

29:07.080 --> 29:10.980
Emacs org Rome, which I have used for a lot of our show notes actually and I

29:10.980 --> 29:14.780
still love, but Emacs is just a pain, isn't it?

29:14.880 --> 29:15.680
I'm sorry, audience.

29:15.680 --> 29:16.180
I'm sorry.

29:16.180 --> 29:19.780
I'm sorry, send your hate mail to Alan at Jupiter Broadcasting.com.

29:20.480 --> 29:22.680
Hey, to be fair, you gave it a legit go.

29:23.180 --> 29:23.680
I did.

29:23.680 --> 29:23.980
Yeah.

29:23.980 --> 29:28.380
I mean, it's just it just breaks a bit too often when I want to sit down

29:28.380 --> 29:29.080
and take notes.

29:29.180 --> 29:30.380
Unfortunately, that's not so.

29:30.380 --> 29:30.780
Yeah.

29:31.080 --> 29:31.280
Yeah.

29:31.280 --> 29:31.580
Yeah.

29:31.780 --> 29:32.380
C'est la vie.

29:33.180 --> 29:36.380
So yes, I'm using Obsidian, which is a free.

29:36.680 --> 29:40.680
I think it's open source and Notion.

29:41.180 --> 29:45.880
I should say is like the new game in note-taking.

29:45.880 --> 29:49.280
It's an all-in-one note-taker where you can embed embed spreadsheets

29:49.280 --> 29:54.380
and wikis and obviously notes and drawings and it's a monster electron

29:54.380 --> 29:58.680
app and it also has a web service and it has native iOS and Android

29:58.680 --> 30:01.980
apps and it promises to be what like several different note-taking

30:01.980 --> 30:03.580
apps are all in one place.

30:03.580 --> 30:07.080
And of course it has team integration and business stuff and all of

30:07.080 --> 30:08.280
that, but it's a service.

30:08.280 --> 30:09.980
It's not something you can run yourself.

30:10.580 --> 30:14.080
And you know, as well as I do that you probably have fragments of

30:14.080 --> 30:16.580
notes in about eight different apps that you've tried over the

30:16.580 --> 30:22.380
last 10 years and getting the data out of these proprietary services

30:22.380 --> 30:27.280
is just very difficult, you know, and the thing that I really love

30:27.280 --> 30:30.080
about Obsidian, there's lots of others coming up as well as one

30:30.080 --> 30:34.280
called LogSec SEQ go and have a look at that if you're interested.

30:34.680 --> 30:37.980
But the thing I love about Obsidian is it does everything in

30:37.980 --> 30:39.180
markdown files.

30:39.580 --> 30:40.180
There you go.

30:40.180 --> 30:46.580
So is it storing them just all on the file system locally in plain

30:46.580 --> 30:47.680
text on your disk?

30:47.680 --> 30:48.080
Yep.

30:48.180 --> 30:52.680
So it really even has Joplin beat in that regard because for some

30:52.680 --> 30:56.080
reason and this pisses me off because Joplin is so close.

30:57.180 --> 30:59.680
It scrambles the file names in Joplin.

30:59.680 --> 31:02.980
Like if you've ever looked at the plain text files on disk from

31:02.980 --> 31:07.380
Joplin, it's just, you know, it's 32 characters of complete gibberish

31:07.380 --> 31:11.980
and it's so close Joplin is so close, but if they fix that one

31:11.980 --> 31:18.380
thing, they're like ID database ID file names or something, but

31:18.380 --> 31:20.980
it sounds like you're kind of cooking something that's a little

31:20.980 --> 31:24.180
more complete even that's like web component search component

31:24.180 --> 31:24.680
all of that.

31:24.680 --> 31:25.080
Yeah.

31:25.180 --> 31:25.380
Yeah.

31:25.380 --> 31:28.180
The really nice thing about Notion is that there's a little check

31:28.180 --> 31:31.780
box you can select in the corner that says make this note public

31:32.280 --> 31:35.180
and when I was working on my photography article for Ars Technica

31:35.180 --> 31:38.380
a few months ago, I really gave Notion a full try just to get

31:38.380 --> 31:41.880
the experience and I've got to say it was fantastic.

31:41.880 --> 31:45.380
Actually, I mean apart from the fact that it my data is now

31:45.380 --> 31:49.580
hostage in that system and the fact that I could share notes

31:49.580 --> 31:52.380
with, you know, the editors are ours and they could, you know,

31:52.380 --> 31:55.180
make comments and it was like it was like Google Docs but on

31:55.180 --> 31:58.880
steroids because it I could it would it's hard to explain but

31:58.880 --> 32:01.280
I really really enjoyed the experience.

32:01.680 --> 32:04.580
I could definitely see that especially in working, you know,

32:04.580 --> 32:06.780
with like an outlet like publishing.

32:06.980 --> 32:07.480
Yeah, for sure.

32:07.480 --> 32:09.980
So something like that would be great and I could version

32:09.980 --> 32:13.680
things and it had an iOS app and you know, lots of good

32:13.680 --> 32:18.080
reasons. So I'm pairing Obsidian with, you know, just creates

32:18.080 --> 32:19.680
a directory of markdown files.

32:20.080 --> 32:23.580
I've mentioned this on the show before but MKDocs just reads

32:23.580 --> 32:27.080
a directory of markdown files to create a self-hosted Wiki

32:27.480 --> 32:30.880
but to connect the two in the middle, you probably want some

32:30.880 --> 32:34.980
kind of a continuous integration build system thing and for

32:34.980 --> 32:37.580
that I've been trying out something called Drone connected

32:37.580 --> 32:42.680
with Git T lately and I'll go into full details probably in

32:42.680 --> 32:45.580
the next episode, but definitely in a blog post over the

32:45.580 --> 32:48.780
next two weeks explaining how I go about connecting the two.

32:48.780 --> 32:51.980
I've actually already written the first part of that blog

32:51.980 --> 32:56.280
post series, which is how to connect MKDocs and DroneCI

32:56.280 --> 33:00.280
together. So the next part will be how how I use a couple

33:00.280 --> 33:03.680
of plugins in MKDocs to really make some of the cool stuff

33:03.680 --> 33:06.880
in Obsidian like the Wiki linking and the back linking stuff

33:07.280 --> 33:10.180
all kind of work as part of the website as well.

33:10.480 --> 33:11.580
It's really slick.

33:11.580 --> 33:14.380
I've been using it for the last few days since the weekend

33:14.380 --> 33:17.580
to document which hard drives in which slot which ZigBee

33:17.580 --> 33:20.180
button I've put in which room all this kind of stuff and

33:20.180 --> 33:23.380
I am really for the first time feeling like this might be

33:23.380 --> 33:27.280
a long-term Wiki solution that I can use my wife can actually

33:27.280 --> 33:30.980
use. I'm really pretty jazzed on this one to be honest.

33:31.480 --> 33:33.380
Well, then I look forward to hearing more about it.

33:33.480 --> 33:35.980
You gave me a little demonstration before the show and

33:35.980 --> 33:37.180
it is very cool.

33:37.180 --> 33:40.480
And what I like about the entire pipeline is you keep the

33:40.480 --> 33:42.280
data on your land the entire time.

33:42.680 --> 33:46.080
So it is something I could replicate and use off-grid,

33:46.080 --> 33:47.480
which is something I'm always looking for.

33:48.480 --> 33:48.980
Absolutely.

33:48.980 --> 33:51.180
Yeah, and you've got the website component so you could

33:51.180 --> 33:54.080
pull it up on your phone where you wherever you are, you

33:54.080 --> 33:57.080
know, a lot of these note-taking apps Emacs is a perfect

33:57.080 --> 33:59.580
example doing that on mobile.

33:59.580 --> 34:03.880
It's just a train wreck, you know, an Obsidian has an iOS

34:03.880 --> 34:06.780
app as I mentioned, I think they're working on a Google

34:06.780 --> 34:08.480
Play version of the app as well.

34:09.180 --> 34:12.680
And obviously I've got Obsidian on the desktop so I can

34:12.680 --> 34:17.080
do my editing in a real first-class editor unlike some kind

34:17.080 --> 34:20.780
of random Wiki software, which is honestly where things

34:20.780 --> 34:23.780
like tiddly Wiki have fallen down for me as the editor

34:23.780 --> 34:25.980
just doesn't do it.

34:25.980 --> 34:28.280
I still use tiddly Wiki and I've got a lot of useful

34:28.280 --> 34:30.380
information in there that I'm migrating over.

34:30.480 --> 34:33.680
Hmm, but the long-term review of tiddly Wiki is my wife

34:33.680 --> 34:37.080
doesn't use it because it's putting images in it's just I

34:37.080 --> 34:40.880
had to create an entry in the Wiki of how to use the Wiki

34:40.880 --> 34:42.380
to add images to the Wiki.

34:42.980 --> 34:44.880
Yeah, that sounds about right.

34:44.880 --> 34:45.780
Not a good indictment.

34:45.780 --> 34:47.080
When you were showing it to me earlier.

34:47.580 --> 34:50.380
I noticed that you had a plug-in to generate really

34:50.380 --> 34:52.680
quick and nice-looking markdown table.

34:52.680 --> 34:56.280
So is there a pretty healthy like community plug-in ecosystem

34:56.280 --> 34:57.180
around Obsidian?

34:57.380 --> 34:57.980
Oh, yeah.

34:58.080 --> 35:00.480
Yeah, there was an episode of the Connected podcast on

35:00.480 --> 35:04.280
Relay FM where one of the guys goes into basically how

35:04.280 --> 35:08.780
he's creating his own basically his own editor inside Obsidian

35:08.780 --> 35:12.480
to work with his own workflow that publishes posts and does

35:12.480 --> 35:13.680
all sorts of crazy stuff.

35:14.380 --> 35:14.880
Oh wow.

35:14.880 --> 35:19.580
I would honestly liken the community plug-in ecosystem

35:20.080 --> 35:20.980
to Emacs.

35:20.980 --> 35:25.080
It started off as just an editor, but it's very quickly becoming

35:25.080 --> 35:28.280
a bit of a cult and lots of people are writing stuff that

35:28.280 --> 35:31.980
will run all sorts of crazy stuff inside Obsidian and I'm

35:31.980 --> 35:35.980
only two or three days in at this point, so I can only imagine

35:35.980 --> 35:40.380
how in a couple of months I'll be doing all sorts of wacky

35:40.380 --> 35:41.680
wild and wonderful stuff.

35:42.680 --> 35:45.880
And Obsidian is 100% free for personal use.

35:46.280 --> 35:47.980
No account required.

35:47.980 --> 35:50.480
You get access to the plugins and the API.

35:50.980 --> 35:53.180
There are a couple of paid versions, which I imagine is

35:53.180 --> 35:55.780
also kind of a nice way to support development.

35:56.380 --> 36:00.180
You get access like early builds and then there's also a

36:00.180 --> 36:02.780
commercial version and even there it's 50 bucks.

36:02.780 --> 36:05.680
Like it's worth the pricing is really is really fair.

36:06.080 --> 36:09.680
I like this model and I've heard people that you and I both

36:09.680 --> 36:12.680
really respect in our community talk really highly of Obsidian,

36:13.180 --> 36:15.680
but it does definitely strike me as a power tool Alex like

36:15.680 --> 36:18.680
it's not it's not a casual notes app something like simple

36:18.680 --> 36:21.380
note is or the notes app that's built into your phone OS.

36:21.380 --> 36:25.580
It's like it's a power tool of for notes if you want it to

36:25.580 --> 36:31.780
be I mean it could just be completely atomic unlinked set

36:31.780 --> 36:32.980
of Markdown files.

36:33.480 --> 36:36.480
That would be nice still the magic of it though is if you

36:36.480 --> 36:39.280
do start connecting everything together, you know, I've got

36:39.280 --> 36:43.180
a page here that has all of my ZigBee buttons listed, but

36:43.180 --> 36:46.980
then I connect to a separate page elsewhere that then says

36:47.480 --> 36:51.180
you know that ZigBee button is an Ikea trad free and I connect

36:51.180 --> 36:54.080
to another note about how to set up an Ikea trad free button

36:54.380 --> 36:57.280
not as part of the original ZigBee note, but as its own

36:57.280 --> 37:02.680
separate atomic thing that just lives in its own space but

37:02.680 --> 37:05.480
has a backlink to the ZigBee stuff.

37:05.480 --> 37:10.180
It's kind of hard to explain but this this whole Zettel custom

37:10.180 --> 37:13.080
linking notes and organic research type thing.

37:13.080 --> 37:15.980
It's very popular in academia, but I'm finding it very useful

37:15.980 --> 37:17.580
for technical documentation as well.

37:19.280 --> 37:23.480
Linode.com slash SSH go there to get $100 and 60 day credit

37:23.480 --> 37:27.180
on a new account and you go there to support the show Linodes

37:27.180 --> 37:30.680
where we host everything and Linodes also my lab in the cloud

37:31.180 --> 37:33.280
if I'm trying something out if there's a project that we

37:33.280 --> 37:36.580
want to evaluate or also if we want to have something to

37:36.580 --> 37:40.780
just send the audience to go bang on for a bit. I build that

37:40.780 --> 37:41.380
on Linode.

37:41.380 --> 37:44.080
I mean my ISP's connection is not up for that job anyways,

37:44.080 --> 37:46.980
and it's not like I'm going to go rack something in a colo

37:46.980 --> 37:50.480
somewhere like I did back in the early aughts.

37:50.780 --> 37:52.780
Now, I'm going I'm going to go to Linode and you can't do

37:52.780 --> 37:55.580
you can get $100 and 60 day credit on a new account.

37:55.780 --> 37:59.080
That's Linodes way of saying you can really try it out.

37:59.380 --> 38:02.380
It's not like, you know 15 bucks you're going to use for

38:02.380 --> 38:05.780
a little bit and just get first impressions $100.

38:05.780 --> 38:08.780
You can really try out Linode and see why we use it.

38:08.980 --> 38:12.380
See why we put our production software up there too.

38:12.580 --> 38:13.580
It's not just R&D.

38:13.580 --> 38:14.680
It's production as well.

38:15.380 --> 38:18.080
Go try out Alma Linux and Rocky Linux if you're evaluating

38:18.080 --> 38:19.280
different CentOS releases.

38:19.280 --> 38:20.980
There's all kinds of things you can do if there's so many

38:20.980 --> 38:24.080
opportunities to learn and they have great add-ons like S3

38:24.080 --> 38:27.880
compatible object storage cloud firewalls DDoS protection

38:27.880 --> 38:31.680
VLAN support and they're even rolling out bare metal servers.

38:31.980 --> 38:32.680
How about that?

38:32.680 --> 38:35.980
The best part though, the pricing 30 to 50% cheaper than

38:35.980 --> 38:37.180
the major hypervisors out there.

38:37.180 --> 38:39.480
They just want to lock you into their crazy custom platforms.

38:39.480 --> 38:42.680
Anyways, plus Linode has excellent performance 11 data centers

38:42.680 --> 38:45.880
around the world tons of great guides and the best customer

38:45.880 --> 38:46.780
service in the business.

38:47.280 --> 38:51.380
So sign up today and support the show Linode.com slash SSH.

38:51.480 --> 38:54.180
That's Linode.com slash SSH.

38:55.780 --> 38:59.680
Here we are in November and what does a new month mean means

38:59.680 --> 39:00.880
a new home assistant release.

39:00.880 --> 39:04.380
Yeah, it does just when you got the last one installed.

39:04.380 --> 39:09.180
Hopefully 90 contributors over a thousand pull requests.

39:09.280 --> 39:13.880
Let's there's a lot going on now with this project 67,000

39:13.880 --> 39:18.080
lines added 29 basically 30,000 lines of code removed.

39:19.080 --> 39:23.080
They call it a big release a lot of hacktoberfest contributions

39:23.080 --> 39:26.080
were in this one over a thousand different contributors to

39:26.080 --> 39:28.880
this release just the core to not the documents.

39:28.880 --> 39:32.580
The front-end stuff just the core home assistant release had

39:32.580 --> 39:34.480
a thousand over a thousand contributors.

39:34.580 --> 39:35.080
Wow.

39:35.480 --> 39:38.380
I mean that makes me wonder how it even worked before.

39:39.080 --> 39:43.280
I mean think about like managing that just going through it

39:43.280 --> 39:45.580
and making sure all that stuff's of certain quality.

39:46.280 --> 39:47.480
It's a heroic workload.

39:48.180 --> 39:51.880
No wonder Frank's a bit grumpy sometimes a you know, it seems

39:51.880 --> 39:53.280
like such a nice guy on the streams.

39:53.480 --> 39:56.680
Yeah, he is really I think sometimes we paint him in a bad

39:56.680 --> 39:59.580
light, but like you say when you see him actually in person

39:59.580 --> 40:02.880
and talking on the streams very articulate guy, obviously

40:02.880 --> 40:03.480
very smart.

40:03.480 --> 40:07.480
So yeah, he he told a story that you know, really demonstrated

40:07.780 --> 40:10.180
how much he really does care about the user experience.

40:10.980 --> 40:13.180
So, you know, they rolled out that new tuya integration that

40:13.180 --> 40:16.180
they worked with the tuya cloud folks and there was some

40:16.180 --> 40:19.080
problems and people are having a rough time of it.

40:19.680 --> 40:23.380
And so Frank sees that and he goes to his local stores and

40:23.380 --> 40:28.580
he fills up shopping carts full of tuya enabled devices crazy

40:28.580 --> 40:33.580
things like little one-off buttons cubes cameras doorbells

40:33.580 --> 40:37.580
all different kinds of lights Christmas decorations all sorts

40:37.580 --> 40:43.380
of stuff and brings it all home and sits there like just a

40:43.380 --> 40:47.080
champ and gets through all kinds of compatibility issues and

40:47.080 --> 40:48.580
just adds tons of devices.

40:48.980 --> 40:52.380
So some of that work is landing in this release and I think

40:52.380 --> 40:56.180
this release as well as a fix for time zone changes.

40:56.480 --> 40:59.780
There was a bug that caused like a lot of CPU usage when the

40:59.780 --> 41:01.780
time zone change kicked in which has already happened to our

41:01.780 --> 41:02.480
friends in Europe.

41:03.080 --> 41:05.880
They did release a hotfix mid cycle.

41:05.880 --> 41:08.980
That's why you may have seen additional update come down but

41:08.980 --> 41:10.780
this includes that hotfix as well.

41:10.880 --> 41:13.380
So you might want to do that and you'll like this speaking

41:13.380 --> 41:17.180
of links Alex you can now give devices links out to like the

41:17.180 --> 41:20.680
W led page for configuration or if it's a device that needs

41:20.680 --> 41:23.780
configuration it'll link right to it or if the device has

41:23.780 --> 41:25.180
like a local control panel.

41:26.180 --> 41:29.080
Now you won't have to go figure out what its IP is by searching

41:29.080 --> 41:32.180
your DHCP logs like I do home assistant will just generate

41:32.180 --> 41:35.380
a link to the management UI if it knows it and you can just

41:35.380 --> 41:38.580
find it right there in the device screen, which is nice.

41:39.680 --> 41:45.680
The icon picker has landed and it's pretty great.

41:46.480 --> 41:47.380
They did a good job.

41:47.380 --> 41:52.880
That is legit a very low priority feature, but boy, does it

41:52.880 --> 41:53.780
make a big difference?

41:53.780 --> 41:57.980
Yeah, and you know, if you haven't done this yet listener

41:57.980 --> 42:01.480
Alex and I love this but take a minute with some, you know,

42:01.480 --> 42:04.580
some evening when you're you know, you're kind of watching

42:04.580 --> 42:05.880
TV, but it's not something you're super into.

42:05.880 --> 42:07.480
I don't know whenever you got some downtime and go through

42:07.480 --> 42:10.180
and add icons to your end, you know to your entries and get

42:10.180 --> 42:11.480
everything with its own custom icon.

42:11.480 --> 42:14.080
What kind of light it is heaters fans.

42:14.080 --> 42:16.880
It really makes it nice and it makes it easier to sort through

42:16.880 --> 42:19.780
your stuff at a quick glance and they've really done a good

42:19.780 --> 42:22.480
job of making this thing sort through like over 6,000 icons

42:22.480 --> 42:23.180
in just seconds.

42:23.180 --> 42:24.980
It's super impressive.

42:25.180 --> 42:25.980
Just a couple other things.

42:25.980 --> 42:29.980
I'll mention they've added support for WebRTC video streams.

42:30.980 --> 42:34.380
Home assistant now will recognize a WebRTC stream as a camera

42:34.380 --> 42:36.280
source, but there is a catch.

42:36.980 --> 42:39.380
It's only active when your browser is viewing it and pulling

42:39.380 --> 42:42.480
it in because it's actually your browser that is establishing

42:42.480 --> 42:46.380
the WebRTC PDP video stream, but you can you can embed it

42:46.380 --> 42:49.280
and have it in a card and home assistant can help facilitate

42:49.280 --> 42:52.380
that an example of a device where this is actually kind of

42:52.380 --> 42:57.180
useful is the nest doorbell actually provides video via WebRTC

42:57.480 --> 42:59.280
and so now you could pull that into home assistant if you

42:59.280 --> 43:02.280
got a nest doorbell, that's pretty cool.

43:02.580 --> 43:05.480
I also saw something about the home assistant Amber that's

43:05.480 --> 43:05.980
coming up.

43:06.580 --> 43:07.080
Yeah, man.

43:07.080 --> 43:09.580
Well, they so it's funded good.

43:09.880 --> 43:14.580
Yeah, they had about 2500 ish backers raised half a million

43:14.580 --> 43:15.280
dollars.

43:15.280 --> 43:18.180
They were having and are having some problem sourcing their

43:18.180 --> 43:18.580
POE chip.

43:18.580 --> 43:21.880
So they're switching to a different chip, but there are some

43:21.880 --> 43:23.580
first hands-on of the prototype.

43:23.580 --> 43:26.380
It's bigger than I expected, but it looks really good.

43:26.380 --> 43:30.680
And there's some really special things that the home assistant

43:30.680 --> 43:32.280
crew did on the board.

43:32.280 --> 43:36.180
Like they drove little they like hand drew it's printed on

43:36.180 --> 43:37.880
there, but it looks like it's hand-drawn, but I'm sure it's

43:37.880 --> 43:41.080
not to the to like different chips on the board and they wrote

43:41.080 --> 43:43.080
on there what they do in this really cute little way.

43:43.080 --> 43:44.480
So it's a really nice touch.

43:44.480 --> 43:47.080
The home assistant Amber is looks like it's going to be a

43:47.080 --> 43:52.380
really nice piece of hardware to run home assistant and they

43:52.380 --> 43:55.180
I think I think they're pretty happy with the prototype so

43:55.180 --> 43:58.980
far and they they've shipped out to a couple of YouTubers to

43:58.980 --> 43:59.680
take a look at them.

43:59.780 --> 44:02.380
So if you search out on YouTube, you can find some hands-ons

44:02.380 --> 44:03.180
with the amber.

44:03.180 --> 44:05.680
Yeah, so that maybe we need to up our YouTube game.

44:05.680 --> 44:08.980
We need to get our hands on some of this gear, you know policies

44:08.980 --> 44:10.180
in the California area.

44:10.180 --> 44:12.380
Maybe we just need to like take him out for beers or something

44:12.380 --> 44:16.480
and maybe yeah, yeah, they also made a big stink out of making

44:16.480 --> 44:18.980
sure everybody knew that next month's going to be the state

44:18.980 --> 44:21.680
of the Union on December 11th at 11 a.m.

44:21.680 --> 44:22.280
Pacific time.

44:22.780 --> 44:26.980
They say it will be newsworthy whatever that means.

44:27.480 --> 44:28.280
I'm going to try to make it.

44:28.580 --> 44:31.280
I'll try to make it and I'll let you know there's you know,

44:31.280 --> 44:34.780
a lot they say going in to that release which seems impossible

44:34.780 --> 44:38.880
since this one had so much but I I really appreciate all of

44:38.880 --> 44:39.780
the hard work they're doing.

44:39.780 --> 44:42.780
They've also reorganized some of the entity screens and just

44:42.780 --> 44:45.380
a couple other nice little changes where if you are somebody

44:45.380 --> 44:47.980
out there that's actually using the automatically generated

44:48.580 --> 44:50.680
Home Assistant Lovelace dashboard, you're going to see some

44:50.680 --> 44:52.280
improvements there to come in your way.

44:52.680 --> 44:54.780
Yeah, those device categories are really nice.

44:54.780 --> 45:00.180
So rather than having every single parameter about a device

45:00.180 --> 45:04.180
listed under just one tab, it will separate out stuff like

45:04.180 --> 45:07.680
the battery percentage or the RSS I stuff that you really

45:07.680 --> 45:12.880
don't need to know most of the time from like the main toggle

45:12.880 --> 45:15.280
switch, for example, that would be in its own category now.

45:15.980 --> 45:18.180
Really nice small change that one.

45:19.080 --> 45:23.280
Yeah, and I actually still have just I've been pushing it

45:23.280 --> 45:24.580
as far as I can.

45:24.680 --> 45:27.480
I am still using the auto-generated Lovelace dashboard

45:27.480 --> 45:30.680
on my Home Assistant blue here in the really how many millions

45:30.680 --> 45:32.680
of little circles do you have at the top of that thing?

45:34.780 --> 45:36.180
I should look I should tell you.

45:36.180 --> 45:38.780
There is some for sure, but I've been trying to stick with

45:38.780 --> 45:41.480
it. I almost broke this last week.

45:41.480 --> 45:43.980
I really did but then they had this update and I thought well

45:43.980 --> 45:44.880
I got to see this.

45:45.380 --> 45:48.480
Oh, actually, there's no circles along the top on the now

45:48.480 --> 45:51.980
they are in fact, they've read they've this part of the update

45:52.280 --> 45:55.880
only two of them are now on the auto-generated dashboard and

45:55.880 --> 45:58.680
they're in a different spot now totally laid out a little bit

45:58.680 --> 45:58.880
different.

45:58.880 --> 46:01.980
I remember I disabled the auto-generated dashboard when I

46:01.980 --> 46:05.380
added my unify integration and it was a little bit different

46:05.380 --> 46:09.780
version and it showed me every single Wi-Fi device that had

46:09.780 --> 46:13.380
ever connected to my Wi-Fi network in that view at the top

46:13.380 --> 46:14.480
and I was like, I'll screw this.

46:14.780 --> 46:17.980
Yeah, my dashboard is currently telling me that the office

46:18.180 --> 46:22.680
HP Officejet Pro in my office has 70% ink and it's telling

46:22.680 --> 46:27.280
me that for each one of the ink cartridges and I just don't

46:27.280 --> 46:30.580
yeah, yeah, you need to know that right now, by the way,

46:30.580 --> 46:33.280
it's not currently printing just so you know, okay.

46:33.480 --> 46:33.880
All right.

46:33.880 --> 46:38.080
I was worried. Well, as always a big thanks to our site

46:38.080 --> 46:40.780

46:40.780 --> 46:41.380

We really do appreciate every single one of you and you

46:44.880 --> 46:47.580
know, the more of you there are the less ad reads that we

46:47.580 --> 46:51.380
have to do, you know, so a big thanks to all of our SREs.

46:52.180 --> 46:54.580
Yeah, and they also get an extended post show.

46:54.580 --> 46:56.780
Don't forget they get a little more show self-hosted that

46:56.780 --> 46:57.980
show slash SRE.

46:58.280 --> 47:01.680
Oh, yeah, my dad's looking at buying a new house and he's

47:01.680 --> 47:03.980
going to be buying one out in the boonies potentially.

47:04.480 --> 47:07.080
And so we're going to get your thoughts on Starlink in the

47:07.080 --> 47:08.180
