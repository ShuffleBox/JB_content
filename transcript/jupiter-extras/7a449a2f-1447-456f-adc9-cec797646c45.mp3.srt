Dell has some new Linux PCs. It's August 21st, 2019. I'm Chris and here's the news

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:10,240
update. Dell is unveiling their new consumer PC portfolio and included in

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:15,960
the announcement is the ninth generation of the XPS 13 developer edition laptop.

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,240
That's the one that comes pre-loaded with Ubuntu. Dell will be blessing us

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:26,680
with two different models of the XPS 13. The 7390 is the new one and the 9380

6
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:30,880
will remain depending on your price comfort. Now that new developer edition,

7
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:36,480
the 7390, does still feature the same chassis which means the camera is in the

8
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:43,720
more flattering location. Both the 7390 and the 9380 XPS 13s will be available

9
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:48,400
for a period of time. The initial launch will be September 5th, 2019 in both the

10
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:53,040
US and Europe. Initially they'll be shipping with the tenth generation Intel

11
00:00:53,040 --> 00:01:00,160
Core i5 processors, 6 megabytes of cache, up to 4.2 gigahertz for cores. Later on

12
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,520
though in October, both in US and in Europe, they will launch i7 base systems

13
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:09,520
that will be added to the developer lineup. These systems will feature Intel's

14
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:15,160
10th generation Core U series processor with an i7 hexa-core CPU and they will

15
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:19,520
update the Ubuntu systems at the same time that they update the Windows

16
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,920
systems. Now here's a little bit about the specs. The 7390 will be the first

17
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:30,920
Dell system to include 1804 SP1. It comes with the new killer AX1650 Wi-Fi 6

18
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:36,800
chipset like I mentioned Intel Core i5 or i7 based on your configuration and

19
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,160
the time of purchase. And I double-checked with Dell and they are

20
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:45,920
currently still not happy with the state of the fingerprint reader so that will

21
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:51,000
not be a supported configuration. But Dell really has refined this XPS 13

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,080
developer line into a really nice machine. Availability will be Australia,

23
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:59,460
Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, Spain, France, Ireland, Italy, the

24
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:06,200
Netherlands, Norway, the United Kingdom, and of course the US and Canada. If you
