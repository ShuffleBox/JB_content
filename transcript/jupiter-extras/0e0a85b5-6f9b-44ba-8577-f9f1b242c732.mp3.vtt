00:00.000 --> 00:14.600
Well, hello, everyone. This is Brunch with Brent. I'm Brent Jerva. And joining me today

00:14.600 --> 00:18.360
is Sri Ramakrishna. Sri, thanks for joining me today.

00:18.360 --> 00:19.360
Thank you.

00:19.360 --> 00:25.120
Sri, some people will know you, well, you've been around for quite some time, I would say.

00:25.120 --> 00:30.400
Some will know you for being quite involved with the Gnome community. How long has that

00:30.400 --> 00:34.480
been since you've been involved with the Gnome community? I think it's been a little while,

00:34.480 --> 00:35.480
right?

00:35.480 --> 00:42.840
I believe I started in 1998. I'm definitely what they would call the part of the old parts

00:42.840 --> 00:47.600
club. Affectionately so.

00:47.600 --> 00:53.680
How has that felt to be, well, called that, but also you, one of the things I'm excited

00:53.680 --> 00:57.800
to dive into is the perspective that you must have gained throughout that time, you know,

00:57.800 --> 01:02.880
as things kind of shift and move in both the open source community, the Linux community

01:02.880 --> 01:07.240
and everything surrounding that. So I would imagine you've seen some changes there.

01:07.240 --> 01:13.520
Oh, yeah, I've seen a lot of changes over time, especially in the Gnome project and

01:13.520 --> 01:22.920
of course, in the open source sector externally. Yeah. Plenty of things have changed.

01:22.920 --> 01:27.200
What's something that kind of sticks out for you as either maybe something positive that's

01:27.200 --> 01:28.200
kind of shifted?

01:28.200 --> 01:36.800
At least in the desktop, or I guess I'm going to relabel that as the apps community. We've

01:36.800 --> 01:46.640
gotten further refined in our engineering. And I think we have this idea that we have

01:46.640 --> 01:52.800
to work much closer with the rest of the other open source communities out there. And I know

01:52.800 --> 02:01.520
in my personal endeavors, it's about building that relationship with the rest of open source,

02:01.520 --> 02:10.400
the other desktop projects, all of that, because only as a singular community, I think, can

02:10.400 --> 02:13.520
we get where we want to go.

02:13.520 --> 02:19.520
And how would you describe then where we want to go? That's a tricky question, I would imagine.

02:19.520 --> 02:29.360
Well, every project has their own path of where they want to go. But I think we could

02:29.360 --> 02:39.000
all agree that we would like to increase our share of the market. And there's a lot of

02:39.000 --> 02:45.520
great things that comes from that. With the greater share of the market, especially in

02:45.520 --> 02:52.680
consumer space, we actually get to drive contributions in the other ecosystems, right? So if everybody's

02:52.680 --> 03:00.440
using a open source or free software desktop, that means consumer hardware is going to also

03:00.440 --> 03:06.360
be forced to support those desktops, which means that good support in drivers needs to

03:06.360 --> 03:12.440
happen in the Linux kernel. And in the past, we've always had a fairly close relationship

03:12.440 --> 03:22.200
with the kernel people, especially during the GNOME 2 days or the KDE 3 days, because

03:22.200 --> 03:28.600
that was the bulk of the engineering that was happening, right? In order to support

03:28.600 --> 03:34.400
things like hardware detection or hot, hot pluggable devices, we had to engineer them

03:34.400 --> 03:37.600
because it wasn't there previously.

03:37.600 --> 03:42.880
And those are things we just take for granted these days. That kind of stuff is essential

03:42.880 --> 03:48.800
for any of us using the software that we do now. But a lot of people put a lot of hard

03:48.800 --> 03:54.800
work into making that possible. It sounds like collaboration was key to doing that.

03:54.800 --> 04:03.400
Yes, absolutely. We were working with each other quite early in the period. And one of

04:03.400 --> 04:09.360
the changes going back to your question about what's happening in the open source field

04:09.360 --> 04:17.720
is I think a lot of companies have been building communities, initially as silos, but to go

04:17.720 --> 04:24.920
further, they need to start interacting with the rest, right? That is where you become

04:24.920 --> 04:32.400
more powerful. So if you're building a config manager system, then you want to work closely

04:32.400 --> 04:36.800
with the Kubernetes community, or you want to work with the open stack community, right?

04:36.800 --> 04:43.040
So it's not just like using config management to do bare metal. Now you want to be working

04:43.040 --> 04:50.560
with the cloud projects, right? So just as a corporate level open source example, in

04:50.560 --> 05:01.480
the same spirit, in the apps community, we want to be working together as well to build

05:01.480 --> 05:08.520
these various standards with each other so that we can present ourselves as a singular

05:08.520 --> 05:09.720
community as well.

05:09.720 --> 05:16.000
You described there some early kind of collaborations. And of course, those have been happening throughout

05:16.000 --> 05:20.680
the history of Linux. That's sort of the spirit of what's making all this possible and the

05:20.680 --> 05:25.920
reason many of us are here. But do you think it's a bit of a misunderstanding then that

05:25.920 --> 05:33.640
there are these sort of silos around certain software or communities that maybe those who

05:33.640 --> 05:38.720
are involved deeply in the software and the hardware there are actually interacting in

05:38.720 --> 05:44.900
the background, but that's not sort of seen by end users necessarily. And I'm thinking

05:44.900 --> 05:51.880
to the, you know, sort of Reddit users that we all sort of despise and things like that.

05:51.880 --> 05:55.920
So do you think there's a disconnect there between what people believe and what's actually

05:55.920 --> 05:56.920
happening?

05:56.920 --> 06:04.400
So I'll make a comment about the Reddit community, which I don't want to characterize that as

06:04.400 --> 06:12.520
being despised. But there is a high amount of tribalism that occurs in forums, right?

06:12.520 --> 06:22.380
So Reddit or Slash That or any of these others, they think these projects that they're a part

06:22.380 --> 06:30.880
of or they use are in contention with the others, right? So we're not really like that.

06:30.880 --> 06:36.960
I think for the most part, we've sort of stayed in our own kind of corners, but only in the

06:36.960 --> 06:44.800
past, I would say a year and a half or so, we've been connecting on different initiatives

06:44.800 --> 06:56.280
that I think has spurred further collaboration. So the Linux App Summit is one. We're doing

06:56.280 --> 07:02.800
some things with community metrics. Some of those things are things I could talk about,

07:02.800 --> 07:11.040
because I'm part of those projects and I'm working with the other communities for that.

07:11.040 --> 07:21.040
In the background, we're still working with each other and there's not contention.

07:21.040 --> 07:25.600
You called yourself sort of one of the old guys in the community, but it seems to me

07:25.600 --> 07:31.120
like the value of long term relationships with anyone who's working on some of these

07:31.120 --> 07:36.160
projects means that as things evolve, as the technology evolves, as the people evolve and

07:36.160 --> 07:41.160
where your interests evolve as well, means that you have all these connections everywhere

07:41.160 --> 07:47.160
that you can sort of build off of. So the tribalism that you sort of described is not

07:47.160 --> 07:53.240
really useful because you may end up in the other tribe or quote unquote tribe at any

07:53.240 --> 07:59.700
point. So it doesn't really make sense to put up some walls. And it seems to me from

07:59.700 --> 08:05.360
what I know of you that lots of your work has been focused on breaking down those walls

08:05.360 --> 08:07.520
or at least putting connections between them all.

08:07.520 --> 08:15.080
That's right. It's interesting that this is sort of what I do for a living is to build

08:15.080 --> 08:21.480
relationships with ecosystems and so forth.

08:21.480 --> 08:26.280
And so that gets me thinking about, you know, you mentioned the Linux App Summit and that

08:26.280 --> 08:31.480
was a bit of an idea of yours that has evolved and become quite an amazing thing. Can you

08:31.480 --> 08:33.280
can you run us through that a little bit?

08:33.280 --> 08:42.200
You know, I came up with the idea like five, six years ago that I saw that we've come to

08:42.200 --> 08:50.400
a point technologically because we have ubiquitous applications as a technology, right? So you

08:50.400 --> 09:01.040
have your snaps or snap craft, you have flat pack and we now have the kind of ability to

09:01.040 --> 09:08.280
change how applications are distributed, right? Based on a runtime of some sort. So we're

09:08.280 --> 09:14.560
taking all the ideas from the containers that's been that's grown so popular and applied that

09:14.560 --> 09:24.380
in the desktop. And I realized that this is something that we could take advantage of

09:24.380 --> 09:30.400
because it's sort of like using a distribution centric model, we can do a more app centric

09:30.400 --> 09:37.280
model. And the difference is that you could scale that, right? An app centric model is

09:37.280 --> 09:42.960
kind of what the Windows and the app and macOS world is. If you use packaging, you know,

09:42.960 --> 09:49.880
everything goes through this process of packaging and a distro. But the complexity involved

09:49.880 --> 09:55.480
of building an application on Linux is so much more. And a lot of times you're not even

09:55.480 --> 10:04.560
in control of your own distribution. But in a flat pack snap world or ubiquitous app world,

10:04.560 --> 10:12.760
we could build an application market. So I had presented that idea with the Gnome Foundation

10:12.760 --> 10:19.300
board and I said, this is a great idea. Let's do this. Now, I spoke from a bit of ignorance

10:19.300 --> 10:25.280
because I've never put on a conference before. Sometimes that's a good thing. I had told

10:25.280 --> 10:34.400
them, oh, yeah, it won't cost us any money. And to do this conference required me to learn

10:34.400 --> 10:41.280
a whole set of new skills. A lot of it around marketing, a lot about fundraising and be

10:41.280 --> 10:49.160
able to put something conceptual that people can digest. And the first one was quite a

10:49.160 --> 10:59.840
test of those abilities. But over time, we're getting better. And the people who came together

10:59.840 --> 11:05.640
to build that team were just simply amazing people. And it's great that I get to keep

11:05.640 --> 11:13.680
working with them every year. But yes, the first one was very exhausting because everything

11:13.680 --> 11:20.480
is done new. Your concepts are new. You have to explain to people what this concept on

11:20.480 --> 11:28.560
before it starts catching hold. And the next iteration is better. And then the third iteration,

11:28.560 --> 11:34.720
now there's more people joining. It's getting more diverse. There are more stakeholders.

11:34.720 --> 11:40.160
And so I think the best part is that we're able to keep expanding on this concept. And

11:40.160 --> 11:47.240
I think people really get it now. And now that four years have passed that apps is important.

11:47.240 --> 11:54.360
How does it feel now considering you had a vision four years ago? But does it feel like

11:54.360 --> 11:58.820
four years is a long time for people to start getting it? And obviously, there were some

11:58.820 --> 12:03.360
early adopters. But do you feel like you've reached your goal? Maybe that's another way

12:03.360 --> 12:11.920
of putting it. We haven't reached it yet. But it's getting there. I told you about solidification

12:11.920 --> 12:18.160
and everything else. But this is a great vehicle to bring us closer to the other ecosystems,

12:18.160 --> 12:28.600
to the other projects. Because apps are not just desktop apps. When we say apps, we're

12:28.600 --> 12:35.560
talking about an application that runs on the Linux platform. And that also means it

12:35.560 --> 12:40.920
could be any applications. It could be your Kubernetes application. I don't know. But

12:40.920 --> 12:50.200
we're not trying to make it very specific. So this allows us to reach out to other communities

12:50.200 --> 12:53.880
around the concept of applications.

12:53.880 --> 12:58.840
And one real success that came from the Linux App Summit, and it's changed names because

12:58.840 --> 13:05.680
of that success, is the collaborations with the KDE community. I know you've been working

13:05.680 --> 13:10.740
with Alish Paul, who I had a chat with here on brunch as well about that. And he touched

13:10.740 --> 13:15.220
on it a little bit. But it sounds like, yeah, there's some real tangible successes that

13:15.220 --> 13:18.600
are coming from bringing all of these great people together.

13:18.600 --> 13:29.520
Absolutely. The last Linux App Summit really brought in a greater closeness and collaborations.

13:29.520 --> 13:36.520
Not only do we work well together, we trust each other. And that's probably one of the

13:36.520 --> 13:43.640
biggest successes to be able to do that. I consider Alish a friend of mine. All of them.

13:43.640 --> 13:51.240
We support each other. And for me, that's a huge success because we're able to get rid

13:51.240 --> 13:57.200
of walls and move something we're all passionate about forward.

13:57.200 --> 14:00.720
You said that one of the most important things was trust. And that's not something we talk

14:00.720 --> 14:08.800
about too often. But I think you're right. That is something that's essential in working

14:08.800 --> 14:14.800
together. And I've been lucky enough to sort of virtually meet some of the people I think

14:14.800 --> 14:23.160
that you're talking about. We mentioned Alish Paul and I have also spoken with Nuritzi Sanchez.

14:23.160 --> 14:28.560
We've had a similar conversation. She's pretty amazing. Heather Ellsworth as well is really

14:28.560 --> 14:33.480
great. And all of these people come from some different backgrounds. And all of that's coming

14:33.480 --> 14:40.560
together into some, I guess, really cool community collaborations, right? And are there a few

14:40.560 --> 14:43.480
others you'd like to mention just to give a shout out?

14:43.480 --> 14:52.240
I think the people working around the Flatpack, the Flat Hub, the GNOME and KDE communities

14:52.240 --> 15:00.680
have been working together. We're building a foundational store for both GNOME and KDE

15:00.680 --> 15:11.120
apps or any other apps out there. I think that's another great place that people are

15:11.120 --> 15:16.680
working on. The Flatpack, I don't know everyone around it. I know that that's a collaboration.

15:16.680 --> 15:28.280
But there are a couple in the Chaos project that we're working on. And this is around

15:28.280 --> 15:37.840
metrics, right? And community metrics for our communities. Because working on our projects

15:37.840 --> 15:46.720
is a little different than, let's say, a corporate-sponsored project because we deal with the public. And

15:46.720 --> 15:56.760
as I was telling you before by Reddit, we have a class of problems that corporate projects

15:56.760 --> 16:04.720
don't have, right? Because we deal with tribalism in every part. I can't speak for KDE, but

16:04.720 --> 16:14.960
for GNOME, it appears in bug reports, feature requests, forums. It's omnipresent for us.

16:14.960 --> 16:20.400
It sounds like an omnipresence of some negativity, right? Is that what you're referring to?

16:20.400 --> 16:27.320
Absolutely. And also positive things too. It's just that when you're building the interface

16:27.320 --> 16:36.840
for your hardware and something changes, it's a very emotional experience for some technologists.

16:36.840 --> 16:42.360
Because they put so much into their workflow. It's the perfect workflow. And when something

16:42.360 --> 16:55.000
changes, it can create rage, right? So I understand where it comes from, but abusing the project

16:55.000 --> 17:01.120
is not a great look. Generally doesn't give the results you're looking for anyways, right?

17:01.120 --> 17:08.880
So that's not really a sound approach. Right. Exactly. But we're building another committee

17:08.880 --> 17:19.720
with Georg Link and Nuritzy as well and Neo from the KDE project and myself. So for the

17:19.720 --> 17:26.880
foundational members for that group. And this is again another way to get out of our silos

17:26.880 --> 17:33.880
and be able to show through metrics what our community is doing, how they're doing, find

17:33.880 --> 17:41.040
out the health of our community and be able to figure, find ways to improve our relationships

17:41.040 --> 17:46.400
with the community at large by a more data-driven approach.

17:46.400 --> 17:52.240
Sounds fascinating and sounds like that work is really important. The more I'm getting

17:52.240 --> 17:59.680
to have conversations with people who are all over different parts of what is our open

17:59.680 --> 18:05.120
source software and communities, the more I'm realizing that, like you're saying, community

18:05.120 --> 18:11.480
building and those non-developer skills are actually some of the more important things

18:11.480 --> 18:16.640
for the longevity of some of these projects. And I mean, it sounds in many ways like you've

18:16.640 --> 18:25.760
dedicated most of your, well, can I say most of your life at this point to making a difference

18:25.760 --> 18:30.880
here? Certainly. You know, I was never a big coder.

18:30.880 --> 18:43.880
So I naturally fit into this space that works for me. And I enjoy building relationships

18:43.880 --> 18:50.960
or connecting people or any of those things. Those are things that really drives me as

18:50.960 --> 18:52.160
a person.

18:52.160 --> 18:58.960
What was it then, you know, in the beginning that kind of attracted you to open source

18:58.960 --> 19:03.440
software in the first place and Linux and GNOME specifically? You know, what has kind

19:03.440 --> 19:05.560
of grabbed you and kept you here?

19:05.560 --> 19:18.000
So I joined GNOME because I started off just like that kind of tribalness. At the time

19:18.000 --> 19:27.800
we started, Linux was coming up. Linux was out there being installed by systems administrators

19:27.800 --> 19:37.400
in secret. It was like a little revolution that was happening. And these desktop projects

19:37.400 --> 19:45.160
started coming up because they were very aspirational. We wanted to build a desktop. And when KD

19:45.160 --> 19:53.840
came out, that was exciting. GNOME came followed after that. I, for some reason, was attracted

19:53.840 --> 19:58.720
more to the GNOME project than I was with the KDE project. And I think part of that

19:58.720 --> 20:06.640
was because I like C more than I like C++. I know it's really a technologist thing, but

20:06.640 --> 20:11.020
that was kind of one of the reasons.

20:11.020 --> 20:14.880
It's part of the preference spectrum, right? So that makes sense to me.

20:14.880 --> 20:21.600
It's sort of funny because I think our prejudice against C++ and the project is what kind of

20:21.600 --> 20:33.680
binds us together. The great thing about GNOME is it's always reinventing itself in some

20:33.680 --> 20:42.440
shape or form, right? The first version of GNOME was terrible software engineering. Maybe

20:42.440 --> 20:51.840
on a blue moon on a certain day, you can get the whole thing to compile. It was full of

20:51.840 --> 21:01.160
bugs and features. And then the next iteration was the real transformational change, right?

21:01.160 --> 21:08.520
We added accessibility. We learned a lot of things. We realized that software engineering

21:08.520 --> 21:14.240
was a really important part and put a lot of controls in, which of course made a lot

21:14.240 --> 21:24.880
of our public upset. And so this whole meme about features being removed actually came

21:24.880 --> 21:26.880
from that era.

21:26.880 --> 21:33.920
Then you get down to the third iteration, and now we've separated the user experience

21:33.920 --> 21:41.040
from the platform, and then we added designers, right? So primarily in the past, it has always

21:41.040 --> 21:48.320
been coders working on it. Now you've changed the workload to add designers. So I find all

21:48.320 --> 21:57.520
of this fascinating because how we work together and trying to build something that works is

21:57.520 --> 21:58.520
just fascinating.

21:58.520 --> 22:04.200
There are still some more challenges out there that kind of keep being there because the

22:04.200 --> 22:12.520
interesting bit now is in order to continue to grow, you actually have to build your non-technical

22:12.520 --> 22:19.960
base up, right? Because scalability is an issue. There are lots of projects that have

22:19.960 --> 22:28.200
high complexity, but they need people to deal with the bugs, triage the bugs, maintain order

22:28.200 --> 22:35.040
in the threads that are out there, and so forth.

22:35.040 --> 22:46.280
I think a lot of that non-technical contributions kind of works because we moved to a much more

22:46.280 --> 22:55.760
modern platform like GitLab, right? So I think it allows for that kind of growth of non-technical

22:55.760 --> 23:04.980
contributors. It's just a continual set of changes as we keep going.

23:04.980 --> 23:12.920
It sounds in many ways like a maturing and sort of natural, organic growth in directions

23:12.920 --> 23:19.520
that are needed, you know, not throwing away the technical, but just sort of supporting

23:19.520 --> 23:27.000
it with all of these aspects around it that sort of create the more human connection,

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
perhaps.

23:28.000 --> 23:33.280
That's right. And we want to keep evolving because there's just a lot of great stuff

23:33.280 --> 23:40.320
that we need to take advantage of. And I know as a project, I would like to see GNOME work

23:40.320 --> 23:46.800
closely with as many other projects as well, because there's a lot of things we can learn

23:46.800 --> 23:48.040
from each other.

23:48.040 --> 23:54.600
Are you seeing the same kind of energy and hope from other projects in the direction

23:54.600 --> 24:01.140
of GNOME, for instance? Like I know you're describing that sort of hope to reach out

24:01.140 --> 24:03.920
and collaborate, but are you seeing that the other way as well?

24:03.920 --> 24:13.360
I don't know, but when I am interfacing with them, they definitely feel excited about it.

24:13.360 --> 24:15.120
That's a good sign.

24:15.120 --> 24:19.000
I get around more than a lot of the other project members.

24:19.000 --> 24:25.040
And by get around, you mean sort of traveling to other conferences, many conferences and

24:25.040 --> 24:29.280
meeting people and sort of building sort of one to one relationships. Is that what you're

24:29.280 --> 24:30.280
referring to?

24:30.280 --> 24:38.800
Yes, I'm a little bit more exposed to my work, right? Or my work history. I've spent a lot

24:38.800 --> 24:46.080
of time in other ecosystems, like the Linux Foundation ecosystems, corporate open source,

24:46.080 --> 24:55.840
a lot of those things. So I have networks outside of the desktop space, meaning I get

24:55.840 --> 25:03.720
to see various perception role things by watching what other projects do. And I work with a

25:03.720 --> 25:08.720
lot of those people too, in the open source program offices, things like that.

25:08.720 --> 25:11.680
That sounds like a really well rounded perspective.

25:11.680 --> 25:23.800
Yes, I suppose so. Yeah. It's interesting how ecosystem or project works. And I learned

25:23.800 --> 25:30.760
a lot of things and how their contributions happen, how they accept contributions, how

25:30.760 --> 25:39.720
they work and their bugs, which helps me look in and see how, you know, can we adapt some

25:39.720 --> 25:46.440
of those or maybe the other way around? What can we adapt from GNOME or from KDE or from

25:46.440 --> 25:56.120
the desktop projects? So it gives me an opportunity to be an interface that's bidirectional.

25:56.120 --> 26:02.960
It feels almost like a communication of best practices in some way that might, you know,

26:02.960 --> 26:08.520
and you can pick and choose which might fit for a certain purpose, which, yeah, that sounds

26:08.520 --> 26:13.680
really useful, actually, instead of reinventing sort of the processes continuously and in

26:13.680 --> 26:16.200
these little silos, like you were referring to previously.

26:16.200 --> 26:22.760
Right, right. You know, like the Kubernetes community has some really interesting methodology

26:22.760 --> 26:30.600
to use labels for contributions that it looks very interesting to me as an example.

26:30.600 --> 26:34.360
I don't know about that. Can you walk us through that just a little bit?

26:34.360 --> 26:43.760
They have a very automated setup. You know, you put a contribution, there's a series of

26:43.760 --> 26:53.160
steps that happen that is ushered in through various labels that tells you what state the

26:53.160 --> 27:00.680
contribution is at and if you've signed a CLA and, you know, all these other things,

27:00.680 --> 27:08.320
like when a new contribution comes in. And so there's definitely a flow that is, in my

27:08.320 --> 27:18.320
mind, deterministic, right? And it's which I think we lack in Gnome.

27:18.320 --> 27:30.960
Now, again, going back, when you're contributing to Kubernetes, it is a very fixed set of problems.

27:30.960 --> 27:39.800
It's not like in a desktop space where you're essentially looking at infinite ways to do

27:39.800 --> 27:48.200
work, right? Infinite work was because, you know, people always come up with ways to use

27:48.200 --> 27:55.800
their computer as a tool. But Kubernetes has a very fixed set of things that it's used

27:55.800 --> 28:04.320
for. Whereas when you're dealing with humans on our side, it's infinite, right? It's whatever

28:04.320 --> 28:06.000
you come up with.

28:06.000 --> 28:10.440
Sounds like humans are becoming, they are the main challenge and they're always going

28:10.440 --> 28:13.480
to be challenging and there's nothing you can do about that, right?

28:13.480 --> 28:20.040
They will always be challenging. Yeah. And that's one of the most interesting problems

28:20.040 --> 28:29.960
that we have because the tribalism, you get the conspiracy theories, which, you know,

28:29.960 --> 28:34.080
Kubernetes doesn't have that, you know.

28:34.080 --> 28:40.040
That's funny. And yet it can also be beautiful work, right? Like there's lots to celebrate

28:40.040 --> 28:45.720
about the human connection to the work that we do via our computers and all of that. So

28:45.720 --> 28:48.080
I could see why that would keep you interested for sure.

28:48.080 --> 28:49.560
It's never a dull day.

28:49.560 --> 28:53.880
Can you tell me a little bit about where you're working now and what you're doing sort of

28:53.880 --> 28:56.640
on your day-to-day basis professionally?

28:56.640 --> 29:05.300
I work for a company called ITU Renew. They are in circular data centers and my specific

29:05.300 --> 29:15.020
role is a principal ecosystems engineer. And we work primarily with the open compute project.

29:15.020 --> 29:24.760
So I interface with parts of the open compute project, parts of Kubernetes, parts of open

29:24.760 --> 29:32.760
source firmware project. Because ITU Renew is a hardware company and so we use all these

29:32.760 --> 29:39.460
open tools to create an open block, right? So part of open infrastructure.

29:39.460 --> 29:43.880
It sounds like there are many connections there too. You said, you know, parts of this

29:43.880 --> 29:47.520
community, parts of that community. So it sounds like, again, you're a link between

29:47.520 --> 29:52.080
many of those to try to create some neat synergies.

29:52.080 --> 29:58.980
And a lot of times I'm not the subject matter expert. But I'm in news meetings and I surprise

29:58.980 --> 30:09.920
myself from speaking up from time to time. Even though I may not know some of those things.

30:09.920 --> 30:17.680
But you know, there's definitely contributions that I try to make when possible. But it's

30:17.680 --> 30:25.400
challenging to be able to switch from, let's say, something on networking to storage or

30:25.400 --> 30:39.320
to firmware and keep watch on what's happening and keep my company's interests in mind and

30:39.320 --> 30:40.720
my employer's interests in mind.

30:40.720 --> 30:47.120
Yeah, of course. What a balance. Shree, if you wanted to send something out to the community,

30:47.120 --> 30:52.320
a sort of an ask, maybe something you'd like them to try, something you would like us to

30:52.320 --> 30:57.960
think about or to go see, what would be something you would send out there?

30:57.960 --> 31:06.720
I would encourage others to try to build an app application and sort of analyze what is

31:06.720 --> 31:14.120
hard, what is easy, how do you distribute it, that kind of things. And maybe do a write-up

31:14.120 --> 31:20.600
because I think those are interesting things to know what the pain points are. In the aggregate,

31:20.600 --> 31:27.200
having that kind of information is good for us if we want, as a community, to evolve into

31:27.200 --> 31:34.520
something better that can compete with the other operating systems, non-Linux operating

31:34.520 --> 31:35.720
systems.

31:35.720 --> 31:41.480
That sounds like that would necessarily build some empathy as well for the work that goes

31:41.480 --> 31:46.800
on behind most of this software in our open source community and how that works. And I

31:46.800 --> 31:54.180
think maybe another interesting aspect would be to challenge ourselves to shift our thinking

31:54.180 --> 32:02.000
paradigm into the app's perspective instead of the desktop perspective. Would you agree?

32:02.000 --> 32:09.560
The desktop is sort of a... It doesn't have the power it used to have because in this

32:09.560 --> 32:17.800
day and age of web apps, it almost seems like the desktop is the proof of this. And so when

32:17.800 --> 32:26.540
people don't think the desktop is important, they don't believe that it is of interest.

32:26.540 --> 32:33.440
But if we rebrand it as apps or applications, then everybody understands that applications

32:33.440 --> 32:43.760
are important. And by separating an applications community on Linux, it's a much easier ask.

32:43.760 --> 32:51.880
The thing that people should understand is the apps community build an incredible amount

32:51.880 --> 33:00.280
of technology that people use every day. When I was at a Linux Foundation conference, I

33:00.280 --> 33:10.320
would take the time to go through the various booths and I would ask, oh, have you heard

33:10.320 --> 33:17.820
of Gnome or any of these others? And they said no. And so I would bring up Geno with

33:17.820 --> 33:25.520
D-Bus. And they would say yes. They said, well, the apps community came up with D-Bus.

33:25.520 --> 33:32.880
The members of their community was the one who built system D. The very technology that

33:32.880 --> 33:43.520
we build came because we had to find ways to propagate hardware events to the user in

33:43.520 --> 33:56.840
some fashion. And so these are all foundations for all the other technologies that people

33:56.840 --> 33:58.560
are using elsewhere.

33:58.560 --> 34:03.560
That's fascinating. I'm sure you thank you for joining me. If people wanted to get in

34:03.560 --> 34:09.480
contact with you to say hi or to sort of share some thoughts with you, where would they best

34:09.480 --> 34:11.040
contact you?

34:11.040 --> 34:18.000
You can hit me on Twitter. It's S. Ramakrishna. Or you can email me at Sri at Gnome.org.

34:18.000 --> 34:22.840
That sounds great. Sri, thank you so much for your time and really appreciate our chat.

34:22.840 --> 34:41.840
It's been great.
