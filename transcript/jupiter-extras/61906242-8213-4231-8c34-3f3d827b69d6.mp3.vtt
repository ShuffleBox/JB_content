WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:16.860
Well, hi, Jackie, hi, Brent. How are you doing? I'm good. How about you? I'm doing great.

00:16.860 --> 00:22.580
So to give a little bit of context, I'm here with Jackie DeVore. She is a whole bunch of

00:22.580 --> 00:27.360
really great stuff, but I'll give you a little bit of context about where we are physically.

00:27.360 --> 00:35.080
So I've been doing a little bit of a East Coast US trip, which has been really fun.

00:35.080 --> 00:40.880
So I've been staying with Alex from Self Hosted for a little bit. And now I've come and seen

00:40.880 --> 00:45.080
you guys as well because you're not too far, which has been a real treat. So you've taken

00:45.080 --> 00:46.080
me into your home.

00:46.080 --> 00:49.200
Yes. And it's been an absolute delight for us.

00:49.200 --> 00:55.560
Right. So you and Drew have taken me into your home. Drew does most of the editing for

00:55.560 --> 01:00.920
the brunches. And many of you have gotten to know him through the brunch that we did

01:00.920 --> 01:05.040
together, one of the early ones. So we will link to that for sure. But Jackie, it's such

01:05.040 --> 01:08.080
a treat to get to chat with you in person.

01:08.080 --> 01:09.080
Yeah.

01:09.080 --> 01:14.360
So joining us as well is some of your rabbits that you have in your home.

01:14.360 --> 01:20.380
We have a lot of rabbits. Yeah, and there's one. She was laying on me when we were setting

01:20.380 --> 01:27.420
up here, but now she's coming in from the side. This is Min, a very, very fluffy bunny.

01:27.420 --> 01:31.760
She's going for my juice. She has a drinking problem.

01:31.760 --> 01:35.840
But totally welcoming. And you guys have taken me in and I really appreciate that. So it's

01:35.840 --> 01:41.020
been so fun to spend the last few days with you and checking out Savannah here together.

01:41.020 --> 01:45.600
We have absolutely loved having you here. It's been a few days full of food and music

01:45.600 --> 01:50.360
and great conversation. So yeah, well, it just continues here, doesn't it?

01:50.360 --> 01:54.480
Can you give us a little bit of an intro on what you do?

01:54.480 --> 02:05.520
Well, I'm an artist, so I make a lot of different kinds of art. And I'm a podcaster. I'm one

02:05.520 --> 02:07.680
of those people that never really has a title.

02:07.680 --> 02:08.680
Which is a good thing, I think.

02:08.680 --> 02:09.680
Yeah, I guess.

02:09.680 --> 02:12.600
Tell me a little bit about the podcast that you're doing.

02:12.600 --> 02:18.440
Okay. So my main podcast is Sirens of Scream. And we've been doing this for four years.

02:18.440 --> 02:26.720
It's an all women-led horror podcast. And we talk about absolutely anything horror. People,

02:26.720 --> 02:31.920
when they think about horror, they think about just movies or shows. We talk about comics.

02:31.920 --> 02:40.240
We talk about art. We've even talked about hairstylists that do horror-themed hair. And

02:40.240 --> 02:48.520
it's, honestly, it's wild. We've had some absolutely incredible guests on the show.

02:48.520 --> 02:55.560
We were actually talking the other day about, we were talking about music, and that led

02:55.560 --> 02:59.480
to our shared love of Nine Inch Nails.

02:59.480 --> 03:03.080
Yeah, I'm a huge Nine Inch Nails fan, for sure.

03:03.080 --> 03:08.560
And coincidentally, we had the art director for Nine Inch Nails who also writes a comic

03:08.560 --> 03:14.120
called High Level, Rob Sheridan, on the show a few months ago. And he was a phenomenal

03:14.120 --> 03:23.240
guest to have on. He and his wife do these insane Halloween haunts at their house that

03:23.240 --> 03:29.940
they post about every year. And he does this absolutely incredible glitch art. And these

03:29.940 --> 03:34.960
people that we have on the show, typically, they don't just do one project. They will

03:34.960 --> 03:40.960
do, like horror will really encompass a lot of different areas of their life. So it's

03:40.960 --> 03:44.820
really interesting to have them on to talk about the project or talk about something

03:44.820 --> 03:50.200
that they're interested in horror, and then really get to know them as people and what

03:50.200 --> 03:56.440
got them into horror, what happened in your past to make you really want to look at this

03:56.440 --> 03:57.980
traumatic stuff.

03:57.980 --> 04:02.360
But what I've learned, because I have mentioned to you in the last few days that I have a

04:02.360 --> 04:07.920
really good friend, her name is Miranda, and she is totally, like, I would say her entire

04:07.920 --> 04:12.800
lifestyle is splashed with horror in the best kind of way, right? She brings it to her decor

04:12.800 --> 04:18.200
in which you guys have around here. You've got a few sort of horror themed decorations

04:18.200 --> 04:23.840
around your home. It's pretty much always a horror theme around here, which is super

04:23.840 --> 04:30.520
fun. And I love how you can take something that some people feel is really uncomfortable

04:30.520 --> 04:34.440
and take it to a place that brings a lot of joy to people. And that's what I've noticed

04:34.440 --> 04:41.360
of people like you and my friend Miranda and Nine Inch Nails, how it just, like, surrounds

04:41.360 --> 04:45.920
your entire life and all your different projects. But you as an artist, I would imagine that

04:45.920 --> 04:47.960
splashes into everything that you do.

04:47.960 --> 04:56.000
Oh, absolutely. Horror definitely comes into a lot of my art. But at the same time, I also

04:56.000 --> 05:02.840
pull a lot of color and, like, a lot of bright color, a lot of weird, happy themes into art

05:02.840 --> 05:10.680
too. And I like to combine the two in a sort of surreal sort of way, which I think is strange

05:10.680 --> 05:11.680
for some people.

05:11.680 --> 05:17.200
It sounds like it pushes the envelope of what's generally accepted as horror or not.

05:17.200 --> 05:24.240
Yeah, yeah. That I do like to question a lot. Like, I was showing you the other day, I have

05:24.240 --> 05:31.680
a series of animal head girls that I do in watercolor and my favorite is one that I call

05:31.680 --> 05:36.800
Goldie and it's a chicken headed girl and she has an arm missing with her bone sticking

05:36.800 --> 05:43.440
out of it. But she's, you know, the background is a bright neon pink and she's got a, you

05:43.440 --> 05:49.920
know, a neon blue for her body and everything and like gold gilded throughout the piece.

05:49.920 --> 05:55.520
So the colors are bright and happy and they bring you in. But, you know, she's got these

05:55.520 --> 06:02.000
elements of these big glowing dark eyes and, you know, I like to make things uncomfortable

06:02.000 --> 06:06.040
while also making them kind of fun.

06:06.040 --> 06:11.040
Well, the neat thing that I've picked up on is like horror doesn't need to be said. You

06:11.040 --> 06:15.560
can have, it may sound weird to say, but you can have horror that makes you happy.

06:15.560 --> 06:25.200
Absolutely. Yeah. And there's an entire sub-genre of horror comedy even. So yeah. Like one particular

06:25.200 --> 06:31.960
movie that comes to mind is Warm Bodies or even one that's exceptionally popular, Shawna

06:31.960 --> 06:32.960
the Dead.

06:32.960 --> 06:35.320
Fair enough. Yeah. Okay.

06:35.320 --> 06:39.360
But I mean, or Tucker and Dale versus Evil is another great one. If you haven't seen

06:39.360 --> 06:40.360
that, that's fantastic.

06:40.360 --> 06:41.360
I haven't. You'll have to show me that.

06:41.360 --> 06:43.320
I think that might even be Canadian.

06:43.320 --> 06:47.440
Oh, well, apparently I'm learning that a lot of that kind of stuff is Canadian.

06:47.440 --> 06:54.360
Yeah. Canada has the best comedy these days. Hands down. There is no doubt about it. Canada

06:54.360 --> 06:55.840
definitely has the best comedy these days.

06:55.840 --> 06:58.080
Oh, nice. So at least we're known for something.

06:58.080 --> 06:59.080
Yeah.

06:59.080 --> 07:00.080
That's great.

07:00.080 --> 07:01.840
Best comedy and best maple syrup.

07:01.840 --> 07:11.920
Well, you know, sorry Maine. We were chatting earlier as well about how on your podcast

07:11.920 --> 07:18.240
you end up bringing a whole bunch of personalities that are really excited to hear about from

07:18.240 --> 07:22.800
you guys, like Nine Shnails you were mentioning, but you have had some other special guests

07:22.800 --> 07:23.800
as well, right?

07:23.800 --> 07:30.240
Yeah. We had the Soska sisters on and recently-

07:30.240 --> 07:31.240
Who are Canadian.

07:31.240 --> 07:40.360
Yeah, they are Canadian as well. And they're pretty big in the horror industry. And we've

07:40.360 --> 07:49.400
had other horror celebrity types on like Colin Bunn was on and we had Andre Gower and Ryan

07:49.400 --> 07:57.400
Lambert who are movie stars on. And people ask us sometimes, you know, do you just harass

07:57.400 --> 08:06.320
the hell out of these artists and these stars to get them on your show? And no, we just

08:06.320 --> 08:11.320
simply ask them, Hey, do you want to come and talk about your really cool project with

08:11.320 --> 08:12.320
us? And-

08:12.320 --> 08:15.880
I would imagine most people are honored to talk about the stuff they're doing right now.

08:15.880 --> 08:20.120
Nine times out of 10, they'll be like, yes, absolutely. I would love to talk about my

08:20.120 --> 08:23.000
cool stuff with you.

08:23.000 --> 08:28.600
And maybe it's a fallacy to think like that, oh, they'll never reply to me. I'm just a

08:28.600 --> 08:35.600
podcaster or whatever, right? But I feel like there aren't really any rules around this

08:35.600 --> 08:40.360
stuff. So if you have a means of contacting someone, you should just go out there and

08:40.360 --> 08:44.560
try it, right? And that applies to anything. You don't have to be a podcaster. Like if

08:44.560 --> 08:50.400
you want to get a question answered from one of your mentors or your heroes or something

08:50.400 --> 08:53.800
like that, just just kind of reach out and you never know what will happen.

08:53.800 --> 08:59.480
Yeah, exactly. And I mean, like Wayne Gretzky and Michael Scott said, you always regret

08:59.480 --> 09:06.560
100% of the shots you don't take. That's great. Yeah, just try. The worst case is you're right

09:06.560 --> 09:10.200
back where you are. Yeah, they either don't respond or say no, and then you can move on

09:10.200 --> 09:14.460
with your life. Right. Do you have a wish list of people that you're chasing or hoping

09:14.460 --> 09:16.720
to get on at some point?

09:16.720 --> 09:21.760
Absolutely. Right now, we would really love to get the Dupless Brothers on. Do you know

09:21.760 --> 09:22.760
the Dupless Brothers?

09:22.760 --> 09:25.360
I don't because I'm new to this genre.

09:25.360 --> 09:31.040
Oh, my God. They're wonderful. They're both actors and they're both writers and producers.

09:31.040 --> 09:38.840
And they were all actually both on the Mindy project back when that was a thing. But Mark

09:38.840 --> 09:45.640
Dupless specifically wrote and starred in Safety Not Guaranteed. And right now they

09:45.640 --> 09:50.680
both write and direct and produce Room 104.

09:50.680 --> 09:51.680
I don't know it.

09:51.680 --> 09:58.880
Oh, it's great. It's a show that is basically, it focuses on one room in a motel and all

09:58.880 --> 10:00.680
the weird stuff that goes on.

10:00.680 --> 10:09.000
Oh, it reminds me of, is it Five Rooms? This is a Quentin Tarantino. Well, it was a whole

10:09.000 --> 10:13.480
bunch of directors. I'm taking you on our side now. But it was a whole bunch of directors

10:13.480 --> 10:18.840
that focused on five hotel rooms. It's totally worth checking out. There's like Antonio

10:18.840 --> 10:23.040
Banderas saying, oh, here I'm showing you something. There's some really cool, wacky

10:23.040 --> 10:28.040
stuff that happens in there. So it's a recommendation. But continue with what you were mentioning

10:28.040 --> 10:29.520
as one hotel room.

10:29.520 --> 10:36.120
Yeah. And it's basically like a guideline to how to never get your deposit back in a

10:36.120 --> 10:44.440
hotel room. It kind of like tows that line of what's horror. It's one of those kinds

10:44.440 --> 10:54.280
of shows that it will really vary from episode to episode between horror and comedy and just

10:54.280 --> 11:00.600
straight up tragedy. And it's really fantastic. It's very out there. I think it's on HBO right

11:00.600 --> 11:07.320
now in its fourth season currently. But it's fantastic. There's a lot of great writing

11:07.320 --> 11:08.320
going on there.

11:08.320 --> 11:09.320
Nice.

11:09.320 --> 11:16.600
The Uplus brothers, they're very eccentric. And they choose very interesting projects

11:16.600 --> 11:21.240
to work on. So I'd really love to talk to them. They seem like they would be very interesting

11:21.240 --> 11:22.520
to sit down and talk to.

11:22.520 --> 11:25.000
Great. So if anybody has a connection to them, feel free to reach out.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
Oh, I sent them an email already.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
Good, good. Of course you did.

11:27.000 --> 11:32.000
It was actually like just a week ago. So we'll see if they reply.

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
Yeah, that would be so amazing.

11:35.000 --> 11:40.800
And so tell me a little bit more about the podcast or some hosts that join you as well.

11:40.800 --> 11:47.280
My co-hosts are Sierra Halk and Melissa Meagan. And Melissa is the one that actually came

11:47.280 --> 11:53.040
up with this idea for The Sirens. And how this actually started was quite a while ago,

11:53.040 --> 12:01.760
I actually helped Chris Hardwick with a social media site called The Node. This was like

12:01.760 --> 12:07.240
a side project of Nerdist. And it was an invite-only social media site.

12:07.240 --> 12:08.240
Oh, fascinating.

12:08.240 --> 12:18.000
Yeah. And I helped him run it. And on that site, it was just like a couple thousand members.

12:18.000 --> 12:25.920
And I happened to meet Melissa and Sierra there. Another girl and I, Steph, had a blog

12:25.920 --> 12:32.160
site called Nerds in Babeland. And we just wrote geeky articles on there.

12:32.160 --> 12:33.800
Did you say Nerds in Babeland?

12:33.800 --> 12:34.800
Yes.

12:34.800 --> 12:35.800
That's such a great name.

12:35.800 --> 12:36.800
I know, right?

12:36.800 --> 12:37.800
Lovely.

12:37.800 --> 12:44.720
And that actually went on for a while. It was just a blog site where we posted stuff

12:44.720 --> 12:54.480
about comics, just various nerdy things, really. I actually got invited to attend a NASA launch

12:54.480 --> 12:56.280
because of that.

12:56.280 --> 12:57.280
Really?

12:57.280 --> 12:58.280
Yeah.

12:58.280 --> 12:59.280
Oh, my goodness.

12:59.280 --> 13:04.880
I'm actually a social media liaison for NASA because of that site.

13:04.880 --> 13:06.880
That's so cool.

13:06.880 --> 13:15.320
I know, right? So, Melissa was a regular writer on Nerds in Babeland. And Sierra helped out

13:15.320 --> 13:19.560
every now and then, too. And Melissa approached me out of blue. She's like, I really love

13:19.560 --> 13:25.420
horror and I really want to start a podcast about horror. And I want to do it with three

13:25.420 --> 13:28.400
ladies on the show. And you're the first person that came to mind.

13:28.400 --> 13:29.400
Cool.

13:29.400 --> 13:35.980
Melissa had always been on Talking Comics before that, which is a really popular podcast

13:35.980 --> 13:42.520
about comics, obviously. And she asked me, do you have anybody else in mind that might

13:42.520 --> 13:44.560
work for this? And I said, Sierra.

13:44.560 --> 13:45.560
Nice.

13:45.560 --> 13:47.720
Our personalities really work well together.

13:47.720 --> 13:48.720
I agree completely.

13:48.720 --> 13:49.720
Yeah, for sure.

13:49.720 --> 14:00.440
We're very different in a lot of ways. Our interests in horror really intersect. Melissa

14:00.440 --> 14:05.880
is very family-oriented. She has a young son, so she really looks for horror that kids can

14:05.880 --> 14:09.240
get into, which is really important.

14:09.240 --> 14:16.520
There's some amazing books out there that are sketched in a way that is horror-themed,

14:16.520 --> 14:18.880
that is written in a way that's kid-friendly.

14:18.880 --> 14:20.880
Yeah, like Edward Gorey.

14:20.880 --> 14:26.480
Yeah. I guess some popular films have been like that, some animated films as well. But

14:26.480 --> 14:32.760
I have often thought that those two worlds can't really coexist, but I'm learning that

14:32.760 --> 14:33.760
they certainly can.

14:33.760 --> 14:36.760
Yeah. And I'll circle back to that in a moment.

14:36.760 --> 14:37.760
Okay, great.

14:37.760 --> 14:38.760
Great.

14:38.760 --> 14:45.160
And she also really loves comics, so she kind of handles that side of things for us. And

14:45.160 --> 14:53.160
Sierra is a very, very ferocious reader, and she really loves board games, so she really

14:53.160 --> 15:02.160
covers that side. And I hate silence, so I always have something playing in the background.

15:02.160 --> 15:10.200
And I also am an avid video gamer, so I cover that side. And we all really love art. We

15:10.200 --> 15:18.040
all love music, so we all come together with our various likes and dislikes. And Melissa

15:18.040 --> 15:23.760
likes slashers, Sierra likes found footage, I like ghosts, and it's-

15:23.760 --> 15:25.760
So you sound pretty well-rounded then.

15:25.760 --> 15:26.760
Yeah.

15:26.760 --> 15:27.760
That's awesome.

15:27.760 --> 15:33.680
So it's nice to have three of us that really cover this huge genre, and it works very well

15:33.680 --> 15:34.680
for us, I think.

15:34.680 --> 15:37.200
And have you had the opportunity to meet them in person?

15:37.200 --> 15:38.200
No.

15:38.200 --> 15:39.200
Really?

15:39.200 --> 15:40.200
Oh my goodness.

15:40.200 --> 15:46.480
For four years, and we've never met in person. What's weird is Sierra used to come down to

15:46.480 --> 15:50.560
a town just outside of Savannah every year for Thanksgiving, and we could never make

15:50.560 --> 15:51.560
it.

15:51.560 --> 15:53.560
Oh no. That seems like a shame.

15:53.560 --> 15:57.080
And then I was supposed to go out to Seattle just a few months ago, and then that-

15:57.080 --> 15:58.080
Of course.

15:58.080 --> 15:59.080
Didn't work. Last minute.

15:59.080 --> 16:00.080
Of course.

16:00.080 --> 16:03.200
Yeah. So it's like the starts would never align for us meeting.

16:03.200 --> 16:04.200
It'll happen. It'll happen.

16:04.200 --> 16:05.200
It's so weird.

16:05.200 --> 16:10.840
Yeah, there's something about being there in person, as you and I are doing right now,

16:10.840 --> 16:15.420
that is such a treat. And I've talked about that before, that you can build this really

16:15.420 --> 16:23.140
amazing relationship with people at a distance online, which could never really happen before.

16:23.140 --> 16:24.880
It's almost like a pen pal, right?

16:24.880 --> 16:25.880
Yeah.

16:25.880 --> 16:29.040
But there's these amazing connections that can happen that way. But when you sort of

16:29.040 --> 16:34.120
reinforce those with an in-person meeting, it's such a treat. So I'm looking forward

16:34.120 --> 16:37.880
to hearing when you all get together. That's going to be great.

16:37.880 --> 16:45.680
But the kids and horror, let me circle back to that. As I mentioned on another JP episode

16:45.680 --> 16:50.280
recently, I think it was an extras episode that Drew and I did for Halloween.

16:50.280 --> 16:52.560
Yeah, that was a great episode. I loved it.

16:52.560 --> 16:58.840
He and I met while we were planning a zombie walk. And one thing that we really learned

16:58.840 --> 17:01.880
with the zombie walk is that kids love horror.

17:01.880 --> 17:02.880
Really?

17:02.880 --> 17:08.080
Kids would get into those zombie walks so much. You would see these four and five-year-old

17:08.080 --> 17:13.360
zombies running around like, rawr, trying to scare their buddy. And they would get so

17:13.360 --> 17:14.360
into it.

17:14.360 --> 17:17.680
And do you think it's linked to an open imagination at that age?

17:17.680 --> 17:26.760
Oh, absolutely. Kids, they don't really get scared the way people expect them to. I went

17:26.760 --> 17:33.300
to a show where Neil Gaiman was talking. And it happened to be at a theater where Drew

17:33.300 --> 17:41.080
used to work. So we got to hang out backstage and talk to him afterwards. And I talked to

17:41.080 --> 17:47.240
him a little bit about kids and horror. And he has a lot to say about kids and horror.

17:47.240 --> 17:53.040
And he writes a lot of kids and horror, like Coraline. And he has a really great take on

17:53.040 --> 18:01.120
it. Kids are just, they will accept things in a world much more openly than adults will.

18:01.120 --> 18:06.280
Adults will apply these rules that they're used to every day to these imaginary worlds

18:06.280 --> 18:13.400
that are presented to them, where kids will see an imaginary world and dive into it and

18:13.400 --> 18:19.920
be much more open to what's happening in that world rather than apply these rigid expectations

18:19.920 --> 18:21.080
that adults have.

18:21.080 --> 18:25.720
That's so interesting, right? When we were kids, our imagination was one of the places

18:25.720 --> 18:31.680
that we played very often. And as adults, that almost atrophies a little bit, I would

18:31.680 --> 18:37.760
imagine for artists that might not be as true. But it seems to me like what you're saying

18:37.760 --> 18:42.240
is it's important to not cling on to those rules too much when you're approaching something

18:42.240 --> 18:47.520
like horror genres or stories that really push your imagination.

18:47.520 --> 18:55.160
Yeah, it's important to step outside of that rigid comfort zone. Be open.

18:55.160 --> 19:01.320
Yeah, of course. And so I was just about to say, do you know of any kids who listen to

19:01.320 --> 19:06.800
the podcast? But you may be a little explicit on the podcast sometimes, right?

19:06.800 --> 19:10.680
We're a little bit too foul-mouthed for that.

19:10.680 --> 19:13.640
That's all right. That's all right.

19:13.640 --> 19:20.120
So like pretty much the first 15 minutes we started talking when you got here, I warned

19:20.120 --> 19:25.360
you straight up, I talk like a sailor. And it's true. I've been bringing it in a little

19:25.360 --> 19:34.160
bit here. Actually, I haven't been censoring myself at all. It's just coincidence. But

19:34.160 --> 19:37.200
I do, I curse like a sailor.

19:37.200 --> 19:41.200
But what I like about the podcast and the use of it there is that you use it pretty

19:41.200 --> 19:47.040
tastefully. Like it's in the places where it really enforces a point.

19:47.040 --> 19:48.040
I appreciate that.

19:48.040 --> 19:53.780
Yeah. No, I think it has its place, you know, it's nice to hear. If you've listened to,

19:53.780 --> 19:59.760
for instance, like user error, I feel like it has a similar feel in that it has splashes

19:59.760 --> 20:04.820
here and there. But it's only to highlight the things that really matter, right? Sometimes

20:04.820 --> 20:11.960
its uses is exactly perfect. And okay, with kids, maybe that's not so appropriate. But

20:11.960 --> 20:13.400
I say don't change a thing.

20:13.400 --> 20:14.400
Yeah, thank you.

20:14.400 --> 20:15.400
Yeah, absolutely.

20:15.400 --> 20:22.800
Well, coincidentally, my best friend Blue, she's this incredible, incredible woman. She's

20:22.800 --> 20:31.440
an ironworker. And she does a lot for women in her field. And she's a huge advocate for

20:31.440 --> 20:34.440
badass women doing awesome things.

20:34.440 --> 20:41.800
And she was actually listening to one of the Sirens episodes. And she mentioned to me that

20:41.800 --> 20:44.280
she likes how much I cuss on the show.

20:44.280 --> 20:45.280
Really?

20:45.280 --> 20:52.120
Yeah. And it inspired her to start a podcast of her own that she's going to call Women

20:52.120 --> 20:55.160
Who Cuss. I kid you not.

20:55.160 --> 20:56.160
That's awesome.

20:56.160 --> 21:03.000
And her show is actually going to be kind of centered around women who do really interesting,

21:03.000 --> 21:09.680
big badass projects. And she wants to bring them on and talk to them about these projects

21:09.680 --> 21:15.480
and then talk to them about them as a person to really give a well rounded, you know, three

21:15.480 --> 21:22.640
dimensional view of these, these women and what they're doing. She and I are also launching

21:22.640 --> 21:24.840
a project later today.

21:24.840 --> 21:26.240
Oh, cool.

21:26.240 --> 21:39.240
It's called HBIC or Hell Bunny's Independence Club. And we, the shortened version, the HBIC

21:39.240 --> 21:48.760
and the relation to the other meaning of it, head bitch in charge, is absolutely intentional.

21:48.760 --> 21:55.680
The purpose of this club will be to bring boss ass women together in a very supportive

21:55.680 --> 22:03.240
and inclusive kind of environment. So where we can support each other, lift each other

22:03.240 --> 22:13.160
up, a place where women can vent safely, where we can network, basically just a common ground,

22:13.160 --> 22:21.200
like a meeting place where we can come together and have a place to be safe and talk and do

22:21.200 --> 22:24.000
great things and anything we want.

22:24.000 --> 22:29.160
Wow. And it sounds like that spans different professions and different occupations and

22:29.160 --> 22:34.760
everything is like not really too many limits on it, right?

22:34.760 --> 22:39.640
Right. What we're starting with is actually going to be a, um, a discord channel.

22:39.640 --> 22:41.600
Okay. Oh, that's a nice way to do it.

22:41.600 --> 22:46.960
Yeah. We were talking about creating a forum space on a website and that gets complicated

22:46.960 --> 22:52.320
so fast. And we were trying to figure out the details of that and how to, how to work

22:52.320 --> 23:00.240
that out. And oddly enough, Blue and I met on forums on, uh, Rooster Teeth long, long

23:00.240 --> 23:07.080
ago. I've been an admin on Rooster Teeth for over a decade, but that's, that's a whole

23:07.080 --> 23:15.320
other story. So we, naturally our minds go straight to like an old school BBC forum kind

23:15.320 --> 23:21.120
of thing, you know? But as we're sitting here and making it overly complicated for ourselves,

23:21.120 --> 23:26.560
suddenly I look to my, one of my screens to my right and I'm like, oh, I keep discord

23:26.560 --> 23:33.480
up all of the time. Why don't we just open up a discord server here? And I just sat there

23:33.480 --> 23:41.520
and made a really intricate, intricately detailed server for us there. Um, and we're, we're

23:41.520 --> 23:47.480
finally launching it later today. We actually, uh, sought legal advice on it and everything.

23:47.480 --> 23:55.320
It's, it's going to be quite a detailed thing and, um, we are not limiting it, um, strictly

23:55.320 --> 24:01.440
by gender. Uh, we don't want to be that exclusionary cause of course we're not, we're not TERFs

24:01.440 --> 24:07.760
over here. We do want to welcome allies. We, we, we don't want to, you know, say no trans

24:07.760 --> 24:13.880
here. We are not, we don't want to be that kind of people.

24:13.880 --> 24:17.680
That can be, I imagine a little bit tricky too. Cause how do you keep it safe at the

24:17.680 --> 24:18.800
same time? Right?

24:18.800 --> 24:27.080
We do have a, um, uh, system in mind for, uh, bringing in, uh, allies and public support

24:27.080 --> 24:33.720
and, uh, upgrading people to what we want to call members as we vet people basically.

24:33.720 --> 24:34.720
That sounds really wise.

24:34.720 --> 24:41.440
Yeah. So keeping people at like a very basic level and not allowing them to interact fully

24:41.440 --> 24:47.200
at first before we completely vet them and then moving them up to members as, as we vet

24:47.200 --> 24:52.000
people. So we want to, we want to be able to keep it a safe space and we want to be

24:52.000 --> 24:59.220
able to keep it a place where, uh, women and allies can speak freely and, uh, free of consequence

24:59.220 --> 25:07.320
and, um, be able to support each other without worrying about who else is there. This is

25:07.320 --> 25:12.960
something that we've actually been talking about for literally years. Uh, we want to

25:12.960 --> 25:19.200
do a lot more with this project. This is really the very, very basic first step.

25:19.200 --> 25:20.200
Yeah.

25:20.200 --> 25:24.660
Uh, this is something that we want to create, um, speaking events with. This is something

25:24.660 --> 25:31.300
we want to do a charity with. This is an entire massive project that we have been talking

25:31.300 --> 25:35.960
about for so long. And I'm so glad that we're taking this first step. It's very exciting

25:35.960 --> 25:42.860
and kind of frightening, but most important things are right. So we're going to put it

25:42.860 --> 25:45.320
out into the world today and see how that goes.

25:45.320 --> 25:51.640
Great. Well, I, you know, it feels like this topic has come up in a few of my conversations

25:51.640 --> 25:57.880
before. I know Elle talked about it a little bit and Emma did as well and Jill too. And

25:57.880 --> 26:00.960
those are all really great conversations, but it's this theme that keeps coming up,

26:00.960 --> 26:04.400
right? It's like, how do we include everyone? How do we include everyone? This is such an

26:04.400 --> 26:09.620
important thing. Uh, and I totally support that approach and I hope that it, it gains

26:09.620 --> 26:15.120
some pretty long legs and, and really gets going. It sounds like a gift actually. So

26:15.120 --> 26:16.360
thank you for that.

26:16.360 --> 26:21.160
And it was very coincidental that I, uh, specifically brought it up to you. I think yesterday I

26:21.160 --> 26:27.080
said, who was that woman that was on your, on your show? Just that, that last episode,

26:27.080 --> 26:30.800
I loved her. I want to reach out to these strong women that you're having on your show.

26:30.800 --> 26:35.560
These are great people here. So I'm learning so much in these conversations. Like that's

26:35.560 --> 26:44.820
a topic that I didn't necessarily think was, uh, so deeply at the forefront of someone

26:44.820 --> 26:49.360
like Emma, who you're mentioning. Uh, but she feels at least as far as I understood

26:49.360 --> 26:53.880
that this is one of our main missions, right? It's like include everybody, especially in

26:53.880 --> 27:01.480
tech or, or you were mentioning horror as well is often sort of seen incorrectly as

27:01.480 --> 27:08.160
male specific or male only, which is totally wrong, isn't it?

27:08.160 --> 27:15.080
Right. And, um, one thing that I don't think people realize is that women don't really

27:15.080 --> 27:22.960
have a lot of spaces where they can speak freely without backlash. You can't really

27:22.960 --> 27:29.080
say to your male coworker, Hey, you're making me uncomfortable or, Hey, you're not including

27:29.080 --> 27:35.520
me. Why can't you say that? Um, a lot of times women will get flack for that. They'll get

27:35.520 --> 27:42.020
punished for that. That's awful. Yeah. Women will be overlooked as being, um, dramatic

27:42.020 --> 27:49.040
or causing problems, uh, just because they spoke up for themselves. Uh, they'll be seen

27:49.040 --> 27:55.960
as that, that person that just has a problem with everyone just because she spoke up about

27:55.960 --> 28:03.020
sexual harassment. And it's, it's insane that we're still dealing with this in 2019 completely.

28:03.020 --> 28:09.680
And it's also very upsetting how much more prominent it's actually become in the past

28:09.680 --> 28:14.640
couple of years. Oh, you sense a change. Yeah. There are certain factions of people that

28:14.640 --> 28:23.800
have been a little more outspoken with their misogyny and it's a bizarre and terrifying

28:23.800 --> 28:29.400
trend. Terrifying is accurate. Yeah. Um, being a woman that has been in tech specifically

28:29.400 --> 28:33.280
that has been in the art world, that has been in the horror world, the gaming world, right?

28:33.280 --> 28:38.920
Yeah. Gaming world, especially. Oh my God. That's something that I, I know is it's a

28:38.920 --> 28:44.000
needed space. It's something that we absolutely need. You know how, when you hear, when you

28:44.000 --> 28:49.800
learn a word for the first time, you suddenly hear it everywhere. It's true. Yeah. As we're

28:49.800 --> 28:55.200
getting closer to launching this project, I'm suddenly seeing everywhere just how needed

28:55.200 --> 28:59.880
it is. I've known in the back of my mind that it's a very needed thing, but just in the

28:59.880 --> 29:06.800
past couple of weeks, I've been really seeing women itching for this exact type of project.

29:06.800 --> 29:12.840
So it's, I'm very excited for it. I'm very excited to see how it blossoms and I really

29:12.840 --> 29:17.520
hope it grows in a positive way. Yeah. I'm sure it'll evolve in all sorts of directions

29:17.520 --> 29:22.360
you can't predict right now, but that will be necessary in many ways. Right? Yeah. Um,

29:22.360 --> 29:29.600
how do you see the discord server being approachable by some people who may not, um, know what

29:29.600 --> 29:35.120
discord is or, or have experience with it at this point? Discord is, uh, fortunately

29:35.120 --> 29:42.000
pretty user-friendly. Okay. Um, so we're writing up a little guide, uh, for people to just

29:42.000 --> 29:46.960
be able to read through and they'll be able to chat there. But it's, it, I mean, it'll

29:46.960 --> 29:53.040
be a very easy to use, just chat form sort of thing. So it'll be basically be like the

29:53.040 --> 29:57.200
old school chat rooms of the nineties for those types of people that don't, don't really

29:57.200 --> 30:00.720
get into the internet that well. Yeah. Reducing those barriers is such an important thing

30:00.720 --> 30:04.760
for something like this, right? It's like, how do we make it accessible to everybody?

30:04.760 --> 30:10.080
Absolutely. Yeah. That's awesome. Very important thing. And so where can we learn more about

30:10.080 --> 30:15.520
this? We are setting up a website right now that will be hellbunnyindependence.club. Nice.

30:15.520 --> 30:20.320
Okay, great. And we'll definitely link to that for sure. And literally right before

30:20.320 --> 30:24.480
I got on the air with you, I said to Blue, okay, what domains do we have these days?

30:24.480 --> 30:29.720
Let's go ahead and set up a, let's set up a website and you know, just make sure we

30:29.720 --> 30:33.920
have info there so that I can send people somewhere. Gotta plug these things for sure,

30:33.920 --> 30:37.920
especially when they're so fresh. And, and I love how this was completely unplanned,

30:37.920 --> 30:43.280
the timing of all these things, of you and I chatting and this coming out, but it just

30:43.280 --> 30:47.000
like is pretty serendipitous that it's all happening at the same time. So it's great.

30:47.000 --> 30:50.480
It's one of those things that feels meant to be because of the timing. Yeah, yeah, for

30:50.480 --> 30:55.280
sure. Which is awesome. Okay. I wanted to ask you a little bit more about some of your

30:55.280 --> 31:02.160
art. I know you hinted to me earlier that some of your art got picked up maybe by a

31:02.160 --> 31:07.400
brewery by chance. Can you walk us through that a little bit?

31:07.400 --> 31:15.040
So I have a friend, Megan, who is in Ottawa and she does a lot of work with LGBT groups

31:15.040 --> 31:20.560
there and she's another incredible woman. I love that I have surrounded myself with

31:20.560 --> 31:23.480
incredible badass women doing amazing things. I was just thinking, how do you find all these

31:23.480 --> 31:27.920
amazing people? It's just coincidence. Well, you must be attracting them with some energy,

31:27.920 --> 31:34.540
that's for sure. I hope so. Oh, you have good energy, I like it. Thank you. So Megan actually

31:34.540 --> 31:41.480
just coincidentally asked me a few days ago, how do I make a logo? I'm like, well, I do

31:41.480 --> 31:45.320
graphic design. I'll do it for you. What do you want? Basically, you ask someone who knows

31:45.320 --> 31:50.180
how to do it, right? And she just told me what she wanted. So I went ahead and whips

31:50.180 --> 31:56.760
it up for her. And her organization there is called Bell's Corner. Well, she's in Bell's

31:56.760 --> 32:01.160
Corners, I'm sorry. So her organization there is called Queer's Corners. Oh, nice. That's

32:01.160 --> 32:08.520
a nice play on words. So we made this logo and she went ahead and put it with her organization

32:08.520 --> 32:16.360
and a brewery in the area called Whippersnapper saw it and loved it and said, we're going

32:16.360 --> 32:20.880
to go ahead and make a beer with that logo on it for you guys. Oh my goodness, that's

32:20.880 --> 32:27.000
amazing. Within hours of all this happening, it just all happened within a day there. And

32:27.000 --> 32:32.960
I had actually never heard of Whippersnapper because it's very localized to the area it

32:32.960 --> 32:38.880
seems and we're so far down here. I don't know Whippersnapper either and I lived in

32:38.880 --> 32:43.200
Ottawa for like eight to 10 years or so. So I wonder if they're new. It seems like they

32:43.200 --> 32:50.160
might be pretty new, but it seems like she knows the brewer there. But their flavors

32:50.160 --> 32:53.360
are very inventive. We went through quite a few of the flavors. You were showing me

32:53.360 --> 32:57.720
some of these earlier. They were amazing. There was like a blueberry pancakes one.

32:57.720 --> 33:04.960
Yeah, there was one with guava and oh my God, guava. It almost seemed like it wasn't beer

33:04.960 --> 33:09.840
or it was a whole other like parallel universe of beer. Actually, maybe that's a nice way

33:09.840 --> 33:15.160
of putting it. So over there, like talking to her kind of salivating over these various

33:15.160 --> 33:20.960
flavors he's making and telling her how jealous I am. So she and Ian the brewer are actually

33:20.960 --> 33:25.520
working on sending me some. Oh, cool. That's nice. I'm so excited about that. Cool. But

33:25.520 --> 33:30.880
it feels like kind of probably feels like a treat to you that some of your art is getting

33:30.880 --> 33:31.880
around that way.

33:31.880 --> 33:39.640
Yeah. I also have some art out on Ghost in the Burbs merchandise right now. Ghost in

33:39.640 --> 33:48.080
the Burbs is a podcast that is wildly popular in the horror realm. It's about a woman who

33:48.080 --> 33:54.560
lives in Wesley, a suburb of Boston, and interviews her haunted neighbors.

33:54.560 --> 33:56.680
That is so great.

33:56.680 --> 34:05.720
It is wonderful. She transcribes the interviews and puts her own voice to these transcriptions

34:05.720 --> 34:11.840
and she has such a beautiful writing voice. The podcast itself just recently ended last

34:11.840 --> 34:15.560
month but she did it for three or four years.

34:15.560 --> 34:16.720
So there's lots of content there.

34:16.720 --> 34:17.720
There's so much content.

34:17.720 --> 34:18.720
Beautiful.

34:18.720 --> 34:25.640
And the story is wonderful to go through. Her name is Liz Sauer. She was on Siren's

34:25.640 --> 34:32.200
screen for an episode there and she and I became friends through that. But I did a couple

34:32.200 --> 34:39.840
of designs for her and one of my designs, which is a Ouija board with one of her sayings

34:39.840 --> 34:43.760
on it, is still up on the shop there.

34:43.760 --> 34:44.760
Nice.

34:44.760 --> 34:48.840
And that design got pretty popular. So it's actually really fun to see people on Instagram

34:48.840 --> 34:54.780
post their mug or their shirt with this design that I have and the little tag there. I even

34:54.780 --> 35:00.880
have Liz send me one of the mugs with my design on it. So sometimes I get to have my tea in

35:00.880 --> 35:05.480
my little mug with my design on it and it's nice and fun there.

35:05.480 --> 35:12.520
It just reminds me of the power of art in any form really. Either digital stuff like

35:12.520 --> 35:21.480
some of your design work, but also you've got these beautiful tattoos and some of your

35:21.480 --> 35:28.040
painting stuff is pretty incredible. You were showing me a mask that you made out of all

35:28.040 --> 35:32.320
sorts of stuff and it just feels like the string that ties all that together is artistry

35:32.320 --> 35:37.160
and yet can help share some pretty powerful messages too.

35:37.160 --> 35:45.040
Yeah. I feel like being creative is a pretty important part of my life in general. I feel

35:45.040 --> 35:50.240
like that's something that people don't really do enough of, but that's very much a huge

35:50.240 --> 35:57.680
driving force in my life. I mean, it's the way I solve problems. It's the way I approach

35:57.680 --> 36:05.880
everything, literally everything. We were talking about even cooking and we were talking

36:05.880 --> 36:12.320
about cooking vegetarians specifically and how people when they try to incorporate vegetables

36:12.320 --> 36:19.640
in their diet if they're just eating meat a lot and they'll steam some broccoli and

36:19.640 --> 36:21.440
be like, I hate this.

36:21.440 --> 36:26.200
Because broccoli can shine, but not if it's boiled, right?

36:26.200 --> 36:31.120
Yeah. Well, obviously you hate that. Look what you did to it.

36:31.120 --> 36:38.000
There's a real artistry in your entire life, even in cooking. I agree with that completely.

36:38.000 --> 36:40.960
Art in the kitchen can be such a delicious thing.

36:40.960 --> 36:49.200
Yeah. Creativity through everything in life I think is a fun way to live life and a great

36:49.200 --> 36:52.320
way to live life, for me at least.

36:52.320 --> 36:56.640
I have noticed as well that you're pretty good with tech stuff and you're a gamer and

36:56.640 --> 37:05.400
you bring in some of that artistry. Those often are seen as exclusive that art and technology

37:05.400 --> 37:10.080
can't necessarily mix, but I think that's a completely a huge fallacy, right? It's like

37:10.080 --> 37:11.360
one can increase the other.

37:11.360 --> 37:17.640
It absolutely can. In fact, in that next room over there, hanging over the mantle, you'll

37:17.640 --> 37:19.720
see a massive picture.

37:19.720 --> 37:21.040
I do, yeah.

37:21.040 --> 37:27.800
That is an art print from my favorite game, which is Portal 2.

37:27.800 --> 37:30.960
Oh, that is such a great game.

37:30.960 --> 37:38.940
And that picture is called Approaching Wheatly. Coincidentally, that print, the way I got

37:38.940 --> 37:45.240
it is really interesting. Do you ever do Reddit gift swaps at Christmas?

37:45.240 --> 37:47.360
No, but that sounds fascinating.

37:47.360 --> 37:57.040
Oh, so Reddit does Christmas gift swaps. They do the biggest secret Santa in the world.

37:57.040 --> 38:02.040
I used to do it every year and it's a lot of fun. Sometimes you'll get handmade things

38:02.040 --> 38:09.200
from somebody in Lithuania or something. It's incredible. These absolutely charming and

38:09.200 --> 38:15.360
wonderful things that you will get from other people and you'll get to know other people

38:15.360 --> 38:18.960
that way. It's wonderful.

38:18.960 --> 38:27.160
This person that I got matched with one year, almost a decade ago, he just fucking slayed

38:27.160 --> 38:37.560
it. He went through my profile there on Reddit and saw that I love Portal 2 so much. He saw

38:37.560 --> 38:43.520
that I'm a gamer. He saw that I'm an artist and love art and he found this art print.

38:43.520 --> 38:49.680
It's a limited edition signed by the artist. Massive art print from my favorite game ever.

38:49.680 --> 38:52.040
Oh my goodness. That's unbelievable.

38:52.040 --> 38:59.400
When this came in the mail, I was floored. I did not know how to handle this. It was

38:59.400 --> 39:00.400
so incredible.

39:00.400 --> 39:08.020
I think anyone can do art and I have been really fortunate to have integrated photography

39:08.020 --> 39:12.960
into my life. Previous to that, I hadn't had that much experience with artistic endeavors.

39:12.960 --> 39:21.120
It was mostly because I came to technical topics much easier and much more easily like

39:21.120 --> 39:28.680
science and especially computers, that's for sure. I realized that once you dive into technology,

39:28.680 --> 39:34.480
there's a huge amount of creativity that goes into it. Solving problems, as you know, can

39:34.480 --> 39:40.640
be a very creative endeavor. I've been lucky enough to see that with combining photography

39:40.640 --> 39:49.020
and computers, but I encourage everybody to find some way of expressing yourself creatively.

39:49.020 --> 39:50.640
It's such a wonderful outlet.

39:50.640 --> 39:54.040
Jackie, can I ask you a question?

39:54.040 --> 39:55.040
Go for it.

39:55.040 --> 39:59.720
I was wondering if you had an ask of the community, of anybody listening, maybe something you'd

39:59.720 --> 40:01.960
like them to try or to do?

40:01.960 --> 40:08.320
Well, you're asking that at absolutely the perfect moment because my ask would be to

40:08.320 --> 40:14.560
look for creative ways to do things in your life, whether that be to go out of your way

40:14.560 --> 40:22.440
and paint a picture today or to go through your usual routine and add a little spice

40:22.440 --> 40:32.280
into your lunch today or maybe find a colorful way to get to work, a little more scenic way

40:32.280 --> 40:33.280
to get to work.

40:33.280 --> 40:34.280
That's nice.

40:34.280 --> 40:37.680
Find some way to add some creativity to your life.

40:37.680 --> 40:41.480
Put on your artistic glasses and see the world in a slightly different way.

40:41.480 --> 40:42.480
Absolutely.

40:42.480 --> 40:46.400
That's lovely. If people want to get connected with you, where would you like to send them?

40:46.400 --> 40:53.080
I am Jackie the Robot on Twitter and Instagram. I post a lot of bunny and art pics on Instagram.

40:53.080 --> 40:56.360
It doesn't seem like you at all.

40:56.360 --> 41:03.040
No, not at all. My personal site is uselessprogress.com.

41:03.040 --> 41:04.040
Nice.

41:04.040 --> 41:08.280
And sirensofscream is just sirensofscream.com.

41:08.280 --> 41:09.280
Great.

41:09.280 --> 41:10.960
So it's easy.

41:10.960 --> 41:15.260
That's wonderful. Thank you so much for chatting with me today. It's been a real pleasure.

41:15.260 --> 41:18.480
Thank you for having me on. It's been absolutely wonderful getting to know you the past few

41:18.480 --> 41:20.880
days and absolutely wonderful talking to you now.

41:20.880 --> 41:36.480
Great. Yeah. Thanks for having me in your home and for sharing all of the bunny love.
