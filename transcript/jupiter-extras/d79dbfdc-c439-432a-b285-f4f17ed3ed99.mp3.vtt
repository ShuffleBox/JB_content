00:00.000 --> 00:14.880
Welcome to the Dystopia. I just had my whole world

00:14.880 --> 00:21.720
shaked. Just shook and ran underneath me. I'm still processing what I was just told.

00:21.720 --> 00:24.520
You're also putting your money where your mouth is. You're planning to accept salary

00:24.520 --> 00:28.800
in Bitcoin. It's rather interesting that the new mayor-elect here, Eric Adams, is...

00:28.800 --> 00:34.360
So they're taking salary in Bitcoin in Miami, the mayor is, and now they've launched Miami

00:34.360 --> 00:35.360
Coin.

00:35.360 --> 00:39.320
First, we become friends, and we joke with each other and kid each other all the time.

00:39.320 --> 00:42.920
And so maybe it's difficult for him to do it. It's very easy for me to do it. So I don't

00:42.920 --> 00:48.120
know if there's a generational thing there or something that's going on.

00:48.120 --> 00:49.120
He's an old mayor.

00:49.120 --> 00:55.000
We use an app called Strike, and that allows us to convert it instantly. So it's like a

00:55.000 --> 01:00.900
direct deposit feature. So it actually directly deposits the money into a digital wallet.

01:00.900 --> 01:05.120
And so it's very easy for us to do. And I'm doing it with a variety of different cryptocurrencies

01:05.120 --> 01:09.000
on my mayoral salary. And I think, you know, things like putting the Satoshi White Paper

01:09.000 --> 01:11.640
on our website, we're the first city in the country to do that.

01:11.640 --> 01:14.800
So he wants to make Miami competitive by going all in on crypto.

01:14.800 --> 01:19.440
Paying our employees in Bitcoin. We've already paid multiple employees in Bitcoin, including

01:19.440 --> 01:24.680
myself. Allowing our residents to pay for fees and taxes in Bitcoin. And then, of course,

01:24.680 --> 01:28.220
the Miami coin, which now created a New York coin after the Miami coin.

01:28.220 --> 01:32.760
The Miami coin. So you can get paid in Bitcoin. You can pay your taxes in Bitcoin and you

01:32.760 --> 01:37.760
can buy and trade the Miami coin. How about this?

01:37.760 --> 01:41.440
And then, of course, the Miami coin, which now created a New York coin after the Miami

01:41.440 --> 01:46.540
coin, which has generated 30 million dollars in revenue in three months from the mining

01:46.540 --> 01:49.080
revenue that gets put into our digital wallet.

01:49.080 --> 01:54.520
30 million dollars in three months for the Miami coin. I want to know, would you buy

01:54.520 --> 02:01.760
a coin for your city? Where the nearest city to you? Would you would you buy your local

02:01.760 --> 02:02.760
coin?

02:02.760 --> 02:07.360
Ours in revenue in three months from the mining revenue that gets put into our digital wallet.

02:07.360 --> 02:11.800
We're staking that and we're going to give every one of our citizens a Bitcoin dividend

02:11.800 --> 02:15.280
on a quarterly basis. So now they're going to have money in their pocket from innovation

02:15.280 --> 02:17.680
of the city, but they're going to learn about Bitcoin as well.

02:17.680 --> 02:23.360
They're going to give a Bitcoin dividend to the to Miami citizens. I'm having a hard time

02:23.360 --> 02:26.120
even processing these words.

02:26.120 --> 02:32.800
Mayor talk to me from a big picture perspective. A lot of critics would say, OK, the appeal

02:32.800 --> 02:38.440
is cost of living. It's the good weather. It's low taxes. Right. But eventually with

02:38.440 --> 02:44.760
the flock of people, you're going to need to get better housing, fix, get better schools,

02:44.760 --> 02:48.680
fix the roads, fix the bridges. With that is going to eventually become higher taxes.

02:48.680 --> 02:53.040
And it's just going to be this revolving circle. What is the case really that you can make

02:53.040 --> 02:56.160
to stand out for the long term?

02:56.160 --> 03:00.800
I'm laughing because I love when the sense begins to critics say, right, dot, dot, dot.

03:00.800 --> 03:04.720
But for us, it's actually been a completely different story. We've reduced taxes to the

03:04.720 --> 03:09.080
second lowest level since the 1960s. Obviously, we don't have a state income tax and our budget

03:09.080 --> 03:13.820
has doubled in size. So the people who think that you have to raise taxes to increase the

03:13.820 --> 03:17.800
size of your budget are completely wrong. The more you increase taxes, the more people

03:17.800 --> 03:21.360
are going to flee, which is what we're seeing in some of these high tax states. And then

03:21.360 --> 03:23.760
you're going to lose revenue, which is going to create a budget hole. It becomes sort of

03:23.760 --> 03:28.840
a vicious cycle. So for us, we've seen the exact opposite scenario by having more revenue

03:28.840 --> 03:32.680
in our coffers by reducing taxes. Now we've been able to increase policing while many

03:32.680 --> 03:36.560
cities across America have defunded their police. And guess what happened? They know

03:36.560 --> 03:40.080
it's going to shock you. Crime went down in the city. So while the murder rate is going

03:40.080 --> 03:45.360
up across America, it's actually decreasing in the city of Miami. So we're starting to

03:45.360 --> 03:49.880
see these counter narratives. And so they're in there. They're using the Bitcoin to fund

03:49.880 --> 03:53.800
certain city initiatives. They're giving a dividend. They have a Miami coin that's gone

03:53.800 --> 04:01.320
to 30 million dollars in three months. There's a lot to process. There's a lot. Optimus Gray

04:01.320 --> 04:07.320
says his met his nearest city would be St. Louis. So not going to do it for him. A Seattle

04:07.320 --> 04:14.600
coin. I'd have to see outperforms. What would you base it on? The entire thing is completely

04:14.600 --> 04:21.920
new to me. I wonder if I could find anything else about it. The greatest investment, the

04:21.920 --> 04:26.720
greatest newest investment, Miami coin, you've got to be shitting me. Miami coin. All right.

04:26.720 --> 04:29.360
Here's the coverage of the launch. Let's see what we have.

04:29.360 --> 04:34.440
That Miami coin will set the city up for that lofty long term goal. The cryptocurrency was

04:34.440 --> 04:40.040
born out of a project with a nonprofit called City Coins. According to its founders, anyone

04:40.040 --> 04:45.800
can download the software, hop on a computer to mint those new coins. The miner keeps 70

04:45.800 --> 04:51.200
percent of the profits and the rest goes straight to the city's wallet. And like OK, OK, all

04:51.200 --> 04:56.880
right. So a miner keeps 70 percent of the profits. All right. This is that's the key

04:56.880 --> 05:02.080
details here. 70 percent of the profits and the rest goes straight to the city's wallet.

05:02.080 --> 05:07.760
And like other crypto currencies, Miami coin also trades on an exchange so people can invest

05:07.760 --> 05:12.960
in it. This one hit an all time high of just around five cents. It is the first and so

05:12.960 --> 05:17.640
far the only test case of this idea. But since August, the cryptocurrency has brought in

05:17.640 --> 05:22.880
just over 10 million dollars for Miami. That's more than three times what officials say.

05:22.880 --> 05:29.040
This is this, by the way, is as of I should mention, because this was a recorded theater

05:29.040 --> 05:34.240
mode without make it display better for you guys. My cat, my capture device is dying,

05:34.240 --> 05:40.000
so I can't play real time video for you. It's a slow, pathetic death to 10 million as of

05:40.000 --> 05:50.440
October 5th, and now he's saying 30 million. Hmm. So you get to keep 70 percent. The rest

05:50.440 --> 05:55.680
goes to the city to essentially pay for city services or however they're going to spend

05:55.680 --> 06:02.480
it. Some cities will probably not spend it very well. But that allows them to back off

06:02.480 --> 06:08.120
on paying taxes, theoretically, of course, they'd probably just do both. It's an interesting

06:08.120 --> 06:13.280
idea. OK, I guess the more I hear about it, the less I'm hating it, but I'm still feeling

06:13.280 --> 06:18.480
like it's some sort of weird, dystopian future. They forecast it. The city's mayor and a Bitcoin

06:18.480 --> 06:24.000
believer, Francis Suarez, says at the current pace it could bring in as much as 60 million

06:24.000 --> 06:29.360
dollars for Miami and eventually subsidize or even replace taxes. But he says Miami's

06:29.360 --> 06:35.040
still holding the coins in escrow for a couple months. He says they're doing more due diligence

06:35.040 --> 06:39.620
before Miami can start spending these coins. We're going to hold them for a while to make

06:39.620 --> 06:44.040
sure that there are no issues related to the technology, and then we can work on a variety

06:44.040 --> 06:49.680
of different ideas that we have to make our city better, including educational ideas,

06:49.680 --> 06:55.080
including affordable housing and including a lot of issues that, you know, we obviously

06:55.080 --> 07:00.320
as cities across America would love to have more resources to help solve. The project

07:00.320 --> 07:05.200
comes with its share of challenges. There are price fluctuations, regulatory questions

07:05.200 --> 07:10.320
at the federal level and even money laundering concerns, to name a few. City coins are the

07:10.320 --> 07:16.480
latest sign of growing competition to attract the fast growing digital industry and digital

07:16.480 --> 07:20.880
asset industries. Suarez has billed Miami as the crypto capital of the country, but

07:20.880 --> 07:27.200
Austin, Texas, and Cheyenne, Wyoming are among those also competing to attract crypto companies.

07:27.200 --> 07:51.280
Sources tell me Austin and New York are on the shortlist for their own city coin. Well,

07:51.280 --> 07:56.240
you're going to see a lot of different implementations possibly, and one of them inevitably, or many

07:56.240 --> 08:01.200
of them will have corruption. And then you will have a currency that the city is creating

08:01.200 --> 08:08.320
or an asset being created by the state or the local city that is involved with money

08:08.320 --> 08:17.440
laundering and fraud. And these coins, what they'll do is they'll be pumped up in value

08:17.440 --> 08:24.600
initially. This is going to be a thing. This is going to be bad for Bitcoin because these

08:24.600 --> 08:30.200
coins will initially take off like rockets, like the Miami coin is and others. Miami coin

08:30.200 --> 08:36.240
will probably be the strongest because there is a first mover's advantage here. Oh boy.

08:36.240 --> 08:39.640
And then what's going to happen is all the other cities are going to start getting, well,

08:39.640 --> 08:44.560
a lot of other cities will start getting involved, states and cities, it's going to be a mess.

08:44.560 --> 08:52.520
And you're going to see this happen. As they go up in value, the city officials, the people

08:52.520 --> 09:00.640
running, the managing their part of it will use that inflated temporary price to buy Bitcoin.

09:00.640 --> 09:05.420
They're going to turn it around and convert that into Bitcoin and they'll buy Bitcoin

09:05.420 --> 09:09.400
when their price is at a premium. And then when they start doing that and they start

09:09.400 --> 09:14.840
selling and they start buying the Bitcoin to do it, they have to sell to buy the Bitcoin,

09:14.840 --> 09:19.340
that's going to start to crash the price. So the cities will cash out and they'll move

09:19.340 --> 09:24.280
this into Bitcoin, the price will drop and it'll artificially inflate the price of Bitcoin

09:24.280 --> 09:29.160
while they do it. Then as the value of all these currencies tumbles, after a while they'll

09:29.160 --> 09:34.960
all start to tumble. Then the very price that propped up Bitcoin will start to crumble and

09:34.960 --> 09:42.800
it'll affect the price of Bitcoin as well. It's going to be a mess. And we do not have

09:42.800 --> 09:48.780
a federal government that is capable of properly managing this because there are elements of

09:48.780 --> 09:58.760
this I could get on board with. If my local county had a coin, I know this sounds crazy,

09:58.760 --> 10:04.760
but I would, I would, if, if I could do something that would help raise revenue for my local

10:04.760 --> 10:09.400
county and I could also maybe make a little money, that does seem like there's something

10:09.400 --> 10:17.280
to that idea. Um, but I'm pretty skeptical of the implementation. And I suppose if I

10:17.280 --> 10:24.800
lived in downtown Seattle and if they raised revenue via cryptocurrency to help with the

10:24.800 --> 10:29.340
homeless population or something, that would be something that I think a lot of my citizens

10:29.340 --> 10:36.060
would be compelled by. So that, that shared goal would add value. It would, that would

10:36.060 --> 10:41.240
be value created by the Seattle coin. If, if the city of Seattle said, we're going to

10:41.240 --> 10:48.840
use these funds to help build homeless camps and set up shelters for the homeless and feed

10:48.840 --> 10:57.280
them, a lot of us would think that's a worthy cause. And I could see that adding intrinsic

10:57.280 --> 11:02.880
value to something that would otherwise be valueless. If supporting your city is valuable

11:02.880 --> 11:07.120
to you and you can achieve that through a cryptocurrency, I could see some people adopting

11:07.120 --> 11:12.560
that and you could even see like local businesses that use the Seattle coin and they get a special

11:12.560 --> 11:17.780
kickback, a special, special percentage from the city. I mean, you could see how far this

11:17.780 --> 11:23.580
could go. I don't know if I think it's a good idea or not though. It feels like, it feels

11:23.580 --> 11:28.400
like instead of having one true currency, we're going to have thousands and you'll have

11:28.400 --> 11:33.020
some big cryptocurrencies that are essentially the primary stores of value that everybody's

11:33.020 --> 11:36.000
going to move things in and out of. And you're going to have all these other cryptocurrencies

11:36.000 --> 11:42.120
that are popping off and dying and popping off. It's going to be stocks times a hundred,

11:42.120 --> 11:46.480
right? Because the volatility, the speed at which it moves and the global nature and the

11:46.480 --> 11:52.680
24 seven aspect of it, right? Because who says a rich billionaire in Russia couldn't

11:52.680 --> 11:57.040
go buy up a ton of Miami coin and start effing with the market. I bet you there's nothing

11:57.040 --> 12:00.980
that says you have to be in Miami to own that coin, right? So you could start to see how

12:00.980 --> 12:05.060
people could really manipulate this thing and how that would force some sort of federal

12:05.060 --> 12:09.440
regulation. And then we get into a state versus federal rights thing. And that's also going

12:09.440 --> 12:15.280
to be just a huge political mess. Political lines will be drawn and sides will be declared.

12:15.280 --> 12:19.480
That's what I suspect will happen. Miami's kicking it off. Austin's next and New York's

12:19.480 --> 12:25.000
on the list. So it's coming. Wonder how long until Portland or Seattle or San Francisco

12:25.000 --> 12:54.840
around there. To make those new coins, the miner keeps

12:54.840 --> 13:00.040
70 percent of the profits and the rest goes straight to the city's wallet. If you're just

13:00.040 --> 13:04.960
joining us, we've been talking about Miami coin launching. It launched earlier this year.

13:04.960 --> 13:09.960
Miami now has their own cryptocurrency that's around 30 million dollars. They're letting

13:09.960 --> 13:15.880
citizens pay for taxes in Miami coin or Bitcoin. And some of the city staff, including the

13:15.880 --> 13:22.880
mayor, are taking some or all of their paychecks in Bitcoin. Miami says that they can use some

13:22.880 --> 13:26.560
of the funds raised to pay for things like police enforcement and other things that have

13:26.560 --> 13:31.560
been defunded recently. So the question I've been asking the chat room is, would you buy

13:31.560 --> 13:36.300
a local city coin? Now, Avath in here says that there's no such thing as fixing social

13:36.300 --> 13:42.420
problems and using crypto at the same time. And I think he probably knows I kind of disagree

13:42.420 --> 13:49.160
with that. My mindset is you have a technology which is amoral and then you have how people

13:49.160 --> 13:53.280
use it. And this is a universal debate we have about all kinds of things, but it is

13:53.280 --> 14:00.200
100 percent applicable to crypto currencies as well. You could look at Bitcoin as just

14:00.200 --> 14:06.500
a volatile asset that can be a store of wealth and not a currency. And if I think if you

14:06.500 --> 14:12.200
start looking at things like Ethereum or Miami coin or Bitcoin as an asset comparable to

14:12.200 --> 14:17.200
gold and silver, but digital equivalents, you might start to see some of the shift like

14:17.200 --> 14:22.760
the nice thing about Bitcoin for, say, people who are lower on the social tier or don't

14:22.760 --> 14:31.680
have a lot of or no disposable income. You can Satoshi down these Bitcoins into teeny,

14:31.680 --> 14:36.720
teeny, teeny, tiny amounts and you can buy tiny bits at a time. Ten dollars worth, twenty

14:36.720 --> 14:41.340
five dollars worth. And you can stack that and stack that and stack that and stack that

14:41.340 --> 14:51.400
over time. Now, Bitcoin just had a 20 percent value drop, right? But if you started getting

14:51.400 --> 14:56.720
in at the beginning of the year, even with this 20 percent drop, Bitcoin has had one

14:56.720 --> 15:01.520
hundred and sixty percent gain for the last year, even after the drop. And it's recovering

15:01.520 --> 15:08.880
right now from the drop. But even at the bottom of the drop. Bitcoin had gained one hundred

15:08.880 --> 15:13.720
and sixty percent in value from the beginning of the year. Now, if you've been stacking

15:13.720 --> 15:19.260
like the beginning from the beginning of the year, that's pretty great. And I I just kind

15:19.260 --> 15:24.200
of went through this. So I decided to just experiment with this about the beginning of

15:24.200 --> 15:29.240
the year. And I started buying small amounts of Bitcoin every Friday, like twenty five

15:29.240 --> 15:36.720
bucks here, maybe 50 bucks here, depending on what I could afford. And then by just dumb

15:36.720 --> 15:42.600
luck, I decided right before the price crashed over the weekend to cash out some of that

15:42.600 --> 15:46.460
Bitcoin for Christmas to buy Christmas gifts, because I think if you can convert that stuff

15:46.460 --> 15:51.100
into physical goods like that, that's you know, it's not a good investment strategy,

15:51.100 --> 15:59.200
but it's how I'm using it right now. I'd rather use that than credit. So I had put about almost

15:59.200 --> 16:04.720
three hundred dollars worth of cash into Bitcoin since the beginning of the year, just buying

16:04.720 --> 16:11.180
little bits at a time here and there. And I withdrew this weekend. Four hundred and

16:11.180 --> 16:15.680
eighty dollars now after fees was four hundred and fifty dollars. But I put in almost three

16:15.680 --> 16:23.260
hundred and I took out after fees four hundred and fifty dollars. And that's just been since

16:23.260 --> 16:30.900
about April. And now I'm paying for Christmas with some of that stuff. I don't have another

16:30.900 --> 16:36.260
way to build wealth. I can't buy real estate anymore. And even if I could buy real estate,

16:36.260 --> 16:41.180
I don't have the personal bandwidth to maintain the real estate to even do the paperwork and

16:41.180 --> 16:46.500
pay the taxes. I don't have the bandwidth for that. So and I don't have the I don't

16:46.500 --> 16:52.040
have the money to and I don't really have anything to leverage for the loan. So I can't

16:52.040 --> 16:57.340
do the real estate thing. I don't really understand the stock market well enough to feel like

16:57.340 --> 17:03.400
I'm not going to screw myself. So I don't really do anything there. I don't have a company

17:03.400 --> 17:10.300
retirement account because I'm an independent business person in a sole proprietorship.

17:10.300 --> 17:16.340
So there's not a lot of tools. Plus, I've chosen a very minimal mobile lifestyle. So

17:16.340 --> 17:21.740
I can't really like accumulate valuable things and store them in my RV. And I don't really

17:21.740 --> 17:27.560
have any interest in paying for gold because to me, it's just a rock. It's a useful rock

17:27.560 --> 17:31.860
that has a lot of good industrial applications. But there's a lot of it out there. And I don't

17:31.860 --> 17:39.260
personally want to have a bunch of metals and rocks. I want to store my my wealth digitally.

17:39.260 --> 17:44.700
And so Bitcoin is a is a form of mathematically provable property. That's what it is. It's

17:44.700 --> 17:52.600
an asset that is mathematically proved and secured by a peer to peer network with a central

17:52.600 --> 18:00.740
ledger that tracks who owns which coins and everyone can have a copy of that ledger.

18:00.740 --> 18:05.280
How people use it? Well, I mean, we could talk about how the Biden family pays each

18:05.280 --> 18:09.460
other off with diamonds, right? Or we could talk about how most drug sales are in cash

18:09.460 --> 18:14.100
or how we give bags of cash to the Afghans. What are they using cash for? Who knows, right?

18:14.100 --> 18:23.700
The cash cash is the ultimate crime. Currency. Caches. So we got to be realistic about that

18:23.700 --> 18:30.400
by probably orders of magnitude more, right? So the technology does not necessarily equal

18:30.400 --> 18:34.940
the use of it. And there is an opportunity for people that are lower on the social economical

18:34.940 --> 18:39.700
ladder to actually build wealth if these things don't blow up in their face. But just like

18:39.700 --> 18:47.020
playing in the stock market can blow up in your face times five that so can crypto currencies.

18:47.020 --> 18:52.740
But there absolutely is a place for people lower on the wealth ladder. Now, when you

18:52.740 --> 18:58.340
start taking it to things like city coins, like Miami coin. And then you times that to

18:58.340 --> 19:02.860
an Austin coin. I mean, like, maybe I just I don't know, would you like say you say you

19:02.860 --> 19:08.340
knew you were going to move to Austin in two years? Do you start by an Austin coin? It

19:08.340 --> 19:14.620
just it starts to it does start to become a casino. And people's concerns about that

19:14.620 --> 19:21.060
about the fraud and Ponzi scheme nature of it are legitimate because those aspects of

19:21.060 --> 19:26.500
it are concerning. But they don't necessarily mean the technology is bad and there isn't

19:26.500 --> 19:50.580
some fundamental use.

19:50.580 --> 20:05.780
You know, my buddy Joe has been taking to calling cryptocurrency like our modern dot

20:05.780 --> 20:11.780
com bubble. And I think that might be a good way to think about it. If you were buying

20:11.780 --> 20:21.020
stocks back in 2000, and we had the dot com bubble, 95% of those stocks went bust. They

20:21.020 --> 20:27.660
just blew up in your face and people went broke. But 5% of those stocks are Amazon,

20:27.660 --> 20:34.500
Apple, Microsoft, Rackspace, all the companies that were involved in building the cloud era,

20:34.500 --> 20:39.500
from hardware to software to services. Like they were around back then too. And some of

20:39.500 --> 20:46.220
those paid off handsomely. But a lot of them didn't. That's where we're at with this whole

20:46.220 --> 20:52.500
crypto idea. Like there's some fundamentals there like with the blockchain. Being able

20:52.500 --> 20:56.900
being able to send money peer to peer with no middleman to anyone in the world a universal

20:56.900 --> 21:02.580
currency that somebody in Russia and somebody in China and somebody in India and somebody

21:02.580 --> 21:08.420
in Canada and somebody in Mexico like all over the world. They all have a common currency

21:08.420 --> 21:13.460
they can work with. That's clearly fucking needed. Like that's just obvious, right? That's

21:13.460 --> 21:20.000
just like, in the age of the internet, especially like you look at my kids, man, they're growing

21:20.000 --> 21:25.860
up online. Especially these COVID years. You think they're you think they're going to find

21:25.860 --> 21:30.540
value in physical crap that you got to move around or or like paperwork you got to deal

21:30.540 --> 21:35.420
with now they want something they could buy on their iPhone in 15 minutes. And you know,

21:35.420 --> 21:38.820
that often gets thrown around despairingly. But you know what the technology should actually

21:38.820 --> 21:47.000
enable that that's not it's not an unrealistic expectation in 2021 and on. So we also have

21:47.000 --> 21:54.780
to think about this from a younger generation who values things like avatar skins in roblox.

21:54.780 --> 22:01.740
It's a huge market right now is these digital goods in app purchases, these tokens. And

22:01.740 --> 22:10.260
they're I mean, that's how app stores make money now. And if they value that stuff, that

22:10.260 --> 22:13.940
stuff is literally never going to gain in value. It's never going to do anything but

22:13.940 --> 22:20.540
buy more crap in a game for them. Our crypto currencies really that much more of a leap.

22:20.540 --> 22:24.420
Don't they actually make more sense because they're cryptographically verifiable. You

22:24.420 --> 22:32.460
can trade them with anybody. They have value amongst a many areas of things and utility.

22:32.460 --> 22:38.620
Cryptocurrency is the conversion of energy into wealth into a store value and it's very

22:38.620 --> 22:42.580
expensive right now. But that's an area where people are going to invest a lot to is making

22:42.580 --> 22:46.980
it greener and greener. And as people do that, that hype cycle is going to keep going. I

22:46.980 --> 22:53.540
mean, we we are entering like this.com bubble mutant that's probably going to go for a while

22:53.540 --> 22:58.900
it's going to build and it's going to get outrageous. And then one day it's likely going

22:58.900 --> 23:04.180
to give and there will be a few left standing. And I think so it's it's not a bad analogy

23:04.180 --> 23:12.380
to say it's like the dot com bubble, but just a global 2021 dystopian version of it. All

23:12.380 --> 23:16.580
right. Well, Coder's coming up here in just a minute. Mike's going to be joining me shortly

23:16.580 --> 23:39.180
and we got a good show plan.

23:39.180 --> 24:04.900
Hey,
