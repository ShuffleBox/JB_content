00:00.000 --> 00:15.320
Well, hello, everyone. Welcome to Brunch with Brent. Joining me today is Stuart Langridge.

00:15.320 --> 00:18.520
Stuart, how are you? And thank you so much for joining me.

00:18.520 --> 00:21.560
Hi, Brent. And thank you very much for inviting me.

00:21.560 --> 00:29.240
Anytime. Some may know you from co-hosting the podcast Bad Voltage. I think many will

00:29.240 --> 00:35.620
recognize your voice. It's one of a kind. And I know for sure that your laughter is

00:35.620 --> 00:41.200
something that always gets to me. So that's appreciated. Tell me a little bit about Bad

00:41.200 --> 00:46.080
Voltage. What is it? How does it start for you? And where's it going, maybe?

00:46.080 --> 00:54.360
Okay, so Bad Voltage is a technology podcast. The intention is that it's about things that

00:54.360 --> 00:59.400
the hosts find interesting. The hosts now are myself, John O'Bacon, who people might

00:59.400 --> 01:04.920
have heard of as the, he was a community manager of Ubuntu. Then he worked for XPrize and GitHub.

01:04.920 --> 01:11.360
Now he runs John O'Bacon Consulting. And Jeremy Garcia, who runs Linux Questions and has been

01:11.360 --> 01:17.800
around forever. He used to work for himself. And the three of us do the podcast once a

01:17.800 --> 01:24.480
fortnight. And the intention, as I say, is that it's a general technology focus. It tends

01:24.480 --> 01:33.840
to skew a little bit towards the open source end of the universe. But that's mostly because

01:33.840 --> 01:40.380
the three of us are quite interested in that area. So you'll hear the word Linux turn up

01:40.380 --> 01:47.000
on it more than you might do on, say, The Verge podcast. But the key point here is that's

01:47.000 --> 01:51.440
not what it's about. We occasionally get people who will show up and complain that we're not

01:51.440 --> 01:55.640
covering the release of a distribution or something. And we're like, we're not a Linux

01:55.640 --> 02:01.160
podcast. We're not an open source podcast. The fact that we came out of that area, I

02:01.160 --> 02:05.480
mean, perfect example of someone else who came out of that area. I used to go to the

02:05.480 --> 02:10.760
GNOME summits, the GUARDEC. This is the GNOME User and Developer Summit, which happens every

02:10.760 --> 02:19.040
year. And one of the first people I met at one of those back in 2004, 2005, was a chap

02:19.040 --> 02:26.400
called Nat Friedman, who was working on GNOME. And now he's CEO of GitHub. So not everyone

02:26.400 --> 02:31.560
who necessarily starts in the free software arena ends up in that place. And having a

02:31.560 --> 02:35.960
wider arena, I think, is interesting. It gives us the opportunity to talk about things that

02:35.960 --> 02:41.600
affect the technology world from a bigger perspective and things in technology that

02:41.600 --> 02:46.640
affect the wider world more generally. One of the nice things about doing Bad Voltage

02:46.640 --> 02:54.120
as well is that we get to do live shows. So we'll do a stage performance, a live performance

02:54.120 --> 03:00.680
of the show. We've done those six or seven times now, I think. We've done most of them

03:00.680 --> 03:07.400
at scale, the Southern California Linux Expo, which I got back from, what, two weeks ago,

03:07.400 --> 03:11.920
I think. And we had an absolute whale of a time. The live show is always brilliant.

03:11.920 --> 03:12.920
That's lovely.

03:12.920 --> 03:18.360
Yeah. One of the things we've been talking about is maybe doing more live shows and shaking

03:18.360 --> 03:23.520
up the format a little bit. But that's still under discussion. So I'm not going to reveal

03:23.520 --> 03:29.560
the discussions just yet. But if you're interested in what we might be doing, then listen to

03:29.560 --> 03:32.000
the show.

03:32.000 --> 03:38.440
What I appreciate about the show, actually, is its flexibility in content. Because the

03:38.440 --> 03:45.080
three of you clearly have experiences and a depth of experience in the kind of topics

03:45.080 --> 03:51.800
that the Linux-y and open source-y folk like us tend to appreciate. But some topics that

03:51.800 --> 04:00.960
have come up have been questions like, what does privacy mean in the current era? Each

04:00.960 --> 04:07.840
perspective has been explored, which I appreciate. It's like, well, there's the idealistic side

04:07.840 --> 04:14.080
of it, but also the pragmatic side of it. And just the discussions that you each had

04:14.080 --> 04:19.000
there I thought was really rich. So thanks for putting that out there.

04:19.000 --> 04:24.320
Thank you. I mean, that's obviously the intention behind these things is to at least attempt

04:24.320 --> 04:29.720
to look at a problem somewhat pragmatically, somewhat idealistically. I mean, in general,

04:29.720 --> 04:35.120
I probably end up being the most idealistic of the three of us, but it depends quite dramatically

04:35.120 --> 04:40.760
on what the topic is. Jeremy's the most knowledgeable and Jono's the most fervent. But Jono would

04:40.760 --> 04:45.640
say he was the most practical. I would say I was the most knowledgeable and I'd be wrong.

04:45.640 --> 04:51.880
But I think that exactly the goal is to attempt to look at big picture things. I mean, we've

04:51.880 --> 04:54.440
done quite a lot of looking at privacy, so we're probably going to move on from that

04:54.440 --> 04:59.600
now. But we have spent quite some time looking at various different angles of things like

04:59.600 --> 05:06.800
facial recognition and big companies gathering our data and stuff like that. And obviously,

05:06.800 --> 05:10.280
I have a certain amount of interest in this kind of thing myself. I've spoken at conferences

05:10.280 --> 05:19.240
about it and things like that. So it's attempting to take that half a step back and look at

05:19.240 --> 05:23.400
the bigger picture. But it might be the bigger picture around something relatively small.

05:23.400 --> 05:33.680
One of the shows we did recently was essentially a full show review of an email client called

05:33.680 --> 05:34.960
Superhuman.

05:34.960 --> 05:37.560
This was a fascinating episode.

05:37.560 --> 05:41.840
It turned out even more interesting than I thought it would, I think, because it was

05:41.840 --> 05:47.640
a review in the New York review of books style, a review where you spend the first 30 seconds

05:47.640 --> 05:51.680
talking about the product and then the rest of it essentially talking about something

05:51.680 --> 05:55.440
vaguely related to it in order to give you an excuse to talk about the bigger picture

05:55.440 --> 06:03.800
thing. So we segued quite relatively quickly into the bigger picture of email clients in

06:03.800 --> 06:10.280
general and whether email is important and user experience and user interface and how

06:10.280 --> 06:17.320
Gmail was streets ahead of the competition. And now it isn't, but no one else has really

06:17.320 --> 06:21.380
stepped up to take that play and maybe Superhuman are it. Is it a good idea to trust your email

06:21.380 --> 06:29.080
to a company like this? So it's all kind of larger thoughts prompted by a particular thing.

06:29.080 --> 06:32.560
And again, that was interesting because we got some feedback from people saying, why

06:32.560 --> 06:36.880
would you spend the whole time talking about a proprietary email client? And we were like,

06:36.880 --> 06:41.680
why wouldn't we? It's an interesting product if you're an email power user.

06:41.680 --> 06:47.320
Jono certainly loves it to bits. I don't get anywhere near enough email to warrant this

06:47.320 --> 06:52.280
kind of thing. But as with everything else, I mean, we reviewed a Kindle one, say, you

06:52.280 --> 06:57.120
know, which was 10 years old at the time. But the whole point is that it's a stepping

06:57.120 --> 07:03.040
stone into a larger question. It's very rare that we talk about a thing just for the sake

07:03.040 --> 07:05.680
of the thing itself.

07:05.680 --> 07:11.700
And no product is isolated. It's always in an environment interacting with all sorts

07:11.700 --> 07:18.560
of other things. So it warrants that exploration, I think. And that's often missed.

07:18.560 --> 07:24.220
There is almost nothing I own, which, as you say, I use in isolation. There isn't anything

07:24.220 --> 07:31.040
like that. Everything has a cultural context, a technological context. You might think of

07:31.040 --> 07:36.680
it as compatibility, but it's not technological compatibility. It's not, are there drivers

07:36.680 --> 07:41.800
for this in my Ubuntu kernel? It's more, is it compatible with the way I live the rest

07:41.800 --> 07:46.960
of my life? There's no point in buying a device to control your smart home if you have no

07:46.960 --> 07:49.480
intention of buying any smart home light bulbs.

07:49.480 --> 07:50.480
Right.

07:50.480 --> 07:54.400
And similarly, there's not a lot of point in buying one smart light bulb for your house

07:54.400 --> 08:01.080
because what's the point, you know? So if you've decided to invest yourself in a particular

08:01.080 --> 08:04.600
area of technology, you've got to think, does all this stuff fit together? Does it fit in

08:04.600 --> 08:10.640
with my life? What am I going to do when new people walk into the house? That kind of thing.

08:10.640 --> 08:15.840
So that, I think, that cultural context of how does it fit into my life? How does it

08:15.840 --> 08:21.760
fit into the larger scheme of technology as a whole? Is this product an example of something

08:21.760 --> 08:25.840
which is taking us in a direction that we want to go in or a direction that we don't

08:25.840 --> 08:30.800
want to go in? Is anyone else doing it better? That, to me, is almost more interesting than

08:30.800 --> 08:32.720
the thing itself.

08:32.720 --> 08:39.440
Which is why spending an episode on a proprietary email service, while that seems like you spent

08:39.440 --> 08:43.600
the entire episode simply on that product, that's not true at all, right? So there's

08:43.600 --> 08:51.360
a real value in exploring kind of what's rubbing shoulders with that email service because

08:51.360 --> 08:56.440
obviously it got there somehow and it's necessarily a cultural indicator.

08:56.440 --> 09:00.960
That's precisely the plan. I mean, certainly I remember when Gmail first came out, everyone

09:00.960 --> 09:07.840
was super duper impressed with it because it was fast and it basically never got spam

09:07.840 --> 09:14.080
wrong and it was easy to use. And that was great. But as far as I can tell since then,

09:14.080 --> 09:21.960
since 2012 or something, it's kind of stagnated. And there's been ample opportunity. People

09:21.960 --> 09:25.280
say, well, why don't you use Thunderbird or whatever? Yeah, okay. But Thunderbird is exactly

09:25.280 --> 09:26.840
the same now as it was in 2008.

09:26.840 --> 09:28.680
Yeah, it really is.

09:28.680 --> 09:38.400
There's a whole bunch of space for people to innovate in the way they handle my email.

09:38.400 --> 09:43.240
This is not about innovating in what email is because companies tend to think, hey, let's

09:43.240 --> 09:48.280
innovate in email by getting rid of all the things that make email good. Like the fact

09:48.280 --> 09:57.360
that it's free and I can run my own server. But the last big change in the way I think

09:57.360 --> 10:05.040
email was handled was Gmail inventing conversations. And you forget, if you go back to a non-Gmail

10:05.040 --> 10:10.240
way of looking at your mail, you forget that conversations aren't part of how email works.

10:10.240 --> 10:16.200
They're a Gmail thing. And still to this day, as far as I can tell, no one's actually caught

10:16.200 --> 10:21.440
up with that. And that was nearly 10 years ago. So the idea that someone is going to

10:21.440 --> 10:29.120
say, let's find a way of handling email, which is more in tune with the way email works today,

10:29.120 --> 10:34.160
I think is really interesting. One of the things that has, one of the accusations I

10:34.160 --> 10:36.720
should say, that's often been levelled at the open source community is that we're towel

10:36.720 --> 10:41.200
light chasers. That there's no innovation going on. That all we know how to do is wait

10:41.200 --> 10:45.320
till a proprietary product comes along and then clone it. Now, I don't think that's true.

10:45.320 --> 10:48.800
Part of the reason I don't think it's true is that every time someone comes up with a

10:48.800 --> 10:54.040
new WYSIWYG proprietary thing, someone is always able to point to a half-finished, half-written

10:54.040 --> 11:00.360
GTK app from 2006, which did basically what this was talking about and say, see, no, we

11:00.360 --> 11:06.880
invented it first. What we are not good at as a community, in my opinion, is actually

11:06.880 --> 11:11.480
doing the final mile. Turning a thing from a project into a product, turning a thing

11:11.480 --> 11:15.440
from a proof of concept into something that real people can use. And they can be real

11:15.440 --> 11:19.880
people like me. They don't have to be real people like my family, who aren't very technological

11:19.880 --> 11:25.560
at all. I've got no problem if they're real people who need a bit of technical knowledge,

11:25.560 --> 11:32.760
but I would like to see us have the confidence in our innovations. I mean, places where we

11:32.760 --> 11:36.040
do lead the world, if you look at stuff the Linux kernel does with things like containers

11:36.040 --> 11:42.160
and so on, they said, okay, we think it's a good idea to enable this concept of containers.

11:42.160 --> 11:50.280
And they created the cloud, right? People were doing VMs before, but this stuff didn't

11:50.280 --> 11:55.920
really take off until the Linux container stuff really got started. And so some people

11:55.920 --> 11:59.320
in the kernel team go, we're going to invent these things called containers to enable you

11:59.320 --> 12:05.960
to namespace and sandbox a Linux installation on top of another Linux installation. Created

12:05.960 --> 12:09.760
the cloud, which now dominates the whole technology industry. That's what happens when you get

12:09.760 --> 12:14.520
something right. And it's something that happened in open source first. And for everyone who

12:14.520 --> 12:17.980
says, I don't understand why YouTube is so interesting. I invented YouTube by sketching

12:17.980 --> 12:23.400
the answer on the back of a cigarette packet in 2004. The answer is because the idea of

12:23.400 --> 12:26.840
going, I know what I'll do. I'll let people upload video and then download it to their

12:26.840 --> 12:31.240
own computers. That's not the revelation. Ideas are not the hard bit. Execution is the

12:31.240 --> 12:37.400
hard bit. Delivery is the hard bit. And I'd love to see us doing more of that.

12:37.400 --> 12:44.240
I like how you mentioned that final mile because that's so true. It feels like, well, maybe

12:44.240 --> 12:49.500
I'll put a question to you. Do you think that that final mile is such a challenge because

12:49.500 --> 12:57.000
of some of the economic realities of open source projects? Like creating a stereotypical

12:57.000 --> 13:03.320
successful business around a project isn't necessarily in line with open source ideals.

13:03.320 --> 13:05.440
Would you agree with that? Or what do you think?

13:05.440 --> 13:13.960
Oh, now there's a contentious opinion. I don't think that making money is inimical to open

13:13.960 --> 13:20.480
source ideals. I think they are perfectly compatible. Some of the reason I think, and

13:20.480 --> 13:25.920
this discussion has come up quite a lot recently, the idea about making a Linux app rather than

13:25.920 --> 13:33.400
making another distribution. What we don't see is a lot of apps coming out. And that's

13:33.400 --> 13:38.480
disappointing to me at least. And I think some of the reason for that is that that last

13:38.480 --> 13:45.160
mile is not very well documented. So people think that, well, that can't be that hard.

13:45.160 --> 13:49.840
But actually, once you've finished writing an app which does something, the amount of

13:49.840 --> 13:56.280
work it takes to go from there to getting it into someone's hands in a delightful state

13:56.280 --> 14:01.840
is just as much work as building the thing was in the first place. So if you say, well,

14:01.840 --> 14:05.840
okay, I've written the code, now it's on GitHub, just download it and install it. You've only

14:05.840 --> 14:11.480
actually done half the work at that point, right? You've got to sit down and design the

14:11.480 --> 14:16.600
icons for it and get them drawn. And you've got to think about the UI and make sure that

14:16.600 --> 14:19.560
everything's spaced correctly, everything's laid out correctly. And you've got to make

14:19.560 --> 14:23.000
sure that right to left text works. And you've got to make sure that you can paste emojis

14:23.000 --> 14:26.600
into your app and it doesn't crash. And you've got to give it a good name. And you've got

14:26.600 --> 14:31.400
to give it a good strap line. And you've got to upload it to one of two or three different

14:31.400 --> 14:35.560
stores depending on who you go with. And then after you've done all that, you've got to

14:35.560 --> 14:41.640
get the word out to people. And marketing is really hard. And our community has a habit

14:41.640 --> 14:47.680
of sneering at marketeers. And there's a small amount of truth in this. Because there are

14:47.680 --> 14:54.480
certainly plenty of people, or plenty of products, I should say, which are basically worthless

14:54.480 --> 14:59.080
but got to be popular because they had good marketing. But, and this is important, not

14:59.080 --> 15:06.440
everything is like that. Yes, you can occasionally make something popular by having a really

15:06.440 --> 15:10.920
strong marketing team, even if the thing itself doesn't deserve popularity. Fine, we can sneer

15:10.920 --> 15:19.360
at celebrities or Dasani water all we like. But the flip side of that is that building

15:19.360 --> 15:24.060
a better mousetrap doesn't work either. The fact that you have better technology does

15:24.060 --> 15:30.440
not ensure that you will be successful. And you do have to do all the other work as well.

15:30.440 --> 15:39.440
The fact is a thing needs to be, or it should be, beautiful and available and viable, as

15:39.440 --> 15:48.200
well as working. And I'd very much like to see the focus of the open source community

15:48.200 --> 15:51.160
shift to making that kind of thing more possible.

15:51.160 --> 15:56.680
I wonder if it's because the open source, you know, our open source community is filled

15:56.680 --> 16:03.720
with, or seemingly filled with generally engineers, and that the slow trickle of people coming

16:03.720 --> 16:10.800
to it now, perhaps are those who are strong in design and marketing, and that maybe there's

16:10.800 --> 16:16.400
a void there in the teams and collaborations that is only now getting filled.

16:16.400 --> 16:24.480
I would certainly agree. Yeah, the history is that way. I've had a bunch of really interesting

16:24.480 --> 16:30.120
conversations about this with Alan Puck, who I know you've already had on, who you've already

16:30.120 --> 16:31.120
had brunch with.

16:31.120 --> 16:32.120
Yes.

16:32.120 --> 16:41.480
One of the things which is my opinion on this, which not everybody shares, is that, yes,

16:41.480 --> 16:48.600
as we came primarily from an engineering background as a community, we tend to overweight engineering

16:48.600 --> 16:54.000
concerns and underweight other things. The flip side of that is historically, if you

16:54.000 --> 16:58.280
look at people who used Macs, they came out of a very designer focused community, which

16:58.280 --> 17:01.680
meant that you got beautiful apps and that kind of thing, which is great. But every now

17:01.680 --> 17:07.080
and again, you'll see an app which converts Celsius to Fahrenheit, and it's a beautiful

17:07.080 --> 17:13.320
app. And someone downloads this app and then runs it on the desktop. And I think to myself,

17:13.320 --> 17:18.320
but that's like one line in a terminal.

17:18.320 --> 17:23.560
Now, there are a couple of things here. The first one is, yes, it's one line for someone

17:23.560 --> 17:30.400
like me. It's not a tall one line for, say, my dad. And that's critically important. There

17:30.400 --> 17:35.200
is the accusation, again, leveled at our community that we tend to be, just open a terminal and

17:35.200 --> 17:42.720
do everything and real people can't do this. And that was historically true. Unfortunately,

17:42.720 --> 17:47.200
it still is true for some parts of our community. I'll give you an example. If I say to someone,

17:47.200 --> 17:52.640
hey, install this piece of software. So, do that by opening a bunch of software center

17:52.640 --> 17:55.280
and then searching for the name of it and then clicking search, you know, like real

17:55.280 --> 17:58.520
people do. You'll get a bunch of feedback saying, why don't you just tell people to

17:58.520 --> 18:02.800
open a terminal and type sudo apt install. Actually, what they'll say is sudo apt get

18:02.800 --> 18:07.600
install, which annoys me. Slight diversion. If you're getting if people are kicking to

18:07.600 --> 18:13.320
use commands, at least use the up-to-date ones rather than the ones from 2006. But anyway,

18:13.320 --> 18:18.840
ignore that. I mean, these days, it might be sudo snap install or sudo flat pack install.

18:18.840 --> 18:26.480
Anyway, there is a certain amount of power in the command line stuff. You shouldn't demand

18:26.480 --> 18:33.280
that people use it. But equally, power users can find this kind of thing more important.

18:33.280 --> 18:37.400
To give you an example, and this harks back slightly to the superhuman thing we were talking

18:37.400 --> 18:41.840
about a moment ago. One of the things that superhuman have done, their email client,

18:41.840 --> 18:46.480
is to give you the ability to run almost any command by giving you a little pop up command

18:46.480 --> 18:50.440
palette, they call it. This is very similar to the command palette that you get in Visual

18:50.440 --> 18:56.560
Studio Code, for example, the editor or Sublime Text, where anything the editor is capable

18:56.560 --> 19:01.120
of doing is available with a little summonable command palette, which gives you basically

19:01.120 --> 19:06.640
a box you can type in to search for a command it can run. Which means that the way a bunch

19:06.640 --> 19:12.280
of these power user tools have managed to make them more suitable to power users here

19:12.280 --> 19:19.440
in 2020 is to put a command line back in. Which is, you know, great. But I think it's

19:19.440 --> 19:26.000
interesting that there is that value in this stuff. But equally, and more importantly,

19:26.000 --> 19:36.800
they're power user tools. So they're not necessarily suitable for an ordinary person. But, and

19:36.800 --> 19:41.680
I'd be interested in your thoughts on this, actually. If you asked a whole bunch of people,

19:41.680 --> 19:49.720
how do I convert 71 Fahrenheit to centigrade? I think what they'd do is they'd open a browser

19:49.720 --> 19:52.800
and type 71 Fahrenheit centigrade into Google.

19:52.800 --> 19:53.800
Yes.

19:53.800 --> 20:01.280
And as far as I can tell, that's a command line command, right? You get a box to type

20:01.280 --> 20:07.640
things into, and you type commands into it in a particular format, and it gives you the

20:07.640 --> 20:14.160
answer. I mean, conceptually, that's quite a lot more like a command line than it is

20:14.160 --> 20:17.360
like a graphical application, isn't it?

20:17.360 --> 20:18.360
Yeah.

20:18.360 --> 20:27.280
But why have we not managed to seize that? Why have we, an engineering led culture, which

20:27.280 --> 20:35.080
Google is as well, why do they get credit for doing that, whereas our community are

20:35.080 --> 20:39.640
decried for occasionally wanting the same thing? So I'd be interested in your thoughts

20:39.640 --> 20:41.120
on that.

20:41.120 --> 20:47.120
Very curious juxtaposition there. I love it. I think what Google got right, and why someone

20:47.120 --> 20:54.940
like me goes to, I don't use Google very much, but why we go to search engines to find such

20:54.940 --> 21:02.440
simple information like that, is that they are a true success in converting a variety

21:02.440 --> 21:07.980
of English or any language really into the answer that we're actually looking for. So

21:07.980 --> 21:13.880
you don't need to be as precise as you would on, say, a classic command line to get the

21:13.880 --> 21:21.600
answer you're looking for. So if you open a command line for any regular user, it's

21:21.600 --> 21:29.220
daunting, I think, for two reasons. One, because you need to be so exact, otherwise the possibility

21:29.220 --> 21:36.200
of screwing something up is quite high, but also that the discoverability in most terminals

21:36.200 --> 21:42.400
is quite awful. You can't just really play easily to discover what you're looking for,

21:42.400 --> 21:47.920
where looking at a search engine, it's very difficult to do anything wrong in a search

21:47.920 --> 21:52.960
engine, and yet you can just play and try things until you get it right, which maybe

21:52.960 --> 21:54.720
we can learn something from that.

21:54.720 --> 22:01.360
I wholeheartedly agree with this, to the point where I went back in time and did a talk about

22:01.360 --> 22:08.920
this at about 10 different conferences last year. So I have talked with UX of text, and

22:08.920 --> 22:15.360
it's about precisely this, the user experience of text interfaces, because two other places

22:15.360 --> 22:21.480
where we're seeing textual interfaces get used outside a terminal and a Google search

22:21.480 --> 22:26.180
box or a DuckDuckGo search box or start page search box, wherever it is you like, two other

22:26.180 --> 22:32.640
places where we see a textual interface used are chat bots on Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp

22:32.640 --> 22:41.480
or Telegram or Discord or whatever it is you use, and secondly, voice assistants. So Google

22:41.480 --> 22:48.960
Home or the Amazon Echo, and those things are essentially textual interfaces. Yes, you

22:48.960 --> 22:55.320
are speaking out loud to them, but you are doing so with words, as opposed to a GUI,

22:55.320 --> 23:00.760
where you're essentially identifying a picture and clicking on it. You point and grunt like

23:00.760 --> 23:09.080
a caveman. One of the things that led us out of caves and created modern society was language,

23:09.080 --> 23:15.440
and the idea that language, that text has a user interface and has user experience and

23:15.440 --> 23:20.320
needs to be optimized is something which the technology community as a whole, not just

23:20.320 --> 23:24.920
the open source, but the whole technology community has slighted rather over the last

23:24.920 --> 23:30.880
40 or 50 years. But there are people who are very good at this, and they are authors and

23:30.880 --> 23:39.320
poets and writers. There's an example in a Neal Stephenson book, Snow Crash, I think

23:39.320 --> 23:46.240
it was, about a woman in the book, and she gives an example of being at a dinner with

23:46.240 --> 23:54.520
her grandmother, and she was, I think, recently pregnant or something along those lines. And

23:54.520 --> 24:02.560
just by saying that, she never mentioned it at all, and her grandmother, wise old woman,

24:02.560 --> 24:08.040
picked up on the nuances of her expression and the kinds of things she was saying and

24:08.040 --> 24:13.280
deduced what had happened without ever having been told. And it's that kind of nuance that

24:13.280 --> 24:17.800
I think is interesting. I'll give you an example. Who's your favorite fiction author?

24:17.800 --> 24:23.160
Hmm. The book that hit me the most that comes to mind first in 1984.

24:23.160 --> 24:26.560
That's a good example. Orwell's a very good example of this, to the point where he wrote

24:26.560 --> 24:30.840
essays about word choice and how to think about things. But that's the thing. If you

24:30.840 --> 24:37.360
think about a book that you've liked, if an author is good at what they do, they can use

24:37.360 --> 24:45.400
one or two words in a way that puts a whole picture into your head, and in a way in which,

24:45.400 --> 24:50.180
in theory, you could use a synonym for any one of those words, and the sentence would

24:50.180 --> 24:53.200
still mean the same thing, but it wouldn't give the same impression. It wouldn't give

24:53.200 --> 24:59.040
you that sense of immersion into the world they're describing. I mean, the holy grail

24:59.040 --> 25:03.000
of this kind of thing is Patrick Rothfuss, for people who are fantasy readers like I

25:03.000 --> 25:10.840
am, who spends an absurd amount of time over word choice and things like that, precisely

25:10.840 --> 25:18.480
because he's hugely aware of the impressions that each individual word gives. To give you

25:18.480 --> 25:24.800
a Rothfuss example, he's describing in The Wise Man's Fear, which is one of his books,

25:24.800 --> 25:31.680
there's a kind of an underground complex, and there's a woman who lives in this underground

25:31.680 --> 25:37.320
complex, and she's a bit weird. Lives down there on her own, doesn't like talking to

25:37.320 --> 25:41.240
people, but she's named all the different areas of this, which is obviously some kind

25:41.240 --> 25:47.240
of ancient, abandoned catacomb with bits of machinery in it and so on.

25:47.240 --> 25:48.240
It sounds lovely.

25:48.240 --> 25:53.040
Yeah, well, you know, I don't think I want to live in it, but then I'm not hour-y. She's

25:53.040 --> 25:58.400
named all the different rooms and different areas of this complex, and they're all named

25:58.400 --> 26:01.720
with things which sound like words, but aren't actually words we know. So a bit is called

26:01.720 --> 26:10.720
downings, and a bit is called cricklet, and one bit is called billows. And each of these

26:10.720 --> 26:15.160
things are evocative in a particular way. If I said to you the word cricklet, it's not

26:15.160 --> 26:20.920
a word that necessarily means something to you, because it's not a word, right?

26:20.920 --> 26:26.720
Yeah, just by hearing it, I can approach perhaps what it might look or feel like.

26:26.720 --> 26:27.720
Yes.

26:27.720 --> 26:31.960
And that's simply with language, which is exactly, I think, your point.

26:31.960 --> 26:36.560
And that is exactly precisely my point. And that's the kind of thing that I'd like to

26:36.560 --> 26:44.400
see people doing more of, thinking about the user experience of text. Think of the amount

26:44.400 --> 26:52.360
of care and attention that goes into a graphic application or a website from a designer.

26:52.360 --> 26:59.240
They'll spend days, weeks, considering things like the flow of the text and how much space

26:59.240 --> 27:03.000
there is in between each individual thing and exactly how rounded the corners should

27:03.000 --> 27:06.720
be. And those people who are listening to this, who have a history in development and

27:06.720 --> 27:13.120
working with design, will probably be aware of the frustration when you build something

27:13.120 --> 27:16.600
and the designer says, but that's not right, because it's really important that these things

27:16.600 --> 27:20.560
are 14 pixels apart, and you've got them 16 pixels apart, and you want to just say, why

27:20.560 --> 27:24.880
does it matter? But the point is it does matter because they're the designers and they understand

27:24.880 --> 27:30.520
this stuff and developers don't as much. So you take their word for it. But that level

27:30.520 --> 27:38.240
of care and attention to detail is just as applicable to text. And that happens in, I

27:38.240 --> 27:45.080
think, two ways. The first one is when you have a conversation with a piece of software,

27:45.080 --> 27:53.560
whether that's an Amazon Echo, or it's a chatbot, or it's, you know, the shell in your terminal,

27:53.560 --> 28:02.560
or it's the Google search box. We need to work out a way of guiding people, as developers,

28:02.560 --> 28:06.840
we need to work out a way of guiding people towards the correct answer without making

28:06.840 --> 28:13.600
it their fault that they don't have the correct answer. Now the terminal, precisely as you

28:13.600 --> 28:19.560
say, if you get something even a tiny bit wrong, it just put in syntax error, get lost.

28:19.560 --> 28:20.560
Computer says no.

28:20.560 --> 28:24.440
Chastises you for wanting to learn or not knowing.

28:24.440 --> 28:32.440
Yeah. And as you say, Google search box, it's almost impossible to do something wrong. Back

28:32.440 --> 28:37.600
when I was a child here in the UK, you had eight bit computers. So the Acorn Electron

28:37.600 --> 28:42.020
and the Single S Spectrum and the Corridor 64 and so on. I know there are different ones

28:42.020 --> 28:46.880
in other countries. But the principle back then, you got a machine, you turned it on,

28:46.880 --> 28:51.240
it booted immediately because all the stuff was in ROM. And then you had a command line.

28:51.240 --> 28:56.400
And that command line was basically a way of entering basic commands. But one of the

28:56.400 --> 29:01.160
things that stuck in my head is, I think this was in the manual, start programming with

29:01.160 --> 29:04.800
the Electron, which is the book you got with the Acorn Electron, which was an extremely

29:04.800 --> 29:11.120
naughty eight bit computer in about 1983. And it said very near the beginning, you can

29:11.120 --> 29:17.200
type anything you want into this, you will not damage your computer. It gave you the

29:17.200 --> 29:22.480
freedom to play, to explore. You think, well, the worst that can happen is that it just

29:22.480 --> 29:27.500
says no. Now admittedly, it had that very command line experience of just printing syntax

29:27.500 --> 29:32.640
error or no or mistake. If you did anything other than exactly what you needed to, which

29:32.640 --> 29:38.920
is why computers didn't take off as much in the 80s as they have done now. I mean, yes,

29:38.920 --> 29:42.560
it's fine. They were popular then. But now everyone on earth has a computer in their

29:42.560 --> 29:51.720
pocket. Was not the case in 1984. But I think putting that level of care and attention into

29:51.720 --> 29:57.880
how to guide people through a conversation in such a way that they feel empowered the

29:57.880 --> 30:01.840
whole time, they feel they're making progress the whole time, but still having them end

30:01.840 --> 30:09.720
up where you, the developer, want them to be. That's a real skill. To take a real world

30:09.720 --> 30:16.560
analogy to this, it's like those of us who've worked in a job will know the experience of

30:16.560 --> 30:23.920
managing your manager. You want your manager to do something, but you can't command them

30:23.920 --> 30:30.240
to do it because they're your boss and you aren't. How would you guide your manager into

30:30.240 --> 30:36.040
ending up at the decision you would like them to make without ever being able to just command

30:36.040 --> 30:43.880
it so? And that skill, which some people are unaware even exists, some people are not very

30:43.880 --> 30:51.140
good at, and some people are spectacularly brilliant at. That skill is one of the skills

30:51.140 --> 30:57.520
that the developers of a user interface need, and especially a textual user interface, whether

30:57.520 --> 31:04.200
that's the Google search box or Amazon Echo. I'm carefully saying Amazon Echo, not the

31:04.200 --> 31:09.640
name of it, because if I say the name of it, then my one will wake up. I don't want it

31:09.640 --> 31:10.640
to.

31:10.640 --> 31:11.640
We don't want that.

31:11.640 --> 31:13.140
We do not.

31:13.140 --> 31:23.200
It's the skill of very gently nudging users into their own perceived successful outcome,

31:23.200 --> 31:28.120
even if you don't know what that outcome is going to be at the onset, which is no small

31:28.120 --> 31:29.120
thing.

31:29.120 --> 31:38.000
Imagine a butler in Victorian England or a lieutenant in the army. Are you a lieutenant

31:38.000 --> 31:39.000
or a lieutenant?

31:39.000 --> 31:47.000
Canadian. Yes. You know, I've heard both. Some military folk is lieutenant, but I've

31:47.000 --> 31:53.480
heard lieutenant repeatedly. So I think, you know, we can't decide whether we're British

31:53.480 --> 31:54.480
or American.

31:54.480 --> 31:58.600
I shall strike one tiny blow for the diminishing island of Albion and say lieutenant for now,

31:58.600 --> 32:04.680
but feel free to correct it in your heads, Americans. So imagine the skill of a lieutenant

32:04.680 --> 32:13.440
not being able to say, no, sir, that's a terrible idea. There's a way of saying, okay, sir,

32:13.440 --> 32:19.200
which gives the impression you really shouldn't do this without actually saying so. And that

32:19.200 --> 32:26.280
sort of vibe, that sort of skill, I think, is really important. So careful word choice,

32:26.280 --> 32:30.720
understanding how to manage your manager, because in this environment, your Amazon Echo

32:30.720 --> 32:39.640
or the Facebook chat bot that you're talking to, to order dinner or pay your taxes or whatever,

32:39.640 --> 32:46.880
it's operating as essentially a butler, a personal assistant, something which is attempting

32:46.880 --> 32:56.400
to guide you into, as you said, to the destination that you want to reach. And this feels to

32:56.400 --> 33:03.460
me like a skill that we, the open source community, ought to be all right at, because we've always

33:03.460 --> 33:10.280
been believers in the power of text. We have, as a community, up until relatively recently

33:10.280 --> 33:14.480
spent all our time sneering at the idea of people who thought the text was a bad thing.

33:14.480 --> 33:23.080
So maybe this is something where we could, as a community, get out ahead of this. But

33:23.080 --> 33:30.080
it does require us to let go of this idea that you've either got it right, or you need

33:30.080 --> 33:35.960
to learn more. The bash command line, not a friendly user interface, exactly as you

33:35.960 --> 33:36.960
said.

33:36.960 --> 33:38.680
And yet the default in many areas.

33:38.680 --> 33:45.160
Yeah, absolutely. And we've got people working on the graphical UI and so on. And I think

33:45.160 --> 33:54.120
a lot of the, or at least a decent proportion of the accusations leveled at our desktops,

33:54.120 --> 33:58.600
that you spend all your time opening a terminal, they are not the truth. They're being leveled

33:58.600 --> 34:05.760
at us by people who've not actually sat down and used Ubuntu, for example, or elementary

34:05.760 --> 34:15.240
or whatever it is you prefer. But I'd like to see us be better at things. And one of

34:15.240 --> 34:20.320
the areas where I do think we ought to be able to steal a march on this is with something

34:20.320 --> 34:29.200
like the Echo, or with chatbots, with textual interfaces, at least partially because we're

34:29.200 --> 34:38.200
not attempting to overcome a massive entrenched victory on someone else's part. Making the

34:38.200 --> 34:43.480
Linux desktop be popular, even if it was literally the best thing that ever existed, will be

34:43.480 --> 34:51.440
hard because we're at 2% and the rest of the market is 98%. Whereas the Echo or Google

34:51.440 --> 34:59.200
Home is essentially untouched ground. There's no one there with any entrenched advantage

34:59.200 --> 35:03.160
other than Amazon and Google themselves, of course. And I'm not talking about building

35:03.160 --> 35:08.880
an alternative to the Echo, I'm talking about building on the Echo as a platform. So this

35:08.880 --> 35:12.760
is not what Mycroft are doing. Mycroft are working away at this and I have one on my

35:12.760 --> 35:19.520
desk and well done to them. But the thing that they don't have, and Amazon do have,

35:19.520 --> 35:26.260
is a billion customers already. But I see no reason why we can't use existing platforms

35:26.260 --> 35:33.080
and then build software on top of them, a way that really exhibits the skills that we

35:33.080 --> 35:43.240
as a community should have. I mean, think about it this way, right? A decent textual

35:43.240 --> 35:48.640
interface needs to be good at two things, doing text and being the underdog and getting

35:48.640 --> 35:53.040
stuff done anyway. And if there's anything more suited to the Linux community, I don't

35:53.040 --> 35:57.440
know what it is. It seems absolutely ideal.

35:57.440 --> 36:03.320
Well, perhaps what you're saying is we've been good at this and yet we've been holding

36:03.320 --> 36:10.160
on to old ideals around these technologies. And so we've got to progress and move on and

36:10.160 --> 36:16.240
use those skills and improve them to be more appropriate for modern times.

36:16.240 --> 36:23.520
This is another one of my people don't necessarily agree with this thought. But I am of the opinion

36:23.520 --> 36:31.760
that our community's worst enemy is itself. There is a reasonable proportion of the community

36:31.760 --> 36:37.840
who are, first of all, louder than everybody else. But secondly, consider it more important

36:37.840 --> 36:48.200
that their rivals in open source lose than the open source as a whole wins. There are

36:48.200 --> 36:54.360
people out there who would rather see open source not become a success if that meant

36:54.360 --> 36:58.920
that Ubuntu were the people who'd done it. They'd rather say, no, we'd rather open source

36:58.920 --> 37:04.040
wasn't a success than have it be successful through a distribution or a piece of software

37:04.040 --> 37:08.040
or a person who they personally don't like.

37:08.040 --> 37:12.920
And I find it infuriating. I mean, we're not alone in this. Other people who feel like

37:12.920 --> 37:22.720
this are, for example, phone manufacturers or phone carriers. If you are T-Mobile, apparently

37:22.720 --> 37:29.840
doing something which means that you win and Vodafone wins and Sprint wins and AT&T wins

37:29.840 --> 37:35.400
is not that important. You're OK with doing things where T-Mobile wins and everyone else

37:35.400 --> 37:36.400
loses.

37:36.400 --> 37:42.220
I'll give you another example. Think about storage formats. You know how Sony every five

37:42.220 --> 37:46.440
minutes would bring out a brand new format which is incompatible with everything else?

37:46.440 --> 37:50.400
And that's because businesses tend to have this thought where they go, we've invented

37:50.400 --> 37:56.480
a new thing. We'd like it to be the massively dominant monopolistic thing in whatever field

37:56.480 --> 38:02.160
it's in because then everyone on Earth buys one and we get $1 every time they do that.

38:02.160 --> 38:07.160
And it normally takes about five years for the four or five different competitors in

38:07.160 --> 38:12.760
that market to say, you know what, maybe we should start cooperating after all. And why

38:12.760 --> 38:16.840
people don't learn the lesson from this and start cooperating on day one because they're

38:16.840 --> 38:21.960
going to eventually anyway escapes me, but they don't.

38:21.960 --> 38:29.320
So this is something which I think our community is guilty of as well. That for everyone who

38:29.320 --> 38:34.120
says, OK, let's build a great new graphical interface that people said, oh, that's because

38:34.120 --> 38:38.760
you hate the command line or why are you doing this in GTK? It's the worst. Or why are we

38:38.760 --> 38:44.900
not building this in Rust? Or Gnome Shell uses JavaScript or KDE's got too many clocks

38:44.900 --> 38:45.900
or whatever.

38:45.900 --> 38:50.120
And it's just, I mean, I hate to sound trite about this, but if you can't find anything

38:50.120 --> 38:54.440
nice to say, don't say anything. Sounds like something one's grandmother might say, but

38:54.440 --> 39:01.720
there's a certain amount of truth in it. Not necessarily because your objection isn't viable,

39:01.720 --> 39:12.440
but because it degrades the viability of open source as a whole in the eyes of the mainstream.

39:12.440 --> 39:20.040
It's a negative externality. So for every time that someone in open source attempts

39:20.040 --> 39:26.080
to do something outreaching and they're clawed down by other people in open source, people

39:26.080 --> 39:30.160
in the outside world don't look at this and go, great, there's a good Darwinian process

39:30.160 --> 39:34.440
going on there and I'll definitely choose whichever one wins. They just go, what the

39:34.440 --> 39:37.840
hell is this? Every time one of these open source things comes up, it just seems to be

39:37.840 --> 39:41.840
an enormous bun fight. I just don't want to be involved in that. And then they go and

39:41.840 --> 39:45.340
buy Windows 10.

39:45.340 --> 39:48.380
Because I mean, yeah, Microsoft might have a bunch of problems, but what they don't do

39:48.380 --> 39:57.720
is fight with themselves about which one of their computers you should buy. I think for

39:57.720 --> 40:01.520
those people who've read Unseen Academicals by Terry Pratchett, this is a crab bucket

40:01.520 --> 40:06.400
thing, where if you've got a bucket full of crabs and one crab tries to crawl out of the

40:06.400 --> 40:08.160
bucket, the other crabs will all pull it down.

40:08.160 --> 40:10.920
What a terrible situation, really.

40:10.920 --> 40:17.280
I know. As far as I can tell, the success we have achieved, we have achieved despite

40:17.280 --> 40:21.920
ourselves or at least despite some of our community. And it makes me sad because I mean,

40:21.920 --> 40:26.920
I was about to say, I've dedicated my life to open source, which sounds way more like

40:26.920 --> 40:30.440
I want to be a martyr than I actually am. And I haven't, because at least some of my

40:30.440 --> 40:35.320
life is dedicated to getting paid, which comes back to a point you made earlier. But I've

40:35.320 --> 40:42.120
certainly spent a lot of my life building, releasing, working with open source software.

40:42.120 --> 40:48.120
I worked for Canonical for five years. I release software to this day. I constantly agitate

40:48.120 --> 40:57.480
for the web to be and remain open. So I have a certain amount of skin in this game, right?

40:57.480 --> 41:05.520
And I'd very much like to see us and our mindset become more successful. But I'd like to see

41:05.520 --> 41:12.720
it become more successful along with the ideals behind it. I mean, if you look at the technology

41:12.720 --> 41:20.720
world outside strictly open source things, most of it is open source. We won that battle.

41:20.720 --> 41:24.680
If you go looking for programmers now, they're all doing JavaScript, right? JavaScript itself

41:24.680 --> 41:32.960
is open source. NPM is the library of JavaScript libraries, the repository of JavaScript libraries,

41:32.960 --> 41:39.200
and that's all open source. People routinely publish their source code on GitHub. We are

41:39.200 --> 41:45.360
now in a world which was unimaginable 20 years ago, where most of the software you need to

41:45.360 --> 41:52.200
use most of the time. You could see the source code if you wanted to. That's great. We won,

41:52.200 --> 41:58.240
you know, but no one seems to be taking a victory lap about that because the last 10%

41:58.240 --> 41:59.240
isn't done.

41:59.240 --> 42:04.640
Are you saying that perhaps many of us and perhaps I should say those that are causing

42:04.640 --> 42:11.200
us issues in our own community are fighting a battle that we've already won? So it's an

42:11.200 --> 42:16.880
outdated mission or effort to try to win that over?

42:16.880 --> 42:20.920
Some people are. Not that many, but there's still enough of them. The sort of people who

42:20.920 --> 42:27.880
still put a dollar sign in the word Microsoft are fighting a battle that was over years

42:27.880 --> 42:31.400
ago. I mean, I don't know whether we won or we lost. It's like asking who won the Cold

42:31.400 --> 42:34.040
War, right?

42:34.040 --> 42:35.040
Nobody did.

42:35.040 --> 42:42.000
Exactly. Either nobody did or everybody did. Difficult question to answer, but the point

42:42.000 --> 42:49.520
is it doesn't matter. Stop litigating the old battles. So yes, since I mentioned Microsoft,

42:49.520 --> 42:56.040
let's take them as an example. They now own GitHub, who now own NPM as of about two days

42:56.040 --> 43:01.520
ago, so being topical. They also produce VS Code, which came from nowhere to be as far

43:01.520 --> 43:06.840
as I can tell the most popular editor around. They're doing a lot of open source stuff more

43:06.840 --> 43:11.960
generally as yours become quite dominant and a lot of the work they're doing there is open.

43:11.960 --> 43:16.880
And there are certainly reasons to take a step back and say, maybe we shouldn't just

43:16.880 --> 43:21.720
stick all our eggs in one basket, especially a basket with the Microsoft logo on it. But

43:21.720 --> 43:28.100
I think that's different from just flat up mistrusting them the whole time without any

43:28.100 --> 43:33.760
way of them proving things to be different. If you find someone who says Microsoft shouldn't

43:33.760 --> 43:37.120
have all this stuff because they're Microsoft and they embrace extended extinguished and

43:37.120 --> 43:42.840
they think Linux is a cancer, you say, well, okay, they did 18 years ago. I get that, right?

43:42.840 --> 43:48.760
What could they do today to prove they're no longer like that? And if the answer is

43:48.760 --> 43:53.920
nothing, then you're not making a rational argument. If the answer is something, then

43:53.920 --> 44:00.160
I mean, for me, it took a while to change this and I still don't fully trust their company

44:00.160 --> 44:04.320
and say, well, I don't fully trust Apple or I don't fully trust Google. You said yourself,

44:04.320 --> 44:09.640
you don't use Google very much because you've presumably taken a stand on this front. And

44:09.640 --> 44:15.760
that's cool. But there are still products they do that I find useful. There are moves

44:15.760 --> 44:22.200
they make that I'm prepared to treat with an open mind. And if there is a list of things

44:22.200 --> 44:29.440
that would convince that what Microsoft are doing is becoming a better company, I'm sure

44:29.440 --> 44:33.320
that some of the things on that list have already been ticked off.

44:33.320 --> 44:34.320
Yeah.

44:34.320 --> 44:36.400
Well, at least one would hope so.

44:36.400 --> 44:43.480
I agree completely. And what more could they do? You know, I think they have been fairly

44:43.480 --> 44:50.340
good stewards of open source in the last few years. And I don't know if you could come

44:50.340 --> 44:54.000
up with a reasonable list and I'd love to hear it if there is one, but a reasonable

44:54.000 --> 44:59.360
list of what they could do better if you kind of look at it from an objective perspective.

44:59.360 --> 45:02.600
Yeah. I mean, I think the key word there is reasonable because there'll be some people

45:02.600 --> 45:05.200
who go, okay, thing number one on the list, open source windows.

45:05.200 --> 45:07.200
But what would that give? That's the question.

45:07.200 --> 45:13.080
Yeah. I mean, it helped wind people quite a lot, I imagine. And there certainly are

45:13.080 --> 45:18.540
a whole bunch of things that the company as a whole do, which I don't particularly like

45:18.540 --> 45:25.580
to this day. And Microsoft is a very big church, right? And certainly some parts of the business

45:25.580 --> 45:34.920
have moved in our direction quite a lot more than others. Try and get open source stuff

45:34.920 --> 45:38.120
working on the Xbox, for example.

45:38.120 --> 45:39.120
Okay.

45:39.120 --> 45:45.920
You know, when Windows Phone was around, attempting to get anybody to even tell you how to send

45:45.920 --> 45:50.920
things to it by USB was close to impossible. But at least there are some parts of the business

45:50.920 --> 45:55.960
who are doing that. And what I want to see is culture change. But I think there is some

45:55.960 --> 46:04.280
value in our community deciding what it is they want to stand for. Because if what you

46:04.280 --> 46:08.840
want to stand for is that you won't work with anything unless it's all completely open source

46:08.840 --> 46:14.440
and you don't like the phone you've got because it has a non-free firmware to run the baseband

46:14.440 --> 46:19.920
control or whatever, then okay, you're making a stand for that and that's great. But it's

46:19.920 --> 46:25.920
fundamentally incompatible with being mainstream. And if you're okay with that, then I'm fine

46:25.920 --> 46:31.960
with that too. But if someone is interested in getting into the mainstream, stop throwing

46:31.960 --> 46:36.460
stones at them because they're pursuing a different goal.

46:36.460 --> 46:37.460
And both are honorable.

46:37.460 --> 46:44.440
Yeah, absolutely. There's no problem with doing either of them. But it feels like, I

46:44.440 --> 46:48.600
don't know, what does it feel like? It's like seeing that the people next door are cooking

46:48.600 --> 46:54.960
a curry and then shouting at them because they're not cooking Chinese food or fish and

46:54.960 --> 47:00.240
chips. And you say, well, there's not one that's any better than any other. I just happen

47:00.240 --> 47:04.560
to fancy that this evening. That's what I wanted. The fact that you happen to prefer

47:04.560 --> 47:14.560
this other food. I mean, that almost captures the absurdity of it to my mind that there's

47:14.560 --> 47:19.760
criticism because they're failing to meet up to goals that the person doing it doesn't

47:19.760 --> 47:21.760
have in the first place.

47:21.760 --> 47:30.640
Well, it's taking someone else's project, ignoring perhaps their intentions for that

47:30.640 --> 47:39.320
project and then throwing it into your own system with your own objectives and seeing

47:39.320 --> 47:44.360
how it doesn't align. But that's completely unfair because it was never designed to align

47:44.360 --> 47:47.960
with your objectives. It was designed to align with theirs.

47:47.960 --> 47:50.880
Yeah, absolutely correct. I completely agree with that.

47:50.880 --> 47:57.840
So Stuart, I would say typically I spend the first part of this conversation getting to

47:57.840 --> 48:05.160
know you a little bit, but we took a single topic and extrapolated it in about 20 different

48:05.160 --> 48:12.800
fascinating angles. And so thank you for that. To give some transparency in my process a

48:12.800 --> 48:17.440
little bit, I usually have this little page in front of me. I talked with Chris on his

48:17.440 --> 48:21.800
podcast, The Chris Last Cast, a bit about my process. But I just have a page here that

48:21.800 --> 48:26.680
I write some notes on for us to maybe dive into during the conversation. And I've crossed

48:26.680 --> 48:35.640
off exactly one out of a list of maybe 20. But I loved all of those directions that we

48:35.640 --> 48:42.000
went in. I think I'm going to need to definitely have you on a few other times to check off

48:42.000 --> 48:44.400
some more items on this list.

48:44.400 --> 48:47.040
I'm fine with that.

48:47.040 --> 48:54.000
Lovely. I will put a question to you and maybe it will hit on some points that we discussed

48:54.000 --> 48:59.080
earlier. Maybe it'll even be a manifesto of sorts. But is there something that you want

48:59.080 --> 49:03.280
to put out to the community? Something you want them to think about? Something you want

49:03.280 --> 49:06.400
them to try or go see or put their energy into?

49:06.400 --> 49:10.080
I have been thinking about this a bit.

49:10.080 --> 49:11.080
Perhaps you have a list.

49:11.080 --> 49:18.800
Well, I kind of do have a list. But I think to be honest with you, the importance of any

49:18.800 --> 49:22.680
list I might have is probably obviated at the moment by the fact that the world is in

49:22.680 --> 49:29.080
a massive crisis. And one of the things I've seen, I've been looking into recently and

49:29.080 --> 49:35.100
hearing people talk about is the number of people who are going to end up disenfranchised

49:35.100 --> 49:42.000
and suffering by the fact that we have a world in lockdown through essentially no fault of

49:42.000 --> 49:46.640
their own. I mean, and I have to put up my hand declare a certain amount of self-interest

49:46.640 --> 49:51.960
here. I work for myself, right? We are currently in a position where because everything's very

49:51.960 --> 49:56.000
uncertain and everyone's very worried and no one really knows what's going on. There

49:56.000 --> 49:59.760
aren't that many people who are saying, you know what we should do? Start this new project

49:59.760 --> 50:04.560
that Man Language was pitching for. But there are an awful lot of people in my position

50:04.560 --> 50:10.360
who are going to increasingly find it difficult to find work and so on. I mean, I have the

50:10.360 --> 50:15.640
advantage that I do a few different things. So I consultant CTO kind of thing, but I also

50:15.640 --> 50:22.660
do development work and I also write for a living. So I'm shading myself more towards

50:22.660 --> 50:28.400
the writing end of things for the moment, because that's easier to convince people that

50:28.400 --> 50:33.520
you want me to write about this thing for you. Here it is. But there are a lot of people

50:33.520 --> 50:40.800
both in our community and out there in the world who run a restaurant or who run a pub

50:40.800 --> 50:47.180
or who run a flower shop who are going to struggle an awful lot. I don't think anyone

50:47.180 --> 50:53.320
knows how long this whole coronavirus crisis is going to go on, but the bite is really

50:53.320 --> 50:57.000
going to start to set in. We're currently about, well, it depends on where you are in

50:57.000 --> 51:02.280
the world, but here in the UK, things went from, oh, blimey, I wonder if the coronavirus

51:02.280 --> 51:06.240
is going to be a problem to, oh my goodness, no one leaves the house in the space of about

51:06.240 --> 51:12.560
three days and that was last weekend. So we're currently about four days into this and it

51:12.560 --> 51:21.560
might last months. So basically what I'd like to ask people to do is kind of be kind. We

51:21.560 --> 51:28.920
as a community, we have a reasonably high proportion of people who work on their own

51:28.920 --> 51:34.680
or live on their own, whose primary contact with people is maybe over the internet. We

51:34.680 --> 51:42.720
have a reasonably high proportion of people who are introverted, who maybe feel more anxious

51:42.720 --> 51:50.000
than others. And it would be lovely to see the depths of love that I've experienced within

51:50.000 --> 51:57.080
our community actually coming out in this fashion. Because for all that I complained

51:57.080 --> 52:07.040
about loud vocal complainy elements of our community earlier, most of it's lovely. I

52:07.040 --> 52:13.720
wouldn't have spent 20, 25 years doing this stuff if it wasn't for the warm embrace of

52:13.720 --> 52:18.920
the community. And one of the things that we are good at, in theory at least, is pulling

52:18.920 --> 52:26.920
together when there are problems, having people's back. And I'd like to see people thinking

52:26.920 --> 52:34.440
of ways to make that happen. So small example, did you see the thing about the 3D printed

52:34.440 --> 52:35.680
respirator valves in Italy?

52:35.680 --> 52:38.960
No, but tell me more. I'm very curious.

52:38.960 --> 52:44.920
So they are having difficulty getting enough respirators. I don't understand the medical

52:44.920 --> 52:48.980
details here. So if I'm explaining this slightly wrong, cut me some slack, medical engineers.

52:48.980 --> 52:55.120
But they need more respirators for people in hospital and they didn't have enough. And

52:55.120 --> 53:00.720
one of the things that we're short on is a particular kind of a valve. So a couple of

53:00.720 --> 53:05.520
people from, as far as I can tell, it's the local maker space, took a 3D printer into

53:05.520 --> 53:10.640
a hospital and then measured one of the valves they already had and then 3D printed a replica

53:10.640 --> 53:15.720
and went, here you go, try it out. And it worked. And so now the hospital's got loads

53:15.720 --> 53:21.280
of valves. Now, there are a bunch of legal issues around this and apparently the people

53:21.280 --> 53:26.380
who make the valves are suing them for it, which we're not going to get into. And obviously

53:26.380 --> 53:33.600
this is a temporary stop gap. And the people who make the real things, you know, are probably

53:33.600 --> 53:38.280
making them to high tolerances and they'll last 10 years rather than a 3D printed one,

53:38.280 --> 53:47.480
which will last a week. But equally, probably a good idea to have a shedload of respirator

53:47.480 --> 53:51.640
valves more than you need, even if they do only last a week because we can 3D print more.

53:51.640 --> 53:59.240
And that kind of thing, I think, is something we're just cutting through the red tape and

53:59.240 --> 54:05.280
being direct, a direct person to person connection. We're good at interoperating with people over

54:05.280 --> 54:12.400
the internet. We're good at seeing places for technology to help humanity. And we talk

54:12.400 --> 54:17.360
a big game about how that's what open source is good at and it's what proprietary companies

54:17.360 --> 54:21.520
are not good at because all they want is money. So this, I think, is our chance to put it

54:21.520 --> 54:28.080
into practice. So look at how your software can help people or how you might build software

54:28.080 --> 54:32.400
that could help people. Check out the members of our community who might need your help,

54:32.400 --> 54:38.280
who might not want to reach out, but would really appreciate just a note saying, hey,

54:38.280 --> 54:41.920
everything okay? You know, I haven't heard from you for a couple of days. Just want to

54:41.920 --> 54:48.800
make sure you stay connected. This is a chance, I think, to demonstrate that we're decent

54:48.800 --> 54:59.280
people, that the underlying ethos of our community about supporting everyone, about making sure

54:59.280 --> 55:06.480
that everyone is included. This is our chance to do it for real. And frankly, the world

55:06.480 --> 55:12.080
needs it. So much as I'd like to say, well, here's this bit of software I've written,

55:12.080 --> 55:19.360
you should all go and download it. I think there are more important things on everyone's

55:19.360 --> 55:24.080
minds and now is maybe the time to put those into practice.

55:24.080 --> 55:30.720
I think you're right. It's our time to shine. So I will put something out there. If anyone

55:30.720 --> 55:36.600
wants to reach out to me and say hi at any point, please do. You can find me either in

55:36.600 --> 55:41.120
the Jupiter Broadcasting Telegram group, which I'll link to. You can find me on Twitter,

55:41.120 --> 55:45.000
which I'll also link to. And just say hi if you want to have a five-minute conversation

55:45.000 --> 55:49.600
or something like that. That's my little gift out there in the world. Stuart, do you have

55:49.600 --> 55:54.800
a place where people can reach you or a place where people can find a community around bad

55:54.800 --> 55:55.800
voltage or otherwise?

55:55.800 --> 56:01.680
Certainly. First of all, I will say exactly the same thing that Brent did. If you just

56:01.680 --> 56:06.160
want to chat to me, check in, that's fine. Just give me a shout, no problem. Places you

56:06.160 --> 56:11.760
can find me, badvoltage is at badvoltage.org and you can get the podcast there. Cool. Download

56:11.760 --> 56:17.640
it, listen to it, you'll like it. Me personally, probably the best couple of places to get

56:17.640 --> 56:24.440
hold of me are either on Twitter where I'm at, S-I-L, SugarIndigoLima. It's the advantage

56:24.440 --> 56:28.440
of Twitter. I think popped up, I think today or yesterday, saying it was my 13th anniversary

56:28.440 --> 56:30.320
on Twitter, which is rather disturbing.

56:30.320 --> 56:31.320
Congratulations.

56:31.320 --> 56:36.280
And then the other way of getting hold of me, or all the other ways of getting hold

56:36.280 --> 56:43.800
of me are via my website, which is Cryogenics.org, K-R-Y-O-G-E-N-I-X.org. There are about a million

56:43.800 --> 56:49.760
different content details there. I write things there. You can get talks that I've done and

56:49.760 --> 56:54.560
things that I've written and work that I've done and people I've worked with and things

56:54.560 --> 56:59.000
like that are all there. But yeah, if you want to get hold of me quickly, Twitter is

56:59.000 --> 57:05.000
the way. If you want to get hold of me more detailed, then my email address is on my website.

57:05.000 --> 57:11.000
I love email, send me email. I hang out in a few Telegram channels, but Twitter is probably

57:11.000 --> 57:12.000
a better way.

57:12.000 --> 57:16.800
Great. Well, Stuart, thank you so much for your time. And as promised, I think you and

57:16.800 --> 57:21.360
I are going to have to do this again to fill out some extra details. So I'm looking forward

57:21.360 --> 57:22.360
to that.

57:22.360 --> 57:29.200
I am more than happy to come back on and use another hour and knock another one thing off

57:29.200 --> 57:33.560
your list. I apologize for that.

57:33.560 --> 57:47.120
That's great. Looking forward to it.
