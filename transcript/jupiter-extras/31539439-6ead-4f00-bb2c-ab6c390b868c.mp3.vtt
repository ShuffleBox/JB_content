WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:15.440
Well, hello, everyone. I'm joined today by Heather Ellsworth. Heather, how are you doing?

00:15.440 --> 00:16.640
I'm well, how are you?

00:16.640 --> 00:24.280
I'm doing good. We got connected through Popey, actually, those who know Alan Pope. He said,

00:24.280 --> 00:28.480
hey, you should really have a chat with Heather. She's pretty darn interesting and would be

00:28.480 --> 00:31.440
a great guest for Brunch with Brent.

00:31.440 --> 00:34.960
Yeah, thanks for having me. I feel very honored.

00:34.960 --> 00:41.240
Yeah, absolutely. Now, I wanted to just give a little taste of sort of the things that

00:41.240 --> 00:46.680
you're doing these days, but we'll dive into a bit of your history in a moment. So I know

00:46.680 --> 00:53.000
a few that you're newly on the canonical team, I guess the Ubuntu desktop team specifically,

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
is that right?

00:54.000 --> 00:59.080
That's right. I've been there for like five months, just about.

00:59.080 --> 01:02.560
Okay. So somewhat fresh, but just finding your feet now.

01:02.560 --> 01:07.240
That's right. Five months and two days, actually. I realize.

01:07.240 --> 01:09.960
Well, happy five month and two day anniversary.

01:09.960 --> 01:14.800
Yeah, I would say that I'm still learning the ropes, but that also means like I'm still

01:14.800 --> 01:19.840
learning that there are more ropes to learn. There's an infinite number of ropes to learn.

01:19.840 --> 01:22.760
The more you learn, the more you realize you don't know.

01:22.760 --> 01:28.080
Yeah, but one nice thing is that everybody at canonical is super nice and down to earth

01:28.080 --> 01:33.640
and happy to answer silly questions for newcomers like myself.

01:33.640 --> 01:37.760
You know, they were all newcomers at one point, too. So I'm sure there's some empathy there.

01:37.760 --> 01:42.440
Yeah, but not everybody usually remembers that. But in this community, it seems like

01:42.440 --> 01:44.120
they do. So that's quite nice.

01:44.120 --> 01:50.660
Oh, nice. Yeah. And I've heard that often of canonical that it's really kind of a human

01:50.660 --> 01:54.040
centric environment. Would you agree with that description?

01:54.040 --> 01:56.420
I would absolutely agree with that. Yeah.

01:56.420 --> 02:03.040
Does that feel nurturing in a way that maybe you haven't experienced in the past?

02:03.040 --> 02:09.960
Yes, definitely. Especially like an open source. I've experienced kind of both spectrums where

02:09.960 --> 02:15.440
some people can be quite antagonistic and mean unnecessarily. And it's just kind of

02:15.440 --> 02:21.560
like, why? And then it's really nice to be surrounded by people that are the opposite

02:21.560 --> 02:28.480
that are happy to help and happy to chat, especially being like in a remote position

02:28.480 --> 02:34.480
where sometimes you can feel isolated and siloed, get frustrated on your own. So it's

02:34.480 --> 02:39.640
nice to have that sort of base that you can reach out to.

02:39.640 --> 02:45.000
Sounds like a really strong support system, really, that allows you to do your best work.

02:45.000 --> 02:50.420
I would imagine on the flip side when there's that antagonistic environment, how then can

02:50.420 --> 02:53.480
you do your best work if you're sort of surrounded by that energy?

02:53.480 --> 03:00.600
Yeah. I tend to mirror the energy that I experience. So if someone's going to be a jerk to me,

03:00.600 --> 03:06.100
I am going to push it right back because that's kind of what you have to do. Like that's,

03:06.100 --> 03:10.440
you know, a thick skin bounces stuff off, right?

03:10.440 --> 03:19.480
Well, it's important to defend yourself. Like I tend to be quite conflict avoiding, I would

03:19.480 --> 03:21.120
say in general.

03:21.120 --> 03:23.440
Oh yeah, me too.

03:23.440 --> 03:28.440
That has been my nature and it sounds like yours too. And certainly my parents are sort

03:28.440 --> 03:34.680
of that way. And I've observed that in myself as being a really nice trait, but not a hundred

03:34.680 --> 03:35.680
percent of the time.

03:35.680 --> 03:39.080
Yeah. It's not good to be too squishy.

03:39.080 --> 03:42.960
Thank you for describing me as squishy.

03:42.960 --> 03:47.280
I think I'm squishy sometimes. If someone that's more experienced than I comes and says

03:47.280 --> 03:50.920
like, oh no, you have to do it this way. I say, oh, okay. Yeah. You're more experienced.

03:50.920 --> 03:54.760
I believe you. And then if someone else comes along and says, oh no, don't do it. That person

03:54.760 --> 04:01.160
says, well, dang it. I don't know what else to do.

04:01.160 --> 04:02.160
Tricky, eh?

04:02.160 --> 04:09.800
Yeah. But I find that the community at Canonical has been really helpful and in all ways. So

04:09.800 --> 04:11.920
I am very happy to be there.

04:11.920 --> 04:18.120
Lovely. Well, that sounds amazing. And how was the onboarding for you? Cause I know you're

04:18.120 --> 04:23.320
working remotely, so at a distance, but you're also a huge like time zone difference. So

04:23.320 --> 04:26.040
was that kind of an adjustment as well?

04:26.040 --> 04:32.440
Not so much because my previous role was a time adjustment as well. I mean, at least

04:32.440 --> 04:36.520
in this role, there is another person on my team that is in the US.

04:36.520 --> 04:37.520
You're not the only one.

04:37.520 --> 04:44.080
Yeah. Right. Whereas in my last team, well, no, I guess there was someone in the US, but

04:44.080 --> 04:51.320
most of the people I worked with were in Germany. So the central European standard of time.

04:51.320 --> 04:55.200
And now it's a little bit better. So I used to have a lot of meetings that started at

04:55.200 --> 05:02.080
like 7am and I'm not a super morning person. So it's hard to be like caffeinated and ready

05:02.080 --> 05:09.640
to like run meetings by seven. So now I have to, you know, it's more of like an eight to

05:09.640 --> 05:13.400
five thing. It's much more comfortable.

05:13.400 --> 05:17.080
So why don't you guide us through what you do at Canonical?

05:17.080 --> 05:23.880
Yeah. So I was hired to work on snaps. If your listeners don't know what snaps are,

05:23.880 --> 05:29.640
there's a lot of documentation out there, but it's basically a containerized application

05:29.640 --> 05:39.240
system. And it's really kind of fun to just like write metadata to snap things. That's

05:39.240 --> 05:47.160
how it started, but then it quickly led to improving the snap craft build tool itself

05:47.160 --> 05:56.600
and adding an extension to make snapping gnome snaps a lot easier since I am a devout gnome

05:56.600 --> 06:02.880
user and I'm a gnome foundation member and I love gnome. So I've been kind of working

06:02.880 --> 06:09.420
in this like snap and snap craft space. And then there was a need for someone to take

06:09.420 --> 06:14.880
on the maintainership of LibreOffice. So I said I would happily do that, not really knowing

06:14.880 --> 06:18.240
what I was signing up for.

06:18.240 --> 06:23.120
Sometimes the best things we run into are the things where you just kind of take a chance,

06:23.120 --> 06:24.120
right?

06:24.120 --> 06:31.000
Yeah. My life motto has always been like, how hard can it be? Sometimes it's gotten

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
me into trouble.

06:32.000 --> 06:36.200
And yet I imagine that also stretches you in a bunch of ways.

06:36.200 --> 06:42.040
Yeah, definitely. I learned so much having that attitude. I am still learning a lot about

06:42.040 --> 06:50.360
LibreOffice and I still want to call it OpenOffice. It seems like a new bug is opened about that

06:50.360 --> 06:55.400
every day. So it's like every day I'm like, oh, how do I reproduce that? How do I do that?

06:55.400 --> 07:02.440
I don't know. So that's what I'm doing now. Yeah. Kind of snap stuff and helping out with

07:02.440 --> 07:03.440
LibreOffice.

07:03.440 --> 07:06.000
LibreOffice seems like a big project.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.200
It is a beast. Yeah.

07:09.200 --> 07:16.440
I was being kind. And so I would imagine then that people must look quite fondly at the

07:16.440 --> 07:21.000
work that you've done in the past to give you that kind of responsibility.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.400
I sure hope so. Either that or they're desperate or some sort of combination.

07:24.400 --> 07:30.800
I was going to say, how's that feeling?

07:30.800 --> 07:36.040
But I can tell you that I do my best every day, whatever the problem is I'm working on,

07:36.040 --> 07:42.320
whether it's snap stuff or LibreOffice. And it probably looks like I'm kind of slow, but

07:42.320 --> 07:48.680
I've been here five months and I'm still learning the infinite ropes. So I'm slowly but surely

07:48.680 --> 07:55.520
I will master this. It's funny because I'm really competitive. And when LibreOffice was

07:55.520 --> 08:03.240
handed over to me, my boss said, hey, it's being handed to you in a pretty good state.

08:03.240 --> 08:11.760
And I thought, oh, this is a good state. And I made note that there are 372 bugs. One day

08:11.760 --> 08:17.080
I'm sure I will hand this off and I want to make sure that there's less than 372 bugs.

08:17.080 --> 08:21.920
And if I do, then I will feel like I have won somehow.

08:21.920 --> 08:23.680
That's your own internal metric?

08:23.680 --> 08:29.960
Yes. Yes, absolutely. I like to win. I like to set goals. I don't know, just all over

08:29.960 --> 08:37.080
the place. I'm a big planner and goal setter. And I mean, I track all kinds of like metrics

08:37.080 --> 08:40.280
in my personal life just for the heck of it.

08:40.280 --> 08:41.280
Can you give us a few?

08:41.280 --> 08:50.520
Yeah, I like to just try and measure things, random things, seemingly.

08:50.520 --> 08:52.000
They must be measured somehow.

08:52.000 --> 08:58.280
Yeah, yeah. But like, like coffee. I guess it's been a couple of years ago. So I buy

08:58.280 --> 09:02.360
my coffee in bulk and I love my coffee and I drink the same amount of coffee every day.

09:02.360 --> 09:11.200
So I wanted to know how much does a cup of coffee cost me every day? I'm happy to pay

09:11.200 --> 09:17.680
too much for bulk, delicious coffee. But I wanted to know like how much cheaper is it

09:17.680 --> 09:24.960
than like if I were to go to whatever local coffee shop and get a black coffee. And so

09:24.960 --> 09:32.640
yeah, I did this for like three-ish months and it turns out it costs 80 cents a day.

09:32.640 --> 09:37.880
Now 80 cents, is that 80 cents total or 80 cents more than the other option?

09:37.880 --> 09:43.360
Nope, that's 80 cents total. So when I do go to coffee shops, when I'm, you know, when

09:43.360 --> 09:50.960
I need to get out of the house, you know, a cup of black coffee is about $3. So it's

09:50.960 --> 09:57.280
a lot cheaper. And even if it wasn't cheaper, I probably wouldn't go to a coffee shop every

09:57.280 --> 10:02.560
day just cause that's more of a commute than I'm used to. Just walking downstairs.

10:02.560 --> 10:06.040
Yeah, I'm with you on that one.

10:06.040 --> 10:13.120
When I was in grad school, I did a more complicated measurement on the milk. So, you know, I always

10:13.120 --> 10:19.600
have milk around and I wanted to know like, you know, the sell by date. Is that really

10:19.600 --> 10:26.000
when I should stop drinking the milk or, so I measured all kinds of things about like

10:26.000 --> 10:33.080
when I opened the milk relative to when the sell by date was. And I had sort of a flavor

10:33.080 --> 10:36.720
like numerical profile I would attach to every day.

10:36.720 --> 10:38.840
I'm loving this.

10:38.840 --> 10:45.800
Yeah, I just, so I did this for like only maybe a month or so because it was kind of

10:45.800 --> 10:53.000
intense and I was a grad student and I didn't have time to do that. And yeah, so I stopped

10:53.000 --> 10:55.240
drinking milk exactly at the sell by date.

10:55.240 --> 10:59.440
There you go, listeners. You don't have to do that for yourself.

10:59.440 --> 11:03.880
I just enjoy taking notes about little things in my life like that.

11:03.880 --> 11:07.800
Oh, it sounds like you're optimizing in many ways, right? And then you don't have to think

11:07.800 --> 11:13.000
about that topic at all forever unless something drastic changes.

11:13.000 --> 11:18.120
That's right. I love efficiency, so.

11:18.120 --> 11:23.400
Now that process you just described sounds quite scientific to me and I know that you

11:23.400 --> 11:28.240
have a scientific background. So can you walk us through that background?

11:28.240 --> 11:34.240
I'm a software engineer, but I didn't take any computer science classes. I am a physicist

11:34.240 --> 11:35.320
by trade.

11:35.320 --> 11:36.920
It all makes sense now.

11:36.920 --> 11:45.320
Yeah, I did my bachelors in physics and then I did my masters in high energy physics, experimental

11:45.320 --> 11:53.440
high energy physics. I'm not a theorist. And I worked at CERN for a year while I did that.

11:53.440 --> 12:01.640
Yeah, no, that was amazing. I lived in France, just on the French Swiss border, rode my bike

12:01.640 --> 12:05.920
to CERN every day, worked in building 42.

12:05.920 --> 12:07.440
That sounds so romantic.

12:07.440 --> 12:15.920
It was lovely. I worked on the ATLAS detector, so I could talk for hours about high energy

12:15.920 --> 12:23.080
physics, but I think we don't have that kind of time. But what I did was I worked on a

12:23.080 --> 12:32.240
piece of the detector that didn't have a good protection from the radiation. So the signal

12:32.240 --> 12:39.480
going through each of those kind of areas was not usable. So I came up with a scheme

12:39.480 --> 12:45.520
to calibrate those so that the energy that went through those sections could be actually

12:45.520 --> 12:52.720
used towards finding the Higgs. So I was lucky enough to be a published author on the Higgs

12:52.720 --> 12:56.840
paper among 3000 other physicists.

12:56.840 --> 13:01.360
That seems pretty cool. That's like world class stuff. And when you say Higgs, for those

13:01.360 --> 13:02.960
who don't know the shorthand, that would be?

13:02.960 --> 13:05.040
Oh, right. Higgs boson.

13:05.040 --> 13:11.040
When that was sort of just all happening. Man, did I ever throw myself into a whole

13:11.040 --> 13:14.960
bunch of reading all about that. And it's so fascinating. Like, you have a certain perspective

13:14.960 --> 13:20.560
of it. But, you know, as someone in the public, it was still really quite exciting. Some of

13:20.560 --> 13:25.240
the discoveries that are happening at CERN and around the Higgs, especially, it seemed

13:25.240 --> 13:26.440
like a really cool time.

13:26.440 --> 13:30.640
I still follow, you know, the physics that comes out of CERN specifically. I mean, it's

13:30.640 --> 13:37.600
quite interesting. And I just love physics. But so when I was doing my master's, that's

13:37.600 --> 13:43.800
when I learned how to write some code because you had lots of data coming through the detector

13:43.800 --> 13:50.320
every day and that had to be analyzed. And you're kind of racing against, you know, the

13:50.320 --> 13:55.240
other general purpose detector, which is CMS. And so there's like a healthy rivalry there.

13:55.240 --> 13:57.680
Of course, ATLAS is objectively the best.

13:57.680 --> 13:58.680
Perfect for you.

13:58.680 --> 14:05.320
Yeah. There was a lot of kind of statistics. Well, a lot of similar things actually with

14:05.320 --> 14:10.480
what goes on in machine learning today. You know, there was a lot of data. My advisor

14:10.480 --> 14:16.920
was just like, write some C code to make these plots. And you got to, you know, just figure

14:16.920 --> 14:20.560
it out. So I Googled my way to writing some working C code.

14:20.560 --> 14:21.560
Wow.

14:21.560 --> 14:27.320
I hated it at first, but after I was able to actually do things with it, I really loved

14:27.320 --> 14:34.360
it. And then after I graduated, I started my PhD in physics. But after one semester

14:34.360 --> 14:40.040
I was like, you know what? I think I'm good on grad school and feeling constantly guilty

14:40.040 --> 14:48.640
that I'm not working 24 hours a day. So I went and got a job writing Perl tests at HP.

14:48.640 --> 14:49.640
Really?

14:49.640 --> 14:50.640
Yeah.

14:50.640 --> 14:51.640
Sounds cool.

14:51.640 --> 15:01.680
So I was happy to do that for several reasons. I mean, I am from Texas. And then I moved

15:01.680 --> 15:08.960
to Colorado to start my PhD and the town I lived in, which was Fort Collins was absolutely

15:08.960 --> 15:16.600
amazing and I didn't want to leave. And so it was nice to be able to stay in Fort Collins

15:16.600 --> 15:25.400
and have a job making real person money and have time to like read books for leisure and,

15:25.400 --> 15:32.760
you know, pursue hobbies and that kind of thing. And I don't miss school. However, I

15:32.760 --> 15:39.760
do miss doing math on a daily basis. Just pages of math was so much fun. Oh my God.

15:39.760 --> 15:46.440
There are so many of the inclinations that you're describing in yourself, like your love

15:46.440 --> 15:54.840
of math and deep interest in physics and in measuring things that is of course like multi

15:54.840 --> 16:02.060
disciplinary benefits. So I could see how those would translate into what you're doing

16:02.060 --> 16:07.160
now in a really beautiful way, even if, you know, clearly there's a little bit less math,

16:07.160 --> 16:12.180
but a lot of those principles still carry over in a, in a really beautiful way. So at

16:12.180 --> 16:16.720
least you're still using some of it in many ways.

16:16.720 --> 16:21.080
Absolutely. I think that computer science is a little bit more of a challenge relative

16:21.080 --> 16:27.920
to physics because physics is very much recipes. Here's a recipe to do a thing. You follow

16:27.920 --> 16:33.880
that recipe and discovering recipes to do things. But in computer science, there's like

16:33.880 --> 16:41.840
multiple ways to do one thing. Like how to make a Debian package. Well, it kind of depends

16:41.840 --> 16:47.600
on some things, you know, how does that project do things? Do they use get build package or

16:47.600 --> 16:55.040
maybe they use, you know, pristine tar balls or just Deb build or P builder or who knows,

16:55.040 --> 16:56.040
like

16:56.040 --> 17:02.520
But could those not be described as like a variety of recipes or at least like sub recipes

17:02.520 --> 17:04.000
to a greater recipe?

17:04.000 --> 17:07.880
Definitely. But then it's all about kind of determining what recipe you need to do to

17:07.880 --> 17:14.080
solve this problem. Instead of like in physics, it's like, here's your recipe to this.

17:14.080 --> 17:17.040
But is that only because someone else has figured the recipe out for you? Like in some

17:17.040 --> 17:22.080
of your research in physics, I would imagine like that would still be an unknown.

17:22.080 --> 17:29.640
Yeah. I think, you know, the research in physics, um, you're always asking yourself a question,

17:29.640 --> 17:34.120
at least in my experience, I was asking a question, you know, I want to answer this

17:34.120 --> 17:41.900
particular thing with this data set. So what plots, what graphs, you know, can I make to

17:41.900 --> 17:47.960
answer that? And then that answer would always lead to another question that always involved

17:47.960 --> 17:53.620
making more plots based on the data to answer that question. And so it was just like a linear

17:53.620 --> 18:00.800
trail of questions. It was a lot of fun. Yeah. I quite enjoyed it. Sometimes I wish, you

18:00.800 --> 18:05.640
know, I'd had more of a traditional computer science background, but I had so much fun

18:05.640 --> 18:11.600
in physics, especially getting to, you know, work at CERN that I, I don't think I would

18:11.600 --> 18:13.480
take it back for anything.

18:13.480 --> 18:18.640
Why do you say that sometimes you could see a more traditional path as helpful? Like what

18:18.640 --> 18:23.000
is it about that traditional path that you feel like you're, you've missed out on or

18:23.000 --> 18:24.400
that you would benefit from?

18:24.400 --> 18:31.040
Just, there's like foundational concepts I've come across in the last, I guess I've

18:31.040 --> 18:33.720
been a software engineer for like nine years now.

18:33.720 --> 18:35.760
Congratulations. That's awesome.

18:35.760 --> 18:43.240
Oh yeah. Thanks. Yeah. Like there's, there's just been several times over that nine years

18:43.240 --> 18:49.960
where I've, you know, having some piece of fundamental computer science knowledge would

18:49.960 --> 18:56.920
have really helped me out because I didn't have that. Then it was a bit more of a struggle

18:56.920 --> 19:04.840
and maybe a little frustrating to get there. But that's kind of why I like to write documentation

19:04.840 --> 19:11.040
so that I can help myself learn those things and kind of build up that foundational knowledge,

19:11.040 --> 19:12.200
even if it's a little late.

19:12.200 --> 19:16.860
Right. Because with documentation, you have to sort of understand the underlying principles

19:16.860 --> 19:20.600
in order to communicate effectively. So self-serving. Interesting.

19:20.600 --> 19:25.560
Yeah, that's right. I mean, everything we do is self-serving.

19:25.560 --> 19:30.480
Fair enough. Fair enough. Even if we don't want to admit it.

19:30.480 --> 19:31.480
Right. Yes.

19:31.480 --> 19:37.040
But you were saying, yeah, learning it yourself, like in order to teach someone else, you have

19:37.040 --> 19:38.040
to learn it yourself.

19:38.040 --> 19:45.000
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I learned a lot of physics just by teaching labs to undergrads. You know,

19:45.000 --> 19:49.560
they would ask questions and be like, oh, well, that's a good question. I will go find

19:49.560 --> 19:53.880
that out. Like just to be able to explain, you know, the concept. This is what today's

19:53.880 --> 20:02.800
lab is about. You know, when you're preparing for things like that, it leads you to do some

20:02.800 --> 20:07.160
more research to understand maybe some finer points that you weren't so sure on.

20:07.160 --> 20:16.160
How would you describe either similar or different the creative space in either realm? Like because

20:16.160 --> 20:23.640
there's, as you know, quite a lot of creativity in software, but there's also quite a lot

20:23.640 --> 20:28.920
of creativity. I have some friends who are, well, you included, but some other friends

20:28.920 --> 20:35.840
who are also deeply in the physics realm. Do you find that creativity to be similar

20:35.840 --> 20:38.320
or complimentary or is it totally different?

20:38.320 --> 20:45.160
Yeah, I guess it is similar. I mean, it is like the creativity comes from the logic and

20:45.160 --> 20:51.760
the logic, you know, they're both logical things, computer science and physics, although

20:51.760 --> 20:57.640
sometimes one or both of those might seem a little illogical, but there's definitely

20:57.640 --> 21:05.560
some method to the madness. So yeah, I think that they are quite similar in their creativity.

21:05.560 --> 21:13.040
I certainly get creative whenever I just write some code, especially like if I'm doing it

21:13.040 --> 21:22.120
at home for personal use or something. I'm not the kind of programmer that seeks to write

21:22.120 --> 21:29.600
the tightest code in the world. I'm a physicist programmer and what we do is we write code

21:29.600 --> 21:30.800
that works.

21:30.800 --> 21:32.720
To get you to the next point, right?

21:32.720 --> 21:41.040
Yeah. So a couple of jobs ago I was writing some Python tests and this coworker was kind

21:41.040 --> 21:45.120
of looking over this function I had written and he was like, oh, you could do these like

21:45.120 --> 21:53.160
four lines in like two lines. And I was like, so? Like, I really don't care. Ain't nobody

21:53.160 --> 21:58.280
got time for that. Like this works. Let's move on. As long as there's not some like,

21:58.280 --> 22:04.200
you know, major performance hit then. Yeah. In my development experience, and you're

22:04.200 --> 22:09.360
going to agree with this, I know already, and it's true of my background in photography

22:09.360 --> 22:18.960
and perhaps even yours in physics, but it's, there's something essential about like gleaning

22:18.960 --> 22:26.520
when you need to compromise. So when is, you know, really elegant code important, you know,

22:26.520 --> 22:30.880
in terms of performance would be a perfect example. But then there's also something to

22:30.880 --> 22:36.360
be said for your own development time and energy and creativity, right? So if you got

22:36.360 --> 22:40.360
four lines that work as well as those two lines and that's not really going to have

22:40.360 --> 22:45.960
any, you know, play a different role, then maybe there is more value in just moving on

22:45.960 --> 22:51.080
and working on the next, you know, the next four lines. That's an area that fascinates

22:51.080 --> 22:59.280
me is in my trying to break my own leanings towards perfectionism is knowing when enough

22:59.280 --> 23:05.160
is good enough, you know, like, like a B plus is maybe enough in this case. And maybe the

23:05.160 --> 23:08.560
true skill is knowing how to evaluate that for each situation.

23:08.560 --> 23:14.860
Yeah, I do agree. I mean, I could play the devil's advocate and say that I could see

23:14.860 --> 23:20.000
an argument for the other side that would give you an opportunity to learn the language

23:20.000 --> 23:25.520
a little bit better to learn this, you know, maybe a new feature of the language. I'm not

23:25.520 --> 23:32.120
going to learn that unless I don't use it. But I tend to kind of barrel through things

23:32.120 --> 23:38.360
as you know, I want to get to my goal as quickly as possible. Maybe that goes back to the competitive

23:38.360 --> 23:46.360
thing. But yeah, so I just want to write something that works and then move on. That's yeah,

23:46.360 --> 23:51.560
that's typically how I approach things. I think what's lovely is that there are so

23:51.560 --> 23:59.360
many different types of us right of people and approaches to solving problems. So I would

23:59.360 --> 24:05.240
imagine in an open source environment, having several people looking at some code, and I

24:05.240 --> 24:08.720
don't know if that's your experience, but having several different types of people looking

24:08.720 --> 24:14.400
at the same code might be helpful in that way, because you'd have, for instance, you

24:14.400 --> 24:19.560
who barrels through as you suggested, but solves the problem and then someone else who

24:19.560 --> 24:25.960
comes through behind you and just maybe, I don't want to say clean it up, because that's

24:25.960 --> 24:31.280
that's kind of suggest that that what you've written is sort of under a negative light,

24:31.280 --> 24:37.200
but just maybe add some elegance or performance to that kind of stuff.

24:37.200 --> 24:44.640
Definitely. I mean, diversity is important in all aspects of our life. So yeah, I mean,

24:44.640 --> 24:51.820
having more eyes on code by all walks of life is always a good thing.

24:51.820 --> 25:01.020
And that brings me back to your mentioning how you wish sometimes that you had that sort

25:01.020 --> 25:07.440
of classic computer science background, because I think there is an argument to the benefits

25:07.440 --> 25:11.760
of not having that, you know, you look at problems a little differently than someone

25:11.760 --> 25:18.040
who's, I'll call it classically trained, but someone who's gone through the standard learning

25:18.040 --> 25:23.880
path may be trained to see problems a certain way, but that diversity that you're bringing

25:23.880 --> 25:28.640
from not having that might also be a benefit. So don't be too hard on yourself.

25:28.640 --> 25:35.440
That's a good point. No, that's a good point. I mean, and I think honestly that employers

25:35.440 --> 25:44.680
have seen that maybe before I have, because they say, oh, a physicist. And I'm like, hang

25:44.680 --> 25:49.200
on there. You know, I'm not like a genius or anything. Just anybody can study physics.

25:49.200 --> 25:50.200
You say that.

25:50.200 --> 25:58.000
In physics, we make things sound harder than they really are. We like to use complicated

25:58.000 --> 26:06.860
terms like calorimeter and, you know, boson. We actually read an article the other day

26:06.860 --> 26:12.600
about how scientists like to do that. They like to, you know, jargon things up to make

26:12.600 --> 26:18.380
it sound fancy. But when the layman reads, you know, a scientific article or something

26:18.380 --> 26:25.640
with that jargon, it actually deters them from wanting to pursue science in general.

26:25.640 --> 26:27.000
That's unfortunate.

26:27.000 --> 26:31.200
That's a challenge, isn't it? Because I see that in my photography realm as well, is that

26:31.200 --> 26:36.480
there's all these terms that are very helpful if you're sort of deep in that topic because

26:36.480 --> 26:43.520
it points to a very specific, I don't know, instrument or concept, for instance. But you're

26:43.520 --> 26:52.120
right. It does push some distance between maybe the, I'll call it the uninitiated to

26:52.120 --> 26:55.480
approach those topics. And I imagine that's true in software as well.

26:55.480 --> 27:03.400
Yeah. I mean, I think people in general like to create a niche little space for them and

27:03.400 --> 27:04.840
their kind, right? Like...

27:04.840 --> 27:05.840
It's our tribe.

27:05.840 --> 27:12.120
Yeah, it's our tribe. Exactly. It makes it feel special and exclusive. But that's a double

27:12.120 --> 27:14.320
edged sword, right? So...

27:14.320 --> 27:19.480
Maybe it's the role of documentation to sort of guide people from one realm to the other.

27:19.480 --> 27:26.880
Yeah. Yeah. I think documentation is such a key of communication. I write all kinds

27:26.880 --> 27:32.860
of documentation for myself, especially if I have to learn something new, then I want

27:32.860 --> 27:38.340
to write everything down. That way I can hand it off to someone and not have to remember

27:38.340 --> 27:45.000
anything about it or come back to it in six months and be able to pick it back up pretty

27:45.000 --> 27:51.960
quickly. So anytime I'm learning something new, I write a ton of like personal documentation

27:51.960 --> 27:57.720
and it feels so good. It feels like I don't have to remember this. So if I go to sleep,

27:57.720 --> 28:00.940
you know, tonight and then the morning I'm like, oh yeah, what was that command? I can

28:00.940 --> 28:02.380
just go look at it.

28:02.380 --> 28:08.400
And so you find the time dedicated to documenting worthwhile in the end?

28:08.400 --> 28:16.600
100%. Maybe that's why I am kind of slower when I do things because I make sure to document

28:16.600 --> 28:25.040
alongside at the same time. I just need it. Like it's cathartic and it helps me when I

28:25.040 --> 28:34.080
need to refer back to it. I find, you know, projects that have good documentation. I think

28:34.080 --> 28:38.760
like, I wonder who wrote this. I would like to meet that person. They did a very good

28:38.760 --> 28:42.720
job. I would like to buy them a beer, you know?

28:42.720 --> 28:49.600
I've heard repeatedly the value of documentation and yet so often the people who write good

28:49.600 --> 28:53.000
documentation are sort of hidden away in the shadows.

28:53.000 --> 28:59.400
Not everybody loves it and I don't understand that, but I do love it and I am definitely

28:59.400 --> 29:04.500
going to continue to write documentation.

29:04.500 --> 29:06.600
Thank you for loving it. We need people like you.

29:06.600 --> 29:11.720
Yeah, sure. I enjoy it. So it's win-win.

29:11.720 --> 29:16.720
Can I ask you about your personal documentation infrastructure?

29:16.720 --> 29:17.720
Sure.

29:17.720 --> 29:24.320
Like how do you capture these things and how are you storing them long-term, et cetera,

29:24.320 --> 29:25.320
et cetera?

29:25.320 --> 29:33.400
Well, there's an application that I absolutely love. I've been using Cherry Tree for about

29:33.400 --> 29:41.360
nine years. I found it when I found software engineering. And it's kind of like OneNote,

29:41.360 --> 29:47.840
but for Linux and it's very simple and amazing. And so I absolutely love this project. I've

29:47.840 --> 29:55.480
actually told several people, converted several people to be Cherry Tree users, snapped it.

29:55.480 --> 29:57.000
It's in the Snap Store.

29:57.000 --> 29:58.000
Also self-serving.

29:58.000 --> 30:01.080
I can't live without it. It's fantastic.

30:01.080 --> 30:02.080
Oh, wow.

30:02.080 --> 30:10.920
Yeah. So I use Cherry Tree daily for like, well, really for everything. But I like to

30:10.920 --> 30:17.520
take a lot of notes on what I do with my workday every day, just to kind of make sure that

30:17.520 --> 30:20.920
I'm capturing the work that I do, that I can communicate that.

30:20.920 --> 30:24.360
So tracking your progress through time?

30:24.360 --> 30:28.840
Tracking my progress. Yeah. And kind of make a summary every week to share that with my

30:28.840 --> 30:35.180
coworkers. But also I have another Cherry Tree document that's just like full of how-tos.

30:35.180 --> 30:42.820
So yeah, it's just been growing over the years. The way I write documentation is very similar

30:42.820 --> 30:50.240
to Markdown. But yeah, it's really a rich text editor that I just love.

30:50.240 --> 30:53.360
So I've not heard of Cherry Tree. I'm going to dive into it because this is a topic I

30:53.360 --> 30:58.780
really like, this sort of personal documentation stuff. And I'm a huge believer and have been

30:58.780 --> 31:05.940
for many years. But what's the underlying infrastructure? Is this being synced to various

31:05.940 --> 31:10.260
devices of yours or is it just at a single workstation?

31:10.260 --> 31:15.880
It's on my workstation, but I have a hacky script to kind of sync it on my devices.

31:15.880 --> 31:17.880
It's a B plus script, it sounds like.

31:17.880 --> 31:25.760
Yeah, I mean, it works, right? So whenever I am using my laptop, I can just run this

31:25.760 --> 31:34.240
little script and it'll grab the latest changes. There's no like mobile Cherry Tree. So I am

31:34.240 --> 31:40.860
at a loss with my phone. I have to email myself things to put in Cherry Tree.

31:40.860 --> 31:42.740
It sounds like something you wish existed.

31:42.740 --> 31:50.200
Oh my God, yes. Yes. Well, I mean, once I have a Linux phone, then...

31:50.200 --> 31:51.740
It's coming.

31:51.740 --> 31:54.020
I know.

31:54.020 --> 31:59.060
So maybe that's actually a really nice segue. I wanted to ask you a little bit more about

31:59.060 --> 32:06.220
your documentation in the professional realm. And I know you've spent some time at Purism

32:06.220 --> 32:10.180
doing some documentation stuff there. Can you walk us through that a little bit?

32:10.180 --> 32:17.540
Before Purism, I was just writing, you know, how-tos for myself, for other coworkers. And

32:17.540 --> 32:25.780
I was browsing Reddit one day and I saw that the Librem 5 project was launched and dove

32:25.780 --> 32:35.540
into that and applied for a job and was really happy to be hired as the documentation engineer.

32:35.540 --> 32:36.540
Amazing.

32:36.540 --> 32:45.780
I set up the VM and the NGINX and, you know, the Sphinx documentation there and just started

32:45.780 --> 32:55.320
writing it. Worked with some amazing engineers to try and document the fantastic technologies

32:55.320 --> 33:02.860
that they were putting together for the Librem 5. And that was a lot of fun. I really enjoyed

33:02.860 --> 33:03.860
it.

33:03.860 --> 33:09.620
I'm not with Purism anymore, just because after my maternity leave, I became a project

33:09.620 --> 33:15.740
manager. I thought, I can give this a shot. It was a hole that needed to be filled. And

33:15.740 --> 33:20.860
it turns out I really didn't like that at all. And it wasn't really a good path for

33:20.860 --> 33:24.140
me to kind of go back to what I was doing.

33:24.140 --> 33:25.860
Ah, got it.

33:25.860 --> 33:34.640
So yeah, I mean, I am really honored to have written so much documentation for Librem 5

33:34.640 --> 33:40.780
and to work with the engineers on that team. They are absolute rock stars.

33:40.780 --> 33:46.620
It sounds like once again, you are sort of on the trailblazing side of some pretty cool

33:46.620 --> 33:47.620
technology.

33:47.620 --> 33:52.820
Yeah, I feel really like lucky to have had that opportunity.

33:52.820 --> 33:54.220
It also sounds like you're seeking it.

33:54.220 --> 33:58.340
Yeah, of course. We should always be seeking to make ourselves happy, right?

33:58.340 --> 34:03.860
If trailblazing is what makes you happy, go for it. That's awesome. But I admire how you

34:03.860 --> 34:09.540
sort of discovered a project, saw how it's something that you could really believe in

34:09.540 --> 34:16.060
and then threw yourself 100% at it. That's really quite lovely and honorable, I think.

34:16.060 --> 34:25.500
Oh, yeah. Thanks. I mean, I'm going to chase after whatever makes me happy and that definitely

34:25.500 --> 34:27.180
fit the bill.

34:27.180 --> 34:33.500
I really do like writing documentation. I sadly haven't had enough time to do that in

34:33.500 --> 34:44.300
my current role because I think the SnapCraft documentation could use some additional effort

34:44.300 --> 34:49.660
from myself. I mean, it's definitely being maintained and the community is awesome and

34:49.660 --> 34:55.660
they help out. But I think I have some to give in that realm too. I just got to find

34:55.660 --> 34:56.660
some time.

34:56.660 --> 35:03.240
Well, I would imagine for you being kind of new on the desktop team that there's quite

35:03.240 --> 35:07.980
the learning curve you're going through. So maybe as that settles a little bit, you'll

35:07.980 --> 35:08.980
find some time.

35:08.980 --> 35:12.460
That's kind of what I'm hoping. I mean, I am kind of documenting some stuff just for

35:12.460 --> 35:21.900
myself on the side in Cherry Tree, like everything to do with, oh, not open office, LibreOffice.

35:21.900 --> 35:26.880
And so yeah, like I have documented some stuff about SnapCraft, but mostly I've used kind

35:26.880 --> 35:27.880
of what's out there.

35:27.880 --> 35:32.300
I've read only like kind of surface level stuff and I found it quite nice. But I would

35:32.300 --> 35:35.780
imagine like any project, there's always more that can be done.

35:35.780 --> 35:41.500
At Purism, that was one thing. That was standing up a whole documentation thing from the ground

35:41.500 --> 35:47.540
up. So I got to lay it out however I wanted to, however I felt was the most intuitive.

35:47.540 --> 35:52.220
Whereas this is completely different, right? There's an established like documentation

35:52.220 --> 36:00.380
tree, hierarchy already out there that maybe that's not how exactly how I would have laid

36:00.380 --> 36:05.020
it out, but we can always add more links, right?

36:05.020 --> 36:13.500
And I think referencing relevant pages at relevant times can always improve existing

36:13.500 --> 36:18.260
documentation. So I would like to find some time to do that maybe in the next year or

36:18.260 --> 36:19.260
so.

36:19.260 --> 36:27.580
One topic I wanted to touch on is we sort of chatted about it very briefly when we talked

36:27.580 --> 36:31.540
a few days ago and I wanted to come back to it because it was one of those moments where

36:31.540 --> 36:38.980
I was like, no, no, no, no, let's keep it for when we chat. And we had quickly explored

36:38.980 --> 36:45.500
the topic of the economics of open source. And I know that's something that's close

36:45.500 --> 36:52.500
to your heart that you feel is often misunderstood. And I just wondered some of your additional

36:52.500 --> 36:53.660
thoughts on that.

36:53.660 --> 37:01.820
I'm passionate about open source. And when I started working at HP, I was very proprietary

37:01.820 --> 37:13.820
and I didn't really understand open source. I've been a Linux user exclusively for a long

37:13.820 --> 37:22.340
time actually, maybe 15 years. But it didn't contribute. There was a point where I tried

37:22.340 --> 37:30.020
to contribute, but I got shot down in a very mean way. And then I was kind of gun shy.

37:30.020 --> 37:36.300
How come and why? What was the environment like? And you don't have to mention a project

37:36.300 --> 37:37.300
specifically.

37:37.300 --> 37:44.740
Yeah, no, I just I wanted to help out on a package. And I thought I'd like I'd read

37:44.740 --> 37:53.620
the project's documentation and it was misleading. And so I offered to take over maintainership

37:53.620 --> 38:00.940
because I thought that that's the way you did that. And it was wrong. And what I should

38:00.940 --> 38:08.220
have done is I should have offered to improve the documentation. But instead, I was terrified

38:08.220 --> 38:17.660
of this faceless community. So I just stood back and watched for many years until I found

38:17.660 --> 38:22.420
the Gnome community and they've been very nice.

38:22.420 --> 38:28.260
And what was it about that Gnome community that convinced you that it was a safe environment

38:28.260 --> 38:29.260
to rejoin?

38:29.260 --> 38:37.980
The people, they were just so nice and willing to help and answer questions. And they were

38:37.980 --> 38:41.020
real people with real faces that I met.

38:41.020 --> 38:42.860
That makes all the difference, doesn't it?

38:42.860 --> 38:44.000
It does.

38:44.000 --> 38:47.380
To know that there's another human being on the other side of that that code or that that

38:47.380 --> 38:48.380
documentation.

38:48.380 --> 38:57.340
Yeah, I'm I'm a visual person. And so I like to see faces. So I went to LinuxCon in 2015,

38:57.340 --> 39:03.540
which now it's like all things are open source summit. That's what it is. But in 2015, it

39:03.540 --> 39:10.500
was LinuxCon and it was amazing. And I was standing outside of some talk that was full.

39:10.500 --> 39:16.780
I forget what it was. And I was just kind of standing like at the door, open doors.

39:16.780 --> 39:23.380
And right behind me was this booth for the Free Software Foundation. And I started talking

39:23.380 --> 39:32.100
with some of the guys there and I ended up buying Freedom 2.0, which is Richard Stallman's

39:32.100 --> 39:41.300
book. And I read it and loved it. And it answered a lot of questions for me. But it also kind

39:41.300 --> 39:47.900
of led me to read Cathedral and the Bazaar, which is almost like a response. And the combination

39:47.900 --> 39:54.020
of those two books really helped me kind of understand the history of open source and

39:54.020 --> 39:59.260
why we need it, even just like the terms open source versus free software, how there can

39:59.260 --> 40:08.700
be some contentiousness there. And then, you know, in my various jobs, not every manager

40:08.700 --> 40:18.740
understands the value of open source and why it's good to contribute back. A lot of companies

40:18.740 --> 40:24.060
just think like, oh, we'll take from open source and we'll modify it so it meets our

40:24.060 --> 40:33.400
needs and then we'll kind of keep it closed. And so even just knowing that if you take

40:33.400 --> 40:38.700
something that's under GPL and modify it, and then if a customer wants to see that code,

40:38.700 --> 40:44.700
like you have to give it to them. I learned a lot about licenses and I mean, there's still

40:44.700 --> 40:52.780
so much that I don't know. And then how companies can make money off of like support and other

40:52.780 --> 40:58.700
services or even just like bring you in with this open free product and then sell you some

40:58.700 --> 41:03.980
other things. So just like how people make money, how companies can make money off of

41:03.980 --> 41:10.540
open source, that didn't make sense to me for a long time. But now it does. And I think

41:10.540 --> 41:11.540
it's awesome.

41:11.540 --> 41:18.340
Yeah, I think you're right in that it's often misunderstood. You know, even I've run into

41:18.340 --> 41:24.860
that speaking, you know, when people ask me what I do on a daily basis, as soon as I introduce

41:24.860 --> 41:30.180
the concept of Linux and open source and how that works for those who are interested enough

41:30.180 --> 41:35.860
to want to learn a little bit more, often that's the question that guests ask is, well,

41:35.860 --> 41:42.820
okay, if you're giving this stuff for free, how does anybody make money? I get that often.

41:42.820 --> 41:49.740
And I think you're probably right, like having a deep understanding of that realm and the

41:49.740 --> 41:57.700
history to it and the social aspects that are connected to these topics really gives

41:57.700 --> 42:05.820
you a perspective on why the work you're doing is important to you, but also why it's important

42:05.820 --> 42:13.320
to share it. And so do you find that that's something that allows you to kind of venture

42:13.320 --> 42:19.180
on and do the hard work and to inspire you to continue to push yourself?

42:19.180 --> 42:25.580
Absolutely. Even just knowing that any code I put out there is going to be possibly viewed

42:25.580 --> 42:33.260
by, you know, hundreds or maybe even thousands of people. It drives you to write more readable,

42:33.260 --> 42:39.980
more maintainable, nicer code, not necessarily more efficient code, but I am all about communication.

42:39.980 --> 42:47.700
So yeah, definitely more readable code for sure. I've tried to explain it to people like

42:47.700 --> 42:52.420
my parents and they still don't get it. So I think I still need to work on my communication

42:52.420 --> 42:57.420
about that specifically. It is kind of a hard topic for some people.

42:57.420 --> 43:03.540
In open source, we tend to be quite giving. How does that compare to the scientific community?

43:03.540 --> 43:11.140
When you're doing research, it's free flowing amongst your colleagues, but there are going

43:11.140 --> 43:19.980
to be rivalries in any area of the sciences. And so of course you want to kind of keep

43:19.980 --> 43:29.420
your research details from them while being, you know, so there's definitely some reflection.

43:29.420 --> 43:36.060
I think the open source community is more giving, more open. It's all open. That's what

43:36.060 --> 43:42.860
it's about. It's got open in the name. There's no like open science, open physics.

43:42.860 --> 43:51.140
Heather, I wanted to ask you a question if you had an ask of our community, of the listeners.

43:51.140 --> 43:55.420
Is there something that you'd want to put to them? Something you'd like them to try

43:55.420 --> 43:58.380
or go and explore or maybe something to go read?

43:58.380 --> 44:06.740
I actually have two things. One of them is to be empathetic. It's good to do that in

44:06.740 --> 44:13.820
all walks of life, but when you're opening bug reports, and I hope that if any listener

44:13.820 --> 44:18.700
finds a bug or find something that even just doesn't seem right, they're not sure it's

44:18.700 --> 44:26.120
a bug, just file a bug. But when you file a bug, try and think about the person that's

44:26.120 --> 44:33.540
going to receive that and kind of, you know, add things to the bug report that you would

44:33.540 --> 44:40.660
need if you were that person. So how to reproduce the bug. What version of the software were

44:40.660 --> 44:47.860
you using? Maybe what version of the operating system are you running? Any little details

44:47.860 --> 44:53.860
like that. People that receive bugs that, you know, it's their job to fix them really

44:53.860 --> 44:58.620
appreciate good bug reports. And I think good bug reports come from empathy.

44:58.620 --> 45:04.820
I like that a lot. I think you're right in that empathy can be applied in so many different

45:04.820 --> 45:11.140
areas. But in this one specifically, it reminds me of what we touched on earlier, how there's

45:11.140 --> 45:18.380
a human element to every side of software, even though sometimes that seems stripped

45:18.380 --> 45:23.500
away. But yeah, bringing empathy to the person who's trying to help you get rid of the bug

45:23.500 --> 45:31.820
in the future. Sounds super powerful and reminds me of bringing solutions to a problem instead

45:31.820 --> 45:33.860
of just problems to a problem.

45:33.860 --> 45:40.300
Definitely. Yes, it's always good to try and offer a solution. And so my second ask would

45:40.300 --> 45:47.980
be a little abstract, but I think that it's always good to sharpen critical thinking skills.

45:47.980 --> 45:52.180
And so I would implore your listeners to go play a board game.

45:52.180 --> 45:53.660
I love that.

45:53.660 --> 46:01.740
I love board games. I play them any chance I get. So yes, please go find a board game

46:01.740 --> 46:03.200
and play it.

46:03.200 --> 46:09.240
When you said critical thinking, that was not going to be the first area I expected

46:09.240 --> 46:14.100
you to mention. But what is it about board games for you that really touches on that

46:14.100 --> 46:15.540
critical thinking area?

46:15.540 --> 46:21.460
When you play a strategy game of some sort, if you're trying to win, then you have to

46:21.460 --> 46:26.580
think critically about, you have to analyze, did I make the best decisions here? Even if

46:26.580 --> 46:35.020
you feel almost territorial of like, my strategy is the best. Well, is it though? And stop

46:35.020 --> 46:40.900
and think and do your best and if you win, then you win.

46:40.900 --> 46:45.320
Is there a game or two that you recommend that really kind of grabs you?

46:45.320 --> 46:52.800
So there's a game called Onitama, which is a two player chess-like game where you kind

46:52.800 --> 46:59.480
of have pictures with little grids on them. And it tells you like how you can move each

46:59.480 --> 47:07.140
piece. And there's five cards. So each player has two cards and there's another card. And

47:07.140 --> 47:11.440
whenever you play a card, then it kind of goes into this other pile and then it eventually

47:11.440 --> 47:20.300
rotates to the other player. So that's a lot of fun. It's not super interactive.

47:20.300 --> 47:27.280
For a long game, my favorite game would probably be a feast for Odin, which is a worker placement

47:27.280 --> 47:32.300
game kind of like Agricola. I also really like Norse mythology. That's kind of why I

47:32.300 --> 47:33.300
bought that game.

47:33.300 --> 47:34.300
It helps.

47:34.300 --> 47:42.540
Yeah, but that's actually a really good game. I have lots of games and I love to play them.

47:42.540 --> 47:46.780
Magic the Gathering. I'm also a big magic nerd.

47:46.780 --> 47:52.140
Sounds lovely. Heather, if people wanted to get connected with you, where would you like

47:52.140 --> 47:53.180
to send them?

47:53.180 --> 48:02.820
People can email me. I am hellsworth at gnome.org. I am on Twitter, although I don't make my

48:02.820 --> 48:08.380
way over to Twitter very often. Only when I'm procrastinating.

48:08.380 --> 48:09.620
For some of us, that's often.

48:09.620 --> 48:14.780
I know, right? Email is the best. I will answer my emails.

48:14.780 --> 48:19.740
Sounds great. Well, Heather, thank you so much for your time and for connecting on all

48:19.740 --> 48:23.420
these super fun topics. I really, really appreciate it.

48:23.420 --> 48:24.420
Sure. Anytime.

48:24.420 --> 48:38.820
Okay, great. Let's chat soon.
