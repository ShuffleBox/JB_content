00:00.000 --> 00:04.880
G's here and I've recently been falling in love with ThinkPads again. I've owned a few over the

00:04.880 --> 00:12.240
years and specifically used ThinkPads and how you can get more value for your money out of a use

00:12.240 --> 00:16.880
ThinkPads. And so the one and only person that I could think to bring on to talk about ThinkPads

00:16.880 --> 00:22.080
is of course Alan Pope. Many of you know him as Popey. So how are you doing Mr. Popey?

00:22.080 --> 00:27.120
I'm doing very well. Thanks for asking me on. I'm not the world's biggest expert on ThinkPads,

00:27.120 --> 00:29.520
but I think you could class me as an enthusiast.

00:29.520 --> 00:33.600
Yeah. So how did you originally get into ThinkPads? Like what was your first one?

00:33.600 --> 00:36.160
Was it a hand-me-down or a work machine or what was it?

00:36.960 --> 00:42.560
So I used to do IT support for companies years and years and years ago. And I think I came

00:42.560 --> 00:48.720
across ThinkPads at some point. I worked for one of the big six accountancy firms and some of their

00:48.720 --> 00:57.280
accountants had ThinkPads. And I liked them then because as an IT support person, you know, if you

00:57.280 --> 01:02.080
had to do any maintenance, they were easy to work on. You could take them apart easily. You could

01:02.080 --> 01:09.280
swap out the battery, the hard drive. They were just really easy machines to work on. And so that

01:09.280 --> 01:16.960
set it in my mind that ThinkPads are always this high bar for laptops from a maintenance point of

01:16.960 --> 01:26.240
view and reliability as well. And I never really owned one back then. That was in the mid to late

01:26.240 --> 01:33.920
90s. I never had one until working through IBM. And obviously everyone who worked through IBM

01:34.960 --> 01:40.560
got a ThinkPad. And so I got one given to me, well, you know, on loan while I'm working there.

01:41.280 --> 01:45.360
And that's when I properly fell in love with it because I installed Ubuntu on it

01:45.920 --> 01:52.160
and everything just worked. And it just felt super reliable and robust. And, you know,

01:52.160 --> 02:01.600
I could lob it in my bag and it just felt like the perfect laptop for me for all of the reasons,

02:01.600 --> 02:06.720
you know, robustness, ease of maintenance, everything worked. And so it just ticked all

02:06.720 --> 02:10.240
the boxes as soon as I got that one workstation ThinkPad.

02:10.240 --> 02:11.360
Aaron Alexander Excellent. So

02:12.240 --> 02:17.280
do you remember what model it was or what the specs were on that first ThinkPad? Because this

02:17.280 --> 02:19.040
would have been in the late 90s then?

02:19.040 --> 02:24.080
Jason Vale No, this one would have been quite a bit later. So this would have been in the 2000s,

02:24.080 --> 02:31.680
around about 2004, 2005. No, later than that, about 2006, something like that. And that would

02:31.680 --> 02:38.960
have been a W series. So for those who don't know, the ThinkPads have like the first letter

02:40.320 --> 02:45.520
defines the series of ThinkPad and the W's are the workstation ones. So it was a workstation

02:45.520 --> 02:52.000
of some kind. I know it had an NVIDIA GPU. So it was it was quite chunky. And it was mostly

02:52.000 --> 02:56.560
sat on my desk at work. But yeah, that was that was the first one. So I actually went in high.

02:57.600 --> 03:02.160
I didn't get an entry level one. I got a really decent spec machine as my first one, which I think

03:02.880 --> 03:03.680
probably helped.

03:03.680 --> 03:06.720
Aaron Alexander Yeah, I would imagine that that would help. So

03:07.920 --> 03:14.880
the workstation series, is that still the series that you kind of go along with? Do you is there

03:14.880 --> 03:18.960
is there a series that you gravitate to more on your personal buys?

03:18.960 --> 03:22.800
Jason Vale Yeah, it really depends. And I mean, I have

03:22.800 --> 03:30.480
a number of ThinkPads and they're a mixture, but they're a mixture between the X series,

03:30.480 --> 03:38.240
which are the kind of lightweight workstation, the one that's a little bit thinner, a little bit

03:38.240 --> 03:42.800
narrower. So the keyboard generally goes right to the edge of the machine. There's not like a big

03:42.800 --> 03:53.280
gap either side. Whereas the T series are more the corporate desk-bound laptops, and those are

03:53.280 --> 04:00.240
slightly wider. And then the workstation ones are the higher end ones. So I mostly got X series

04:00.240 --> 04:06.000
laptops and T series laptops, but some of them are so old that they predate that naming scheme.

04:06.000 --> 04:14.320
So they're, you know, they're R90 or R something. And most of the ones I've got are that I actually

04:14.320 --> 04:19.520
use are relatively modern, like within I say relatively modern, we're talking within the last

04:19.520 --> 04:24.560
eight years. And but I've got a bunch that are much older than that. And those are kind of the

04:24.560 --> 04:31.040
retro ones that don't fit that naming scheme. But currently, it's mostly X series and T series

04:31.040 --> 04:31.520
machines.

04:31.520 --> 04:34.560
Aaron Alexander Right. Yeah, I've actually got one that I

04:34.560 --> 04:40.320
when I purchased a vinyl cutter from a friend of mine, they gave me an old ThinkPad that was running

04:40.320 --> 04:45.360
I think Windows 95 or something that actually still has a parallel port because that's what

04:45.360 --> 04:51.520
the printer needed. So I'd have to dig it out to see what it is. But it currently isn't in use.

04:52.640 --> 04:58.000
I probably will never use it again, in fact. So how many ThinkPads do you own now?

04:58.000 --> 05:01.120
Jason Vale That's a good question. Is it bad that I

05:01.120 --> 05:01.520
don't know?

05:01.520 --> 05:03.200
Aaron Alexander No, it's not.

05:03.200 --> 05:06.800
Jason Vale So my main machine that I'm sat talking to

05:06.800 --> 05:14.000
you on is a T450. And that's the one I use all the time. And that's the one I sit in a docking

05:14.000 --> 05:19.760
station and I run it with three displays. And I've upgraded the drives in it and I've upgraded

05:19.760 --> 05:24.480
the RAM. And that's my main workhorse. I've even replaced the display with a better display. So

05:24.480 --> 05:31.600
it's like, that's the one I'm sat looking at all the time. The previous ThinkPad I had was an X220.

05:31.600 --> 05:43.360
So that dates from around 2012. My general guide is, when you're looking at the X series and the

05:43.360 --> 05:50.640
T series, the middle digit equates to the year of manufacture roughly. So if you're trying to

05:50.640 --> 05:58.320
think how old a machine is, a 220 was made in 2012. And a 230 was made in 2013. So that gives

05:58.320 --> 06:02.080
you an idea of how old it was. Mine dates from around 2012, my X220.

06:02.080 --> 06:03.600
Aaron Alexander Okay, yeah, I was actually

06:03.600 --> 06:06.560
looking at some of the X220s in the X series myself.

06:06.560 --> 06:08.160
Jason Vale They're great. They're really great.

06:09.520 --> 06:14.160
I mean, all of them have their flaws. None of them are perfect. But then no laptop is.

06:15.760 --> 06:22.960
I've got a couple of X61s. And the X61s are even more compact. And they've got a four by three,

06:22.960 --> 06:29.520
they're much older. They've got dual core CPUs. And they've got four by three aspect ratio display,

06:29.520 --> 06:36.000
no webcam. But they're perfectly serviceable. I've got one running Ubuntu Mate. And the desktop,

06:36.000 --> 06:39.440
once you get the desktop up and running, everything's fine. And I've got another one,

06:39.440 --> 06:44.960
which is a command line only system has no GUI on it. Because you can.

06:46.240 --> 06:51.680
And those both work really well. And they've both got six gig of RAM. So you know, it's not like

06:51.680 --> 06:57.360
they're starving for memory or anything. They've got enough oomph to work.

06:57.360 --> 06:58.960
Aaron Alexander So we're counting up to like,

06:59.520 --> 07:01.920
six or so at least that you have in use?

07:01.920 --> 07:04.880
Jason Vale Well, that's one, two, three, four. That's

07:04.880 --> 07:14.400
four in use. There's an X1 Carbon, which is the Ultrabook style, which my wife uses as her

07:14.400 --> 07:20.960
main machine. And the handy thing there is because my T450 and my wife's X1 Carbon have the same

07:20.960 --> 07:26.000
charge port, this rectangular yellow port. It means that when we're sat on the sofa,

07:26.000 --> 07:30.400
we just hand each other the cable. Like, so I don't have to have two chargers underneath the

07:30.400 --> 07:35.840
sofa. I can just, she has the cable for a bit and I have the cable for a bit. And then the rest of

07:35.840 --> 07:45.440
them are really somewhat older, crustier, kind of Windows 98, Windows 95, Windows XP era kind of

07:45.440 --> 07:52.800
ThinkPad. So I've got a T43, which is the last model of ThinkPad that was made before IBM sold

07:52.800 --> 08:01.200
off the laptop line to Lenovo. And I've got a super thick one that's got speak, front firing

08:01.200 --> 08:08.320
speakers, like grills on the front of the laptop. It's really, really thick. And that's got Windows

08:08.320 --> 08:14.880
98 on it. So yeah, I've got a range of them. But the main ones that are actually in use on a daily

08:14.880 --> 08:21.360
basis are the X61, the X220 and the T450. Excellent. And the T450, you said you have

08:21.360 --> 08:26.320
three displays hooked up to that. Are you running those out of the DisplayPort, Jack?

08:26.320 --> 08:31.920
So I've got it sat in a docking station. I picked the docking station up on eBay.

08:33.120 --> 08:38.160
And I just slammed the thing into the docking station. And there are two external displays

08:38.160 --> 08:44.960
plugged in. One's via DisplayPort, one's via HDMI. And as soon as I slam the laptop in,

08:44.960 --> 08:50.480
I use the internal panel as the main screen. And then the other two displays are sat above

08:50.480 --> 08:56.640
and behind as I use the secondary and tertiary display. But thankfully, you know,

08:57.200 --> 09:02.960
GNOME and KDE and all the modern desktops remember the layout. So when I yank the laptop out,

09:02.960 --> 09:07.200
everything just reduces back to one screen. And then when I plug it back in again,

09:07.200 --> 09:11.360
everything opens up to three screens and I can rearrange my windows a little bit

09:11.360 --> 09:18.000
and carry on. So yeah, my day-to-day machine has three displays, the laptop and two externals.

09:18.000 --> 09:24.000
That's pretty awesome, man. You know, talking about these and have you purchased any of these

09:24.000 --> 09:30.000
new or do you mainly purchase them used? If someone was kind of looking to buy their first

09:30.000 --> 09:36.080
ThinkPad, is there a suggestion you would give them to look for pre-owned or buy new?

09:36.080 --> 09:37.120
What would you suggest?

09:37.120 --> 09:41.520
Yeah, they're quite expensive, like relatively speaking. And one of the pitfalls you can fall

09:41.520 --> 09:47.520
into is buying the, there's a consumer grade ThinkPads, which are the E-series and I would

09:47.520 --> 09:53.360
avoid those. I mean, if you're on a budget and that's all you can afford, then, you know,

09:53.360 --> 09:57.680
fair enough. But they're nothing like what I would call proper ThinkPads. The E-series ones are

09:57.680 --> 10:04.560
consumer grade and it shows they're not as easy to upgrade. They just don't feel as robust and

10:04.560 --> 10:06.640
they don't have the same components.

10:06.640 --> 10:11.600
Yeah, I can attest to that because the first ThinkPad that I ever purchased outright was the

10:12.800 --> 10:22.240
X120E, which was the AMD GPU or APU rather. It was not great. But I mean,

10:22.240 --> 10:24.400
it did the job for what I was using it for.

10:25.120 --> 10:31.760
So I think that's the thing is that if you've got the budget and you can buy one new,

10:31.760 --> 10:38.160
that's great. But I personally have only ever had one from new, other than the one I had when

10:38.160 --> 10:45.600
I worked at IBM. I personally bought the X220 myself from new and I was contracting at the

10:45.600 --> 10:53.360
time. So it was a business expense, my own company. And I paid 45 pounds, I think it was,

10:53.360 --> 11:02.560
on top of the cost of the laptop for on-site warranty. And I had to use it, I think three times

11:02.560 --> 11:08.320
in the three years that that warranty was valid. And I had to have the motherboard replaced once

11:08.320 --> 11:12.240
and I can't remember what else, but I had other components replaced and the guy just turns up to

11:12.240 --> 11:17.440
my house and, you know, sits at my dining room table and repairs my laptop right there in front

11:17.440 --> 11:21.840
of me. It's great. It's a lovely service, not having to return to base and be without your

11:21.840 --> 11:28.480
laptop for, you know, who knows how long. It was really valuable. That 45 quid was the best 45

11:28.480 --> 11:33.840
quid I ever spent on that laptop. But most of them I've bought secondhand, either through eBay,

11:34.400 --> 11:39.520
or there are various resellers that, you know, refurbish laptops. And if you can find a reputable

11:39.520 --> 11:45.920
one that's got good reputation through, you know, other people or has got good online scores or

11:45.920 --> 11:50.640
whatever. But I bought them on eBay and they've been fine. I've not had any problem with buying

11:50.640 --> 11:54.960
ThinkPads on eBay. And there's so many of them because, because ThinkPads are so popular as

11:54.960 --> 12:01.600
business machines and then businesses churn and get rid of hundreds of them. The market is full

12:01.600 --> 12:06.560
of them. So there's, there's tons of these X series laptops on the market and they don't

12:06.560 --> 12:11.920
particularly hold their value. They're not like Apple laptops where they command a high price

12:11.920 --> 12:15.760
secondhand. You can pick one up for a couple of hundred dollars pretty easily.

12:15.760 --> 12:22.160
Well, and it seems like from just my research recently, whenever I purchased, my latest

12:22.160 --> 12:28.320
purchase was, was a T440S that a lot of these machines are off lease machines. So you'll find

12:28.320 --> 12:36.960
that the seller has 150 of these machines. They've sold, you know, 40 or so. So I can attest to,

12:37.520 --> 12:43.200
you know, buying from eBay and, and so far I've had a good experience. But I think you're right.

12:43.200 --> 12:48.800
I think you just need to do your research and kind of determine if the seller is reputable

12:48.800 --> 12:56.400
enough to buy from them or not. When you're shopping for a pre-owned ThinkPad, is there

12:56.400 --> 13:03.520
a particular model you would say that you should look for nowadays? Is, is there, you know, a

13:03.520 --> 13:10.480
particular combo mill per se that you should look for? I know that on my 440S, the track pad is

13:10.480 --> 13:16.960
probably the worst track pad I've ever used. So immediately I replaced that. But is, is there,

13:16.960 --> 13:20.880
are there any tips or tricks that you would give people out there if they're looking to buy one?

13:20.880 --> 13:22.080
Maybe which model?

13:22.080 --> 13:26.640
So I would start, if you're looking for ones that are going to be a usable workstation,

13:26.640 --> 13:31.360
it really depends on what your use case is. Do you want something for, you know, retro fun,

13:31.360 --> 13:36.800
maybe installed DOS and Windows 98 and Windows XP and stuff like that to play old retro games and

13:36.800 --> 13:42.880
have a bit of nostalgia as a like spare machine? Or do you want it as a, an active usable machine?

13:43.920 --> 13:52.240
And if we, if we talk about the, the latter, then I would say the X220 is okay, but it's a bit long

13:52.240 --> 13:57.920
in the tooth now. The CPU is Sandy Bridge. It's usable and you know, you can install a modern

13:57.920 --> 14:05.920
desktop on it and it works perfectly reasonably. But you might, you might get a good deal on a

14:05.920 --> 14:14.800
230 or 250. I would probably skip the 240, which has the dodgy keyboard as well.

14:14.800 --> 14:21.280
So some of them have, Lenovo went through a weird phase where some of the models had a strange

14:21.280 --> 14:26.880
keyboard, which had the function keys along the top were a little bit weird, like touch buttons

14:27.600 --> 14:34.160
and generally nobody likes those, but it's down to personal taste. You know, what your personal,

14:34.160 --> 14:39.440
some people prefer those keyboards. Most people don't, they prefer the traditional Lenovo keyboard

14:40.080 --> 14:46.320
and the X220 has, I think is the last one that has the older generation of ThinkPad keyboard.

14:46.320 --> 14:51.200
And then they went to the chiclet style and then they went downhill, I think with the 240

14:51.200 --> 14:55.920
and the 440 and then they came back with the 450 and that's the one that's good.

14:55.920 --> 15:03.680
So if you get a good deal on a 450, so a 2015 era machine or a 250, they're both the same age,

15:03.680 --> 15:08.080
same kind of internals, or you want something a little bit cheaper and a little bit older,

15:08.080 --> 15:12.800
probably the 230 would be a good one to have if you want something low price and they do show up.

15:13.360 --> 15:17.200
One of the pitfalls with the X series is a lot of them have, because they've been

15:18.800 --> 15:25.920
low cost corporate machines, they have 1366 by 768 resolution. For some people that's okay,

15:25.920 --> 15:29.200
that's good enough if you're just going to be browsing the web a little bit, but if you want

15:29.200 --> 15:39.280
it as a workstation, generally you probably want 1080p and the 450s come with 1080p screens and

15:39.280 --> 15:44.960
more modern ones do, but it's hard to find older ones with a 1080p screen than mostly

15:45.680 --> 15:50.320
the 768, which is a bit awful. It's usable, but it's not so good.

15:51.200 --> 15:58.000
The other thing that's worth noting is some of the T series ones have an interchangeable battery.

15:58.000 --> 16:02.240
In fact, most ThinkPads have an interchangeable battery. You can just like yank it out and put

16:02.240 --> 16:06.160
a different one in, but the difference with the T series is they have an internal battery as well,

16:06.160 --> 16:09.680
so you can actually take the external battery off while the system is running.

16:10.240 --> 16:17.280
And for me, I love that. I have four spare batteries for my laptop in my laptop bag,

16:17.280 --> 16:22.400
and when I'm out, if the battery runs low, I'll just pull the battery out while it's running

16:22.400 --> 16:25.600
and put another battery in and it will just carry on working. I don't have to shut down,

16:25.600 --> 16:30.400
I don't have to plug it into the mains, it just carries on working because it

16:30.400 --> 16:33.360
keeps running on the internal battery while you pull the external one out.

16:34.720 --> 16:41.280
And that's quite a selling point that not many laptops have. But if battery endurance isn't the

16:41.280 --> 16:44.640
main factor for you, then that might not be interesting to you. You might want something

16:44.640 --> 16:48.720
thinner, light, so you might go for the X series, which doesn't have that feature.

16:48.720 --> 16:55.680
Yeah, and I've noticed with that 440 that I have, I think it's a three cell internal battery, and

16:55.680 --> 17:00.560
it's great, man. I love that ability, just like you said, to be able to swap batteries. I've yet

17:00.560 --> 17:05.440
to purchase additional batteries, but I'm sure that that will happen, you know, next pay period,

17:05.440 --> 17:11.040
whenever I can offset that so that my wife doesn't get too mad that I've been purchasing all the

17:11.040 --> 17:16.400
ThinkPad parts and pieces. Yeah, that's the downside. It can be a bit addictive. You can

17:16.400 --> 17:22.480
find yourself, well, you know, I could just buy this docking station and I could buy this ThinkPad

17:22.480 --> 17:26.800
branded mouse that goes along with it. And, you know, I could upgrade the keyboard and it's very

17:26.800 --> 17:32.000
addictive. Exactly. And the one thing for me that I was looking for whenever I purchased the 440

17:32.880 --> 17:39.920
was the 1080p IPS display, because one of the things I noticed with the earlier X120e that I

17:39.920 --> 17:46.720
had was that it had the 1366 screen, but the viewing angles were horrible. Like you had to

17:46.720 --> 17:53.840
get it just perfect to get that kind of, you know, best viewing angle possible. And with that IPS

17:53.840 --> 18:00.480
display, it's been phenomenal. But I purchased that. And then after purchasing that, I purchased

18:00.480 --> 18:09.520
because it came with the i5 4300, I believe it is, immediately bought another motherboard. I bought

18:09.520 --> 18:16.720
the i7 motherboard, found that for like 40 bucks or so, bought the 450 trackpad, found that for 20.

18:18.080 --> 18:24.640
And then there was also an available M2 slot where I guess normally a 3G or cellular modem

18:24.640 --> 18:30.560
would go. So I purchased like a 120 gig M2 drive just to kind of work as my boot drive.

18:32.400 --> 18:38.480
Are there any sort of upgrades that you commonly do to these machines or do you try to buy it

18:38.480 --> 18:40.560
all loaded out as you see?

18:40.560 --> 18:45.600
Yeah, that's a great question. So you can get a good deal on one that's got like only

18:45.600 --> 18:51.520
four gig of RAM or something and spinning rust hard drive, and then you can just replace those.

18:52.560 --> 18:56.640
Because you could be confident with certain models, anything other than the carbon,

18:56.640 --> 19:02.960
the X1 carbon, you can change the RAM, change the hard drive. And the hard drive on most of them is

19:02.960 --> 19:09.680
is on the X series, it's usually a case of undoing one screw and the drive just slides out the side.

19:10.960 --> 19:16.000
With others like the T series, you have to take the whole backplate off, but it's like 12 screws

19:16.000 --> 19:20.560
that get retained in the backplate so you don't lose them. And then you could just pop the drive

19:20.560 --> 19:25.760
out. It's not it's not super hard. It's not difficult. So definitely storage. And yes,

19:25.760 --> 19:30.640
the fact that some of them have an M2 slot, like some of my ThinkPads, I have dual boot.

19:30.640 --> 19:37.280
So for example, I've got my X220, I've got Windows installed on the M2 drive for when I want to test

19:37.280 --> 19:46.160
out stuff like WSL on Windows. But yeah, storage is an easy one to do. In the X220,

19:46.160 --> 19:51.920
I've upgraded the hard drive in that, I don't know, five times in the eight years I've had it,

19:52.800 --> 19:57.440
or seven years I've had it. So it's, it's very easy to do. And the fact that it's easy to do

19:57.440 --> 20:02.960
means I don't, I have confidence that it doesn't matter if the if the drive goes bang, I'll just

20:02.960 --> 20:07.440
put another one in there. Or if I want more storage, I'll just swap it. It's I feel confident

20:07.440 --> 20:14.080
I can do that. The other thing that's a bit more tricky, but you can do is replace the screen.

20:14.800 --> 20:21.840
And so my T450 came with a gloss screen. And it took me a while before I figured out actually,

20:21.840 --> 20:28.320
I could just replace this. And there are companies that will sell the right screen for your laptop

20:28.880 --> 20:33.360
that has the matte coating or a different resolution. You have to be a bit careful because

20:33.360 --> 20:37.120
some of them have different connectors and different interfaces. But in general, it is

20:37.120 --> 20:41.520
possible to replace the screen. So if you really, you know, you like the laptop, but the screen is

20:41.520 --> 20:44.800
getting you down, it is possible to just upgrade that component.

20:45.360 --> 20:47.840
Now are these third party screens?

20:47.840 --> 20:48.560
Yeah.

20:48.560 --> 20:54.400
Okay. So from my research, that's really what I found mostly is, you know, a third party seller

20:54.400 --> 20:58.960
that's that's basically, you know, selling a display that will work with a ThinkPad,

20:58.960 --> 21:02.000
but not necessarily the OEM replacement.

21:02.000 --> 21:07.600
And that gave my my 450 my T450 a new lease of life because I was getting to the point where

21:07.600 --> 21:12.240
the screen was starting to annoy me. And I thought, you know what, I should just go and

21:12.240 --> 21:17.360
buy another laptop because this one's yeah, I'm resisting using it outside. Like sometimes I'll

21:17.360 --> 21:21.680
go and watch my son play football. And I'll take a little chair and I'll sit while he's playing and

21:21.680 --> 21:26.320
I'll get my laptop out tether to my phone and I'll start working on my laptop. But if it's a

21:26.320 --> 21:33.760
bit sunny, the glare makes it almost impossible to use. Whereas now I can I've replaced the screen

21:33.760 --> 21:39.760
and it's now suddenly more usable again. And the other thing to note on upgrades is sometimes

21:39.760 --> 21:49.280
the manual is wrong about how much RAM a machine can take. So the spec for my T450 says that it

21:49.280 --> 21:54.880
can take 16 gigs of RAM, but it's lying, it can actually take 32. And I know this because I bought

21:54.880 --> 22:01.520
two 16 gig sticks and put them in and I've now got 32 gigs of RAM. So there are certain online

22:01.520 --> 22:07.280
resources I'd recommend the the best one actually I found is this there's one website which is

22:07.280 --> 22:14.160
this there's one website which is think wiki. And I think think wiki.org and it's got all the specs

22:14.160 --> 22:20.160
of everything pad. And the other one is on Reddit, there's a subreddit called ThinkPad,

22:20.160 --> 22:26.480
slash our ThinkPad. And in there, you'll find plenty of conversations of people just showing

22:26.480 --> 22:32.560
off photos of the new ThinkPad. But people also having discussions about I want to do this hardware

22:32.560 --> 22:37.360
upgrade or, you know, is this the right amount of RAM for this machine? Is there anyone else who's

22:37.360 --> 22:42.320
got this particular model and has upgraded in this particular way? And it's a really friendly,

22:42.320 --> 22:47.200
nice community. It's a nice bunch of people and most of the people in there seem to run Linux.

22:47.200 --> 22:48.560
So that's also nice.

22:48.560 --> 22:52.960
Well, yeah, and that's we were recently having a conversation about ThinkPads in the

22:52.960 --> 22:58.560
Jupiter Telegram channel. And one of the things that we were talking about, you know, someone was

22:58.560 --> 23:04.000
like, well, this machine only supports 16 gigs of RAM. And I was like, Are you sure? And so I just

23:04.000 --> 23:10.720
looked up the specs for the CPU that was in it. And it can support up to 32. And, you know, I

23:10.720 --> 23:15.280
couldn't see his eyes bulge wide open. But he was like, Oh, my God, dude, I never I never thought

23:15.280 --> 23:19.680
that this would work. I was like, you might as well give it a try. I mean, at the price of

23:19.680 --> 23:25.760
of RAM, I mean, it's it's a pretty inexpensive upgrade. And he now has RAM on order. So I'm

23:25.760 --> 23:30.880
looking forward to whenever he pops back in and he says this ThinkPad now has 32 gigs of RAM.

23:30.880 --> 23:37.600
I was really lucky this T450 takes RAM I couldn't swap out of any other machine because most of them

23:37.600 --> 23:45.600
are older than this. But on eBay, there were two different vendors selling the same 16 gig

23:45.600 --> 23:51.120
stick at the same time. And so I bought one from each of them. And they both arrived within a day

23:51.120 --> 23:54.960
of each other and I put them both in the machine and they're basically a matched pair. They're

23:54.960 --> 23:58.960
exactly the same. I put them both in and now 32 gigs. It's awesome.

23:59.600 --> 24:07.840
Yeah. And with that 440 s a little disappointing, but four gigs was soldered on. So in theory,

24:07.840 --> 24:12.640
you know, I could so I've got the four gigs that are soldered on and then an eight gig stick in

24:12.640 --> 24:18.640
there. So in theory, I could upgrade and throw a 16 gig stick in there, but I'm likely only going

24:18.640 --> 24:25.280
to get the 16 gigs, not the 16, not the full 18 gigs that would be in the machine. Wouldn't it go

24:25.280 --> 24:31.120
to 20? Would you not get 20 with 16 plus four? Yeah, my math is horrible. Thank you. Thank you,

24:31.120 --> 24:36.560
poppy for correcting my math. But yes, so I wouldn't I wouldn't be able to get, you know, the

24:36.560 --> 24:42.080
full RAM that would be in the machine. So I'm kind of teetering on if that's an upgrade that I want to

24:42.080 --> 24:51.280
do or not. And I have noticed too that like the gets the 440 p model actually has a socketed CPU.

24:51.280 --> 24:57.680
So you can swap the entire CPU out without actually having to do a motherboard swap, which

24:58.560 --> 25:02.720
I found to be, you know, pretty inexpensive way to upgrade a machine as well.

25:02.720 --> 25:09.600
Yeah, the only thing to watch with CPUs on ThinkPads is their thermal design isn't perfect.

25:09.600 --> 25:17.600
And my X220, I bought the i7. And a colleague at the same time bought the i5 version, identical

25:17.600 --> 25:26.160
in every way, just different processor. And mine overheats quite a bit. And it overheats,

25:26.960 --> 25:33.280
we think because the thermal design doesn't allow the ThinkPad to get the hot air out fast enough.

25:34.720 --> 25:39.360
So you know, if you're going to be using it for like compiling code constantly, and you want it,

25:39.360 --> 25:46.560
you never want the processor to scale back the frequency, then you might want to consider that.

25:47.280 --> 25:53.680
The other problem is my 450 in a docking station, this is an official docking station from Lenovo.

25:54.560 --> 26:00.800
The bit on the left hand side where there's a key lock and a button to power on and the eject button

26:00.800 --> 26:07.440
to pop it out of the docking station actually obscures part of the vent. So it's the thermal

26:07.440 --> 26:13.040
dynamics on this thing are worse when you put it in a docking station than when you don't.

26:13.040 --> 26:16.960
So my laptop overheats more when I'm sat at my desk. Now part of that is going to be because

26:16.960 --> 26:21.760
it's driving three screens. So there's more pixels to push around, for sure. And there's

26:21.760 --> 26:29.200
more applications on and active at any one time. But still, it's a bit rubbish designed to have

26:29.200 --> 26:37.040
half the vents blocked by the docking station that it's sat in. It's not great. I don't know

26:37.040 --> 26:41.600
if the modern ones do that as well. But this is the most recent one I have.

26:41.600 --> 26:49.840
I see. Well, not the best engineering design decision, it seems. So of all these machines,

26:49.840 --> 26:54.880
and obviously you run Ubuntu and other variants of Linux on most of these machines,

26:54.880 --> 27:05.920
BIOS updates. If your system doesn't have LVFS support, is there a way that you go about updating

27:05.920 --> 27:10.080
the BIOS, flashing custom BIOS? Have you tried any of those?

27:10.080 --> 27:18.240
So I haven't tried any custom BIOSes. I'm always wary of bricking machines with BIOSes. So I'm

27:18.240 --> 27:26.240
pretty careful in that regard. I have seen that one of the downsides of Lenovo devices is they

27:26.240 --> 27:34.240
sometimes have whitelists in the BIOS for things like the wireless card. So you can't always just

27:34.240 --> 27:38.400
open it up and replace the wireless card with a better, faster one because there's a whitelist in

27:38.400 --> 27:43.760
the BIOS that won't let you. And that also happens with the battery sometimes as well. If you

27:43.760 --> 27:49.680
plug in a non-OEM battery, it can detect that and say your battery is dead, your service center or

27:49.680 --> 27:56.160
whatever, which is not very pleasant. And I don't like that. But thankfully, I've got none where I

27:56.160 --> 28:01.600
have wanted to do that. But I can understand if people have wanted to do that. And it's frustrating

28:01.600 --> 28:08.480
that you're blocked by some flag in a BIOS somewhere. But there are guides that I've seen on

28:08.480 --> 28:13.040
Reddit, on our ThinkPad, where people have talked about what they've done to overcome these issues.

28:13.040 --> 28:17.600
And yeah, patching a BIOS is one thing. For the standard BIOS updates that come from Lenovo,

28:18.880 --> 28:23.200
the two main machines, I mean, most of my machines, as I've said, are ancient. And so

28:23.200 --> 28:29.920
they're never going to get BIOS updates ever. So I don't really care. But the main ones that I use,

28:29.920 --> 28:37.840
I generally also don't care because I don't know, they currently work. It's only if there was some

28:37.840 --> 28:43.920
issue that I discovered that I actually had to do a firmware update for. If I was experiencing,

28:43.920 --> 28:50.560
then I'd go and look for one. But I'm a pretty BIOS cautious person. I'm not like an arch user

28:50.560 --> 28:55.840
who always wants the latest version of everything and the latest number in the BIOS boot screen and

28:55.840 --> 29:02.720
all that. However, that said, I do have Windows on both of them, both of my modern ones as dual boot

29:02.720 --> 29:12.080
on the M2 drive. Now, one thing that can be useful to do, whenever I receive a Lenovo ThinkPad,

29:12.720 --> 29:18.000
I always boot from Clonezilla on a USB stick, and I clone the hard drive before I touch it,

29:18.000 --> 29:22.160
so that in the event that I ever do need to boot back the original operating system,

29:22.160 --> 29:26.880
I can put it back on the drive. Or I might pull the drive out and put a different drive in. I'll

29:26.880 --> 29:34.080
always replace a spinning rust with an SSD. And so having the old drive kicking around or an image,

29:34.080 --> 29:40.560
you know, on a server somewhere or on a USB drive via Clonezilla, means if I really urgently wanted

29:40.560 --> 29:46.240
to do it, I could restore the original image, do all the updates, and then do the firmware update,

29:46.240 --> 29:50.480
and then take it out again. But other than that, I don't really care.

29:50.480 --> 29:54.800
But I personally, I haven't been hit too badly with that.

29:55.360 --> 29:59.600
Okay. Yeah. And that's, you know, the same for me. I'm very much one of those guys,

29:59.600 --> 30:05.600
if it's not broken, you know, don't fix it. Right. So and I don't want to run the risk of,

30:05.600 --> 30:10.960
you know, flashing the BIOS and having some unforeseen issue and breaking my machine.

30:10.960 --> 30:20.480
I had considered flashing the BIOS or patching it, rather, to create a Hackintosh out of the 440s.

30:20.480 --> 30:24.480
Because of that reason that you spoke about the the white listing of wireless cards,

30:24.480 --> 30:28.080
you know, if you wanted to put a wireless card in that would be supported for

30:28.080 --> 30:32.240
Mac OS, you would basically have to go in and patch the BIOS for that.

30:33.680 --> 30:38.560
Which is not something that you have to do, because you can always just get a wireless

30:38.560 --> 30:43.680
adapter that plugs into USB and you're off to the races. So not a huge problem there.

30:46.000 --> 30:51.840
You know, that now that we've been talking about these ThinkPads, and, you know, I run Linux on

30:51.840 --> 30:57.440
mine, obviously, you run Linux on yours and dual boot it with Windows. Are there any features

30:58.320 --> 31:03.840
that we can expect to work or not work? I've noticed recently with the latest version of 1910.

31:03.840 --> 31:12.640
And I don't know if that's just part of the GNOME 3.34 package or not, but the fingerprint reader

31:12.640 --> 31:16.560
in mine works flawlessly, which is super awesome, something I didn't expect to work.

31:17.760 --> 31:23.120
But is there is there anything that that, you know, doesn't work really on these ThinkPads?

31:23.120 --> 31:30.640
So yeah, the fingerprint reader works for me as well on my 450 and my X220.

31:30.640 --> 31:39.120
I think on more recent ThinkPads, I think from about a 470, 480 onwards, I think it might be

31:39.120 --> 31:48.000
broken. And I believe it's broken because the the necessary driver for the fingerprint reader is

31:48.000 --> 31:55.760
proprietary. And the people who do the fingerprint stuff on the Linux side, don't want to interface

31:55.760 --> 32:02.560
with proprietary blobs. And so that's a bit of a blocker. However, I'm told there are people

32:02.560 --> 32:07.600
working on some kind of magic voodoo shim or something that will enable that to work in the

32:07.600 --> 32:14.400
future. So I would imagine in the next six to 12 months, the fingerprint readers on more modern

32:14.400 --> 32:20.800
ThinkPads should start to work as well, where if they don't already, they should work. But yeah,

32:21.440 --> 32:25.600
I've got 1910 on both of mine and the fingerprint reader works. But I think that's because

32:25.600 --> 32:33.200
they're sufficiently ancient. I mean, my T450 dates from 2015. So it's not that ancient,

32:33.200 --> 32:39.200
but it's still like a four year old laptop. And it works there. But no, I don't know. I don't

32:39.200 --> 32:48.160
know of anything else that I've not had working. All the ports work as expected. One of my laptops

32:48.160 --> 32:57.920
also has a GSM modem in and that works. So yeah, I suspend works and more importantly resume works

32:57.920 --> 33:06.240
as well. The camera works. Yeah, I can't think of anything that doesn't work. All the media keys

33:06.240 --> 33:11.280
work so you can, you know, turn the brightness up and down the volume up and down and all that kind

33:11.280 --> 33:16.800
of stuff with the function keys. The only thing that might be interesting to look at on newer

33:16.800 --> 33:22.560
models is Thunderbolt support. I've not looked at that because I just don't have a modern enough

33:22.560 --> 33:28.560
ThinkPad that has Thunderbolt ports. But that might be worth a look to investigate if that's

33:28.560 --> 33:33.360
something that's important to you plugging in external GPUs or other Thunderbolt devices. I

33:33.360 --> 33:38.160
don't know how well supported that is. Yeah, and I've had great luck. You know, we talked about the

33:38.800 --> 33:44.240
dual batteries, the onboard battery and the detachable battery. I've also noticed that both

33:44.240 --> 33:52.400
of those report fine in Ubuntu. I haven't had any issues with those. I like to see that whenever I

33:52.400 --> 33:58.000
am running low on the detachable battery that, you know, I can see the power level that I have left

33:58.000 --> 34:04.560
in the onboard battery, which is super convenient so that you never really run the risk of being in

34:04.560 --> 34:10.880
a position where you can't power down or save your work or swap another battery in. So, I mean,

34:10.880 --> 34:16.720
overall, I've had a great experience with this recent purchase. One of the questions that Chris

34:16.720 --> 34:24.320
wanted me to ask is he's talking about upgrading Dylan's laptop. Is there a particular ThinkPad

34:24.320 --> 34:29.200
that you think is good for kids? Do you hand any of your ThinkPads down to your kids?

34:29.200 --> 34:41.280
Oh, God, no. I guess, as always, it comes down to what do they want to do with it. And I know Sam

34:41.280 --> 34:49.520
has used my X220 in the past and his primary use case back when he was using it was Minecraft.

34:49.520 --> 34:58.960
And the GPU in the Sandy Bridge processor in the X220 is a bit gutless. And you have to

34:59.920 --> 35:07.680
lower the render distance and drop the detail. And so for gaming, these older ThinkPads are not

35:07.680 --> 35:13.360
really up to it. But something like a 230, 240, once you start getting a little bit newer, like

35:13.360 --> 35:21.600
2015 era laptops, they can run some of the more basic games. I mean, Minecraft, I wouldn't

35:21.600 --> 35:29.040
necessarily say is basic, but you know, it's not Skyrim and Fortnite. But yeah, I think

35:30.000 --> 35:36.080
the robustness of a ThinkPad is helpful for a kid. Like, you know, kids are like,

35:36.640 --> 35:41.520
they can, you know, drop them, have them on their lap and, you know, spill stuff on them.

35:41.520 --> 35:48.720
I don't know if you've ever noticed, but there are drip holes on the bottom. If someone spills

35:48.720 --> 35:55.120
a drink on the keyboard, the idea is that the liquid is routed around the motherboard rather

35:55.120 --> 36:00.800
than onto it and through and should just drip straight out the bottom. There's a fun video I

36:00.800 --> 36:06.480
think Lenovo made a few years ago where someone just dumps an entire litre of water over a running

36:06.480 --> 36:10.720
ThinkPad and it just runs straight through and the laptop carries on running. It's not something I

36:10.720 --> 36:14.800
would recommend anyone tries and I'm certainly never going to do it on my laptop, but it's nice

36:14.800 --> 36:22.080
to know that that's a test they do. And so for kids, like my own son has dropped a cup of juice

36:22.080 --> 36:30.480
over a laptop before my mother-in-law's MacBook Air and so it was ruined. Whereas you would like

36:30.480 --> 36:37.760
to hope that the ThinkPad would survive that kind of abuse pretty well. So yeah, I think the other

36:37.760 --> 36:42.080
nice thing about ThinkPads is, I mean, I go back to the repairability and the maintenance. If

36:42.080 --> 36:48.720
something does break, if the plastics break, you'll always find someone on eBay selling

36:48.720 --> 36:56.000
the plastic shell or the palm rest or the underside or something or the memory slot cover.

36:56.720 --> 37:01.200
There's spare parts for these things all over the place. So even if something does break,

37:02.320 --> 37:04.480
there's a chance to get it fixed.

37:04.480 --> 37:11.280
Right, right. And that's one thing that I've noticed that they do have really good documentation

37:11.280 --> 37:15.520
and repair manuals, you know, freely available. It's not like you have to go through some

37:16.640 --> 37:21.280
loops to try and say that you're a dealer or a vendor or something to get these repair manuals.

37:22.080 --> 37:27.440
So that's one thing that I really like about Lenovo. And it makes sense, in my opinion,

37:27.440 --> 37:32.720
for them to have drain holes for drinks. I mean, if I'm thinking about this as a business class

37:32.720 --> 37:38.560
machine, I'm sure several people have knocked over a cup of coffee or something into their

37:38.560 --> 37:43.040
keyboard. So yeah, it's easily done. It seems like it's a wise decision on engineering's part

37:43.040 --> 37:48.000
to try and help mitigate that. You know, thanks for coming on and thanks for talking to me about

37:48.000 --> 37:54.080
all this. No worries. Are there any closing suggestions or some sort of advice that you

37:54.080 --> 37:58.560
would give people if they're looking at picking up a ThinkPad? Yeah, so we've mostly talked about

37:58.560 --> 38:06.320
like the modern era, like from year 2000 onwards. But there's still a whole bunch of older laptops

38:06.320 --> 38:13.840
that, you know, predate year 2000 that would have come with DOS and Windows 98 and XP.

38:13.840 --> 38:19.760
And they're tremendous fun to play with as well. Especially if you want to try, you know, playing

38:20.480 --> 38:25.760
old DOS based games and stuff like that and live that retro life if that's something that's

38:25.760 --> 38:33.280
appealing to you. But one warning I would give you is there are some models of ThinkPad which

38:33.280 --> 38:40.720
have BIOS passwords in them that you absolutely can't remove. And if you're looking for second

38:40.720 --> 38:48.080
hand older ThinkPads on eBay or Gumtree or whatever, do make sure that you've got assurance

38:48.080 --> 38:52.960
from the vendor that you can actually boot directly to an operating system and that there's no password

38:52.960 --> 39:00.400
lock. Because I made the mistake of buying a ThinkPad and it has a password on the BIOS and

39:00.400 --> 39:06.160
I absolutely can't get into it. And I've had to buy a complete replacement motherboard for a 15

39:06.160 --> 39:12.720
year old ThinkPad just so that I can get the thing to boot. So that's one thing to watch out for I

39:12.720 --> 39:19.360
would say is make sure the thing boots. You know, get some good photos of what it looks like when

39:19.360 --> 39:26.240
it's booted. But the nice thing is they're mostly super repairable and, you know, easy to maintain

39:26.240 --> 39:32.640
and they're fun to use. And despite their, you know, 1980s industrial design that looks like

39:32.640 --> 39:50.160
it came out of a, you know, Russian military, they're delightful machines. I love them.
