1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,860
Well, hi, Jackie, hi, Brent. How are you doing? I'm good. How about you? I'm doing great.

2
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:22,580
So to give a little bit of context, I'm here with Jackie DeVore. She is a whole bunch of

3
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:27,360
really great stuff, but I'll give you a little bit of context about where we are physically.

4
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:35,080
So I've been doing a little bit of a East Coast US trip, which has been really fun.

5
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:40,880
So I've been staying with Alex from Self Hosted for a little bit. And now I've come and seen

6
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:45,080
you guys as well because you're not too far, which has been a real treat. So you've taken

7
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,080
me into your home.

8
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,200
Yes. And it's been an absolute delight for us.

9
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:55,560
Right. So you and Drew have taken me into your home. Drew does most of the editing for

10
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:00,920
the brunches. And many of you have gotten to know him through the brunch that we did

11
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:05,040
together, one of the early ones. So we will link to that for sure. But Jackie, it's such

12
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,080
a treat to get to chat with you in person.

13
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,080
Yeah.

14
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:14,360
So joining us as well is some of your rabbits that you have in your home.

15
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:20,380
We have a lot of rabbits. Yeah, and there's one. She was laying on me when we were setting

16
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:27,420
up here, but now she's coming in from the side. This is Min, a very, very fluffy bunny.

17
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,760
She's going for my juice. She has a drinking problem.

18
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:35,840
But totally welcoming. And you guys have taken me in and I really appreciate that. So it's

19
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:41,020
been so fun to spend the last few days with you and checking out Savannah here together.

20
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:45,600
We have absolutely loved having you here. It's been a few days full of food and music

21
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,360
and great conversation. So yeah, well, it just continues here, doesn't it?

22
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:54,480
Can you give us a little bit of an intro on what you do?

23
00:01:54,480 --> 00:02:05,520
Well, I'm an artist, so I make a lot of different kinds of art. And I'm a podcaster. I'm one

24
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,680
of those people that never really has a title.

25
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,680
Which is a good thing, I think.

26
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,680
Yeah, I guess.

27
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,600
Tell me a little bit about the podcast that you're doing.

28
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:18,440
Okay. So my main podcast is Sirens of Scream. And we've been doing this for four years.

29
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:26,720
It's an all women-led horror podcast. And we talk about absolutely anything horror. People,

30
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,920
when they think about horror, they think about just movies or shows. We talk about comics.

31
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:40,240
We talk about art. We've even talked about hairstylists that do horror-themed hair. And

32
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:48,520
it's, honestly, it's wild. We've had some absolutely incredible guests on the show.

33
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:55,560
We were actually talking the other day about, we were talking about music, and that led

34
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,480
to our shared love of Nine Inch Nails.

35
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,080
Yeah, I'm a huge Nine Inch Nails fan, for sure.

36
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:08,560
And coincidentally, we had the art director for Nine Inch Nails who also writes a comic

37
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:14,120
called High Level, Rob Sheridan, on the show a few months ago. And he was a phenomenal

38
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:23,240
guest to have on. He and his wife do these insane Halloween haunts at their house that

39
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:29,940
they post about every year. And he does this absolutely incredible glitch art. And these

40
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:34,960
people that we have on the show, typically, they don't just do one project. They will

41
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:40,960
do, like horror will really encompass a lot of different areas of their life. So it's

42
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,820
really interesting to have them on to talk about the project or talk about something

43
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:50,200
that they're interested in horror, and then really get to know them as people and what

44
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:56,440
got them into horror, what happened in your past to make you really want to look at this

45
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,980
traumatic stuff.

46
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:02,360
But what I've learned, because I have mentioned to you in the last few days that I have a

47
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:07,920
really good friend, her name is Miranda, and she is totally, like, I would say her entire

48
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,800
lifestyle is splashed with horror in the best kind of way, right? She brings it to her decor

49
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:18,200
in which you guys have around here. You've got a few sort of horror themed decorations

50
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:23,840
around your home. It's pretty much always a horror theme around here, which is super

51
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:30,520
fun. And I love how you can take something that some people feel is really uncomfortable

52
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,440
and take it to a place that brings a lot of joy to people. And that's what I've noticed

53
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:41,360
of people like you and my friend Miranda and Nine Inch Nails, how it just, like, surrounds

54
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,920
your entire life and all your different projects. But you as an artist, I would imagine that

55
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,960
splashes into everything that you do.

56
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:56,000
Oh, absolutely. Horror definitely comes into a lot of my art. But at the same time, I also

57
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,840
pull a lot of color and, like, a lot of bright color, a lot of weird, happy themes into art

58
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:10,680
too. And I like to combine the two in a sort of surreal sort of way, which I think is strange

59
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,680
for some people.

60
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:17,200
It sounds like it pushes the envelope of what's generally accepted as horror or not.

61
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:24,240
Yeah, yeah. That I do like to question a lot. Like, I was showing you the other day, I have

62
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:31,680
a series of animal head girls that I do in watercolor and my favorite is one that I call

63
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,800
Goldie and it's a chicken headed girl and she has an arm missing with her bone sticking

64
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:43,440
out of it. But she's, you know, the background is a bright neon pink and she's got a, you

65
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:49,920
know, a neon blue for her body and everything and like gold gilded throughout the piece.

66
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:55,520
So the colors are bright and happy and they bring you in. But, you know, she's got these

67
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:02,000
elements of these big glowing dark eyes and, you know, I like to make things uncomfortable

68
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,040
while also making them kind of fun.

69
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:11,040
Well, the neat thing that I've picked up on is like horror doesn't need to be said. You

70
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:15,560
can have, it may sound weird to say, but you can have horror that makes you happy.

71
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:25,200
Absolutely. Yeah. And there's an entire sub-genre of horror comedy even. So yeah. Like one particular

72
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:31,960
movie that comes to mind is Warm Bodies or even one that's exceptionally popular, Shawna

73
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,960
the Dead.

74
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,320
Fair enough. Yeah. Okay.

75
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:39,360
But I mean, or Tucker and Dale versus Evil is another great one. If you haven't seen

76
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,360
that, that's fantastic.

77
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,360
I haven't. You'll have to show me that.

78
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,320
I think that might even be Canadian.

79
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:47,440
Oh, well, apparently I'm learning that a lot of that kind of stuff is Canadian.

80
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:54,360
Yeah. Canada has the best comedy these days. Hands down. There is no doubt about it. Canada

81
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,840
definitely has the best comedy these days.

82
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,080
Oh, nice. So at least we're known for something.

83
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,080
Yeah.

84
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,080
That's great.

85
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,840
Best comedy and best maple syrup.

86
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:11,920
Well, you know, sorry Maine. We were chatting earlier as well about how on your podcast

87
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:18,240
you end up bringing a whole bunch of personalities that are really excited to hear about from

88
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,800
you guys, like Nine Shnails you were mentioning, but you have had some other special guests

89
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,800
as well, right?

90
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:30,240
Yeah. We had the Soska sisters on and recently-

91
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,240
Who are Canadian.

92
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:40,360
Yeah, they are Canadian as well. And they're pretty big in the horror industry. And we've

93
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:49,400
had other horror celebrity types on like Colin Bunn was on and we had Andre Gower and Ryan

94
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:57,400
Lambert who are movie stars on. And people ask us sometimes, you know, do you just harass

95
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:06,320
the hell out of these artists and these stars to get them on your show? And no, we just

96
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:11,320
simply ask them, Hey, do you want to come and talk about your really cool project with

97
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,320
us? And-

98
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,880
I would imagine most people are honored to talk about the stuff they're doing right now.

99
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:20,120
Nine times out of 10, they'll be like, yes, absolutely. I would love to talk about my

100
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,000
cool stuff with you.

101
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,600
And maybe it's a fallacy to think like that, oh, they'll never reply to me. I'm just a

102
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:35,600
podcaster or whatever, right? But I feel like there aren't really any rules around this

103
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:40,360
stuff. So if you have a means of contacting someone, you should just go out there and

104
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:44,560
try it, right? And that applies to anything. You don't have to be a podcaster. Like if

105
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:50,400
you want to get a question answered from one of your mentors or your heroes or something

106
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,800
like that, just just kind of reach out and you never know what will happen.

107
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:59,480
Yeah, exactly. And I mean, like Wayne Gretzky and Michael Scott said, you always regret

108
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:06,560
100% of the shots you don't take. That's great. Yeah, just try. The worst case is you're right

109
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,200
back where you are. Yeah, they either don't respond or say no, and then you can move on

110
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,460
with your life. Right. Do you have a wish list of people that you're chasing or hoping

111
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,720
to get on at some point?

112
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,760
Absolutely. Right now, we would really love to get the Dupless Brothers on. Do you know

113
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,760
the Dupless Brothers?

114
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,360
I don't because I'm new to this genre.

115
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:31,040
Oh, my God. They're wonderful. They're both actors and they're both writers and producers.

116
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:38,840
And they were all actually both on the Mindy project back when that was a thing. But Mark

117
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:45,640
Dupless specifically wrote and starred in Safety Not Guaranteed. And right now they

118
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:50,680
both write and direct and produce Room 104.

119
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,680
I don't know it.

120
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:58,880
Oh, it's great. It's a show that is basically, it focuses on one room in a motel and all

121
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,680
the weird stuff that goes on.

122
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:09,000
Oh, it reminds me of, is it Five Rooms? This is a Quentin Tarantino. Well, it was a whole

123
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,480
bunch of directors. I'm taking you on our side now. But it was a whole bunch of directors

124
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:18,840
that focused on five hotel rooms. It's totally worth checking out. There's like Antonio

125
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:23,040
Banderas saying, oh, here I'm showing you something. There's some really cool, wacky

126
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:28,040
stuff that happens in there. So it's a recommendation. But continue with what you were mentioning

127
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,520
as one hotel room.

128
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:36,120
Yeah. And it's basically like a guideline to how to never get your deposit back in a

129
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:44,440
hotel room. It kind of like tows that line of what's horror. It's one of those kinds

130
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:54,280
of shows that it will really vary from episode to episode between horror and comedy and just

131
00:10:54,280 --> 00:11:00,600
straight up tragedy. And it's really fantastic. It's very out there. I think it's on HBO right

132
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:07,320
now in its fourth season currently. But it's fantastic. There's a lot of great writing

133
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,320
going on there.

134
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,320
Nice.

135
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:16,600
The Uplus brothers, they're very eccentric. And they choose very interesting projects

136
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:21,240
to work on. So I'd really love to talk to them. They seem like they would be very interesting

137
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,520
to sit down and talk to.

138
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:25,000
Great. So if anybody has a connection to them, feel free to reach out.

139
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Oh, I sent them an email already.

140
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Good, good. Of course you did.

141
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,000
It was actually like just a week ago. So we'll see if they reply.

142
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Yeah, that would be so amazing.

143
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,800
And so tell me a little bit more about the podcast or some hosts that join you as well.

144
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:47,280
My co-hosts are Sierra Halk and Melissa Meagan. And Melissa is the one that actually came

145
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:53,040
up with this idea for The Sirens. And how this actually started was quite a while ago,

146
00:11:53,040 --> 00:12:01,760
I actually helped Chris Hardwick with a social media site called The Node. This was like

147
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:07,240
a side project of Nerdist. And it was an invite-only social media site.

148
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,240
Oh, fascinating.

149
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:18,000
Yeah. And I helped him run it. And on that site, it was just like a couple thousand members.

150
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:25,920
And I happened to meet Melissa and Sierra there. Another girl and I, Steph, had a blog

151
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:32,160
site called Nerds in Babeland. And we just wrote geeky articles on there.

152
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,800
Did you say Nerds in Babeland?

153
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,800
Yes.

154
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,800
That's such a great name.

155
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,800
I know, right?

156
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,800
Lovely.

157
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:44,720
And that actually went on for a while. It was just a blog site where we posted stuff

158
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:54,480
about comics, just various nerdy things, really. I actually got invited to attend a NASA launch

159
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,280
because of that.

160
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,280
Really?

161
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,280
Yeah.

162
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,280
Oh, my goodness.

163
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:04,880
I'm actually a social media liaison for NASA because of that site.

164
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,880
That's so cool.

165
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:15,320
I know, right? So, Melissa was a regular writer on Nerds in Babeland. And Sierra helped out

166
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:19,560
every now and then, too. And Melissa approached me out of blue. She's like, I really love

167
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:25,420
horror and I really want to start a podcast about horror. And I want to do it with three

168
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:28,400
ladies on the show. And you're the first person that came to mind.

169
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,400
Cool.

170
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:35,980
Melissa had always been on Talking Comics before that, which is a really popular podcast

171
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:42,520
about comics, obviously. And she asked me, do you have anybody else in mind that might

172
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,560
work for this? And I said, Sierra.

173
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,560
Nice.

174
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,720
Our personalities really work well together.

175
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,720
I agree completely.

176
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,720
Yeah, for sure.

177
00:13:49,720 --> 00:14:00,440
We're very different in a lot of ways. Our interests in horror really intersect. Melissa

178
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:05,880
is very family-oriented. She has a young son, so she really looks for horror that kids can

179
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:09,240
get into, which is really important.

180
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:16,520
There's some amazing books out there that are sketched in a way that is horror-themed,

181
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,880
that is written in a way that's kid-friendly.

182
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,880
Yeah, like Edward Gorey.

183
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:26,480
Yeah. I guess some popular films have been like that, some animated films as well. But

184
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:32,760
I have often thought that those two worlds can't really coexist, but I'm learning that

185
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,760
they certainly can.

186
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,760
Yeah. And I'll circle back to that in a moment.

187
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,760
Okay, great.

188
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,760
Great.

189
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:45,160
And she also really loves comics, so she kind of handles that side of things for us. And

190
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:53,160
Sierra is a very, very ferocious reader, and she really loves board games, so she really

191
00:14:53,160 --> 00:15:02,160
covers that side. And I hate silence, so I always have something playing in the background.

192
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:10,200
And I also am an avid video gamer, so I cover that side. And we all really love art. We

193
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:18,040
all love music, so we all come together with our various likes and dislikes. And Melissa

194
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:23,760
likes slashers, Sierra likes found footage, I like ghosts, and it's-

195
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,760
So you sound pretty well-rounded then.

196
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,760
Yeah.

197
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,760
That's awesome.

198
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:33,680
So it's nice to have three of us that really cover this huge genre, and it works very well

199
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,680
for us, I think.

200
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,200
And have you had the opportunity to meet them in person?

201
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,200
No.

202
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,200
Really?

203
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,200
Oh my goodness.

204
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:46,480
For four years, and we've never met in person. What's weird is Sierra used to come down to

205
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,560
a town just outside of Savannah every year for Thanksgiving, and we could never make

206
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,560
it.

207
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,560
Oh no. That seems like a shame.

208
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:57,080
And then I was supposed to go out to Seattle just a few months ago, and then that-

209
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,080
Of course.

210
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,080
Didn't work. Last minute.

211
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,080
Of course.

212
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:03,200
Yeah. So it's like the starts would never align for us meeting.

213
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,200
It'll happen. It'll happen.

214
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,200
It's so weird.

215
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:10,840
Yeah, there's something about being there in person, as you and I are doing right now,

216
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:15,420
that is such a treat. And I've talked about that before, that you can build this really

217
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:23,140
amazing relationship with people at a distance online, which could never really happen before.

218
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,880
It's almost like a pen pal, right?

219
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,880
Yeah.

220
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:29,040
But there's these amazing connections that can happen that way. But when you sort of

221
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:34,120
reinforce those with an in-person meeting, it's such a treat. So I'm looking forward

222
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,880
to hearing when you all get together. That's going to be great.

223
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:45,680
But the kids and horror, let me circle back to that. As I mentioned on another JP episode

224
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:50,280
recently, I think it was an extras episode that Drew and I did for Halloween.

225
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,560
Yeah, that was a great episode. I loved it.

226
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:58,840
He and I met while we were planning a zombie walk. And one thing that we really learned

227
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,880
with the zombie walk is that kids love horror.

228
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,880
Really?

229
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:08,080
Kids would get into those zombie walks so much. You would see these four and five-year-old

230
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:13,360
zombies running around like, rawr, trying to scare their buddy. And they would get so

231
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,360
into it.

232
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:17,680
And do you think it's linked to an open imagination at that age?

233
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:26,760
Oh, absolutely. Kids, they don't really get scared the way people expect them to. I went

234
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:33,300
to a show where Neil Gaiman was talking. And it happened to be at a theater where Drew

235
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:41,080
used to work. So we got to hang out backstage and talk to him afterwards. And I talked to

236
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:47,240
him a little bit about kids and horror. And he has a lot to say about kids and horror.

237
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:53,040
And he writes a lot of kids and horror, like Coraline. And he has a really great take on

238
00:17:53,040 --> 00:18:01,120
it. Kids are just, they will accept things in a world much more openly than adults will.

239
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:06,280
Adults will apply these rules that they're used to every day to these imaginary worlds

240
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:13,400
that are presented to them, where kids will see an imaginary world and dive into it and

241
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:19,920
be much more open to what's happening in that world rather than apply these rigid expectations

242
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,080
that adults have.

243
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:25,720
That's so interesting, right? When we were kids, our imagination was one of the places

244
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:31,680
that we played very often. And as adults, that almost atrophies a little bit, I would

245
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:37,760
imagine for artists that might not be as true. But it seems to me like what you're saying

246
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:42,240
is it's important to not cling on to those rules too much when you're approaching something

247
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:47,520
like horror genres or stories that really push your imagination.

248
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:55,160
Yeah, it's important to step outside of that rigid comfort zone. Be open.

249
00:18:55,160 --> 00:19:01,320
Yeah, of course. And so I was just about to say, do you know of any kids who listen to

250
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:06,800
the podcast? But you may be a little explicit on the podcast sometimes, right?

251
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:10,680
We're a little bit too foul-mouthed for that.

252
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,640
That's all right. That's all right.

253
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:20,120
So like pretty much the first 15 minutes we started talking when you got here, I warned

254
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:25,360
you straight up, I talk like a sailor. And it's true. I've been bringing it in a little

255
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:34,160
bit here. Actually, I haven't been censoring myself at all. It's just coincidence. But

256
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,200
I do, I curse like a sailor.

257
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,200
But what I like about the podcast and the use of it there is that you use it pretty

258
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:47,040
tastefully. Like it's in the places where it really enforces a point.

259
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,040
I appreciate that.

260
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:53,780
Yeah. No, I think it has its place, you know, it's nice to hear. If you've listened to,

261
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:59,760
for instance, like user error, I feel like it has a similar feel in that it has splashes

262
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:04,820
here and there. But it's only to highlight the things that really matter, right? Sometimes

263
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:11,960
its uses is exactly perfect. And okay, with kids, maybe that's not so appropriate. But

264
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,400
I say don't change a thing.

265
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,400
Yeah, thank you.

266
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,400
Yeah, absolutely.

267
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:22,800
Well, coincidentally, my best friend Blue, she's this incredible, incredible woman. She's

268
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:31,440
an ironworker. And she does a lot for women in her field. And she's a huge advocate for

269
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,440
badass women doing awesome things.

270
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:41,800
And she was actually listening to one of the Sirens episodes. And she mentioned to me that

271
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,280
she likes how much I cuss on the show.

272
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,280
Really?

273
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:52,120
Yeah. And it inspired her to start a podcast of her own that she's going to call Women

274
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:55,160
Who Cuss. I kid you not.

275
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,160
That's awesome.

276
00:20:56,160 --> 00:21:03,000
And her show is actually going to be kind of centered around women who do really interesting,

277
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:09,680
big badass projects. And she wants to bring them on and talk to them about these projects

278
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:15,480
and then talk to them about them as a person to really give a well rounded, you know, three

279
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:22,640
dimensional view of these, these women and what they're doing. She and I are also launching

280
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,840
a project later today.

281
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,240
Oh, cool.

282
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:39,240
It's called HBIC or Hell Bunny's Independence Club. And we, the shortened version, the HBIC

283
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:48,760
and the relation to the other meaning of it, head bitch in charge, is absolutely intentional.

284
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:55,680
The purpose of this club will be to bring boss ass women together in a very supportive

285
00:21:55,680 --> 00:22:03,240
and inclusive kind of environment. So where we can support each other, lift each other

286
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:13,160
up, a place where women can vent safely, where we can network, basically just a common ground,

287
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:21,200
like a meeting place where we can come together and have a place to be safe and talk and do

288
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,000
great things and anything we want.

289
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,160
Wow. And it sounds like that spans different professions and different occupations and

290
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:34,760
everything is like not really too many limits on it, right?

291
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:39,640
Right. What we're starting with is actually going to be a, um, a discord channel.

292
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,600
Okay. Oh, that's a nice way to do it.

293
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:46,960
Yeah. We were talking about creating a forum space on a website and that gets complicated

294
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:52,320
so fast. And we were trying to figure out the details of that and how to, how to work

295
00:22:52,320 --> 00:23:00,240
that out. And oddly enough, Blue and I met on forums on, uh, Rooster Teeth long, long

296
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:07,080
ago. I've been an admin on Rooster Teeth for over a decade, but that's, that's a whole

297
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:15,320
other story. So we, naturally our minds go straight to like an old school BBC forum kind

298
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:21,120
of thing, you know? But as we're sitting here and making it overly complicated for ourselves,

299
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:26,560
suddenly I look to my, one of my screens to my right and I'm like, oh, I keep discord

300
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:33,480
up all of the time. Why don't we just open up a discord server here? And I just sat there

301
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:41,520
and made a really intricate, intricately detailed server for us there. Um, and we're, we're

302
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:47,480
finally launching it later today. We actually, uh, sought legal advice on it and everything.

303
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:55,320
It's, it's going to be quite a detailed thing and, um, we are not limiting it, um, strictly

304
00:23:55,320 --> 00:24:01,440
by gender. Uh, we don't want to be that exclusionary cause of course we're not, we're not TERFs

305
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:07,760
over here. We do want to welcome allies. We, we, we don't want to, you know, say no trans

306
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:13,880
here. We are not, we don't want to be that kind of people.

307
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:17,680
That can be, I imagine a little bit tricky too. Cause how do you keep it safe at the

308
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,800
same time? Right?

309
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:27,080
We do have a, um, uh, system in mind for, uh, bringing in, uh, allies and public support

310
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:33,720
and, uh, upgrading people to what we want to call members as we vet people basically.

311
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,720
That sounds really wise.

312
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:41,440
Yeah. So keeping people at like a very basic level and not allowing them to interact fully

313
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:47,200
at first before we completely vet them and then moving them up to members as, as we vet

314
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:52,000
people. So we want to, we want to be able to keep it a safe space and we want to be

315
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:59,220
able to keep it a place where, uh, women and allies can speak freely and, uh, free of consequence

316
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:07,320
and, um, be able to support each other without worrying about who else is there. This is

317
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:12,960
something that we've actually been talking about for literally years. Uh, we want to

318
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:19,200
do a lot more with this project. This is really the very, very basic first step.

319
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,200
Yeah.

320
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:24,660
Uh, this is something that we want to create, um, speaking events with. This is something

321
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:31,300
we want to do a charity with. This is an entire massive project that we have been talking

322
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:35,960
about for so long. And I'm so glad that we're taking this first step. It's very exciting

323
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:42,860
and kind of frightening, but most important things are right. So we're going to put it

324
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:45,320
out into the world today and see how that goes.

325
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:51,640
Great. Well, I, you know, it feels like this topic has come up in a few of my conversations

326
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:57,880
before. I know Elle talked about it a little bit and Emma did as well and Jill too. And

327
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,960
those are all really great conversations, but it's this theme that keeps coming up,

328
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,400
right? It's like, how do we include everyone? How do we include everyone? This is such an

329
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:09,620
important thing. Uh, and I totally support that approach and I hope that it, it gains

330
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:15,120
some pretty long legs and, and really gets going. It sounds like a gift actually. So

331
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,360
thank you for that.

332
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:21,160
And it was very coincidental that I, uh, specifically brought it up to you. I think yesterday I

333
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:27,080
said, who was that woman that was on your, on your show? Just that, that last episode,

334
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:30,800
I loved her. I want to reach out to these strong women that you're having on your show.

335
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:35,560
These are great people here. So I'm learning so much in these conversations. Like that's

336
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:44,820
a topic that I didn't necessarily think was, uh, so deeply at the forefront of someone

337
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:49,360
like Emma, who you're mentioning. Uh, but she feels at least as far as I understood

338
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:53,880
that this is one of our main missions, right? It's like include everybody, especially in

339
00:26:53,880 --> 00:27:01,480
tech or, or you were mentioning horror as well is often sort of seen incorrectly as

340
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:08,160
male specific or male only, which is totally wrong, isn't it?

341
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:15,080
Right. And, um, one thing that I don't think people realize is that women don't really

342
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:22,960
have a lot of spaces where they can speak freely without backlash. You can't really

343
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:29,080
say to your male coworker, Hey, you're making me uncomfortable or, Hey, you're not including

344
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:35,520
me. Why can't you say that? Um, a lot of times women will get flack for that. They'll get

345
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:42,020
punished for that. That's awful. Yeah. Women will be overlooked as being, um, dramatic

346
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:49,040
or causing problems, uh, just because they spoke up for themselves. Uh, they'll be seen

347
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:55,960
as that, that person that just has a problem with everyone just because she spoke up about

348
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:03,020
sexual harassment. And it's, it's insane that we're still dealing with this in 2019 completely.

349
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:09,680
And it's also very upsetting how much more prominent it's actually become in the past

350
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:14,640
couple of years. Oh, you sense a change. Yeah. There are certain factions of people that

351
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:23,800
have been a little more outspoken with their misogyny and it's a bizarre and terrifying

352
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:29,400
trend. Terrifying is accurate. Yeah. Um, being a woman that has been in tech specifically

353
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:33,280
that has been in the art world, that has been in the horror world, the gaming world, right?

354
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:38,920
Yeah. Gaming world, especially. Oh my God. That's something that I, I know is it's a

355
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:44,000
needed space. It's something that we absolutely need. You know how, when you hear, when you

356
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,800
learn a word for the first time, you suddenly hear it everywhere. It's true. Yeah. As we're

357
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:55,200
getting closer to launching this project, I'm suddenly seeing everywhere just how needed

358
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,880
it is. I've known in the back of my mind that it's a very needed thing, but just in the

359
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:06,800
past couple of weeks, I've been really seeing women itching for this exact type of project.

360
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:12,840
So it's, I'm very excited for it. I'm very excited to see how it blossoms and I really

361
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:17,520
hope it grows in a positive way. Yeah. I'm sure it'll evolve in all sorts of directions

362
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:22,360
you can't predict right now, but that will be necessary in many ways. Right? Yeah. Um,

363
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:29,600
how do you see the discord server being approachable by some people who may not, um, know what

364
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:35,120
discord is or, or have experience with it at this point? Discord is, uh, fortunately

365
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:42,000
pretty user-friendly. Okay. Um, so we're writing up a little guide, uh, for people to just

366
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,960
be able to read through and they'll be able to chat there. But it's, it, I mean, it'll

367
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:53,040
be a very easy to use, just chat form sort of thing. So it'll be basically be like the

368
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:57,200
old school chat rooms of the nineties for those types of people that don't, don't really

369
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,720
get into the internet that well. Yeah. Reducing those barriers is such an important thing

370
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,760
for something like this, right? It's like, how do we make it accessible to everybody?

371
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:10,080
Absolutely. Yeah. That's awesome. Very important thing. And so where can we learn more about

372
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:15,520
this? We are setting up a website right now that will be hellbunnyindependence.club. Nice.

373
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:20,320
Okay, great. And we'll definitely link to that for sure. And literally right before

374
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:24,480
I got on the air with you, I said to Blue, okay, what domains do we have these days?

375
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:29,720
Let's go ahead and set up a, let's set up a website and you know, just make sure we

376
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:33,920
have info there so that I can send people somewhere. Gotta plug these things for sure,

377
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:37,920
especially when they're so fresh. And, and I love how this was completely unplanned,

378
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:43,280
the timing of all these things, of you and I chatting and this coming out, but it just

379
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:47,000
like is pretty serendipitous that it's all happening at the same time. So it's great.

380
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,480
It's one of those things that feels meant to be because of the timing. Yeah, yeah, for

381
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:55,280
sure. Which is awesome. Okay. I wanted to ask you a little bit more about some of your

382
00:30:55,280 --> 00:31:02,160
art. I know you hinted to me earlier that some of your art got picked up maybe by a

383
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:07,400
brewery by chance. Can you walk us through that a little bit?

384
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:15,040
So I have a friend, Megan, who is in Ottawa and she does a lot of work with LGBT groups

385
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:20,560
there and she's another incredible woman. I love that I have surrounded myself with

386
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:23,480
incredible badass women doing amazing things. I was just thinking, how do you find all these

387
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:27,920
amazing people? It's just coincidence. Well, you must be attracting them with some energy,

388
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:34,540
that's for sure. I hope so. Oh, you have good energy, I like it. Thank you. So Megan actually

389
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:41,480
just coincidentally asked me a few days ago, how do I make a logo? I'm like, well, I do

390
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:45,320
graphic design. I'll do it for you. What do you want? Basically, you ask someone who knows

391
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:50,180
how to do it, right? And she just told me what she wanted. So I went ahead and whips

392
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:56,760
it up for her. And her organization there is called Bell's Corner. Well, she's in Bell's

393
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:01,160
Corners, I'm sorry. So her organization there is called Queer's Corners. Oh, nice. That's

394
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:08,520
a nice play on words. So we made this logo and she went ahead and put it with her organization

395
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:16,360
and a brewery in the area called Whippersnapper saw it and loved it and said, we're going

396
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:20,880
to go ahead and make a beer with that logo on it for you guys. Oh my goodness, that's

397
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:27,000
amazing. Within hours of all this happening, it just all happened within a day there. And

398
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:32,960
I had actually never heard of Whippersnapper because it's very localized to the area it

399
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:38,880
seems and we're so far down here. I don't know Whippersnapper either and I lived in

400
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:43,200
Ottawa for like eight to 10 years or so. So I wonder if they're new. It seems like they

401
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:50,160
might be pretty new, but it seems like she knows the brewer there. But their flavors

402
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:53,360
are very inventive. We went through quite a few of the flavors. You were showing me

403
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:57,720
some of these earlier. They were amazing. There was like a blueberry pancakes one.

404
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:04,960
Yeah, there was one with guava and oh my God, guava. It almost seemed like it wasn't beer

405
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:09,840
or it was a whole other like parallel universe of beer. Actually, maybe that's a nice way

406
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:15,160
of putting it. So over there, like talking to her kind of salivating over these various

407
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:20,960
flavors he's making and telling her how jealous I am. So she and Ian the brewer are actually

408
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:25,520
working on sending me some. Oh, cool. That's nice. I'm so excited about that. Cool. But

409
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:30,880
it feels like kind of probably feels like a treat to you that some of your art is getting

410
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,880
around that way.

411
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:39,640
Yeah. I also have some art out on Ghost in the Burbs merchandise right now. Ghost in

412
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:48,080
the Burbs is a podcast that is wildly popular in the horror realm. It's about a woman who

413
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:54,560
lives in Wesley, a suburb of Boston, and interviews her haunted neighbors.

414
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,680
That is so great.

415
00:33:56,680 --> 00:34:05,720
It is wonderful. She transcribes the interviews and puts her own voice to these transcriptions

416
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:11,840
and she has such a beautiful writing voice. The podcast itself just recently ended last

417
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:15,560
month but she did it for three or four years.

418
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,720
So there's lots of content there.

419
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:17,720
There's so much content.

420
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:18,720
Beautiful.

421
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:25,640
And the story is wonderful to go through. Her name is Liz Sauer. She was on Siren's

422
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:32,200
screen for an episode there and she and I became friends through that. But I did a couple

423
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:39,840
of designs for her and one of my designs, which is a Ouija board with one of her sayings

424
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:43,760
on it, is still up on the shop there.

425
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,760
Nice.

426
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:48,840
And that design got pretty popular. So it's actually really fun to see people on Instagram

427
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:54,780
post their mug or their shirt with this design that I have and the little tag there. I even

428
00:34:54,780 --> 00:35:00,880
have Liz send me one of the mugs with my design on it. So sometimes I get to have my tea in

429
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:05,480
my little mug with my design on it and it's nice and fun there.

430
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:12,520
It just reminds me of the power of art in any form really. Either digital stuff like

431
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:21,480
some of your design work, but also you've got these beautiful tattoos and some of your

432
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:28,040
painting stuff is pretty incredible. You were showing me a mask that you made out of all

433
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:32,320
sorts of stuff and it just feels like the string that ties all that together is artistry

434
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:37,160
and yet can help share some pretty powerful messages too.

435
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:45,040
Yeah. I feel like being creative is a pretty important part of my life in general. I feel

436
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:50,240
like that's something that people don't really do enough of, but that's very much a huge

437
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:57,680
driving force in my life. I mean, it's the way I solve problems. It's the way I approach

438
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:05,880
everything, literally everything. We were talking about even cooking and we were talking

439
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:12,320
about cooking vegetarians specifically and how people when they try to incorporate vegetables

440
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:19,640
in their diet if they're just eating meat a lot and they'll steam some broccoli and

441
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,440
be like, I hate this.

442
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:26,200
Because broccoli can shine, but not if it's boiled, right?

443
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:31,120
Yeah. Well, obviously you hate that. Look what you did to it.

444
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:38,000
There's a real artistry in your entire life, even in cooking. I agree with that completely.

445
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,960
Art in the kitchen can be such a delicious thing.

446
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:49,200
Yeah. Creativity through everything in life I think is a fun way to live life and a great

447
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,320
way to live life, for me at least.

448
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:56,640
I have noticed as well that you're pretty good with tech stuff and you're a gamer and

449
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:05,400
you bring in some of that artistry. Those often are seen as exclusive that art and technology

450
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:10,080
can't necessarily mix, but I think that's a completely a huge fallacy, right? It's like

451
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,360
one can increase the other.

452
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:17,640
It absolutely can. In fact, in that next room over there, hanging over the mantle, you'll

453
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,720
see a massive picture.

454
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,040
I do, yeah.

455
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:27,800
That is an art print from my favorite game, which is Portal 2.

456
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,960
Oh, that is such a great game.

457
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:38,940
And that picture is called Approaching Wheatly. Coincidentally, that print, the way I got

458
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:45,240
it is really interesting. Do you ever do Reddit gift swaps at Christmas?

459
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,360
No, but that sounds fascinating.

460
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:57,040
Oh, so Reddit does Christmas gift swaps. They do the biggest secret Santa in the world.

461
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:02,040
I used to do it every year and it's a lot of fun. Sometimes you'll get handmade things

462
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:09,200
from somebody in Lithuania or something. It's incredible. These absolutely charming and

463
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:15,360
wonderful things that you will get from other people and you'll get to know other people

464
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:18,960
that way. It's wonderful.

465
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:27,160
This person that I got matched with one year, almost a decade ago, he just fucking slayed

466
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:37,560
it. He went through my profile there on Reddit and saw that I love Portal 2 so much. He saw

467
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:43,520
that I'm a gamer. He saw that I'm an artist and love art and he found this art print.

468
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:49,680
It's a limited edition signed by the artist. Massive art print from my favorite game ever.

469
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:52,040
Oh my goodness. That's unbelievable.

470
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:59,400
When this came in the mail, I was floored. I did not know how to handle this. It was

471
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,400
so incredible.

472
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:08,020
I think anyone can do art and I have been really fortunate to have integrated photography

473
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:12,960
into my life. Previous to that, I hadn't had that much experience with artistic endeavors.

474
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:21,120
It was mostly because I came to technical topics much easier and much more easily like

475
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:28,680
science and especially computers, that's for sure. I realized that once you dive into technology,

476
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:34,480
there's a huge amount of creativity that goes into it. Solving problems, as you know, can

477
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:40,640
be a very creative endeavor. I've been lucky enough to see that with combining photography

478
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:49,020
and computers, but I encourage everybody to find some way of expressing yourself creatively.

479
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:50,640
It's such a wonderful outlet.

480
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:54,040
Jackie, can I ask you a question?

481
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,040
Go for it.

482
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:59,720
I was wondering if you had an ask of the community, of anybody listening, maybe something you'd

483
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,960
like them to try or to do?

484
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:08,320
Well, you're asking that at absolutely the perfect moment because my ask would be to

485
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:14,560
look for creative ways to do things in your life, whether that be to go out of your way

486
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:22,440
and paint a picture today or to go through your usual routine and add a little spice

487
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:32,280
into your lunch today or maybe find a colorful way to get to work, a little more scenic way

488
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,280
to get to work.

489
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,280
That's nice.

490
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:37,680
Find some way to add some creativity to your life.

491
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:41,480
Put on your artistic glasses and see the world in a slightly different way.

492
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,480
Absolutely.

493
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:46,400
That's lovely. If people want to get connected with you, where would you like to send them?

494
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:53,080
I am Jackie the Robot on Twitter and Instagram. I post a lot of bunny and art pics on Instagram.

495
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:56,360
It doesn't seem like you at all.

496
00:40:56,360 --> 00:41:03,040
No, not at all. My personal site is uselessprogress.com.

497
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,040
Nice.

498
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:08,280
And sirensofscream is just sirensofscream.com.

499
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,280
Great.

500
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,960
So it's easy.

501
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:15,260
That's wonderful. Thank you so much for chatting with me today. It's been a real pleasure.

502
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:18,480
Thank you for having me on. It's been absolutely wonderful getting to know you the past few

503
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,880
days and absolutely wonderful talking to you now.

504
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:36,480
Great. Yeah. Thanks for having me in your home and for sharing all of the bunny love.
