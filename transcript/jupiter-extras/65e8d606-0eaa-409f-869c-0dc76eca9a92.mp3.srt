00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,920
Hey, Billy, Daddy and I brought home a Windows Home Server to help organize our family.

2
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:10,920
What's that?

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,920
Well, Billy, a server is...

4
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:13,920
Me!

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,920
I'm a stay-at-home server!

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:16,920
Wow!

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,360
Let's go, Billy.

8
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,040
I'll show you what a stay-at-home server is all about.

9
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,240
I'll have him home by dinner.

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,640
Eh, keep him till morning.

11
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,640
All right, there we go.

12
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,640
That's it.

13
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,640
I guess that's all there is.

14
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,120
I could play the whole thing, but I'd have to go get the YouTube video.

15
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:37,720
I love that clip, though, because I bought that dumb home server that's in that cartoon.

16
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,480
All right, setting up for a live stream here.

17
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,640
If you're just getting on, we have the chat room up.

18
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,640
It's going.

19
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,640
Join me.

20
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,280
We've got a couple of things to talk about on the live stream, bit.ly slash Jupiter chat.

21
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,360
If you're listening to this on playback, well, thanks for just saying hi and checking us

22
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,360
out.

23
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,920
Just hanging out today.

24
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:01,960
We are in the Coder Pre-Show time zone right now, so I thought we'd have a few things to

25
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:02,960
talk about.

26
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:10,480
And I kind of wanted to start with trouble in NVIDIA land, it seems to persist.

27
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:15,080
If you thought all was well with NVIDIA on Linux, it is not so.

28
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:22,120
Matthew Miller, the lead of the Fedora project, tweeted about what he calls the NVIDIA conundrum.

29
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:28,120
The drivers on Linux are still in bad shape.

30
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,840
He says it's a Fedora perspective, but he thinks it's a shared problem, which I'm sure

31
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,480
he's right on that.

32
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:39,320
And he writes, on one hand, users just want their hardware to work.

33
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,320
I've got a laptop.

34
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,560
I've got an NVIDIA card.

35
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,280
Make it go, which I think that's true.

36
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,200
I think a lot of people feel that way, desktop, laptop, regardless.

37
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,360
He says, and I don't have anything against proprietary software.

38
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,000
I mean, I find it boring, but sure, keep your secrets.

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,840
Software patents are another issue, but that's not this thread.

40
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,200
But the exciting thing about Fedora and the free and open source software endeavor in

41
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,680
general is that we're building a shared common good, something that belongs to all of us.

42
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,120
It doesn't just belong to coders.

43
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,320
It doesn't just belong to billionaires.

44
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,480
It doesn't just belong to any shareholders.

45
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,040
It doesn't belong to an IP holder conglomerate.

46
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,360
It belongs to you and me, no matter who you are.

47
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,240
And I mean, literally you reading this, if you've tried a Linux distro, or if you've

48
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:28,080
used Corita or LibreOffice on Windows, or if you use WSL, or if you're even interested

49
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,720
in this whole world of amazing software is yours.

50
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,880
And you should feel that pride of ownership.

51
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:37,880
We're making a digital public good, something that advances the world for everyone.

52
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:42,400
And many big companies are part of it, pitching in and sharing code, ideas, paid time, other

53
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,400
resources.

54
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,400
And that's amazing.

55
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,080
For graphics, that includes Intel and AMD, because their participation in the whole shared

56
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:54,280
thing, if you install Fedora Linux, their hardware just works because of that.

57
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,720
And it works to the best of its potential.

58
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:02,560
Meanwhile, Nvidia is just, nah, they've intentionally been not part of the project of building a

59
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,320
shared thing, or they want to benefit from it, sell stuff that benefits from the collective

60
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,520
while keeping their own part walled off.

61
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:14,880
So going back to that first point, I see that they have such a dominant market position

62
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,460
right now.

63
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:21,080
That's a case to be made for papering that over, and doing a whole bunch of extra bending

64
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:26,720
over backwards work in the shared community to hide that they're not actually a participant,

65
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,200
to make it easy for users who shouldn't have to care.

66
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:35,320
But it sucks to spend effort that way, when all we have is limited resources and time.

67
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:39,480
I'd rather spend that on graphics card companies who are part of the whole open source project.

68
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:45,200
If you're going to do any special extra work, shouldn't it be for AMD or Intel GPUs?

69
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,900
We could make a special thing which detects Nvidia hardware and does kid glove special

70
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,900
handling to hide Nvidia's lack of support, but that really hides that we don't want

71
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,680
to do that for others.

72
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:58,280
It's tempting to do that, but also accompanying it with a rant like this one.

73
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,880
But that's just preaching to the wrong audience at the wrong time.

74
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,820
Again, users just want their hardware to go.

75
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:07,000
And a lecture while trying to do that is likely to backfire.

76
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,600
So honestly, I don't know what to do.

77
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,920
I've heard all the arguments for Dora and the Red Hat desktop team have done a huge

78
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,920
amount of papering over.

79
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,840
That's why it can work so smooth out of the box on other distros right now.

80
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,840
But I don't think any of that will make the situation better long term.

81
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,160
If you work at Nvidia and happen to see this, maybe you can make a difference.

82
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,800
Come on, join us.

83
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,000
Work directly on the Nuvu driver team, so it just works our Nuvu driver team, so it

84
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,880
just works on new hardware.

85
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,080
And for everyone else, tell Nvidia the same.

86
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,720
Redistributable binary kernel drivers really don't cut it.

87
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:46,280
They make us do extra work that would be better directed elsewhere, both users and distros,

88
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:51,720
and they sometimes literally make us choose between security updates and graphics.

89
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:56,600
Either way, Nvidia is in the position to make it better, and that's where you should push.

90
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,600
Okay.

91
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,200
Thread done, he says.

92
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,200
That's a...

93
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,680
Boy, that's a lot, right?

94
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,920
When I read that, I have actually a lot of mixed feelings.

95
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:12,840
Of course I am frustrated that Nvidia hasn't done better.

96
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:16,960
I've been frustrated for nearly 20 years that Nvidia hasn't done better.

97
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:22,760
I'm frustrated by this entire thing, because, you know, it feels like, I think at the root

98
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:29,100
of it, what bothers me is that it comes from a position of weakness on Linux's part.

99
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:36,400
Because the Linux desktop has essentially failed at getting a large market share, vendors,

100
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,840
maybe particularly arrogant vendors, are not forced to adapt.

101
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,280
And you know, in a lot of ways, free software is a radical idea.

102
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:52,780
And if you want a large corporate leader to adapt to your radical idea, you got to have

103
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:55,160
a lot of weight behind that demand.

104
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,920
And if you don't have a lot of weight behind that demand, there's really no incentive for

105
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:03,320
that large company to adapt to suit you.

106
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,280
Because you will have to adapt to suit them.

107
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:13,040
So if they do nothing, you're forced to adapt, and they save time and money.

108
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:17,460
So I'm frustrated because Linux has never really been in a position to have any leverage

109
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,880
in this conversation.

110
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:26,560
The best that we have is that enterprise deployments of render farms and other shops that use GPUs

111
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,600
at scale on Linux boxes need NVIDIA drivers often.

112
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,700
So that has compelled NVIDIA to a certain degree to support Linux.

113
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:40,640
But the irony of that situation is it's not really that big of a problem in the long-term

114
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:46,640
support distros like RHEL or Ubuntu 16.18.2004, et cetera, et cetera.

115
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,120
They don't change very much.

116
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,000
So NVIDIA doesn't have to do much to keep up with them.

117
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,760
Maybe the rare security patch here and there.

118
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,760
But everything's documented.

119
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,080
The APIs don't change.

120
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:04,440
And ironically, Red Hat and Canonical are likely making revenue by selling solutions

121
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,680
that accommodate that problem.

122
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:10,960
So in a really weird, twisted way, Matthew Miller's employer may actually be profiting

123
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:16,020
from the fact that some people have to accommodate for the NVIDIA driver at scale, and so they

124
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:20,240
are buying RHEL licenses, ironically.

125
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:26,120
And I think the reason why ultimately this has gotten me upset is because, boy, can I

126
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:30,200
really understand where Matthew's coming from here.

127
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:34,320
Imagine how frustrating it is when you have a limited amount of team availability, X amount

128
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:41,320
of team availability, and you have to spend that precious resource accommodating a vendor

129
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:47,640
who doesn't even try nearly as much as some of the other vendors who are now upstreaming

130
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,440
that code.

131
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,300
I get how annoying that is.

132
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,040
So I totally connect with that position.

133
00:07:54,040 --> 00:08:00,980
And as an end user, I connect with all the people who are so sick and tired of this problem.

134
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:07,040
People who are just longtime Linux users and have had to deal with this.

135
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,760
And of course, I have to acknowledge that there is a bit of history with Fedora in this

136
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,040
capacity, isn't there?

137
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:21,480
Fedora was one of the last standard desktop distros to properly support NVIDIA.

138
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:25,940
You know, and it took a lot of work for them to get it to that place.

139
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:31,240
So there's a bit of history here with this particular topic as well.

140
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:37,280
So you know, I find that to be a pretty difficult situation because it seems like there's a

141
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,280
no-win.

142
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:46,320
And, I don't know, maybe eight, nine years ago, there was a lot of talk about an open

143
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:51,280
source GPU, but it just didn't pan out, you know?

144
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,280
It just didn't pan out.

145
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,280
It just...

146
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,740
I mean, there's still a couple of them ongoing, actually.

147
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,920
So I shouldn't say it didn't pan out completely.

148
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:04,680
It's just evolved into different projects that haven't materialized in a consumer product.

149
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,040
And then of course, you see what Apple's doing with their whole M1.

150
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,800
They're just building their own GPU now.

151
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,240
They got in a fight with NVIDIA years ago over a faulty part in the MacBooks.

152
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,400
And now they're just moving on.

153
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,860
They're just moving on, I guess.

154
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:21,760
So we're going to hang out for a bit more because Mike is taking the week off to hunt

155
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,760
lizards.

156
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,160
Iguanas are a big problem down there.

157
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,560
I've already recorded the episode, so I'm hanging out with you guys.

158
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:39,440
A little boost!

159
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:46,240
Speaking of the M1 hardware, the Asahi Linux.org website for the Linux on Apple Silicon project

160
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,120
got a nice refresh.

161
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,840
People that are watching live, I have it up on the Vigistream right now.

162
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,400
And it's nice and clean and simple.

163
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:57,800
I bet you I could see this appealing to people who are Mac users.

164
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:02,000
And it's still early days over there, so we don't want to oversell it.

165
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,720
But they got links to the Wiki.

166
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:10,560
They got links to the release announcement that explains where they're at.

167
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,680
I don't know if I've actually said this on air.

168
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,280
I think we said it in Linux Unplugged.

169
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:20,200
But to get started, you just need Mac OS 12.3, obviously an M1 machine.

170
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:25,480
And then they just have you, all really safe and good things, curl a shell script and pipe

171
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,480
it to shell.

172
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,520
You just curl that thing.

173
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:32,520
And then the next thing you know, it's formatting your Mac and, well, that's at least resizing

174
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,520
your partition.

175
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,520
Oh, man.

176
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:42,720
Okay, so there's like a billionaire-sized elephant in the room.

177
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,520
I feel like we have to address the breaking news of the day.

178
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,960
This is CNN Breaking News.

179
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:52,520
All right, if you guys, you guys must have seen this because the whole internet is flipping

180
00:10:52,520 --> 00:11:02,320
out that Elon Musk has taken 10%-ish of Twitter, 9.2% of a passive stake in the Twitter corporation.

181
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,720
He sniped it at a low, low price, too.

182
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:14,360
And of course, then tweeted, when everybody found out, oh, hi, lol, incredible.

183
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:19,260
And then there's also a lot of people saying that this feels like a personal, like Elon's

184
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:22,540
just doing this because he's sick and tired of Twitter and it affects his life.

185
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:28,720
And that this purchase is only 1% of his net worth, 1% of his net worth there.

186
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,980
How about that?

187
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:34,960
This guy on Twitter says that for weeks, Elon Musk trashed Twitter and then purchased nearly

188
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:38,440
3 billion worth of Twitter shares for a low price on Friday.

189
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:46,000
This Friday, he made close to a billion dollars off of Twitter.

190
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Well way to go.

191
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,720
He sure, I mean, he sure knew, whoever's buying for Elon knew to buy at the right time.

192
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,720
That's pretty incredible.

193
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,080
$2.89 billion, Elon Musk buys Twitter.

194
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,180
What do you say chat room?

195
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,240
Is this a good thing, good or bad?

196
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,360
That's all you got to tell me, then we can go from there.

197
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,520
Is this a good thing or a bad thing?

198
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,520
Drop it in the chat room.

199
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:11,640
Tell me what you think because, you know, I don't really follow Elon that closely.

200
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:15,760
I'm obviously aware of all like some of the crazy stuff that he does and tweets and stuff

201
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,200
like that.

202
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,680
But I'm not sure if this is a good thing or a bad thing.

203
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:31,240
So go ahead and give it a spin, let me know, good or bad?

204
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,640
It's a mixed bag, everybody says.

205
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:38,960
Wow, wow, that was, that was really sort of, huh, you mean like almost everything is a

206
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,440
mixed bag actually?

207
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,520
Yeah, I suppose so.

208
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:45,080
I wonder how Twitter's doing in the stock market right now.

209
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:48,600
I wonder how the world is responding to this.

210
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,840
Seems like it's a mixed response overall.

211
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,440
MailChimp has disclosed a breach.

212
00:12:54,440 --> 00:13:03,240
Hackers accessed 319 accounts, stole audience data from 102 clients, and it has led to a

213
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,280
phishing scam that's already kicked off of crypto users.

214
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:10,600
And I don't mean to laugh, but it's just so damn impressive how fast those scams kick

215
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,600
off.

216
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,840
MailChimp has confirmed that their service has been compromised by an insider targeting

217
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,520
crypto companies.

218
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,600
Well that explains that.

219
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:27,000
That's why, ah, he writes, we've managed to take the phishing domain offline.

220
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,840
We're trying to determine how many email addresses have been affected.

221
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:34,520
Wow, that's coming from the Trezor wallet account.

222
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:41,600
So Trezor, which is probably the leading crypto hardware wallet, had their MailChimp list

223
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,680
compromised and they were targeted it looks like.

224
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:48,200
We will not be communicating by newsletter until the situation is resolved.

225
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:55,440
Do not open any emails appearing to come from Trezor until further notice.

226
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,640
They've taken the domain down.

227
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:00,760
Damn, that is a shitty situation because those guys are supposed to be all about hardware.

228
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:04,960
Now it doesn't actually compromise your account or your device, but they can send you an email.

229
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:09,640
And you know the internet, people are already clicking that thing.

230
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:15,240
You know one thing people could consider if you use a mail client like Thunderbird, and

231
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:21,960
a lot of Kmail, a lot of clients will do this, is you could turn off HTML email rendering.

232
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:26,300
And then a lot of clients will let you turn it on per email.

233
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,120
And that really solves a lot of this.

234
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,920
You know, don't open attachments, that kind of stuff.

235
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,320
Don't use Windows.

236
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:41,400
But you just turn off HTML email and you solve a lot of these problems.

237
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:47,600
I feel like MailChimp needs to explain a little more about what happened there though.

238
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,520
I do not like that.

239
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,600
That seems bad.

240
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,600
That seems real bad.

241
00:14:53,600 --> 00:15:01,240
Ask not what your podcast can boost for you, but what you can boost for your podcast.

242
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:07,800
Cardano Nerd sent us 115 sats in response to last week's episode of Koda Radio, episode

243
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,160
459.

244
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:15,720
And in that episode we were talking about, okay well, what if you like the idea of decentralized

245
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,800
blockchain technology, you're not really sure if any of this crap is going to stick around

246
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:24,160
for very long, but if you wanted to make a bet today for a development platform, which

247
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,160
one would you consider?

248
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:30,400
And I think Solana came up quick on Mike's radar, but I kind of said maybe put Solana

249
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,880
in a watch and wait area.

250
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:35,600
I think that one, you know, I think it's a pets.com of crypto.

251
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,280
I think Solana is going to do really good for a while, then eventually it's going to

252
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,720
topple.

253
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,560
But it looks like Cardano Nerd agrees, based on the name, that he says here, I came to

254
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,000
the same conclusion about the chains you mentioned.

255
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Cardano's the way to go.

256
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,120
I was cheering down the interstate listening.

257
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,120
Thank you.

258
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,120
Thank you.

259
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,640
Yeah, so the computer guy asked why disable HTML?

260
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:58,980
Because a lot of these things that are downloading images in the background, first of all that

261
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:02,720
pings their server and lets you know that it's a live email inbox, and then they can

262
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,120
start targeting that.

263
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:08,920
But also if there's anything that's exploitable in your email client that's, like maybe it's

264
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:13,280
in a web browser, or maybe it's Outlook and it's using embedded edge.

265
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,540
I don't know how they do it anymore.

266
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:18,560
But if there's any vulnerabilities in the renderer of that email that can be triggered

267
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:23,120
by HTML, if you turn off the HTML, then you're just getting plain text.

268
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,760
Nothing in there is getting rendered.

269
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,100
Nothing's getting executed.

270
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,100
Nothing like that.

271
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:31,280
So it's just a layer of safety because it basically makes your email inert text, which

272
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,520
is always going to be safer, right?

273
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:38,280
And you know, I don't do it myself because I use webmail, and so I don't really have

274
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,880
a choice.

275
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,520
So it's not a hard rule that I follow.

276
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,800
But I actually do think it does make a difference.

277
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:53,480
Fortnite raises $144 million for Ukraine relief.

278
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:57,120
After two weeks after Epic Games said all of its Microsoft proceeds from the game would

279
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:04,260
go to humanitarian efforts, Alphabet's Wing Division plans to begin drone delivery services

280
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:08,960
in the Dallas-Fort Worth area on April 7th, starting with Walgreens and health and wellness

281
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,040
products from Walgreens.

282
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:14,680
I think this is going to be huge, you guys.

283
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:21,760
I really think that drone delivery is probably what industry is going to do in an attempt

284
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,600
to sort out the truck problem.

285
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:28,200
I just watched a documentary this morning, actually, from the Wall Street Journal.

286
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:31,000
It was about, I think it was about 10 days ago they released it.

287
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,160
So it's probably on their YouTube channel, if you're curious.

288
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:39,240
And it was sort of a, this is why the supply chain is going to be really screwed up.

289
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:43,920
Even if we get it resolved at the ports and in China, the trucking industry inside the

290
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:49,880
US is completely falling apart in a very dramatic, very profound way.

291
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,700
And it's really looking rough.

292
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:57,120
And so you can see in there, and they kind of get into this, companies like Walmart and

293
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:04,080
Amazon and apparently Google and others really are investing heavily into drones now.

294
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,960
And I just saw a drone now that's getting up to like a hundred pound, 200 pound loads.

295
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:12,920
It looks more like a military drone than it does actually a delivery drone.

296
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,160
It doesn't look anything like a DJI.

297
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:21,440
Oh, they have some video of it here too, fascinating.

298
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,800
I think this is a render, but this is the idea.

299
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,880
Oh, and the packaging swings, it's kind of like loose.

300
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:32,240
We launched two sites there, then we launched in Helsinki and Finland, then we launched

301
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,240
in Virginia.

302
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,200
That was our first site in the United States.

303
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:41,480
And then it was really exciting in October of 2021, we announced Texas as our next service

304
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,480
area.

305
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:49,440
So we're north of Dallas in the city of Frisco and Little Elm.

306
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,820
Wing is a company that's trying to solve for convenience with environment in play.

307
00:18:54,820 --> 00:19:00,920
In many ways, Wing is a software company, but on top of that, we actually design drones

308
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,360
for commercial use.

309
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:06,080
Interesting that they don't mention it's part of Google.

310
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,640
The thing about getting into this new industry, many people don't know what they don't know.

311
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,200
And so they're going to get a service that they've never seen before.

312
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:18,200
Yeah, I like drones.

313
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,320
People who live here, you are going to be some of the first people in the United States

314
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,200
to experience our service.

315
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,440
So what that means is we have an app, you'll see a marketplace within the app.

316
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,160
Let's say you need some mouthwash, toothpaste and deodorant.

317
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:34,920
So you put those things in your cart and then you add your address.

318
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:39,700
You'll see a delivery zone, maybe two, maybe three, just depending on your home.

319
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,700
You'll pick that.

320
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:44,680
Let's say you want to be comfy, stay in your PJs, you click the backyard today.

321
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,480
And then you do it from the metaverse.

322
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,480
It's all cool.

323
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:50,720
You never have to leave your house ever again.

324
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:55,760
I mean, of course, then there's the businessman of me who says, well, maybe I need a mic cable

325
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,760
in order to go on air.

326
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,960
Sure would love having a microphone cable.

327
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,960
I don't know.

328
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:03,920
I've always been told and I've always heard that if they launch these things in Texas,

329
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,600
I'm going to shoot it out of the sky.

330
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,600
So we'll see, because that's where they're launching it first.

331
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:12,440
They're going to launch it in Texas in the Dallas, Fort Worth area.

332
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,440
They're doing it on April 7th.

333
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:17,120
So that's coming in pretty, pretty soon.

334
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:21,160
Hey, I want to mention we have a new sponsor for Koder radio, which I would have read on

335
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:25,840
the air today, but it's already over, but it's tail scale, which I think a lot of you

336
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,120
probably are familiar with tail scale.

337
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:31,160
That's tailscale.com slash Koder, and it'd be great to just give them a, this is their

338
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:34,840
first episode, the beginning of the quarter kind of go figure we're doing a prerecord

339
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,280
this week.

340
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:39,440
So give them a little, give them a little JB love, because I think that's an awesome

341
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,440
sponsor.

342
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:44,640
And if you go to tailscale.com slash Koder, you'll get your first 20 devices for free.

343
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,160
Of course, you're letting them know that you're supporting JB.

344
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:55,100
If you're not familiar, tail scale has become my go to mesh wire guard VPN solution.

345
00:20:55,100 --> 00:21:01,880
So I have created a flat mesh network of a lot of my devices, including my Bitcoin node,

346
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:07,080
my laptops, my phone, my tablet, a couple of VMs.

347
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:12,160
I've created this large mesh VPN network and I use tail scale to manage all of that.

348
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:17,920
And the sweet thing is tail scale takes like two minutes to set up.

349
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:21,280
It's you're going to, you're going to be blown away how fast you could get a wire guard VPN

350
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,040
up and going.

351
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:31,000
And so give them a little go give them a little Monday boost tailscale.com slash Koder.

352
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,200
Sometimes I feel like I'm the Commodore 64.

353
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,200
That's right.

354
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,960
Tailscale.com slash Koder.

355
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,560
And just, you know, try it out.

356
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,960
If nothing else, go load the page.

357
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:48,120
So we get a little hit on the web counter, but I think even better go over there and

358
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:51,640
sign up and try it out.

359
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:54,920
So that way they say, holy smokes, we signed up for this Koder radio podcast and we're

360
00:21:54,920 --> 00:22:00,000
just getting such great results because that is a sponsor I'd love to work with for a while.

361
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,120
They're a super cool company, super cool tool.

362
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,160
And I frickin love wire guard.

363
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,160
Frickin love it.

364
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,160
All right.

365
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,160
So I think I'm just looking at everything.

366
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,160
So that's probably it.

367
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,160
That's probably it.

368
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,800
I'm going to read a couple of boosts and then I think I'll probably get the heck out of

369
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,800
here.

370
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:17,800
Chat room, if you got any thoughts on anything we talked about, drop them in that IRC.

371
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,920
Our matrix server is still up, but it's in rough shape.

372
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:25,600
It's standing, but it's standing just barely.

373
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,000
The computer guy says, as a Texan, I don't think it's going to be a problem.

374
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,520
Random hackers with GPS spoofers are stealing packages.

375
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,000
That might be an issue though.

376
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,560
It's the high tech version.

377
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,560
That's great.

378
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:41,320
Kpox says, I'm pretty sure even in Texas it's illegal to randomly fire into the air.

379
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,320
Yeah, I know.

380
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:47,480
That's why I always thought when people always said to me, when people always said, oh yeah,

381
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,560
I'm going to shoot it down if it's up here in the air.

382
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,120
I'm going to shoot that thing.

383
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,160
I always thought, really though?

384
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,160
Are you really?

385
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:57,180
Cause like you're going to probably have the cops show up because somebody's probably going

386
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,180
to turn you in.

387
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:00,120
All right, let's load up the old boost page here.

388
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,440
It takes a second because boost.

389
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:06,240
There's a lot of boosts there and thanks you guys for sending those in.

390
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,840
These things, you know, here's the thing though.

391
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,320
How long until it's, how long until these things are delivering a meal?

392
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,280
How long until they're delivering a meal?

393
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,840
That's, that's going to be no time at all.

394
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,880
I'll tell you what.

395
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,880
All right.

396
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,680
So, uh, our first boost, come on, there we go.

397
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:31,780
Our first boost came in and said, hello to Chris and the team.

398
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:33,800
Thanks for everything you do.

399
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,800
Boosting is getting addicting.

400
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,520
That was in response to episode four 59.

401
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,520
Thank you.

402
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,520
Uh, Petar.

403
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:45,440
P E T A R. I'm going to say Petar, what do you think?

404
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,440
I don't know.

405
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,440
I don't know.

406
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,920
I'm not sure about that.

407
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:54,920
Uh, user 46, uh, wrote in with a boost askewt boost.

408
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,200
This is the first time we use Bitcoin.

409
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,200
It seems legitimate.

410
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,520
I'm glad you did the stream to help people get set up.

411
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,680
It's more complex than it should be.

412
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:05,680
I had to have a 30 sat cover for this, for a 2000 sat wallet.

413
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:08,060
You know, if you don't know what we're talking, what he's talking about, I did a live stream

414
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:12,840
that we posted over at extras dot show, uh, which I thought was fun.

415
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:16,400
We covered a little bit of community stuff that we're working on some, some JB behind

416
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,840
the scenes news, um, cause we're heading out soon.

417
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:25,880
He sent me a DM with, oh yeah, okay, thanks.

418
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:26,880
That's great.

419
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,520
Uh, I'm having trouble accepting DMS at the moment because of the load of the server.

420
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:33,920
So I may not have seen it yet.

421
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:37,200
I'm at maximum, maximum server load, I guess.

422
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:43,720
So I haven't gotten to a couple of D a couple of DMS are just like, uh, failed to load today.

423
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:48,640
It's like Mike says, it feels like the Commodore 64 sometimes I feel like I'm the Commodore

424
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,640
64.

425
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,640
Yeah.

426
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,640
That's how I feel too sometimes.

427
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:57,740
Cause it's just so dang slow, but, and go figure it happens right as we're leaving to

428
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:58,820
go to North Carolina.

429
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:00,560
So we're all going to be traveling.

430
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,560
I hope it loads.

431
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,160
I hope it continues to run.

432
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,640
Maybe we could reboot everything once before we go.

433
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,360
And then when we get back, I think we're just going to have to try to hit that as hard as

434
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,360
possible.

435
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:14,120
It's just go figure that it happens just as we're like backing up.

436
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,680
Uh, that's, that's it.

437
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,680
Isn't it?

438
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,680
That's how it always goes.

439
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,680
Anyways.

440
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,840
I'm going to wrap it up there.

441
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,080
Coder is already recorded this week.

442
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,080
So you get that.

443
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,680
It'll be in the feeds in a little bit.

444
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,400
Thank you for joining me today and hanging out.

445
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,400
Join me next Monday.

446
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,400
Hopefully the show will be back to its regular time and good luck to Mike on hunting those

447
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,400
iguanas.

448
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,080
Hopefully he gets them things.

449
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,280
Those things got salmonella in their poop.

450
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,280
It's true.

451
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,280
That's a real fact.

452
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:43,280
I don't know how, I don't know why there's so many of them, but it's all true.

453
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,280
All right.

454
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,280
Thanks for hanging out.

455
00:25:45,280 --> 00:26:09,280
We'll see you next time.
