1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,400
Well, hello, everyone. This is Brunch with Brent. I am so pleased to be joined today

2
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,680
by Alan Pope. Popey, how are you doing today?

3
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,160
I'm doing very well. It's Friday, so end of the week, getting ready for the weekend.

4
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,680
Of course. We're lucky to be recording on a Friday here. It's seeming very quiet this

5
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:34,200
Friday, so it's a good day to be doing this kind of stuff. And of course, we are on completely

6
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,520
different time zones for you. You're in the UK, right?

7
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:44,040
Yeah, we're on the time zone. Everyone should be on, you know, UTC. Everyone should just

8
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,240
switch to UTC.

9
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:51,960
The standard. Everybody else is lesser. So for me, it's midday. For you, it's a little

10
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,920
bit later. But yeah, great to be connected with you. Could you give us a little bit of

11
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,760
introduction? Some people already know you. I know that. But can you introduce yourself

12
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,920
for some of those who might not?

13
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:10,040
Yeah, so I'm some guy on the internet who uses Ubuntu. And I used it enough that I got

14
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:17,080
hired by Canonical to start working on Ubuntu. So since 2011, I've had a number of roles

15
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:27,280
at Canonical. I'm, as I said, based in the UK. And I'm an enthusiastic fan of computers

16
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:33,400
in general and IBM ThinkPads specifically. I also like cats.

17
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,280
You're starting to get known for that, right?

18
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,640
Yeah, just a bit.

19
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,960
You were mentioning cats. I heard a cat in there somewhere.

20
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:49,160
I live with my wife and two children. And we've had cats ever since we moved in together.

21
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:56,960
And yeah, a bit of a fan of cats. Even just laying in bed at night, I'll browse the cats

22
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:05,640
subreddit. And there's also a subreddit that Joe introduced me to called Chonkers. And

23
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:13,080
it's like large cats. And so I'll just sit and browse our Chonkers and just tap my wife

24
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,760
on the shoulder and show her my phone and it will just be a big fat cat waddling down

25
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,480
the street or something.

26
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,440
Perfect bedtime content, right?

27
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,440
Exactly.

28
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:27,000
That's pretty funny. Yeah, I did notice that you have a cat emoji in your Twitter handle

29
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
currently.

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:41,520
I put emojis in my Twitter handle intentionally. And I try and insert emojis in fields on websites.

31
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,600
Not to break them, but in order to uncover bugs, because there are some websites that

32
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:53,280
still don't support emojis. And this all came about years ago when Fedora Linux had a code

33
00:02:53,280 --> 00:03:00,440
name called Schrodinger's cat. And the name Schrodinger has an apostrophe and an accented

34
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:05,440
character in it and it broke the bug tracker and it broke a few tools around the release

35
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,720
of Fedora. And someone in the Ubuntu project rather confidently claimed that it wouldn't

36
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:16,360
happen here. And I thought, hmm, I bet it would. So I started changing my launchpad

37
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:22,840
name to have emoji characters in and sure enough, I broke stuff. Most recently Thunderbird

38
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:29,380
email client, if people get emails from me, they'll see a list of email and then mine

39
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:37,960
will be in the middle at like 72 point text for some reason. There's some bug in Thunderbird,

40
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:42,280
but it's great because they're scrolling through their email and then suddenly mine jumps out

41
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:49,860
at them. So it was successful finding bugs by just putting emoji all over the place.

42
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,600
So yeah, there was method behind that madness.

43
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,560
I suppose you're getting a lot of replies to your emails as well.

44
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:01,640
Well, more angry ones saying, Oh God, another email from Alan, especially people who are

45
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:07,180
subscribed to bug trackers. Like if you subscribe to the launchpad bug tracker, it's mostly

46
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:12,840
people who work for Canonical. So people who work on NumShell or back in the day Unity

47
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,600
and I would file a bug and so they would get bug mail and it would say from Alan Pope and

48
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:24,340
it would, my bugs would stand out a lot more than anyone else's because giant emoji penguin

49
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:27,840
took up half their screen.

50
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,400
That's one way to get things at the top of the priority.

51
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,940
Exactly, exactly. But it uncovers, there's two things there. There's, I've got attention

52
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:40,280
for the bug that I actually filed, but then there's also clearly a bug in their email

53
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,280
client that we have now discovered that that also needs to be raised and that's probably

54
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:48,720
going to be fixed more quickly because it annoys more people whenever I send them an

55
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,240
email. So yeah, double win.

56
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:58,560
Two bugs in one. That's great. But that shows just the importance as well of testing fringe

57
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:05,820
cases, right? And you've kind of taken it upon yourself to test a whole bunch of services.

58
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:10,760
Have you found any bugs in other services that you're not so related to on a daily basis?

59
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:18,080
So sometimes, yeah, like I get frustrated when you sign up for something and they don't

60
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:24,200
allow certain characters in email addresses or, you know, it's often, nerds will often

61
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:29,220
tag their emails with a plus sign and some characters or a dash and some characters in

62
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:36,200
order to, if the email address spreads and is used for sending unsolicited spam, you

63
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:41,080
can tell where it originated, right? And there are a lot of websites that don't accept those

64
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,560
tagged email addresses. They don't accept a plus sign as a valid character in an email

65
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:50,440
and I kind of rant at those companies. But it's unfortunate because they probably just

66
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:55,480
bought an off-the-shelf web package or they just didn't realize that a plus sign is something

67
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:59,920
people use in email addresses and they're probably not going to fix it. But it still

68
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:06,160
makes me a bit cross. Yeah, but I like breaking stuff. I like discovering, pushing the boundaries

69
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:13,480
of software and doing stupid stuff with software in order to identify bugs. I did one a little

70
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:18,560
while ago where I have a tendency to hold down keys on the keyboard to see if that breaks

71
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:24,100
anything because people don't do that. And there's a couple I've found by doing this.

72
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:29,960
If you hold down the mute button on a ThinkPad, there's a hardware mute button, you know,

73
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:36,720
the media keys. Some years ago, I discovered that if you just hold that down, it mutes

74
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:43,400
and then un-mutes, so auto-repeats. But after a while, it gets out of sync with the mute

75
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:48,080
indicator on your desktop. So you get to the point where you press the mute key and the

76
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,560
light comes on to say it's muted, but the thing goes off on the desktop to say you're

77
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:58,480
not muted. And so they're completely out of sync. So I filed a bug and one of the guys

78
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:02,680
on the desktop, I filed a bug saying, if you hold down the mute key, it gets out of sync

79
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:07,080
with the indicator. And the reply from someone on the desktop team was, why would you do

80
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,960
that? I'm like, doesn't matter. I did do it.

81
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:16,160
Well, you know, I was, because I have a ThinkPad in front of me here in X220 with that mute

82
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,000
button, I was tempted when you first started explaining it to give it a try. And then I

83
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,040
thought, I better not.

84
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:27,640
That's the other flip side is sometimes you find bugs that if you tell someone to do it,

85
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:32,160
you have to give them a warning beforehand. So there was a similar bug where if you hold

86
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:39,000
down the print screen key, when you press print screen, it flashes the screen either

87
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:46,180
black or white to like a photo being taken and makes a photo sound and takes a screenshot.

88
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:50,760
And it's, it does this kind of fade effect. And I discovered that the print screen key

89
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:56,220
on one release of Ubuntu auto repeats. And so if you hold down the print screen key,

90
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:03,040
it will rapidly fire off multiple screenshots and it will keep trying to flash the screen

91
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:10,840
repeatedly causing your machine to eventually lock up because it's trying to do this 3D

92
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:16,360
composited fade effect. And so I, I dropped by the Ubuntu desktop team channel and said,

93
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:21,180
Hey, I think I've discovered a bug. Hold down the print screen key. One of the guys, Will

94
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:26,800
Cook held down the print screen key and that, as far as he concerned, locked up his machine.

95
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,640
And I, and he didn't see the very next line that I typed, which was by the way, this will

96
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:40,680
lock up your machine fair warning. Yeah, a bit too late. So yeah, I like doing that kind

97
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,680
of thing.

98
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,920
I've learned recently that in software development and even like web development, those kinds

99
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:49,760
of things, that's actually a surprisingly important part is having someone on the team

100
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,080
or a few people or someone in the public who is intentionally trying to break things, you

101
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:59,920
know, trying to push the boundaries of what the defined use cases perhaps. Is there a

102
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,780
word for that kind of, I think it's fuzzy, fuzzy testing. Okay. I think you're fuzzing.

103
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:08,400
Some people call it fuzzing. It's just like doing stuff that's outside the boundaries

104
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:13,960
of a fixed set of tests. I'm not a QA person. I just, you know, pretend to be one really

105
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:22,960
well. And it's not uncommon for people to re do a software release and then ping me

106
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:27,000
and say, Hey, I've made this thing. And then within minutes I'll tell them I found a bug

107
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,680
like very quickly. I'll find a bug because I'll just do stupid things with the software.

108
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:37,460
Just like resize the window as small as possible or make the window as big as all of my displays

109
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:43,280
just to see what the dialogue does. And, and that exploratory testing, you can't really

110
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:48,040
automate. You need human beings to do stupid stuff because unfortunately human beings do

111
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,800
stupid stuff.

112
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:55,480
We're very good at that. Yeah. One of my pet peeves, and it happened to me two days ago,

113
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:01,680
I was trying to sign up for a conference and I had to create an account and this happens

114
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,160
all the time. You can probably relate, you've probably run into it, but I use a password

115
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:09,960
manager, which everyone should, if you're not currently like get out of the nineties,

116
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:14,120
I guess. Um, and so I use long passwords cause why not? They're all unique and stuff and

117
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:19,440
I don't have to remember them. So, um, so my pet peeve is that on some registration

118
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:25,180
pages, when you put in a long password, it auto truncates the password without really

119
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:30,400
showing you or telling you or giving you any sort of warning. What? Yeah, I've run into

120
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:35,880
this a few times. That's insane. I know. And so I put in the password and it doesn't complain

121
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:41,400
and you hit okay. And then it immediately, you know, it should send you like a confirmation

122
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:45,800
email so that you can, uh, you can say, yep, I actually did that, which you have a story

123
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:51,800
about that, uh, which we might get into. Um, but upon clicking yes on that registration

124
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:56,240
email and coming back to log in, the password doesn't work and it's because it gets truncated

125
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,900
to some, I don't know, it, it's not an arbitrary number, but it's some kind of defined number

126
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:04,880
in their system. And then, uh, and then you can't get in, you have to do, so I had to

127
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,400
do a password reset immediately the first time I tried to log in, which is a pretty

128
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:13,800
bad user experience. So I, whenever I run into that kind of stuff, I try to give someone

129
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:18,240
some information, but, uh, yeah, it's surprising that we're still dealing with that kind of

130
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,240
stuff.

131
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:24,960
Yeah. I, I get frustrated with the web forms that don't let you copy and paste. I know

132
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:29,520
my email address. I, you know, it's pretty short. I'm not going to mistype it. And if

133
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:34,360
I just double click it and paste it in the next line, I'm pretty confident everything's

134
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:39,280
going to be all right. But there are some websites where they use funky JavaScript to

135
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:46,720
disable paste, um, which is just ridiculous. I mean, I guess, I guess, you know, you have

136
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:54,160
to protect against the archetypal idiot user who, you know, is able to operate a microwave

137
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:59,980
oven and nothing more powerful than that. But it doesn't help when there are people

138
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:05,680
out there who actually can use these computer things quite well. And you just frustrate

139
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:10,080
those people. It must be difficult balancing act. I'm glad I don't maintain websites for

140
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,080
a living.

141
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,320
That's what I've realized is sometimes by implementing some of those strategies, you're

142
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:19,920
actually taking away from some strategies for really good security as well. So you're

143
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,120
leaving everybody kind of in the middle. Uh, so you're not allowing bad security, but you're

144
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:28,140
also not allowing very good security. You're just allowing like, like, like some websites

145
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:32,400
having a eight character password must. It's like, you can't go over. You can't go under

146
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:36,600
is like, well, really? Are we still with that? Eight past eight characters?

147
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:41,480
Yeah, the fact that there is a finite number of eight character passwords just makes this

148
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,480
just ludicrous.

149
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:49,560
Yeah, I feel like we should be past that by now. Um, you ran in recently into a situation

150
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:54,040
that we don't necessarily need to mention, uh, the business, but you ran into a situation

151
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:59,200
where they weren't, uh, doing verification emails either. And, uh, that gave you a bit

152
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,200
of trouble, right?

153
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,840
Yeah, I see a lot of that. There's a lot of companies that will, they're eager for you

154
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:08,080
to sign up for their service. And so just visiting their website and punching in your

155
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:15,480
email address basically signs you up. And it's pretty common for me to get signed up

156
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:21,800
for stuff where people have just put in an email address, maybe slightly wrong. Um, and

157
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:27,000
I get the email because I own a domain. I get all emails for that domain. And so people

158
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:33,960
will put in something at the domain.com. Um, and sometimes it's, uh, it can be seen as

159
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:39,800
malicious and sometimes it's just stupidity, but I get signed up for stuff and then immediately

160
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:45,840
get signed up for marketing emails or, you know, promotions for their other products.

161
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:52,560
And those are really hard to get off when it's not Mike, I bought a thing from you.

162
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:57,400
I am a customer. We have a relationship and I would like to hear about your new products.

163
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:01,200
Please sign me up for your newsletter. It's not even that it's randomly out of the blue.

164
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:05,920
I get signed up for a random thing that I've never heard of that I don't care about. I

165
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:14,760
don't want, I will never use. And Oh, here comes the newsletter as well. It's like, no,

166
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:21,000
just aggravating the situation. Yeah. I have a tendency to rant at people a little bit

167
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:27,520
when they do that kind of stuff because it's just, it's just rude. It's just not nice.

168
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:32,640
You got in contact with someone or at least you signaled to someone that that was happening.

169
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:39,680
Did you get a good end result with them connecting with you? I felt kind of bad. I always, I,

170
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,600
you know, I should do that count to 10, you know, look out the window, think about what

171
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,840
this is like from their perspective. And then I just think, no, screw it. They should not

172
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:53,040
have implemented this badly and they did, they should do better. And so I tweeted at

173
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:59,800
them and got nothing. And then I got a newsletter the next day. I was like, okay, this is enough.

174
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:04,200
So I tweeted at them again from another account and you know, rather aggressively said they're

175
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:11,480
doing it wrong. And I got a sincere apology and you know, by the way, we use your products.

176
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:20,680
I'm like, Oh God, why did you have to say that? I feel doubly guilty now, but you know,

177
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:25,520
but they shouldn't have done it. You know, pragmatically speaking, they screwed up. It

178
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:30,080
wasn't my fault that they signed me up for a thing I didn't ask for and then sign me

179
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:35,320
up for their newsletter that I didn't ask for more things you didn't ask for.

180
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:39,440
But I would consider that one of those bugs that you're talking about as well. It's like,

181
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,240
it's just another form of bug, right? You know, it's a bug in their strategy, I guess,

182
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,240
to get people on.

183
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:51,760
Yeah. And I think too many people are keen to get people signed up and it's a numbers

184
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:57,920
game. You know, once you get a certain number of thousands of people signed up, a percentage

185
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:04,760
of those will be converted into paying customers. And you know, you've got to aggressively market

186
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:12,840
at those people who are the 99.9% of non-paying customers to try and convert them and upsell

187
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:19,960
them some special offer without considering that some of those 99.9% of people don't actually

188
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:25,080
care and maybe they just signed up because they want to see what your product is.

189
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:32,520
And you know, over the years I've signed up for products just to see what it is and see

190
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:37,480
what the product can do. And I can probably figure that out myself from playing with a

191
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:43,080
demo or reading their material on their website, which may be hidden behind a login screen.

192
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:48,120
And then five years later I get a marketing email from them. I think, where the hell is

193
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:52,240
this from? And I search my email and I find I signed up for them five years ago just to

194
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:58,380
look at the product. I was like, you don't have to do that. You know, I very clearly

195
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:05,800
am not an engaged participant in your community. I'm very, very obviously not a customer. Don't

196
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:12,880
try and upsell to me by harvesting your entire email address portfolio of everyone who's

197
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:18,120
ever mentioned your product or looked at it or breathed near your website. Not every single

198
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,280
one of them can be converted into a customer.

199
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:30,160
Yeah, exactly. I wanted to bring up, you mentioned a long time ago Wimpy, because I was going

200
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:37,360
to think that the emojis in your Twitter handle were because of Wimpy's influence. I know

201
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:42,120
he has a tendency to use them a little bit everywhere. And I thought that was your way

202
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:48,360
of kind of supporting him in that. But I see now that there may be a different strategy

203
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,360
there.

204
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:57,000
But the other way around, I think I have unfortunately unleashed the beast on Martin of emoji because

205
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:03,360
yeah, I've been putting emoji in all over the places since, well, since whoever it was

206
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:08,560
on the Launchpad team erroneously thought that Launchpad was impervious to these kind

207
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:13,080
of problems. But I haven't been using them quite so much on social media. So I think

208
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:21,640
that's both of us. Because both Martin and I have access to a number of work social media

209
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:28,540
accounts, both on our desktop browser and on our mobile phones. So yeah, we can often

210
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:35,200
be out and about and have an idea for some social thing that we should do and post it.

211
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:46,000
And Martin is very clear in basing his social posts on data. So he has data that suggests

212
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,720
that if you put an image in a social post, it's going to perform better than just plain

213
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:59,340
text. And shorter social posts perform better than longer ones. And ones that have up to

214
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:04,360
three emojis perform better than the ones that have none. Now, they perform differently

215
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:12,480
with different demographics, obviously. But that's the basis, I think, for where Martin's

216
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:19,880
love of emoji comes from. And it's quite infectious. And so I've started using them as well quite

217
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:25,800
a lot in my social posts. I did one today because as we recall, this is Black Friday.

218
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:30,680
So I thought I'd do a social post about it being Black Friday and we have an Ubuntu exclusive

219
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:38,080
special offer to download the desktop for free on Black Friday. And to follow it up

220
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,800
with another tweet that was like note also available for free every other day of the

221
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,800
year.

222
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,800
I thought that was a great deal.

223
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:53,400
Yeah, totally. It's while stocks last, grab that ISO image. Yeah, it's all pretty stupid.

224
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:58,040
But it's just a bit of fun and a bit light hearted because sometimes the social media

225
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:05,160
posts can seem very sterile, corporate, boring. And so we try and lighten the mood a little

226
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:11,720
bit and make them a bit less dull. And we do that a little bit with emojis with some

227
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:14,920
animated gifs, maybe a video here and there or something like that.

228
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:19,160
Yeah, I think, you know, we have to remember that we are talking to other human beings

229
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:26,600
who have some necessity for comedy in their lives as well, right? Martin explained in

230
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:31,500
the brunch with Brent that we did together a few weeks ago, how exactly what you said

231
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:39,000
data was driving that decision, but also his desire to just make the communities feel a

232
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,680
little bit better, like to just bring some light heartedness to these otherwise, you

233
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:48,240
know, sometimes very technical discussions, like a release post or something like that.

234
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,000
And I thought that was really lovely.

235
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,380
It's funny, we, we did a post a little while ago, which were one of when one of the releases

236
00:20:55,380 --> 00:21:01,920
came out, I think it was when 1904 came out, which is an interim non long term support

237
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:10,800
release. And I put a poll up that I thought was fun. And it said something like 1904 is

238
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:18,160
out, are you going to upgrade? And option one was LTS for life. Option two was, you

239
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:22,960
know, I've already upgraded. I can't remember what option three was. Oh, option three was

240
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:29,200
something like still running Ubuntu 7.10 or something like that. And the final one was

241
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:34,920
by the way, I use arch. And whenever you do a poll on the internet, obviously, by the

242
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:41,480
way, I use arch is the winner, of course, obviously. But we engaged with people replying

243
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:46,480
and suggesting this was a stupid idea for a poll from Ubuntu to talk about, you know,

244
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:52,120
a different Linux distro, which is a bit of fun. It's just, you know, it's Friday afternoon.

245
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:56,880
People need a little bit of amusement in their life. And someone took a screen grab of that

246
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:02,840
with the poll, posted it on Reddit, and was like, this isn't going well for them. As if

247
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:08,400
what, like we're gonna change from being Ubuntu to like, right, that's it, I'm gonna quit

248
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:13,720
and I'm switching to arch. As a result of this stupid poll I did on a Friday afternoon.

249
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:18,960
It was just a bit of fun. But the replies were great. And they were like, you know,

250
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,400
someone replied they're saying something like whoever's their social media manager is killing

251
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:32,920
it. And I'm like, well, thanks. It's funny, though, how something that's intended to just

252
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:38,240
be kind of light hearted can just get taken in so many directions. One of the things that

253
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:48,520
we've always tried to do in the Ubuntu project is not rain on any other project. You generally

254
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:56,960
won't find canonical employees and Ubuntu members dissing other projects. Like we won't

255
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:04,360
talk down another Linux distribution or talk down the people who make another Linux distribution,

256
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:10,120
because we're already 1% of the market. Like why? Why would we do that? Like my friend

257
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:17,120
Michael Hall says, if you blow out someone else's candle, it doesn't make your candle

258
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:22,720
any brighter. And so it doesn't make sense, even if we are competitors, and I use that

259
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:27,820
in inverted commas, if we're competitors with these other distros, it doesn't do us any

260
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:36,160
favors to knock them. And so since Ubuntu started, we've always strived to be positive

261
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:43,280
and always strived with a code of conduct to not knock other distros. Now, that doesn't

262
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:49,960
always work and sometimes people make mistakes and sometimes people are not completely positive

263
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:56,120
and I fall into that trap sometimes too. But it's something we strive for and I wish more

264
00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:03,080
people did that. I think the Linux ecosystem would be a better place if we could each share

265
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:12,080
the good work that each other is doing non-maliciously. So when Fedora puts out a release from the

266
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:17,080
Ubuntu account, we'll congratulate them. When KDE put out a release, we congratulate them

267
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:22,800
because we have quite a wide social reach and it's a good thing for us to point people

268
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:28,760
at these projects because it doesn't do us any harm whatsoever to point at KDE or point

269
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:36,340
at Fedora or point at Elementary or Manjaro and highlight their success because highlighting

270
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:38,560
their success doesn't make us any worse.

271
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:46,160
I can only agree completely. I know Wimpy mentioned the same thing in the conversation

272
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:51,200
we had with his brunch and Rocco mentioned the same thing in his and I feel like it's

273
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:59,480
a theme that is just continuing to propagate and I hope it really takes off for all of

274
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:05,760
the people, you know, in the Reddit subs and all over social media and all of the places

275
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:11,160
where you tend to find this negativity or at least this kind of, I don't know if it's

276
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:14,920
a rivalry kind of nature, but it's, I agree with you completely. Like we're all on the

277
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,320
same team.

278
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:22,340
It's tribalism and validation. I installed this thing. If someone else says their thing

279
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:29,600
is better, then maybe I was wrong and I can't be wrong. So people feel it's not a lot different

280
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:36,880
than the rivalry between people who have one particular gaming device and people who have

281
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:42,320
a different manufacturer's gaming device and that. It's all cooked up by the users.

282
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:47,680
It's not cooked up by the manufacturers. There'll be a bit of tongue-in-cheek back and forth

283
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:53,520
between Microsoft and Sony about the Xbox and the PlayStation, but if you get Xbox developers

284
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,960
and PlayStation developers in the same room, they're going to talk to people like human

285
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:02,640
beings. They're not going to be at each other's throats, just the same as when I went to the

286
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,500
Linux application summit in Barcelona. There are people from Red Hat there. There's people

287
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:13,440
from Purism, people from Pine. You know, we're all grown adults and we can all have conversations

288
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,480
together. You don't have to turn everything into a cage fight.

289
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,800
And I think the reality is that we are all connected with a bunch of the software that

290
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:28,120
we're making, right? Lots of it is propagated in all of those distributions and a piece

291
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:32,440
that someone writes might help someone else and or change someone else's perspective.

292
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:36,380
So it's all really constructive. The way I've sort of come to see it, or at least challenged

293
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:41,980
myself to see it recently, is there's a big difference between being right and wrong and

294
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:48,520
just having preferences. And I think those two often get mixed up. You know, if a user

295
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:53,840
has a preference of a certain piece of software or a gaming platform or distribution, that's

296
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,560
very different than one being better than the other.

297
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:01,000
Right. And it's very, it's sometimes very difficult for people to separate those two.

298
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:09,920
And also in Ubuntu, we've sometimes made decisions where a small set of very vocal people will

299
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:14,440
say that's wrong. You shouldn't do that. That's wrong. I prefer it like this and everyone

300
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:20,080
prefers it like this. And it's like, well, you might be right in that you prefer it like

301
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:27,880
that. But it's very difficult in the Linux community to be able to speak for everyone,

302
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:32,960
because everyone has different tastes. And, you know, the fact that we moved the window

303
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:38,400
control buttons from one side to the other side, deeply angered a small amount of people

304
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:45,160
who were, you know, very vocal online. But it turns out most people are like, meh, they're

305
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:49,440
over there now. Okay. Don't care. Where's the button? Oh, it's there. And they click

306
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:54,640
it and they move on with their life because the window controls position on the screen

307
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:59,120
is not the most important thing in their life. It turns out, opening the web browser and

308
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:03,840
surfing Facebook or reading their email or placing a bet online or whatever it is.

309
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,840
Getting something done.

310
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:08,080
Yeah, getting stuff done is way more important than where the window controls are. And it's

311
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,580
difficult having those conversations with very passionate people in the Linux community

312
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:17,040
who feel like their perspective is the one true perspective.

313
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:24,640
It makes me wonder, characters like maybe some Apple CEOs that we've seen having such

314
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:32,160
a strong conviction that their ideas are the best ones. And sometimes that does push the

315
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,600
envelope faster or further.

316
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:42,840
Yeah. And, you know, I'm not trying to draw a parallel between an Apple CEO and the lead

317
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:54,440
sponsor of the Ubuntu project and CEO of Canonical, but Mark Shuttleworth does have like, executive

318
00:28:54,440 --> 00:29:00,580
sign off on many things. There are many decisions that happen inside Ubuntu that are taken by

319
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:07,640
people at all levels. And Mark may not be involved in those conversations at all about

320
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:13,020
which version of which library is used or how a particular dialogue is designed and

321
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:21,020
so on. But broad brush, he will have decision making power over things. And so for example,

322
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:29,040
when we switched from GNOME 2 to Unity, that's largely a project driven by Mark, who was

323
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:35,520
running the design team at the time. And so he will have received some flack and the company

324
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:40,320
will have received some flack because of that decision. But he made that bold decision.

325
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:48,500
And as a result of making that decision, I'm very confident that we sold more machines

326
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:55,120
running Ubuntu using Unity than we ever did before that. And while some people don't like

327
00:29:55,120 --> 00:30:03,860
it, you need someone to take the hit for that, someone to take the can for making that decision.

328
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:09,080
Now we may have introduced it too early. It might not have been ready. It might have been

329
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:15,320
slow performance when it first released. And I've spoken to Mark about this publicly in

330
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:19,880
interviews on the Ubuntu podcast. And he said, yep, we were too early with that. And there's

331
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:23,400
some other things we may have been too early with. But sometimes you just have to push

332
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:32,160
the envelope. And it needs someone like Mark to do that. Because the smaller distros where

333
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:37,320
everything is done by a common consensus will often not have the push, the drive to try

334
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:42,880
out those new things that, yeah, they might be controversial. They might annoy some people.

335
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,760
But someone's got to try this. Otherwise, we're all going to be looking at motif windows

336
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:52,000
and you know, GNOME 2 for the rest of our lives. Someone's got to push that stuff forward.

337
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:57,000
There's something about being so confident with your own perspective that it becomes

338
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,120
visionary and you can lead other people to sort of go in places that no one's ever been

339
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,120
before.

340
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,400
Doesn't mean we get it right all the time, though. Some people would say Ubuntu Phone

341
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:11,280
was a complete failure in inverted commas. And I've seen that written online that Ubuntu

342
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:16,240
Phone was a failure. And it's like, well, there were thousands of devices that shipped

343
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:22,200
with Ubuntu Phone. That's like a drop in the ocean. That's very few devices in the grand

344
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:25,880
scheme of things when you think of how many billions of Android devices there are out

345
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:34,040
there. And we eventually canned the project and handed the open source parts over to the

346
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:37,980
UBports guys and they've run with it and they've grown the community bigger than it ever was

347
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:45,640
under Canonical and have supported more devices and have moved the project forward. But someone

348
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:54,960
needed to actually have a go at doing that. And thankfully, Mark had the bags of money

349
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,120
to throw at it to have a go at it, really.

350
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:04,360
Well, and maybe it, you know, failure or success necessarily depends on what you're measuring.

351
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:11,120
And so if you're measuring progress instead of total sales, then that's maybe a totally

352
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:17,240
different picture. Or impact, you know, if you're trying to measure impact or innovation,

353
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:21,920
for instance, and those kind of things, then failure or success isn't necessarily obvious.

354
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:27,720
And it was also very difficult because the way it ended was with cutbacks within the

355
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:31,960
company. And so that was very painful for the people who worked on it. It's very different

356
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:36,320
from just drawing a line under it and saying, okay, we're not going to contribute to this

357
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:42,640
thing anymore. And we'll make it open source. And everyone who wants to work on it can work

358
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:49,560
on it. It was we're no longer going to work on this thing. And the staff that were working

359
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:54,920
on it now no longer work for us. And so it was an incredibly painful time for those of

360
00:32:54,920 --> 00:33:01,980
us who worked at Canonical at the time to lose that project effectively, because some

361
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,400
of our friends left the company.

362
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:07,880
Yeah, that doesn't sound easy at all, right? When you when you put it that way. Maybe in

363
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:14,640
that sense, it's a shame that you lost some great people as personal relationships, right?

364
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:22,760
Right. But the flip side is, would the company still exist now? Two years later, if we hadn't

365
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:23,820
done that?

366
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:29,240
Those are the really hard decisions that some people in leadership positions have to make.

367
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:32,560
And us as simple users, we're lucky not to have to make those, right?

368
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:37,160
Right. And I don't have a time machine. So I can't tell in an alternate universe what

369
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:40,840
would have happened if we'd carried on working on it and throw more money at it. I don't

370
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:45,840
know. And I don't think anyone can know that we can guess, but it's hard to know.

371
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:49,240
Can we talk about the Ubuntu podcast for a little bit?

372
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,240
Sure.

373
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:58,520
I was fascinated by Wimpy's story about how he got involved there and how you both are

374
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:05,080
now sort of a tag team duo at conferences and things like that, which he said you would

375
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:11,680
laugh about. I wondered a little bit how you got started in podcasting, because you had

376
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:16,160
been doing it quite a bit earlier than Wimpy had, right? Can you walk us maybe through

377
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:17,160
that a little bit?

378
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:23,120
Yeah, so we started we're just coming to the end of our 12th season and we do one season

379
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:30,320
a year. So whatever that is, 2007, sometime around there. So around about 2006, I was

380
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:41,520
a community contributor to Ubuntu. And on the UK IRC channel, the Ubuntu UK IRC channel,

381
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:48,040
we'd often have conversations about maybe there should be an Ubuntu podcast, who would

382
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:57,000
do this. And at the time, I was a keen consumer of a number of podcasts. And I thought, yeah,

383
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:03,480
I think we could probably do this. I think we can generate enough content to put out

384
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:11,160
a show every other week or so, interview people, discuss what's going on in the project. And

385
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:19,080
I contacted a few friends who I'd known through my local Linux user group. And also through

386
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:27,360
the Ubuntu community in the UK and said, do you fancy doing this podcast thing? And we

387
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:33,520
each went out and bought some hardware, bought microphones, mic stands, got a mixer. And

388
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:40,400
everyone came over to my house and we recorded an episode and it took all day to record one

389
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,400
episode.

390
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,400
Oh no, how come?

391
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:49,680
Well, we just didn't know what the hell we were doing. And we made some mistakes, like

392
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:53,440
we recorded a segment and then we went and had a cup of tea and a biscuit and had a

393
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,560
think about what the next segment was going to be. And then we go back in the room and

394
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:03,840
sit there and record that segment. And we edited really heavily. Every um and er was

395
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:14,680
edited out and it took a long time to post process those early episodes. And also the

396
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:19,640
the fact that we were driving to each other's houses. So initially there was myself and

397
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:29,360
Tony and Laura and Davey and we live 50, 60 miles away from each other, which I know by

398
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:36,840
US scale is not a huge distance, but in the UK, nobody drives 50 miles to see a friend.

399
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:42,900
Especially not to record a podcast. Like, yeah. So it it was it was a bit difficult,

400
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:51,520
but we we once we got a few episodes under our belt and a UK VPS provider Bitfolk provided

401
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:57,760
us with some hosting for free. And we got it all set up. It kind of started working

402
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:06,260
and we would interview people who worked on Ubuntu and it we we started off very amateurish

403
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:13,040
and the audio quality was terrible and it took ages to get an episode out the door.

404
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:20,240
But I think we've after 12 years, we've streamlined it. Plus we we outsourced the editing to your

405
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,960
good selves, which is most welcome.

406
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:28,480
Yeah, those were kind of early days for podcasting really when you start to look at it. You know,

407
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:35,000
you mentioned 2007 and there weren't really that many podcasts at that time compared to

408
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
now, of course.

409
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:43,040
Yeah. I mean, I remember there was a bunch of podcasts I used to listen to. There was

410
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:49,480
the ones that Leo Laporte did, you know, Twit, that kind of stuff and the stuff I mean, the

411
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:56,080
ones he still does now. And there was Dig Nation. That was Kevin Rose talking about,

412
00:37:56,080 --> 00:38:01,760
you know, whatever's popular on Dig at the time and a few others. And I used to commute

413
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:06,600
a lot and I used to listen to them on my commute. And after a while I thought, yeah, I can do

414
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:10,480
this. And there were a couple of Linux ones around at the time and they were pretty awful.

415
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:16,040
And to the point where I remember falling asleep on the train listening to one.

416
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,640
Oh, that's not a good sign.

417
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:21,680
No, this is like, I reckon we could do better than this. And I'm not saying we're great

418
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:29,220
at doing podcasts. I know we are amateurs. We are not particularly good microphone technique.

419
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:34,880
You know, we um and err and we have, there are things that I would love to improve about

420
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:42,000
the whole thing. But it's a bit of fun and there are some thousands of people who download

421
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:47,200
it every week. And if we talk about something controversial, we get a lot of feedback. And

422
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,600
there's a little community that's built up around it. Our little Telegram channel that

423
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:55,440
we have for the podcast has today hit a thousand people in there.

424
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,280
Whoa, that's not a small thing.

425
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:05,640
I don't think many of them are bots. I think they're mostly human. But that's, it's really

426
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:10,480
not, I mean, there's 100 or so people who are active at any time. And it's a nice little

427
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:15,520
community of people who, you know, give us feedback and let us know when we're doing

428
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:20,060
something wrong or send us news articles to talk about. And yeah, it's just a bit of fun

429
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:25,360
on a Tuesday night to sit with Martin and Mark and chat about stuff and then out it

430
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:30,840
goes on a Thursday. And it's not even part of either of our jobs, but we're not paid

431
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:35,600
to do it. We're not sponsored. You know, we don't get paid by any sponsors. It's just

432
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:39,320
a bit of fun and we've been doing it for 12 years, which is kind of surprising really.

433
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:43,800
I think the human aspect, similar to what you were saying about like tweets and stuff

434
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:50,400
earlier, the having that human aspect is super important, especially when it comes to sharing,

435
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,320
you know, a little bit of technical information. I think you guys have an amazing balance there.

436
00:39:54,320 --> 00:40:01,040
And I know it's really entertaining as well to listen to and you get some great perspectives

437
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:06,520
with with your crew. So please keep doing it. I know you're probably gonna have a curry

438
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,200
this this coming up.

439
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:14,120
We have a break every year. It's it's funny when we when we did the first season, we did

440
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:19,080
one. The first season was from about March till December, and we all decided we wanted

441
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:23,720
to take a break over Christmas. And we weren't sure whether we were going to come back the

442
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:28,840
following year. And now it's become this meme that at the end of the year, we go away and

443
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:34,080
know will they won't they and obviously there's 100% track record so far that we have come

444
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:40,800
back, but there's no guarantee that we will. You know, Mark has just had a baby and Martin

445
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:47,040
now has more responsibility on his plate for work. So we never know if we're going to come

446
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:50,600
back for another season. We might, we might not. And it's a stupid game we play with the

447
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:54,880
audience where we say, well, we just don't know. But we don't. And we and we never know

448
00:40:54,880 --> 00:41:01,800
until we do the curry because we stopped recording in December. And we actually don't talk about

449
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:07,240
the podcast. The three of us don't talk about the podcast at all for at least a month the

450
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:10,840
whole of January. We never talk about it. And then we talk about going for a curry.

451
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:15,960
Do you feel like that is almost like a necessary break that's really helpful actually to gain

452
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,760
like new perspectives and ideas?

453
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:23,480
Yes, it's a way to take a breather, have a think about what worked in the last season,

454
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:29,760
what didn't work. And whether if we come back, whether we want to do something differently,

455
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:35,720
we'll differently move the day because when a year passes, you know, when you've got children

456
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:41,460
like I have, my son has changed which day he practices football on. And if he practiced

457
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:47,000
on a Tuesday, which is when we record, that would mess up my ability to do the podcast.

458
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,440
And my daughter does dancing and sometimes she has to dance on a Tuesday. So I'm rushing

459
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:56,120
around in order to fit in the podcast because we always do it at the same time on the same

460
00:41:56,120 --> 00:42:01,860
day. And one thing we learned very early on is if you want to build an audience, you have

461
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:06,360
to do the episodes regularly. And if you want to get the episode out on time, you have to

462
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:11,140
record it on time. And we sometimes fail and we sometimes postpone, but more often than

463
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:20,360
not, if you pinged me online at 8.30 in the evening on a Tuesday, you wouldn't get a reply

464
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:24,600
from me for a couple of hours because that's the time that we always do the recording.

465
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:28,320
Yeah, there's something about consistency of schedule, especially when you have a bunch

466
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:33,800
of people involved, right? That's so necessary. I'm starting to learn that. I'm working with

467
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:38,480
the JB team. I've been a sort of freelance photographer being able to do whatever I want

468
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:46,440
to all the time. But some of that consistency actually is super powerful. So you did mention,

469
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:52,320
you wanted to mention something before our chat. You were talking about, well, I think

470
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:58,200
this ties into a bunch of stuff. So lots of people know you for the Ubuntu podcast. Also,

471
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:03,200
I suppose user error. You guys do some really hilarious stuff there. So I would encourage

472
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:10,080
everyone to check it out if they haven't yet. And you mentioned earlier in our chat, some

473
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:13,860
ThinkPad stuff that you might be starting to get famous with that.

474
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:21,600
So this internet famous thing, you know, where you're known by a tiny subset of people on

475
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:27,620
the internet for something, you're notable for something. And I have been recognized

476
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:33,880
in public for being on the podcast. Now I'm not, you know, any of our comments famous.

477
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:38,240
I'm no Kim Kardashian, obviously, but it's quite nice.

478
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,760
You're like niche famous, right?

479
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:46,840
Well, yeah, like Zed list internet celebrity famous. And it's quite nice, but it's also

480
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:52,240
quite weird when people recognize you. And I've kind of got used to it, but I haven't.

481
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:56,660
It still weirds me out a little bit because it's an audio podcast. Nobody knows what I

482
00:43:56,660 --> 00:44:01,720
look like unless they happen to be following me on Twitter and see my avatar or something.

483
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:08,120
But I had it years ago. I think 2001 was the first time I ever experienced it. I was working

484
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:17,440
for a drugs company in the UK and I had a really rubbish website, my blog, popy.com.

485
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:23,600
If you look at the internet archive for popy.com, don't do this, but I'm sure you will. Go back

486
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:31,320
and look around about 2001. It was, it was proper 2001 era web log, right? With stupid

487
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:35,880
icons and stuff all over it. It was awful. Actually it's a bit of the precursor to emoji.

488
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:40,000
I had little icons in between the texts to indicate stuff. And these were icons I ripped

489
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,500
out of the SAP system that I was working on at the time. So yeah, that's the precursor

490
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:45,500
to emoji, I think.

491
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:46,500
It sounds visionary.

492
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:53,040
Yes, totally. But they were, the place I was working were interviewing someone to join

493
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:58,840
the team. And I wasn't part of the interview process because I was just a contractor. And

494
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:04,000
they came back from the interview and we were asking, you know, how's this new person that

495
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:12,240
you're interviewing? What are they like? And one of them apparently asked how big the team

496
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:17,440
is. And the boss said, well, we've got like five or six people. We've got this person,

497
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:20,680
that person, we've got Alan Pope. And apparently the person they were interviewing said, you've

498
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:30,680
got Alan Pope. And she went, yeah. And the guy went, the Alan Pope. And she went, yeah.

499
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:35,760
And from that point onwards, I was known inside that company as the Alan Pope. Everyone just

500
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:43,480
calls me the Alan Pope from that point. Just some nerd online who happens to have a website.

501
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:49,640
But I met them later when they did get hired and they came and introduced themselves. And

502
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:53,760
I said, oh, I'm Alan. And I shook their hand and they went, Alan, have you got pictures

503
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:58,720
of cats on your website? And I said, yes, yes, I have. And that was like, brilliant.

504
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:04,080
I'm recognized for, you know, the Alan Pope and having pictures of cats on my website.

505
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:09,760
So I've kind of got used to that being recognized, but I've always been recognized for stupid

506
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:10,760
reasons.

507
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:14,040
Your website has been updated since then, which is kind of nice. And I just want to

508
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:21,960
point it out. I think it's it's such a wonderfully simple and yet really cheeky website. So I'll

509
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:24,080
encourage everybody to go check it out. Popeye.com.

510
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:27,080
Popeye.com. Yeah, there's not a lot there.

511
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:33,100
No, I know. But that's the brilliance of it. And what is there is hilarious. And yet also

512
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:42,440
quite astute. So I like it. I like it a lot. Aside from Popeye.com. I wanted to ask you,

513
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:47,180
are there any non computer projects that you tend to get excited about? I know a lot of

514
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:50,980
people know you for your ThinkPad tinkering and all of that stuff. But is there anything

515
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:55,240
these days that's like really grabbing you that's not necessarily tech related?

516
00:46:55,240 --> 00:47:00,800
I will often make a note somewhere of a thing that should exist I wish existed but doesn't.

517
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:06,920
And some of those will be games. And I've had a ton of ideas for games. And I have a

518
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:12,320
friend who I bounce ideas off of. I'll put him on Telegram and say, Hey, I've had this

519
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:22,900
idea. And I will describe the game or describe the application and and we'll both agree that

520
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:29,060
that should exist. And sometimes it's a bit of a con and I try and get them to help me

521
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:36,440
make it or get them to make it. Just get them to make and sometimes that works and they'll

522
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:40,560
say yeah, I could probably not cut up in Python in no time at all. And they'll just send me

523
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:45,080
a link to a Git repo a few hours later. And I'm like, Oh, brilliant. That's great. Thank

524
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:51,480
you very much. And I feel super bad about this because I feel like I should be creating

525
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:57,800
those things myself. But I get these mental blocks when I try and create stuff and I get

526
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:04,360
very frustrated. I've often said I don't consider myself a developer. I'm not a programmer.

527
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:11,740
And I can create a shell script and I've done coding on computers for 30 years. I've written

528
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:22,060
Z80 assembler 6502, I've even written 8086 assembler and I've written in Pascal and various

529
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:28,360
other languages. But I find it really difficult to get past that block. And I don't know how

530
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:34,480
to fix that. So my problem is in answer to your question, yes, I have a ton of projects

531
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:38,400
outside the stuff that I do on a daily basis, but none of them are finished. And I get so

532
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:45,400
frustrated because I don't know how to move them forward. And I because I get frustrated

533
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:49,080
that I can't move them forward. I get more frustrated that they don't move forward and

534
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:50,080
then I give up on them.

535
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:58,320
Oh, it's Yeah, recursive. Could I send a challenge your way? Oh, my gosh. Go on then. Could you

536
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:02,120
take a few of those ideas and just put them out into the world? For instance, like send

537
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:07,920
them out on Twitter and in a hope that someone else picks them up? Because some of the ideas

538
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:13,120
sound not necessarily like huge or, or massive business opportunities or anything like that,

539
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:16,540
but just something you wish existed. So I wonder what might happen if you just kind

540
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:19,480
of send it out into the world and see what happens.

541
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:24,160
I know I have inspired a couple of things in the past, I have said to people in the

542
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:29,480
past, you know, what should exist, this thing should exist. And then suddenly it exists.

543
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:34,160
And that's great. I feel guilty because I didn't make the thing. I just had the idea

544
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:40,840
for the thing. And I kind of would like to put those ideas out there. But I worry a bit

545
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:48,240
that I'm just the ideas man. And the biggest one is Ubuntu Matei, right? That is now many,

546
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:52,680
many thousands of people who run Ubuntu Matei. And that came about because of a stupid idea

547
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:57,840
that I had that there should be a Matei spin of Ubuntu. Martin comes around my house picks

548
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:03,700
it up walks away with it. And now I basically don't contribute to Ubuntu Matei at all since

549
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:11,480
day one. He's done it all. And I just had the idea. I mean, that's a good example, because

550
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:14,200
somebody else picked it all up and every so often he'll ping me and say, what do you think

551
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:19,360
about this idea from Ubuntu Matei? And I go, yeah, great idea. And somebody else somewhere

552
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:23,700
on the planet does the work. And all I did was just, you know, agree that that sounds

553
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:27,740
like a good idea. And maybe there'll be more of those.

554
00:50:27,740 --> 00:50:32,380
Perhaps your real gift and contribution is just creating the seeds and then you hand

555
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:38,040
off those seeds to others who are more interested in maintaining the seeds. You know, that has

556
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:39,840
huge value for sure.

557
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:45,560
Well, it doesn't, it doesn't. Because, like, whenever you open a bug tracker, for an open

558
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:49,280
source application, you'll get a load of people giving you ideas on how you could improve

559
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:56,440
your thing. And I worry that I become yet another one of those. Like, I'm just throwing

560
00:50:56,440 --> 00:51:02,880
my ideas out into the big pool of ideas on the planet. And, yeah, some of them might

561
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:09,040
turn out to be, I don't know. I'm also very resistant to people telling me they're terrible

562
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:16,240
ideas. Which is why I run them past my friend Stuart on Telegram before I even think about

563
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:17,240
them any further.

564
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:23,480
But yeah, okay. I think over Christmas, I will try and turn these into documents which

565
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:27,400
could be shared more widely than just between me and my friend Stuart.

566
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:30,920
That sounds lovely. And it doesn't have to be all of them, it could just be a few. That

567
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:34,400
sounds like a fun little project. See what happens, you never know.

568
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:40,920
I wanted to ask you if there's anything that you would like the community to try? Like,

569
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:44,640
sort of an ask? Something you'd like them to try or go check out or think about?

570
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:51,240
So a thing that I've been, we touched on earlier, is the whole testing thing. I wish more people

571
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:59,040
could push the boundaries of testing stuff out. And not specifically Ubuntu, like any

572
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:04,640
Linux distribution. Go and find one you've not tried before and test it out. Find out

573
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:13,440
what their process is for filing bugs and issues and follow that process. And give them

574
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:19,980
feedback about what works and what doesn't work. Because I know often developers will

575
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:27,280
create things and, you know, it works for them, but they don't appreciate that people

576
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:32,600
out there have different size screens or different accessibility requirements. You know, maybe

577
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:37,780
people with impaired vision or impaired motor skills aren't able to use that software because

578
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:45,400
of the way it's constructed. And I think it would be great if we did more of that testing

579
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:53,060
in the community because it's such a low impact thing for normal non-developer people to do.

580
00:52:53,060 --> 00:52:58,240
And I've shown this in videos I've done on my YouTube channel. You know, chucking an

581
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:02,240
ISO image onto a USB key, booting it on a machine, and then just noodling around for

582
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:09,520
an hour and trying it out as if you were using it on a daily basis is a really easy thing

583
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:16,500
to do. Just dedicating an hour or so to noodle around with it and then dedicate another half

584
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:25,340
hour to an hour to filing any bugs you find and continuing to converse with the developer.

585
00:53:25,340 --> 00:53:29,280
Continuing that conversation and making sure they understand what's broken or what's not

586
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:33,300
working or what's glitchy. I think that's the thing I would really love to see more

587
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:41,960
is people contributing meaningfully to Linux distributions rather than seeing Linux distributions

588
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:49,960
as a one-way street because the Linux distributions rely totally on volunteer contributors to

589
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:54,280
help them out. So that would be my call to action is go and test a distro and I don't

590
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:55,840
care which distro it is.

591
00:53:55,840 --> 00:54:01,240
That's lovely. I would imagine too as a user having that bi-directional communication would

592
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:05,560
actually be a real treat. You know you get some insights on where the project is headed

593
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:10,160
or can you know I imagine once you do that for a while you can request some features

594
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:18,080
or maybe share some ideas that would really make you have a sense of ownership for this

595
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:21,640
product that you really love or are learning to love.

596
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:29,960
I think that's a key thing is feeling a sense of ownership, feeling a member of their community.

597
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:37,840
It's very easy to do drive-by bug reports, boot an ISO in a VM, throw a bug report over

598
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:42,840
the wall at a developer and then walk away and never look at that distro ever again.

599
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:49,520
I think it's more useful for people to find a home, find a distro they like, get involved

600
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:55,380
with the community, actually jump on their IRC channel or their Slack or their Mattermost

601
00:54:55,380 --> 00:55:01,080
or wherever it is they chat and ask you know what can I do and they will almost certainly

602
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:05,860
ask you well what can you do? What are your skills? And if you say oh I can I can test

603
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:12,840
your distro they'll almost certainly be happy to point you to well we've just landed this

604
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:15,720
new thing do you want to test it?

605
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:23,560
I even saw a distro whose Slack I'm sat in a couple of days ago posted secret ISO images

606
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:27,840
and said hey can people test this stuff out and so I did but I'm not even part of that

607
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:32,440
distro I'm not even part of their community I just happen to be lurking in their Slack

608
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:37,000
and I thought yeah I'll help them out I'll try out their ISO if it crashes in a thousand

609
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:42,240
colors or formats my hard drive without me asking then I'll tell them but if it all works

610
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:49,160
I'll let them know it worked well and it's an hour of my life that is not hard to contribute

611
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:56,080
to so like I say I work for Ubuntu but I appreciate that everyone has their own personal taste

612
00:55:56,080 --> 00:56:00,860
and everyone wants to contribute in different ways to different distros so go and find a

613
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:02,840
distro and contribute.

614
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:07,600
As little as an hour is helpful and if you can give more than that even more helpful.

615
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:08,880
Yeah totally.

616
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:14,000
And so for someone like me who's not necessarily a developer do you feel like that process

617
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
is quite approachable?

618
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:21,240
It depends on the distro I mean largely all you're doing is downloading an ISO image and

619
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:24,840
chucking it on a USB key and booting it and seeing what happens.

620
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:27,240
Almost any of us could do that right so that's great.

621
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:31,400
Yeah and that's this I mean if you've if you're a Linux user you probably have done that at

622
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:33,240
least once in your life.

623
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:35,440
If not it's a great opportunity to learn.

624
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:42,320
Right yeah why not and also it's nice to test other distros like I've tested out quite a

625
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:48,000
lot of distros over the last year partly because I need to make sure that some of our technology

626
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:52,840
works on other distros but partly just out of interest and I've tried out some that I've

627
00:56:52,840 --> 00:57:00,700
got really wild user interfaces that I would not be happy using on a daily basis but other

628
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:06,920
people love like it's their you know number one child and so I can have a perspective

629
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:12,000
of an outsider just looking in and saying okay this is a bit weird but it doesn't crash

630
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,480
it works and so that's feedback I can give them you know I don't I don't have to tell

631
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:21,080
them I don't like it and I think that's a key thing is doesn't matter if you don't like

632
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:26,560
it you've go and find one you do like use that one and contribute to that one and yeah

633
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:32,440
it's it's really pretty straightforward it's it's it's really just a case of installing

634
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:40,200
an operating system and trying to use it like a normal person and you very quickly can find

635
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:46,140
the edges of what's possible and find you know whether it's easy or difficult to install

636
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:50,560
the software that you want and whether it's easy or difficult to customize the interface

637
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:56,440
to be the way you want it maybe that's by design maybe that's just you don't know how

638
00:57:56,440 --> 00:58:01,800
to do it or maybe it's just not well documented and all of those are opportunities and trying

639
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:06,480
to put emojis in places where you might not think they should go oh yes yes definitely

640
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:13,400
try try and put your username being one character and try and you know weird characters in your

641
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:18,640
password and all kinds of stuff probably if people want to get connected with you where

642
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:22,600
where do you think you would send them I'm pretty much poppy everywhere except a few

643
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:30,220
places where some random people have got poppy so I had to go with poppy DC as the alternative

644
00:58:30,220 --> 00:58:35,040
so if you ever see poppy DC that's probably me as well so people always ask what the DC

645
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:42,120
means the DC just means dot com as in poppy dot com I was not very inventive when I came

646
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:45,520
up with that one because at the time I was really frustrated that I couldn't have poppy

647
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:51,600
so I was like oh poppy DC will do so yeah twitter.com poppy is a good place to start

648
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:55,680
great yeah well poppy thank you so much for chatting with me this has been a real pleasure

649
00:58:55,680 --> 00:59:11,680
and thanks for your time too appreciate it yeah it's been lovely thanks thanks so much
