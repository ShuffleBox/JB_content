00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,360
Hello, everyone. Welcome to Brunch with Brent. My name is Brent Gervais. Joining me today

2
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,480
is Kyle Rankin. Kyle, how are you doing?

3
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,320
I'm doing well. How about yourself?

4
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:26,660
Doing great. Thanks so much for joining me today. I really appreciate it. Some of maybe

5
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:31,920
our community members would know you, Kyle, for you currently are the chief security officer

6
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,260
at Purism, and I believe vice president as well. Is that accurate?

7
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:39,080
That is correct. Yeah. Many hats.

8
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:44,280
That's kind of how it goes, right? You also have quite a history with the Linux Journal.

9
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:50,080
You're a tech editor there for something like 10 years and freelance columnist there for

10
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,080
a long time.

11
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:54,900
Yes, it's pretty crazy, especially when you think about, you know, if you're a columnist,

12
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,240
that means you're writing something new every month.

13
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,240
Right.

14
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:04,280
And my column was all about a new tip, or a tech tip, or, you know, hack or something

15
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:09,820
like that every month. And the first year, no problem. Second year, still pretty much

16
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:15,000
no problem. On the third year, when you're looking at every month to write something

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,720
new that you've never written about before, it really becomes a challenge at that point.

18
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,080
Did you find that helped you kind of grow your skill set because you're constantly hunting

19
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:29,460
for something kind of curious or something new or novel?

20
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:34,200
It's true. Sometimes people would ask me if I'd ever considered writing full time. And

21
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,360
I said, no, there's no way I could write full time because I need to work in technology

22
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,080
just to have enough new information to write about. You could sort of tell when I was really

23
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:48,580
engaged at whatever I was doing at work because I would instantly have, you know, five or

24
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:53,600
six or seven column ideas that would play out over the next year, you know, and flesh

25
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,080
it out with other ones in between.

26
00:01:55,080 --> 00:02:00,780
Nice. I guess you would probably keep a running list of kind of those ideas and pluck them

27
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:05,720
as they seem appropriate for the writing that you're doing. That sounds like a lot of fun.

28
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:10,080
Well, at the beginning, I had a year or so mapped out already.

29
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,080
That seems like a luxury.

30
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:15,240
Exactly. Yeah. At some point, the well runs dry and you do find yourself every month saying,

31
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,800
yeah, and the other challenge is, you know, let's say we're going five or six years into

32
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,640
this. The next challenge is, wait, did I write about this? I don't remember anymore.

33
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,320
Of course. Right. Right. Right. Our memory is only so good.

34
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:31,160
Yeah. Yeah. So I would find myself coming up with an idea and then looking and finding

35
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,960
Nope, nope. I already wrote about that four years ago.

36
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,520
Oh, wait. Past me already thought of that.

37
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,640
Yeah, exactly.

38
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:43,000
That's funny. And do you find yourself sort of missing that in your everyday now?

39
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,640
I do. I miss the Linux journal community in particular. They were always very supportive.

40
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:53,600
And I would always get really good feedback. I mean, I know sometimes tech writers get

41
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,700
the opposite where the only feedback they get is someone correcting them or giving them

42
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:02,840
a nice well actually to the gut. But yeah, in my case, it was always pretty positive

43
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:07,240
when I got feedback at all. You know, usually you're just sort of writing into a void. But

44
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:11,560
that's the thing I think I miss the most is you would go to a conference and every now

45
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:15,700
and then you would run into someone who's like, Oh, I read your column. I really enjoyed,

46
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:20,700
you know, such and such an article you wrote, you know, just kind of really gratifying that

47
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:24,200
would give you that extra bit of fuel to continue on for another year.

48
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:30,120
Did that kind of connection also make you realize how many people you were having an

49
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:35,520
impact on? Because sometimes as writers or even podcasters, we don't always know how

50
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:40,640
many people are reaching or how profound that impact can be. Was that something that hit

51
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,640
you?

52
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:46,760
Most definitely. Because without that, for example, if I hadn't gone to various free

53
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:53,200
software Linux conferences, I would have never even really known that anybody read my column

54
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,960
except for the occasional email I would get or something. But yeah, meeting actual people

55
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:02,920
and, you know, in some cases, a number of people that, you know, got to know me through

56
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:08,400
my writing, and they would recall different things that I wrote in the past. And yeah,

57
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,720
it really built this kind of interesting set of community to where now there's a couple

58
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:17,240
of conferences that pre coronavirus, you know, I would go to annually. And you sort of run

59
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:21,200
across the same group of people that you met initially, just because it said, Hey, hey,

60
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,960
your name sounds familiar. Oh, I've read your column before, you know, that sort of thing.

61
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,400
That's amazing. It's also nice to hear that that community is still sort of reaching out

62
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:34,880
to you in a way. To use a big word, one of the tragedies when projects change or shift

63
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:39,880
or sort of change, you know, change directions is that sometimes the community doesn't know

64
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:44,200
where to go anymore. So I'm glad to hear that they're still finding you here and there.

65
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:48,520
Yeah, well, and it helps that right now the Linux journal site is still online. At one

66
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:53,400
point when it shut down, it was unclear whether that would be the case. And there's a lot

67
00:04:53,400 --> 00:05:00,440
of it. I mean, I got so many solicitations from people to mirror it or to offers to host

68
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:05,120
it and all of that sort of thing, which of course, you know, I, I had nothing to do with

69
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,320
that one way or the other. There's I was just a editor and columnist. But fortunately, because

70
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,560
it's still online, you know, there's still quite a few people that come across these

71
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:18,440
articles because, you know, at one point, I even considered the idea of maybe sort of

72
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:22,460
rounding up all of the articles that were still relevant, which I started reviewing

73
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:26,880
them and it turned out there are quite a few, even some that were, you know, almost 10 years

74
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:32,160
old that still were as, as usable today. And I considered maybe like doing some sort of

75
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,520
ebook or, you know, something like that. But yeah, so because they're still online, I'm

76
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,600
getting still, you know, people that come across, I mean, I come across my articles

77
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,080
sometimes when I'm trying to look up how to do something. And I realized, oh, wait,

78
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,640
I already wrote that for a Linux journal, you know, seven years ago or whatever.

79
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:54,720
And I think that's sort of in a nutshell, part of what can be a little bit challenging

80
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,140
about our internet decentralized world is that some of this great information just sort

81
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:06,380
of disappears sometimes and somehow maintaining that reference, especially with the number

82
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:12,380
and the quality of articles that was in a place like Linux journal just seems valuable.

83
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:18,240
And so, I mean, I guess that's the way back machine, you know, but if we can somehow maintain

84
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,440
those, I think you're on the right track with that sort of thinking, but it's not always

85
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,760
obvious how to accomplish it.

86
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:26,360
Oh, you're absolutely right. And yeah, thank goodness for sites like the Wayback Machine

87
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:31,160
that archive some of this stuff. And thankfully they started archiving shortly after some

88
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:38,880
of my early GeoCities attempts on the internet. So they didn't capture those, thank goodness.

89
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,680
And then all of the stuff they capture for the most part is ready to survive forever.

90
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,760
I think you're beginning to date yourself there a little bit with that GeoCities mention.

91
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:51,440
That's right. Drop the GeoCities mention and hey, tell me about your first laptop. Well,

92
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:57,040
it was the size of a VHS tape, you know, oh, you know, let me tell you what those are.

93
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:08,000
Oh, yeah. Luckily, I can relate to all of those. But for those who don't know the Linux

94
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,120
journal and sort of the history and the let's say the trials and tribulations that went

95
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,880
through, can you give us sort of the the Coles notes version? Because it was around for a

96
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:22,160
long time and it was really important for a lot of people. And yet today we don't we

97
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,200
don't have it anymore. So can you give us the quick, quick sort of version? Because

98
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:30,560
I know it kind of hit you personally as well. If you want the full, you know, unabridged

99
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:36,200
story, I gave a couple of talks on the subject called the death and resurrection of Linux

100
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:42,200
journal. I gave a keynote at Freenote live on that subject, but the clip notes version

101
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:48,080
of it is, you know, Linux journal started shortly after the announcement of the Linux

102
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:54,360
journal. And so it pretty much tracked the history of Linux itself, and started, you

103
00:07:54,360 --> 00:08:00,200
know, relatively relatively modestly, and grew pretty rapidly along with Linux, Linux,

104
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:06,760
and it sort of became this mirror of Linux for a long time. And then I joined about at

105
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:12,520
this point, maybe 12 years ago, I guess, and started writing as a columnist. And this was

106
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:21,160
during the heyday. So I interviewed to be a columnist at a Linux World Expo conference

107
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:25,960
back when they did those, if I remember correctly, it was the same one where IBM was spray painting

108
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:31,440
tux penguins on the sidewalk, just to date that a little bit. That's awesome. Yeah, so

109
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,040
that was, you know, that was that brief period of that period of time where IBM had become,

110
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:40,600
you know, before that, they were sort of like the the original 800 pound gorilla that everyone

111
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:44,920
was thought was evil. And then at that point, they embraced Linux, and everyone just just

112
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:49,880
sort of changed their minds almost overnight, you know, because at the time, we needed 800

113
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:54,360
pound gorilla in our corner. And you could argue now that Microsoft this is, you know,

114
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,640
we're seeing something similar. Yeah, even news today, right? Something similar. Yeah,

115
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,600
you could argue that Microsoft's doing the same thing now, because they've sort of traditionally

116
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:05,300
followed in IBM's footsteps as far as that goes. But anyway, yeah, so back to Linux journals.

117
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:11,540
So started there, then and sort of along with the heyday of Linux, where you started seeing

118
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:17,620
it very easily show up in corporations, you didn't really have to fight to get it installed,

119
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:22,080
there was, you know, professional support options, Red Hat was huge, they went public,

120
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,960
that sort of thing. And then, you know, if we fast forward, maybe five, six years, the

121
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:31,720
publishing industry itself was undergoing a lot of problems. For example, borders had

122
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:37,320
closed their shops and periodicals that were getting a lot of revenue from just store shelf

123
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:42,520
sales, including Linux journal, you know, had some had some trouble there. Because at

124
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:46,560
that point, you had a couple of, you know, you had small book retailers, and Barnes & Noble

125
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,360
were pretty much the only games in town if you were a magazine. So the Linux journal

126
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:57,640
made the difficult decision to go digital only at shortly after that, just because they

127
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:02,120
needed to make ends meet, you know, I mean, it's very expensive. The publishing costs

128
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:09,100
kept going up. It's very expensive to print and ship magazines. So they were digital only,

129
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:16,400
that was very controversial. But it was necessary to survive. And then fast forward, another

130
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:22,520
handful of years, and it basically just I, there's a lot of analysis about why but just

131
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:26,200
the community changed a bit. And the way that we were approaching the community was really

132
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:32,400
based more on sort of traditional, the traditional core audience, because that was the most vocal

133
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:39,100
audience of ours, and the one that really was was supportive of us the most. But in

134
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:44,480
the meantime, we didn't really branch out into what had become the greater Linux community,

135
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,380
at least in the way that we really should. And as a result, that combined with the fact

136
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:52,680
that it's easier to pick up new readers, if you have a magazine on a shelf that they can

137
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:57,160
see, like, Oh, what's this? And then, Oh, I want to subscribe. So in the absence of

138
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:02,920
those things, it was kind of challenging. And we ultimately ran out of steam announced

139
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:08,120
that we were closing up shop, which is really difficult. And then in the last minute, we

140
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:13,560
were we were resurrected someone, private internet access came in and, and save the

141
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:18,640
company. And so we sort of had this opportunity for rebirth. And so all of us, you know, that

142
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,720
were involved were really excited, you know, because right before that, I had written this

143
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:27,920
really heartfelt sort of eulogy for Linux journal, sort of encapsulating the last 10

144
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:32,280
years. So we came back, and we really started focusing on on learning all the lessons that

145
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:36,280
got us there and started, you know, turning things around. And I was very excited about

146
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:41,480
the future of it. And then just sort of out of the blue, a number of months in, we got

147
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:47,640
word that everything needed to be shut down, that we weren't quite to the point where we

148
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:53,520
could make it 100% on our own. Although, arguably, we probably could have with a little bit more

149
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:59,320
headway to prepare. But yeah, so it's just sort of the the cord was pulled. And then

150
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:05,360
we died a second time, man. So then I wrote a second eulogy, you know, about a maybe year

151
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,640
and a half after the first one, which is weird, because I had already said everything I wanted

152
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:15,900
to say before. So I ended up calling the column the awkward goodbye, because it really reminded

153
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:20,120
me of, you know, if you've ever gone to a restaurant with somebody, and you know, you

154
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:23,720
you eat, you have a great time. And well, back remember when you went to restaurants

155
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:28,200
with people? Yeah. So if we can go back in time to when that happened, and you would

156
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:33,240
you would eat with people that you didn't live with. And then when you were done, you

157
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:37,360
go out and go out to the front of the restaurant, right? And you would say your goodbyes. If

158
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,360
you're close friends, you would hug, remember, we would hug people. So you would hug people,

159
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,600
or you would shake your hand back when we did that, then you'd say goodbye, and you'd

160
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:49,280
leave. But then every now and then, you both would realize, oh, wait, we're both parked

161
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:53,000
in the same area. So we just did our goodbyes, we did our really good goodbyes. And now we

162
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,280
have to awkwardly walk to the same parking lot, you know, and then you get to your your

163
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:02,520
cars or whatever. And then you're deciding, well, what do we do now? You know, do we just

164
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:08,360
high five? Or do we wave? Or do we just like, repeat the whole thing? Yeah, repeat the whole

165
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:13,040
thing? Or do we just kind of like, like, ignore each other while we're walking? I mean, what

166
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,840
it's super awkward. And that's, that's sort of what writing that column reminded me of,

167
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:21,280
because I'd already said goodbye. And now I'm trying to do it again. I don't know. So

168
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:28,720
I mostly just talked about the concept itself. And awkwardly, awkwardly, close down the column.

169
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,800
And I would imagine was pretty emotional for you to, you know, trying to bring it back.

170
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:39,240
And it sounds like PIA was sort of a funding body there in a way, and then it just sort

171
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:45,080
of disappeared. And having that lack of control sometimes can be really challenging for the

172
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,360
people involved who are putting their hearts into it, right?

173
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,520
I can't speak for everyone. But at least for me, I think the biggest emotional hit was

174
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:56,320
the first time. Because we didn't know how the story was going to go. So for as far as

175
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,360
we knew, it was dead for good. And so I sort of went through the grieving process, then

176
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:07,040
and did, you know, all of the soul searching I was going to do. And honestly, I would say

177
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:12,480
that it's the death of Linux Journal, that that was at least partially if not mostly

178
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,960
instrumental in me making the decision to go work at Purism full time.

179
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,960
Oh, wow.

180
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:22,000
Yeah, because before that, you know, I've been involved with Purism on the sidelines

181
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,000
and sort of behind the scenes since the beginning. So I wrote one of the first reviews of the

182
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:33,520
Librem 15 laptop when it was still in the crowdfunding phase. I met with Todd in person.

183
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:39,400
And apparently, the laptop he had for me to review was like the Librem 15 prototype, like

184
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:45,240
there was one, you know. And so we're sitting there and I think, you know, I'm sort of feeling

185
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,540
him out to see, you know, what kind of person sort of is starting this company? Is this

186
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:53,240
the real deal? And he's sort of feeling me out a little bit to say, hey, do I trust giving

187
00:14:53,240 --> 00:15:00,800
this guy my one laptop that I have? In any case, he did let me review it. And I wrote

188
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:05,880
what I consider to be a fair review, talking about the pros and cons. But what really interested

189
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:11,800
me about Purism at the time was that Todd really seemed like the real deal because,

190
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:15,280
you know, a lot of times in this community, you see people that know the right words to

191
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:19,680
say and know how to sort of rally the community by saying the right things. But you know that

192
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,420
they're not really they don't really believe it or they, you know, don't have any history

193
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:27,920
with it. But, you know, I discovered, no, he's the real deal. He believes what he's

194
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,960
saying and there's a future here with this. So from that point on, I sort of on the on

195
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:37,000
the background, I would, you know, sort of work behind the scenes, emailing him, giving

196
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,920
advice and helping out with various things, including some of the internal PRS projects

197
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,760
early on. And then every now and then we would talk back and forth, hey, you know, maybe

198
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:49,960
I should go work there. But it never you know, the timing just wasn't right. And then once

199
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:56,880
Linux journal died, and I was sort of grieving that I started looking at my own life, I guess,

200
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,700
my first eulogy for Linux journal started off as like a eulogy, and then it turned into

201
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:06,600
a rant by the end. And while I was ranting, you know, at, you know, the community is maybe

202
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:11,600
lost its way. And we're, you know, we've changed and what's going on. I realized, you know,

203
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:16,320
I'm kind of pointing some fingers at myself, too, because, you know, I felt like I haven't

204
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,820
been doing enough to support this thing. I really cared about, you know, I'm spending

205
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:26,440
my days job, you know, doing perfectly fine things, but, you know, an interesting work,

206
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:30,420
but it was just sort of traditional system and work. And the companies that I was working

207
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:35,560
for didn't necessarily forward free software or Linux in any way, other than the fact that

208
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,560
I use them.

209
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,560
So it sounds like there was a bit of a disconnect between your own personal ideals and where

210
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,560
you were putting most of your time.

211
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:47,180
Oh, most definitely. Yeah. I mean, I realized, you know, I was fortunate enough in the way

212
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:52,820
that I've worked my career so far that I could make the choice to work, you know, somewhere

213
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:58,960
that aligned with my ideals and that I should if I can. And again, I had, you know, worked

214
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:02,440
long enough in the industry and built enough of a career that I was fortunate to be able

215
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:07,080
to make that kind of choice, which, you know, not everyone can. But the timing was right.

216
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:11,840
And I realized, no, I need to I should be spending eight hours a day or more, you know,

217
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:15,520
forwarding my beliefs instead of, you know, just on the side, writing some articles here

218
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,520
and there.

219
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:22,920
There are always sacrifices that come with sort of making that leap, I would imagine.

220
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:27,200
Although, you know, here you are today doing still amazing work, doing that kind of stuff.

221
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:31,880
So good for you for sort of re-evaluating what was important to you. And it sounds like

222
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:37,640
Linux Journal had a major part in that for you and sort of was a nice segue for you to

223
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:45,740
move into purism. And I'm curious about what purism is in your everyday now. You're putting

224
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,420
your main focus on security.

225
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:52,320
It's interesting, because I'm in an executive role. Sometimes when you work at a startup,

226
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:56,360
especially their startups often, I mean, you know, purism has been around long enough,

227
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:59,560
I don't know that it necessarily qualifies as a startup anymore. But a lot of times when

228
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:04,400
you work for a small company or startup, there tends to be title inflation, where, you know,

229
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,120
someone who would be a manager is now a director and someone who'd be a director is now a VP.

230
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:13,080
And so I mean, I this happened to me as well, you know, you just you start sort of in you

231
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:16,920
have, you don't necessarily have the roles and responsibilities of the title, but you

232
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,080
have the title.

233
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,560
Someone has to have the title, right?

234
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:23,760
Exactly. Someone has to have the title and you you are the head of a department. So let's

235
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,560
give you a VP or now a C level title, you know. And in this case, though, it's a little

236
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:33,320
different because it's, you know, it ends up actually having a lot of executive responsibilities,

237
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:38,540
which I was expecting, of course. But yeah, so my day to day really varies because on

238
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:43,120
some days I'm working full time on security related work. And then so some days I have

239
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:47,600
sort of the chief security officer hat on. And then other days, I sort of have the company

240
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:53,040
vice president hat on. By that I mean, it just sort of looking at the overall machine

241
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:58,680
that we have as a company, just sort of helping every department wherever there needs to be

242
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:03,240
help, I suppose, is a way to put it. So there's a lot of times where, you know, you may have

243
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:09,320
a team that is working on getting something done, but they need someone with responsibility

244
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:13,080
for the company to make a decision. Should we go this way or that way? Both ways are

245
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:17,620
equally valid. They have pros and cons. What should we do? And without the answer, they

246
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:23,080
maybe are blocked and can't go forward. So in some cases, some days I spend my days answering

247
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:28,760
those kinds of questions. So they just unblock teams. And other days, you know, I may need

248
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:33,880
to put on the hat as a as a leader of a particular team just to help get something done, just

249
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:38,440
because they need extra help on a project or something. Every day is a little bit different,

250
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,440
actually.

251
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,240
And I would imagine that's that's what keeps it interesting for you. If you're sort of

252
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,520
in a position that's the same every day, you know, day in and day out, that can get sort

253
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:51,380
of old pretty fast, I would imagine, which, which you've alluded to, like, you know, you've

254
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:56,040
automated yourself out of many jobs in the past. But in this case, it sounds like there's

255
00:19:56,040 --> 00:20:00,560
always something new thrown at you that can keep you sort of curious and interested and

256
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,320
really quite valuable, really.

257
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,600
Never really a dull moment. I can say that for sure. There's always something, you know,

258
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:10,520
there's always a new challenge, something new to work on and always definitely new things

259
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:15,380
to learn. You know, I've learned about all kinds of other disciplines, not just learning

260
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:20,600
more about either systems administration in the past or security. But just, you know,

261
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:24,880
anything from marketing to, you know, we're we're a hardware company, we sell hardware

262
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:29,480
and just that whole supply chain, all the operations and all the things required with

263
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:33,700
sourcing hardware and selling hardware and all of that's all been, you know, just fascinating.

264
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:37,720
And because I work with so many smart people who are just experts in whatever the field

265
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:41,980
is that that they happen to be responsible for, I have this great I love learning new

266
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:46,520
things. And so I constantly have this opportunity to learn from people who really know what

267
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,520
they're talking about.

268
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:53,560
I would imagine a place like purism, because of its strong ideals and commitment to those

269
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:59,520
ideals, you know, a lot of free software ideals and open source ideals as well would attract

270
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:07,120
a certain kind of person who someone like you or I or so many of our listeners would

271
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:12,840
just love to be surrounded by that kind of person. Would you say that is sort of accurate

272
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:17,800
versus some of your past corporate experiences, for instance?

273
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:23,480
Almost universally. In fact, I, I can't think of anywhere I've been where I have spent more

274
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:29,200
time in chat having conversations about ethics than we have here. You know, it's, it's really

275
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:35,000
interesting. Whenever we are deciding, making some new decision about some way to go, whatever

276
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,880
it is, whether it's a new product, software, that sort of thing. One of the foremost things

277
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:44,800
that ends up coming up is, is how does this fit in with the overall free software ethos?

278
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:49,600
How does this fit in with our own ethics beyond that with respect to privacy and security?

279
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,720
Are we taking freedom away from our customers or giving them more freedom? That sort of

280
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:57,800
thing. It's just, it's wonderful to also have so many people in the company that already

281
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:02,760
understand all of those issues. So, I mean, it's not universal, but we do have a great

282
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:08,080
number of people who are already experts in free software licenses and understand all

283
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:12,840
of that background. So, you know, when we're discussing things like licensing or how we

284
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:16,880
treat a particular piece of software, a lot of us are already on the same page.

285
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:21,440
Do you find that ends up, you know, because you're practicing those kinds of questioning

286
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:28,600
skills professionally, that it also helps you personally to kind of look at those topics

287
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,240
in your own personal life?

288
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:36,680
It certainly helps reinforce looking through the lens of your, whatever your personal values

289
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:42,440
are. If you're doing it at work for something that you could argue is maybe is less important

290
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:47,860
than how you treat your personal values and yourself, right? It definitely sort of reinforces

291
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:52,120
that if you're spending your time at work thinking about your corporate values and how

292
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:56,520
that affects people, it certainly spills over into thinking about how you deal with everyone

293
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:01,120
in your daily life. Especially if the ethics, if there's crossover in the ethics, you know,

294
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,680
just treating, making sure that people are treated fairly, that you care about people's

295
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,260
privacy, things like that.

296
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:10,900
One of the reasons I mentioned that was something that kind of gave me a smile when I was just

297
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:18,440
exploring through your website. And you mentioned on there that some of your sort of explorations

298
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:25,160
in Linux and open source and free software led to changing the way that you shave, which

299
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:30,400
I laughed at because I sort of approached the exact same thing and went through the

300
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:35,220
same trajectory as you did. So I was like, Oh, that's so, it's so great because some

301
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:41,120
of what we believe in with where we put our time, you know, into open source software

302
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:46,220
and all of that, and hardware, of course, in your case, sort of spills into other areas

303
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:52,800
of our life that are seemingly inconsequential, but they can equally bring us great joy, I

304
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,800
think.

305
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:59,560
I would say that safety razors and that whole technology and the advance of that technology

306
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:04,440
beat the issues we have with proprietary software by a number of decades. But you can follow

307
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:11,440
that history, right? You're right. I changed how I shaved, largely because of my free software

308
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,440
values.

309
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:16,000
That's a great quote.

310
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,640
I was using a Mach 3, like a lot of people did at the time it had just come out and use

311
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,240
it for a while. And then, you know, a number of years later, I was locked in, I had to

312
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:30,280
buy razor blades just from one company, that sort of thing. And time went by, and I found

313
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:34,680
out that they had decided to switch to a new, they had upgraded, you know, to a new version.

314
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,680
They left you behind.

315
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:40,160
Yeah, I had like four blades and two aloe strips or something, I don't know. I had

316
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:44,360
a choice then, I could continue to try to get my old blades, which are already super

317
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:47,920
expensive or, you know, move to the new one. And I tried the new one, and I didn't really

318
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:51,920
like it, and the blades were more expensive, and it was okay. But then I got to the point

319
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:56,080
where I said, you know, I'm just going to use the old one. And I stopped being able

320
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:01,360
to source locally, those razor blades, at least the official ones, you know, I think

321
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:05,060
they eventually they were able to make some knockoffs that worked. But I couldn't find

322
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:08,940
compatible razor blades. And I'm sitting there thinking, I'm trying to find compatible razor

323
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:13,560
blades. I got vendor locked in with shaving. You know, this is ridiculous. This is against

324
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:18,640
everything I stand for. Around the same time, I read this article about, you know, it was

325
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:23,080
from this website called the art of manliness. And it was about it was about how your grandpa

326
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:27,080
used to shave or something like that. And I discovered, wait, there's safety razors.

327
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:32,080
And wait, those razor blades are cross compatible. They, you know, they have a standard public

328
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:38,880
domain compatibility between all of them, you know, and, and that's it. That's what

329
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:45,640
I have to do. And so I ended up just diving headfirst, I guess, pun always intended, into

330
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:50,640
shaving with a safety razor. I ended up writing a whole article about this topic for Linux

331
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:55,080
Journal, even talking about I mean, pretty much the 10 years of Linux Journal is just

332
00:25:55,080 --> 00:26:01,320
a brain dump for me, one way or the other. But yeah, because it really is this case where

333
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:06,520
you see why cross compatibility is better for the consumer and lock in is almost never

334
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:11,520
better. It always creates a better situation because it requires competition. And so, you

335
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:16,320
know, in the case of safety razors, I can buy a pack of 100 safety razors for $10. And

336
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:21,320
that pack of 100 safety razors will last me for two, maybe three years, maybe longer now

337
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,940
that we're all in lockdown and you don't shave as much, you know, when you work from home,

338
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:29,960
that's the first thing to go. Yeah. But yeah, I mean, so it's amazing, you know, instead

339
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:33,840
of $3 a blade or whatever people pay nowadays, I you know, I feel sorry for those people

340
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,740
just like I feel sorry for them when they when they're locked into some vendor that's

341
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:42,600
charges them a whole lot of money for stuff. I just love the parallel between those two

342
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:48,560
worlds. And it's like the open source ideas came a long time before software did, you

343
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:54,440
know, and we need to not forget about that. It's sort of a human ideal before it's a software

344
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:59,360
or hardware, computer hardware ideal. So we can apply it in many areas in our lives. That's

345
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:03,780
for sure. I mean, I'm seeing it all over the place. For instance, I recently, you know,

346
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:09,680
two years ago, I remodeled my kitchen. And the popular thing to do now with kitchen sinks

347
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:14,440
is to have a you know, you get a new countertop and do it we've saved up forever. And finally,

348
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:18,600
we're gonna get a new countertop and you know, in our house and everything. So we save up,

349
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:23,160
we do that. And then the question comes, well, how many holes are you going to drill in your

350
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:27,680
countertop? Of course. And so like, Okay, well, let me think about this. Well, you know what,

351
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:33,240
I will do the single hole sink, or the single hole faucet. So that way, later on, someone

352
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,720
could choose to drill a new hole if they wanted to, but they wouldn't be stuck with a hole

353
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:41,840
that they had to plug. Well, that means you get one of those large single hole faucets

354
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:47,240
that have the little pull down sprayer instead of the separate separate sprayer, right? Well,

355
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:52,740
what I discovered, because I'm a home brewer, and before I had a regular kitchen sink in

356
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:57,480
regular kitchen faucet, and a regular kitchen sink has one of those little aerators that

357
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:02,000
you can unscrew, and there's it's threaded with a standard thread. And I had a water

358
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,960
cooling system to cool my wort when I was brewing, before I would put it in a fermenter.

359
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:11,720
And it was designed to screw on to one of those threaded faucets like you would have

360
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:17,620
on a kitchen faucet. Well, when I up, quote unquote, upgraded, I discovered that the new

361
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:24,700
world of kitchen faucets is all proprietary. It really is. No, it is. And so I have this

362
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:29,120
worthless now. I mean, I had to modify it to hook up to a to a garden hose because they

363
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:35,740
haven't gotten their hands on making garden hoses proprietary yet. Because like it's followed

364
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:40,180
me into my kitchen now my kitchen, even the kitchen sink is proprietary. They're trying

365
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:45,640
to take everything over, which just makes you know, to bring him back a little bit,

366
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:51,680
which just makes some of the work that purism is doing feel really quite important. And

367
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:56,360
there are other people doing that similar work. I think we've got an amazing community

368
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:02,600
who's pushing really hard to implement these ideals as much as possible. And in many ways,

369
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:11,360
it feels like we're lucky enough to be winning the sort of open source software game. And

370
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:15,900
it feels like you're on the sort of trailblazing side of the hardware game. Does that feel

371
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:21,560
pretty rewarding for you? It's definitely rewarding. I mean, it's at the time that we're

372
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:27,520
facing now, it's extra important, because for a while, and this kind of also goes hand

373
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:32,420
in hand with that grieving session I had with Linux Journal, went out of business,

374
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:37,520
but it goes to sort of the sense that the community has changed. And it's not in a bad

375
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:41,880
way. It's just the community is made up of different people. So for instance, 20-30 years

376
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:47,200
ago, technology was not very ubiquitous, not everyone had a computer with internet access.

377
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,960
But these days, it's more or less expected. I mean, there's some expectation that someone

378
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:55,960
has a computer in their pocket with forever internet connectivity at all times now. But

379
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:01,800
beyond that, even with free software, it has also become more ubiquitous. So when I got

380
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:06,380
started, you had to fight your way to get Linux installed in a company, you had to justify

381
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:12,680
using it for a file server or any kind of server at all, a web server. But then, starting

382
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:17,200
in, let's say, like 2005 or so, or even before that, but let's say around that time was sort

383
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:21,520
of this golden era where it was just assumed, well, yeah, Linux is a completely viable option

384
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:26,520
for anything you might want to do on the server side. Beyond that, free and open source software

385
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:29,800
was a viable option for software. There's a point in time before that where that was

386
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:34,520
considered, well, why would you want to see the source code that's not desirable? But

387
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:39,040
now it's sort of second nature. So you have this whole generation of people that grew

388
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:44,500
up and became adults in a world where they had instant access to technology, native access

389
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:48,600
to technology, and lived in a world where free software and open source software was

390
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:53,140
just an expectation. You'd see a project and, oh, I want to contribute to that, and you

391
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:57,760
expected that there would probably be source code on GitHub or some other repository that

392
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:03,240
you could edit, which all of that is great, but there's a downside to it, which is people

393
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:08,400
who grew up in that world now don't really understand why vendor lock-in would be a problem

394
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:13,480
because they've never really experienced vendor lock-in in the same kind of way in that it

395
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:18,840
was, how vendors can use it to restrict you. Because at this point, people, a lot of vendors

396
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:24,340
are still sort of building their influence and their power and haven't really, the other

397
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:31,000
shoe hasn't dropped yet in many cases for how vendors can misuse lock-in to affect the

398
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,080
choices of their customers.

399
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:38,760
I feel like we're seeing a different kind of vendor lock-in these days. And to me, that

400
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:45,320
feels like a vendor lock-in of services. Like if you look at the Googles and the, I don't

401
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:53,680
know, those kind of large surveillance capitalism style entities, it brings the conversation

402
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:57,720
in a whole other direction because we're not just talking hardware and software anymore.

403
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:02,480
We're talking sort of the kind of things that touch our everyday lives.

404
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,720
You may point out, well, if you use this product, this particular product will lock you into

405
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:11,480
this ecosystem where you have to only get products from the same vendor because that's

406
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:16,120
the only way it's compatible. And a lot of people these days would say, well, so what

407
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:18,540
does that matter? It's not a big deal.

408
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:22,740
Or if you start using this vendor, you will not be able to change to a different vendor

409
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:27,360
without a lot of pain and difficulty. And they'll say, well, but why does that matter?

410
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:33,080
And it's simply because they grew up in a world where there was a lot of ubiquitous

411
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:38,080
compatible technology due to the success of Linux in the free and open source software

412
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:45,360
movements that they could appreciate an internet with open protocols that were ubiquitous and

413
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,200
were cross compatible.

414
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:53,400
But now it's more important than ever to have, for example, stuff that Purism is doing to

415
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:57,780
try to forward those ideals and to build products that don't have vendor lock-in because it's

416
00:32:57,780 --> 00:33:01,920
almost an assumption. People don't necessarily even know the risks because they haven't lived

417
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:09,720
through the downsides. And so they are, in some cases, unaware of the world and the effects

418
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,800
that their choices have.

419
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:16,360
So one thing that we try to do with Purism is when we're designing a product, we heavily

420
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:21,560
factor in whether this would lock a customer into us as a vendor. And if it will, we actively

421
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:26,080
avoid using that technology. It's a completely sort of different approach, especially when

422
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,760
it comes to security than most vendors take.

423
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:33,560
If you were to ask some average person in information security to design a product that

424
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:38,680
was for high security to protect a user from something, they would take a very sort of

425
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:44,200
paternalistic approach to it that sort of maybe looks down on the user a little bit

426
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:49,920
as maybe a child where the vendor is the adult who can save them from themselves, that sort

427
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:55,320
of thing, and build a solution where the user has to come to the vendor for everything.

428
00:33:55,320 --> 00:34:00,840
They have to anchor all of their trust in the vendor because the vendor knows best.

429
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:05,480
Almost all of the solutions you see out there are based on that because those engineers

430
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:11,120
who designed them didn't really think about the same kind of free software ethics that

431
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:16,720
we do. And it's also in the vendor's advantage to lock a customer in.

432
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:21,680
But because we don't have any desire to lock the customer in, when we're designing these

433
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:26,280
security measures, we have a completely different playbook and we end up coming up with completely

434
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:30,680
different technologies to achieve a similar goal.

435
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:37,560
But in many cases, it would be to our advantage in some ways to try to lock in people or do

436
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:40,240
all of that sort of things that we don't agree with.

437
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:44,640
But in other ways, we have an advantage that a lot of other companies don't because there

438
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:48,500
are things that we're willing to do that they would never be willing to do, such as build

439
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:54,040
technology that's compatible with a competitor's technology just so that we have interoperability

440
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:59,440
or build a technology that puts the user in control and doesn't require them to come to

441
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,480
us for everything just because that matches with our ethics.

442
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:10,800
Yeah, it seems like with that paradigm shift comes real innovation simply out of need to

443
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,800
make it possible to match the ideals. And I think that's really honorable.

444
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:21,040
Well, a good example of it, I guess, is the first project I did for PureZone when I started

445
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:26,800
full time, which was work on the Librem key, which is a USB security token we have and

446
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:33,520
integration with this secure boot software called Heads, which is a different approach

447
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:40,040
to sort of a traditional secure boot software that your average laptop might have as an

448
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,700
option today.

449
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:46,920
So the way that the traditional solution works is the vendor has keys that they sign and

450
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:52,640
each system has a list of trusted certificates that they can use to validate a software as

451
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:57,080
it boots. If it matches signatures, they allow it to run. If it doesn't match, they don't

452
00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:01,940
allow it to run. Early on when this was put in place, the free software community kind

453
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:06,560
of went up in arms because they thought, well, this is going to stop people from booting

454
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:11,480
Linux. That never really happened. And it probably wasn't necessarily going to happen.

455
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:18,160
Who knows? But it didn't happen. What happened instead was that major Linux vendors such

456
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:23,480
as Red Hat and Canonical had to go to Microsoft and get their software approved and signed

457
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:26,500
so that it could boot with secure boot enabled because you either have a choice of having

458
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:30,300
it on or off, trusted or insecure.

459
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:36,780
So we didn't want the customer to have to come to us or go to Microsoft to get a signature

460
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:41,280
to be allowed to secure their boot process. So we took an approach where the keys that

461
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:45,600
we use to sign software, we don't necessarily sign it in the same traditional way, but the

462
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:49,720
keys that we use are customer controlled keys.

463
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:50,720
User generated, right?

464
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:54,040
Yeah, they can generate them. We generate some at the factory that are temporary just

465
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:58,160
to protect the user in shipment. And when they get the laptop, we encourage them to

466
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:03,800
change them completely with their own keys and make it as easy as we can to do it. But

467
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:08,320
it required a completely different approach than you traditionally would have and a lot

468
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:14,200
of extra work and a lot of extra engineering to do it. But the end result to us is at least

469
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:18,320
a lot better because it puts the user in full control of their computer, which we don't

470
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:23,800
feel like a user should have to come to us and anchor their trust in us wholly for them

471
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,760
to be safe.

472
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:30,580
That's amazing. I think as someone who really, you know, I really care about those things

473
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:37,560
and understand how difficult they are to implement and also to have accepted widely, especially

474
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:43,000
when it's such a different, you know, a change of mentality with how some of this is working.

475
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,840
I think pushing the envelope in this area is really valuable. So thank you for doing

476
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,680
the hard work. That's for sure.

477
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:56,040
I want to ask you if there's anything you feel about purism that is either about its

478
00:37:56,040 --> 00:38:03,440
products or its culture or its values that you feel is at all sort of misrepresented

479
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:10,000
or misunderstood in the wider either Linux community or in the public eye?

480
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,000
I suppose one of the main things that I see and I've seen, I saw this from almost the

481
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:20,060
very beginning before I even worked at Purism, was that this whole Linux community has been

482
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:27,440
hurt so many times by companies that come in and say the right words but don't actually

483
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:34,320
believe in the movement, who then take advantage of sort of the good nature and the efforts

484
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:38,880
of the free software community without either contributing back or, you know, using it at

485
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,040
the beginning and then sort of doing a bait and switch. I mean, you could argue a lot

486
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:48,200
of open core projects are kind of this approach to of getting the free software community

487
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:53,280
to provide initial free labor to build a product when they're in the seed round. And then once

488
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:57,560
they have a proof of concept, they – a lot of these companies get Series A funding or

489
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:01,680
Series B funding and then at that point, they hire up some of the top contributors and pay

490
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:06,200
them to work on a proprietary product, you know, that they're going to sell and ultimately

491
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,640
kind of abandon the original.

492
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:11,680
So this has happened time and time again with the community and so that the community just

493
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:17,780
really been hurt over and over again. Purism has gone to a lot of extremes to demonstrate

494
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:22,460
that it believes what it says and going as far as incorporating as a social purpose corporation

495
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:27,140
so the ethics are, you know, we're legally bound to the ethics. So an investor can't

496
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:32,000
force us to abandon them for profit. But even with all of that, because the community has

497
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,560
been hurt so many times, it's natural to conclude, well, this is a – Purism is yet

498
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:41,200
another company that is saying the right words but doesn't actually believe it and they

499
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,760
say things but they don't really want to follow through. They have all of the, you

500
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:49,280
know, there's an assumption that pretty much every company has nefarious intentions. So

501
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:54,200
I suppose the biggest thing to clear up if necessary is that, you know, I see this applied

502
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:58,280
to Purism from the very beginning, like when Todd first said our goal is to make a laptop

503
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:03,240
that for example has free software firmware. We want it to run core boot. We had people

504
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:08,800
including some people that were like core boot developers at the time said you're lying.

505
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,100
You have no intention of ever doing that. You will never do that. You're just saying

506
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:17,300
it to sell laptops. Even after, you know, they put a job description out to hire a full-time

507
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:20,780
core boot developer, they said the same stuff even after they hired the position and started

508
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:25,680
working on it. Same sort of thing. I mean, the only thing that actually silenced that

509
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:31,200
kind of critique was shipping a laptop that had core boot on, you know, shipping it.

510
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:35,880
Exactly right. But I think in some ways you're always going to have those skeptics because

511
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:40,640
it's some of this has never been done before. And so maybe it means you're headed in the

512
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,640
right direction.

513
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:45,080
I mean, yeah, I mean, it's all very difficult. You know, I mean, we're doing in some cases

514
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:49,020
like we've run into similar things with the phone because we have these huge ambitions

515
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:55,840
that are long term goals with the phone that are really difficult to do and incredibly

516
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:59,360
challenging because in many cases that means we have to do everything from scratch because

517
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:04,280
it's so different from what's out there. I mean, I've had conversations with many people

518
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:10,220
on the subject over the years. And what I've discovered is ultimately the only thing that

519
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:14,120
really silences critics, at least most of them, is doing the thing.

520
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:18,240
I think it's going in amazing places. And I hope that it continues to go in amazing

521
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:21,560
places. It seems like you have wonderful people working on all this stuff. So I'm sure some

522
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:27,700
really amazing things will come out of it. One question I want to ask is whether you

523
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:33,560
have an ask of the community or of listeners, something maybe you'd like them to see, go

524
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:37,400
see something you'd like them to try or something you'd like them to think about.

525
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:42,440
So I have something I want to say to two different sides of the community that are sort of both

526
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:48,720
part of the overall Linux or free software community, which is, you know, what I've noticed

527
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:54,200
and this is something I realized in my soul searching about Linux Journal was that what's

528
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:59,680
happened is as technologies become more ubiquitous and everyone just sort of now grows up and

529
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:04,480
is using computers. Well, that hasn't always been the case. And when it wasn't, people

530
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:09,800
who were in the free software community were people to get that kind of knowledge to develop

531
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:14,800
software to use computers. It was not very accessible. And so it attracted, well, it

532
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:19,720
attracted nerds. I consider myself among them. You kind of had to be a nerd to be willing

533
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:25,840
to spend the time isolated in front of a computer, learning all of this arcane knowledge to contribute

534
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:31,800
to this community and to build software. Well, if you fast forward, you know, 20 years, 30

535
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:36,400
years from that, the world's a completely different place and technology is ubiquitous.

536
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:40,640
Computers are ubiquitous and programming is ubiquitous and very accessible. You don't

537
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:46,320
have to spend years in a basement, you know, in front of a green and black screen to develop

538
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:51,840
software anymore. It's very accessible. And as a result, as part of that, you have a way

539
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:57,360
more diverse non-nerd group of people who have entered the technology realm, technology

540
00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:03,560
careers and the free software community as a byproduct of that. Well, it's created this

541
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:11,280
culture clash. And so I liken it to these nerds who decided to throw a party and it's

542
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:16,160
a Dungeons and Dragons party and they have this really great campaign and they're having

543
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:22,280
a lot of fun and word gets out to everybody else that, hey, I heard this really great

544
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:26,680
party is on such and such a street, this address. And then you have the rest of the school show

545
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:31,220
up and like all of the jocks and all the everything else, everybody else shows up to this party

546
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:37,360
and they're like, oh, wow, this party sucks. And they, you know, throw a kegger in the

547
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:41,720
middle of this Dungeons and Dragons campaign. Right. And so I would say that that's sort

548
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:47,260
of what's happened in our community now where we have completely diverse group in the free

549
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:51,380
software community. So you have everything ranging from the traditional diehard, nerdy

550
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:57,340
geeks like myself, and you have people that have average social skills and come from a

551
00:43:57,340 --> 00:44:01,560
completely different background. I mean, it wasn't that common 30 years ago for someone

552
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:05,520
to say, well, yeah, I want you to go to business school, honey, and get your degree. And then

553
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:10,280
I want you to be a tech entrepreneur. It was more like be a doctor or a lawyer or something.

554
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:13,440
But now a lot of people are doing this. So you have a lot of people with MBAs. I mean,

555
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:18,440
there's this whole notion of people being a brogrammer. They're crushing their code

556
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:20,640
and crushing beer cans against their head and stuff.

557
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,480
I've never heard that before. That's hilarious.

558
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:29,280
I mean, can you imagine 30 years ago, someone doing that? It just wasn't the culture. So

559
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:33,720
anyway, all that to say, we have this culture clash now. And what I want to say to both

560
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:39,000
groups, I guess, is one is to recognize that everyone's in the same community, whether

561
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:44,420
you're this old diehard geek that knows all of these original kind of truths about free

562
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:50,820
software, or you're someone who's just come into the community more recently and who isn't

563
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:56,080
aware of these things. One, both groups are part of the community. And number two, what

564
00:44:56,080 --> 00:45:04,560
I would say to the people who were the hardcore original members of this community is to guide

565
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:09,200
the people who have just entered this community, teach them about the original ethics and the

566
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:13,960
original things that you take for granted that you learned that they were never exposed

567
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:17,000
to in a very understanding way.

568
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,800
Sometimes I see people in the community use these sorts of things as almost like a litmus

569
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:26,360
test, or are you geeky enough to be in this community, that sort of thing, which is pretty

570
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:32,300
worthless in my mind. So I would beg people that have been for a while, use your knowledge

571
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:38,640
of all these things beneficially to the community, to all the newcomers in it, to explain to

572
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:42,840
them why all these values matter, make them relevant. The people who have just joined

573
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:49,640
the community, I would ask them to please be patient with all of these hardcore old

574
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:57,440
geeks who are still learning all of these new social rules that they're being exposed

575
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:03,000
to now that this community is very diverse, people of all kinds of backgrounds. If you're

576
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:09,080
new to the community and you're very extroverted, then you also take certain things for granted.

577
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:15,480
Just like the hardcore geeks may take knowledge of the Four Freedoms for granted, people who

578
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:20,240
are very extroverted may take for granted that it's easy to talk to other people, it's

579
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:24,880
easy to have a conversation and not really understand that sort of thing. I guess the

580
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:32,240
final thing is I would also go back to the original group and ask them to please try

581
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:36,360
to be more open to learning these new social protocols. I see a lot of times flare ups

582
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:41,440
in the community that really come down to certain people digging in their heels and

583
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:45,560
saying, you know what, I don't want to know what new social rules are. I don't want to

584
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:53,060
follow any sort of new protocol. I'm also incapable of doing it, which I don't buy because

585
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:59,440
the same kind of person could recite verbatim the coming of age ceremony in Klingon and

586
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:04,840
will get into a flame war about proper mailing list etiquette. God forbid you pop post on

587
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:10,600
their mailing list. They memorize all of these very complex rules of social engagement. So

588
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:16,920
having empathy and social skills for regular human beings is not beyond them. It's just

589
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:18,120
a matter of putting in the effort.

590
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:22,800
Yeah, I feel like the thing to remember there is that we're all chasing very similar goals

591
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:28,320
and we just have to communicate a little bit and understand each other to get there together.

592
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:35,760
And also the value in community managers. We've gotten to know a few here and they are

593
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:42,680
golden. It's not a skill that was necessarily recognized early on in software development.

594
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:45,040
But man, does it ever feel important these days?

595
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:51,240
Yeah, more important than ever, because, you know, we finally realized that that contribution

596
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:56,840
to a community isn't simply I wrote some code and submitted it. You know, there's all of

597
00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:01,480
these different ways the community needs contribution. You know, everything from that code is very

598
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:08,000
useful, but also documentation, also solid bug reports. Also, I mean, there's 50 different

599
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,160
levels of contribution in most of those areas we were lacking in, in a great way. We weren't

600
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:14,000
necessarily lacking in the code.

601
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:19,880
Well, Kyle, if people wanted to get connected with you to say hi, or otherwise share a little

602
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:22,500
bit of social connection, where can they find you?

603
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:27,960
If you are part of the Fediverse, you can reach me at Kyle at Libram.one. If you use

604
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:32,120
like Mastodon or clients like that. And if you use something like Twitter, you can see

605
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:39,720
me at Kyle Rankin with no space. And I also have a personal website that is at kylrank.in.

606
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:45,720
Which I love. Kyle, thanks so much for your time. This was a lovely chat. I really enjoyed

607
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:59,360
it and hope we get to chat soon again.
