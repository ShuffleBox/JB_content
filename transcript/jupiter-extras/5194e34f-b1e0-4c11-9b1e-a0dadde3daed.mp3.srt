00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,320
Well, hello, everyone. Welcome to Brunch with Brent. Joining me today is Stuart Langridge.

2
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,520
Stuart, how are you? And thank you so much for joining me.

3
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,560
Hi, Brent. And thank you very much for inviting me.

4
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:29,240
Anytime. Some may know you from co-hosting the podcast Bad Voltage. I think many will

5
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:35,620
recognize your voice. It's one of a kind. And I know for sure that your laughter is

6
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:41,200
something that always gets to me. So that's appreciated. Tell me a little bit about Bad

7
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,080
Voltage. What is it? How does it start for you? And where's it going, maybe?

8
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:54,360
Okay, so Bad Voltage is a technology podcast. The intention is that it's about things that

9
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:59,400
the hosts find interesting. The hosts now are myself, John O'Bacon, who people might

10
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:04,920
have heard of as the, he was a community manager of Ubuntu. Then he worked for XPrize and GitHub.

11
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:11,360
Now he runs John O'Bacon Consulting. And Jeremy Garcia, who runs Linux Questions and has been

12
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:17,800
around forever. He used to work for himself. And the three of us do the podcast once a

13
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:24,480
fortnight. And the intention, as I say, is that it's a general technology focus. It tends

14
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:33,840
to skew a little bit towards the open source end of the universe. But that's mostly because

15
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:40,380
the three of us are quite interested in that area. So you'll hear the word Linux turn up

16
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:47,000
on it more than you might do on, say, The Verge podcast. But the key point here is that's

17
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,440
not what it's about. We occasionally get people who will show up and complain that we're not

18
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:55,640
covering the release of a distribution or something. And we're like, we're not a Linux

19
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:01,160
podcast. We're not an open source podcast. The fact that we came out of that area, I

20
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:05,480
mean, perfect example of someone else who came out of that area. I used to go to the

21
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:10,760
GNOME summits, the GUARDEC. This is the GNOME User and Developer Summit, which happens every

22
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:19,040
year. And one of the first people I met at one of those back in 2004, 2005, was a chap

23
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:26,400
called Nat Friedman, who was working on GNOME. And now he's CEO of GitHub. So not everyone

24
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,560
who necessarily starts in the free software arena ends up in that place. And having a

25
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,960
wider arena, I think, is interesting. It gives us the opportunity to talk about things that

26
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:41,600
affect the technology world from a bigger perspective and things in technology that

27
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:46,640
affect the wider world more generally. One of the nice things about doing Bad Voltage

28
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:54,120
as well is that we get to do live shows. So we'll do a stage performance, a live performance

29
00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:00,680
of the show. We've done those six or seven times now, I think. We've done most of them

30
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:07,400
at scale, the Southern California Linux Expo, which I got back from, what, two weeks ago,

31
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,920
I think. And we had an absolute whale of a time. The live show is always brilliant.

32
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,920
That's lovely.

33
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:18,360
Yeah. One of the things we've been talking about is maybe doing more live shows and shaking

34
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:23,520
up the format a little bit. But that's still under discussion. So I'm not going to reveal

35
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:29,560
the discussions just yet. But if you're interested in what we might be doing, then listen to

36
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,000
the show.

37
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,440
What I appreciate about the show, actually, is its flexibility in content. Because the

38
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:45,080
three of you clearly have experiences and a depth of experience in the kind of topics

39
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:51,800
that the Linux-y and open source-y folk like us tend to appreciate. But some topics that

40
00:03:51,800 --> 00:04:00,960
have come up have been questions like, what does privacy mean in the current era? Each

41
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:07,840
perspective has been explored, which I appreciate. It's like, well, there's the idealistic side

42
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:14,080
of it, but also the pragmatic side of it. And just the discussions that you each had

43
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:19,000
there I thought was really rich. So thanks for putting that out there.

44
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,320
Thank you. I mean, that's obviously the intention behind these things is to at least attempt

45
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:29,720
to look at a problem somewhat pragmatically, somewhat idealistically. I mean, in general,

46
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:35,120
I probably end up being the most idealistic of the three of us, but it depends quite dramatically

47
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:40,760
on what the topic is. Jeremy's the most knowledgeable and Jono's the most fervent. But Jono would

48
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:45,640
say he was the most practical. I would say I was the most knowledgeable and I'd be wrong.

49
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:51,880
But I think that exactly the goal is to attempt to look at big picture things. I mean, we've

50
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,440
done quite a lot of looking at privacy, so we're probably going to move on from that

51
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:59,600
now. But we have spent quite some time looking at various different angles of things like

52
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:06,800
facial recognition and big companies gathering our data and stuff like that. And obviously,

53
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,280
I have a certain amount of interest in this kind of thing myself. I've spoken at conferences

54
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:19,240
about it and things like that. So it's attempting to take that half a step back and look at

55
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:23,400
the bigger picture. But it might be the bigger picture around something relatively small.

56
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:33,680
One of the shows we did recently was essentially a full show review of an email client called

57
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,960
Superhuman.

58
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,560
This was a fascinating episode.

59
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,840
It turned out even more interesting than I thought it would, I think, because it was

60
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:47,640
a review in the New York review of books style, a review where you spend the first 30 seconds

61
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:51,680
talking about the product and then the rest of it essentially talking about something

62
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,440
vaguely related to it in order to give you an excuse to talk about the bigger picture

63
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:03,800
thing. So we segued quite relatively quickly into the bigger picture of email clients in

64
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:10,280
general and whether email is important and user experience and user interface and how

65
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:17,320
Gmail was streets ahead of the competition. And now it isn't, but no one else has really

66
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:21,380
stepped up to take that play and maybe Superhuman are it. Is it a good idea to trust your email

67
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:29,080
to a company like this? So it's all kind of larger thoughts prompted by a particular thing.

68
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,560
And again, that was interesting because we got some feedback from people saying, why

69
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,880
would you spend the whole time talking about a proprietary email client? And we were like,

70
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,680
why wouldn't we? It's an interesting product if you're an email power user.

71
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:47,320
Jono certainly loves it to bits. I don't get anywhere near enough email to warrant this

72
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:52,280
kind of thing. But as with everything else, I mean, we reviewed a Kindle one, say, you

73
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:57,120
know, which was 10 years old at the time. But the whole point is that it's a stepping

74
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:03,040
stone into a larger question. It's very rare that we talk about a thing just for the sake

75
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,680
of the thing itself.

76
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:11,700
And no product is isolated. It's always in an environment interacting with all sorts

77
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:18,560
of other things. So it warrants that exploration, I think. And that's often missed.

78
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:24,220
There is almost nothing I own, which, as you say, I use in isolation. There isn't anything

79
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:31,040
like that. Everything has a cultural context, a technological context. You might think of

80
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:36,680
it as compatibility, but it's not technological compatibility. It's not, are there drivers

81
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:41,800
for this in my Ubuntu kernel? It's more, is it compatible with the way I live the rest

82
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:46,960
of my life? There's no point in buying a device to control your smart home if you have no

83
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,480
intention of buying any smart home light bulbs.

84
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,480
Right.

85
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:54,400
And similarly, there's not a lot of point in buying one smart light bulb for your house

86
00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:01,080
because what's the point, you know? So if you've decided to invest yourself in a particular

87
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,600
area of technology, you've got to think, does all this stuff fit together? Does it fit in

88
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:10,640
with my life? What am I going to do when new people walk into the house? That kind of thing.

89
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:15,840
So that, I think, that cultural context of how does it fit into my life? How does it

90
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:21,760
fit into the larger scheme of technology as a whole? Is this product an example of something

91
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:25,840
which is taking us in a direction that we want to go in or a direction that we don't

92
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:30,800
want to go in? Is anyone else doing it better? That, to me, is almost more interesting than

93
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,720
the thing itself.

94
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:39,440
Which is why spending an episode on a proprietary email service, while that seems like you spent

95
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,600
the entire episode simply on that product, that's not true at all, right? So there's

96
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:51,360
a real value in exploring kind of what's rubbing shoulders with that email service because

97
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,440
obviously it got there somehow and it's necessarily a cultural indicator.

98
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:00,960
That's precisely the plan. I mean, certainly I remember when Gmail first came out, everyone

99
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:07,840
was super duper impressed with it because it was fast and it basically never got spam

100
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:14,080
wrong and it was easy to use. And that was great. But as far as I can tell since then,

101
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:21,960
since 2012 or something, it's kind of stagnated. And there's been ample opportunity. People

102
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:25,280
say, well, why don't you use Thunderbird or whatever? Yeah, okay. But Thunderbird is exactly

103
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,840
the same now as it was in 2008.

104
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,680
Yeah, it really is.

105
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:38,400
There's a whole bunch of space for people to innovate in the way they handle my email.

106
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:43,240
This is not about innovating in what email is because companies tend to think, hey, let's

107
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:48,280
innovate in email by getting rid of all the things that make email good. Like the fact

108
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:57,360
that it's free and I can run my own server. But the last big change in the way I think

109
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:05,040
email was handled was Gmail inventing conversations. And you forget, if you go back to a non-Gmail

110
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:10,240
way of looking at your mail, you forget that conversations aren't part of how email works.

111
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:16,200
They're a Gmail thing. And still to this day, as far as I can tell, no one's actually caught

112
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:21,440
up with that. And that was nearly 10 years ago. So the idea that someone is going to

113
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:29,120
say, let's find a way of handling email, which is more in tune with the way email works today,

114
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,160
I think is really interesting. One of the things that has, one of the accusations I

115
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,720
should say, that's often been levelled at the open source community is that we're towel

116
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,200
light chasers. That there's no innovation going on. That all we know how to do is wait

117
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,320
till a proprietary product comes along and then clone it. Now, I don't think that's true.

118
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,800
Part of the reason I don't think it's true is that every time someone comes up with a

119
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:54,040
new WYSIWYG proprietary thing, someone is always able to point to a half-finished, half-written

120
00:10:54,040 --> 00:11:00,360
GTK app from 2006, which did basically what this was talking about and say, see, no, we

121
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:06,880
invented it first. What we are not good at as a community, in my opinion, is actually

122
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,480
doing the final mile. Turning a thing from a project into a product, turning a thing

123
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:15,440
from a proof of concept into something that real people can use. And they can be real

124
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,880
people like me. They don't have to be real people like my family, who aren't very technological

125
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:25,560
at all. I've got no problem if they're real people who need a bit of technical knowledge,

126
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:32,760
but I would like to see us have the confidence in our innovations. I mean, places where we

127
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:36,040
do lead the world, if you look at stuff the Linux kernel does with things like containers

128
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:42,160
and so on, they said, okay, we think it's a good idea to enable this concept of containers.

129
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:50,280
And they created the cloud, right? People were doing VMs before, but this stuff didn't

130
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:55,920
really take off until the Linux container stuff really got started. And so some people

131
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,320
in the kernel team go, we're going to invent these things called containers to enable you

132
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:05,960
to namespace and sandbox a Linux installation on top of another Linux installation. Created

133
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:09,760
the cloud, which now dominates the whole technology industry. That's what happens when you get

134
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:14,520
something right. And it's something that happened in open source first. And for everyone who

135
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,980
says, I don't understand why YouTube is so interesting. I invented YouTube by sketching

136
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:23,400
the answer on the back of a cigarette packet in 2004. The answer is because the idea of

137
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,840
going, I know what I'll do. I'll let people upload video and then download it to their

138
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:31,240
own computers. That's not the revelation. Ideas are not the hard bit. Execution is the

139
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:37,400
hard bit. Delivery is the hard bit. And I'd love to see us doing more of that.

140
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:44,240
I like how you mentioned that final mile because that's so true. It feels like, well, maybe

141
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:49,500
I'll put a question to you. Do you think that that final mile is such a challenge because

142
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:57,000
of some of the economic realities of open source projects? Like creating a stereotypical

143
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:03,320
successful business around a project isn't necessarily in line with open source ideals.

144
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,440
Would you agree with that? Or what do you think?

145
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:13,960
Oh, now there's a contentious opinion. I don't think that making money is inimical to open

146
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:20,480
source ideals. I think they are perfectly compatible. Some of the reason I think, and

147
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:25,920
this discussion has come up quite a lot recently, the idea about making a Linux app rather than

148
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:33,400
making another distribution. What we don't see is a lot of apps coming out. And that's

149
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:38,480
disappointing to me at least. And I think some of the reason for that is that that last

150
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:45,160
mile is not very well documented. So people think that, well, that can't be that hard.

151
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:49,840
But actually, once you've finished writing an app which does something, the amount of

152
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:56,280
work it takes to go from there to getting it into someone's hands in a delightful state

153
00:13:56,280 --> 00:14:01,840
is just as much work as building the thing was in the first place. So if you say, well,

154
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,840
okay, I've written the code, now it's on GitHub, just download it and install it. You've only

155
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:11,480
actually done half the work at that point, right? You've got to sit down and design the

156
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:16,600
icons for it and get them drawn. And you've got to think about the UI and make sure that

157
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,560
everything's spaced correctly, everything's laid out correctly. And you've got to make

158
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:23,000
sure that right to left text works. And you've got to make sure that you can paste emojis

159
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,600
into your app and it doesn't crash. And you've got to give it a good name. And you've got

160
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:31,400
to give it a good strap line. And you've got to upload it to one of two or three different

161
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:35,560
stores depending on who you go with. And then after you've done all that, you've got to

162
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:41,640
get the word out to people. And marketing is really hard. And our community has a habit

163
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:47,680
of sneering at marketeers. And there's a small amount of truth in this. Because there are

164
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:54,480
certainly plenty of people, or plenty of products, I should say, which are basically worthless

165
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:59,080
but got to be popular because they had good marketing. But, and this is important, not

166
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:06,440
everything is like that. Yes, you can occasionally make something popular by having a really

167
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:10,920
strong marketing team, even if the thing itself doesn't deserve popularity. Fine, we can sneer

168
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:19,360
at celebrities or Dasani water all we like. But the flip side of that is that building

169
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:24,060
a better mousetrap doesn't work either. The fact that you have better technology does

170
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:30,440
not ensure that you will be successful. And you do have to do all the other work as well.

171
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:39,440
The fact is a thing needs to be, or it should be, beautiful and available and viable, as

172
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:48,200
well as working. And I'd very much like to see the focus of the open source community

173
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,160
shift to making that kind of thing more possible.

174
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:56,680
I wonder if it's because the open source, you know, our open source community is filled

175
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:03,720
with, or seemingly filled with generally engineers, and that the slow trickle of people coming

176
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:10,800
to it now, perhaps are those who are strong in design and marketing, and that maybe there's

177
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:16,400
a void there in the teams and collaborations that is only now getting filled.

178
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:24,480
I would certainly agree. Yeah, the history is that way. I've had a bunch of really interesting

179
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:30,120
conversations about this with Alan Puck, who I know you've already had on, who you've already

180
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,120
had brunch with.

181
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,120
Yes.

182
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:41,480
One of the things which is my opinion on this, which not everybody shares, is that, yes,

183
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:48,600
as we came primarily from an engineering background as a community, we tend to overweight engineering

184
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:54,000
concerns and underweight other things. The flip side of that is historically, if you

185
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,280
look at people who used Macs, they came out of a very designer focused community, which

186
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:01,680
meant that you got beautiful apps and that kind of thing, which is great. But every now

187
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:07,080
and again, you'll see an app which converts Celsius to Fahrenheit, and it's a beautiful

188
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:13,320
app. And someone downloads this app and then runs it on the desktop. And I think to myself,

189
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:18,320
but that's like one line in a terminal.

190
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:23,560
Now, there are a couple of things here. The first one is, yes, it's one line for someone

191
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:30,400
like me. It's not a tall one line for, say, my dad. And that's critically important. There

192
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:35,200
is the accusation, again, leveled at our community that we tend to be, just open a terminal and

193
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:42,720
do everything and real people can't do this. And that was historically true. Unfortunately,

194
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:47,200
it still is true for some parts of our community. I'll give you an example. If I say to someone,

195
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:52,640
hey, install this piece of software. So, do that by opening a bunch of software center

196
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,280
and then searching for the name of it and then clicking search, you know, like real

197
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,520
people do. You'll get a bunch of feedback saying, why don't you just tell people to

198
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:02,800
open a terminal and type sudo apt install. Actually, what they'll say is sudo apt get

199
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:07,600
install, which annoys me. Slight diversion. If you're getting if people are kicking to

200
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:13,320
use commands, at least use the up-to-date ones rather than the ones from 2006. But anyway,

201
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:18,840
ignore that. I mean, these days, it might be sudo snap install or sudo flat pack install.

202
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:26,480
Anyway, there is a certain amount of power in the command line stuff. You shouldn't demand

203
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:33,280
that people use it. But equally, power users can find this kind of thing more important.

204
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,400
To give you an example, and this harks back slightly to the superhuman thing we were talking

205
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:41,840
about a moment ago. One of the things that superhuman have done, their email client,

206
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:46,480
is to give you the ability to run almost any command by giving you a little pop up command

207
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,440
palette, they call it. This is very similar to the command palette that you get in Visual

208
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:56,560
Studio Code, for example, the editor or Sublime Text, where anything the editor is capable

209
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:01,120
of doing is available with a little summonable command palette, which gives you basically

210
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:06,640
a box you can type in to search for a command it can run. Which means that the way a bunch

211
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:12,280
of these power user tools have managed to make them more suitable to power users here

212
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:19,440
in 2020 is to put a command line back in. Which is, you know, great. But I think it's

213
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:26,000
interesting that there is that value in this stuff. But equally, and more importantly,

214
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:36,800
they're power user tools. So they're not necessarily suitable for an ordinary person. But, and

215
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:41,680
I'd be interested in your thoughts on this, actually. If you asked a whole bunch of people,

216
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:49,720
how do I convert 71 Fahrenheit to centigrade? I think what they'd do is they'd open a browser

217
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,800
and type 71 Fahrenheit centigrade into Google.

218
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,800
Yes.

219
00:19:53,800 --> 00:20:01,280
And as far as I can tell, that's a command line command, right? You get a box to type

220
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:07,640
things into, and you type commands into it in a particular format, and it gives you the

221
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:14,160
answer. I mean, conceptually, that's quite a lot more like a command line than it is

222
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:17,360
like a graphical application, isn't it?

223
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,360
Yeah.

224
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:27,280
But why have we not managed to seize that? Why have we, an engineering led culture, which

225
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:35,080
Google is as well, why do they get credit for doing that, whereas our community are

226
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:39,640
decried for occasionally wanting the same thing? So I'd be interested in your thoughts

227
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,120
on that.

228
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:47,120
Very curious juxtaposition there. I love it. I think what Google got right, and why someone

229
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:54,940
like me goes to, I don't use Google very much, but why we go to search engines to find such

230
00:20:54,940 --> 00:21:02,440
simple information like that, is that they are a true success in converting a variety

231
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:07,980
of English or any language really into the answer that we're actually looking for. So

232
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:13,880
you don't need to be as precise as you would on, say, a classic command line to get the

233
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:21,600
answer you're looking for. So if you open a command line for any regular user, it's

234
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:29,220
daunting, I think, for two reasons. One, because you need to be so exact, otherwise the possibility

235
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:36,200
of screwing something up is quite high, but also that the discoverability in most terminals

236
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:42,400
is quite awful. You can't just really play easily to discover what you're looking for,

237
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:47,920
where looking at a search engine, it's very difficult to do anything wrong in a search

238
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:52,960
engine, and yet you can just play and try things until you get it right, which maybe

239
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,720
we can learn something from that.

240
00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:01,360
I wholeheartedly agree with this, to the point where I went back in time and did a talk about

241
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:08,920
this at about 10 different conferences last year. So I have talked with UX of text, and

242
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:15,360
it's about precisely this, the user experience of text interfaces, because two other places

243
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:21,480
where we're seeing textual interfaces get used outside a terminal and a Google search

244
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:26,180
box or a DuckDuckGo search box or start page search box, wherever it is you like, two other

245
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:32,640
places where we see a textual interface used are chat bots on Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp

246
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:41,480
or Telegram or Discord or whatever it is you use, and secondly, voice assistants. So Google

247
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:48,960
Home or the Amazon Echo, and those things are essentially textual interfaces. Yes, you

248
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:55,320
are speaking out loud to them, but you are doing so with words, as opposed to a GUI,

249
00:22:55,320 --> 00:23:00,760
where you're essentially identifying a picture and clicking on it. You point and grunt like

250
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:09,080
a caveman. One of the things that led us out of caves and created modern society was language,

251
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:15,440
and the idea that language, that text has a user interface and has user experience and

252
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:20,320
needs to be optimized is something which the technology community as a whole, not just

253
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:24,920
the open source, but the whole technology community has slighted rather over the last

254
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:30,880
40 or 50 years. But there are people who are very good at this, and they are authors and

255
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:39,320
poets and writers. There's an example in a Neal Stephenson book, Snow Crash, I think

256
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:46,240
it was, about a woman in the book, and she gives an example of being at a dinner with

257
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:54,520
her grandmother, and she was, I think, recently pregnant or something along those lines. And

258
00:23:54,520 --> 00:24:02,560
just by saying that, she never mentioned it at all, and her grandmother, wise old woman,

259
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:08,040
picked up on the nuances of her expression and the kinds of things she was saying and

260
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:13,280
deduced what had happened without ever having been told. And it's that kind of nuance that

261
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:17,800
I think is interesting. I'll give you an example. Who's your favorite fiction author?

262
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:23,160
Hmm. The book that hit me the most that comes to mind first in 1984.

263
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:26,560
That's a good example. Orwell's a very good example of this, to the point where he wrote

264
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:30,840
essays about word choice and how to think about things. But that's the thing. If you

265
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:37,360
think about a book that you've liked, if an author is good at what they do, they can use

266
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:45,400
one or two words in a way that puts a whole picture into your head, and in a way in which,

267
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:50,180
in theory, you could use a synonym for any one of those words, and the sentence would

268
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:53,200
still mean the same thing, but it wouldn't give the same impression. It wouldn't give

269
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:59,040
you that sense of immersion into the world they're describing. I mean, the holy grail

270
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:03,000
of this kind of thing is Patrick Rothfuss, for people who are fantasy readers like I

271
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:10,840
am, who spends an absurd amount of time over word choice and things like that, precisely

272
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:18,480
because he's hugely aware of the impressions that each individual word gives. To give you

273
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:24,800
a Rothfuss example, he's describing in The Wise Man's Fear, which is one of his books,

274
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:31,680
there's a kind of an underground complex, and there's a woman who lives in this underground

275
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:37,320
complex, and she's a bit weird. Lives down there on her own, doesn't like talking to

276
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:41,240
people, but she's named all the different areas of this, which is obviously some kind

277
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:47,240
of ancient, abandoned catacomb with bits of machinery in it and so on.

278
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,240
It sounds lovely.

279
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:53,040
Yeah, well, you know, I don't think I want to live in it, but then I'm not hour-y. She's

280
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:58,400
named all the different rooms and different areas of this complex, and they're all named

281
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,720
with things which sound like words, but aren't actually words we know. So a bit is called

282
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:10,720
downings, and a bit is called cricklet, and one bit is called billows. And each of these

283
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:15,160
things are evocative in a particular way. If I said to you the word cricklet, it's not

284
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:20,920
a word that necessarily means something to you, because it's not a word, right?

285
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:26,720
Yeah, just by hearing it, I can approach perhaps what it might look or feel like.

286
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,720
Yes.

287
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:31,960
And that's simply with language, which is exactly, I think, your point.

288
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:36,560
And that is exactly precisely my point. And that's the kind of thing that I'd like to

289
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:44,400
see people doing more of, thinking about the user experience of text. Think of the amount

290
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:52,360
of care and attention that goes into a graphic application or a website from a designer.

291
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:59,240
They'll spend days, weeks, considering things like the flow of the text and how much space

292
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:03,000
there is in between each individual thing and exactly how rounded the corners should

293
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,720
be. And those people who are listening to this, who have a history in development and

294
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:13,120
working with design, will probably be aware of the frustration when you build something

295
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,600
and the designer says, but that's not right, because it's really important that these things

296
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:20,560
are 14 pixels apart, and you've got them 16 pixels apart, and you want to just say, why

297
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:24,880
does it matter? But the point is it does matter because they're the designers and they understand

298
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:30,520
this stuff and developers don't as much. So you take their word for it. But that level

299
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:38,240
of care and attention to detail is just as applicable to text. And that happens in, I

300
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:45,080
think, two ways. The first one is when you have a conversation with a piece of software,

301
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:53,560
whether that's an Amazon Echo, or it's a chatbot, or it's, you know, the shell in your terminal,

302
00:27:53,560 --> 00:28:02,560
or it's the Google search box. We need to work out a way of guiding people, as developers,

303
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:06,840
we need to work out a way of guiding people towards the correct answer without making

304
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:13,600
it their fault that they don't have the correct answer. Now the terminal, precisely as you

305
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:19,560
say, if you get something even a tiny bit wrong, it just put in syntax error, get lost.

306
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,560
Computer says no.

307
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:24,440
Chastises you for wanting to learn or not knowing.

308
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:32,440
Yeah. And as you say, Google search box, it's almost impossible to do something wrong. Back

309
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:37,600
when I was a child here in the UK, you had eight bit computers. So the Acorn Electron

310
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:42,020
and the Single S Spectrum and the Corridor 64 and so on. I know there are different ones

311
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:46,880
in other countries. But the principle back then, you got a machine, you turned it on,

312
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:51,240
it booted immediately because all the stuff was in ROM. And then you had a command line.

313
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:56,400
And that command line was basically a way of entering basic commands. But one of the

314
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:01,160
things that stuck in my head is, I think this was in the manual, start programming with

315
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:04,800
the Electron, which is the book you got with the Acorn Electron, which was an extremely

316
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:11,120
naughty eight bit computer in about 1983. And it said very near the beginning, you can

317
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:17,200
type anything you want into this, you will not damage your computer. It gave you the

318
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:22,480
freedom to play, to explore. You think, well, the worst that can happen is that it just

319
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:27,500
says no. Now admittedly, it had that very command line experience of just printing syntax

320
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:32,640
error or no or mistake. If you did anything other than exactly what you needed to, which

321
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:38,920
is why computers didn't take off as much in the 80s as they have done now. I mean, yes,

322
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:42,560
it's fine. They were popular then. But now everyone on earth has a computer in their

323
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:51,720
pocket. Was not the case in 1984. But I think putting that level of care and attention into

324
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:57,880
how to guide people through a conversation in such a way that they feel empowered the

325
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:01,840
whole time, they feel they're making progress the whole time, but still having them end

326
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:09,720
up where you, the developer, want them to be. That's a real skill. To take a real world

327
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:16,560
analogy to this, it's like those of us who've worked in a job will know the experience of

328
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:23,920
managing your manager. You want your manager to do something, but you can't command them

329
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:30,240
to do it because they're your boss and you aren't. How would you guide your manager into

330
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:36,040
ending up at the decision you would like them to make without ever being able to just command

331
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:43,880
it so? And that skill, which some people are unaware even exists, some people are not very

332
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:51,140
good at, and some people are spectacularly brilliant at. That skill is one of the skills

333
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:57,520
that the developers of a user interface need, and especially a textual user interface, whether

334
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:04,200
that's the Google search box or Amazon Echo. I'm carefully saying Amazon Echo, not the

335
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:09,640
name of it, because if I say the name of it, then my one will wake up. I don't want it

336
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,640
to.

337
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,640
We don't want that.

338
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,140
We do not.

339
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:23,200
It's the skill of very gently nudging users into their own perceived successful outcome,

340
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:28,120
even if you don't know what that outcome is going to be at the onset, which is no small

341
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,120
thing.

342
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:38,000
Imagine a butler in Victorian England or a lieutenant in the army. Are you a lieutenant

343
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
or a lieutenant?

344
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Canadian. Yes. You know, I've heard both. Some military folk is lieutenant, but I've

345
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:53,480
heard lieutenant repeatedly. So I think, you know, we can't decide whether we're British

346
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,480
or American.

347
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:58,600
I shall strike one tiny blow for the diminishing island of Albion and say lieutenant for now,

348
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:04,680
but feel free to correct it in your heads, Americans. So imagine the skill of a lieutenant

349
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:13,440
not being able to say, no, sir, that's a terrible idea. There's a way of saying, okay, sir,

350
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:19,200
which gives the impression you really shouldn't do this without actually saying so. And that

351
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:26,280
sort of vibe, that sort of skill, I think, is really important. So careful word choice,

352
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:30,720
understanding how to manage your manager, because in this environment, your Amazon Echo

353
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:39,640
or the Facebook chat bot that you're talking to, to order dinner or pay your taxes or whatever,

354
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:46,880
it's operating as essentially a butler, a personal assistant, something which is attempting

355
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:56,400
to guide you into, as you said, to the destination that you want to reach. And this feels to

356
00:32:56,400 --> 00:33:03,460
me like a skill that we, the open source community, ought to be all right at, because we've always

357
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:10,280
been believers in the power of text. We have, as a community, up until relatively recently

358
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:14,480
spent all our time sneering at the idea of people who thought the text was a bad thing.

359
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:23,080
So maybe this is something where we could, as a community, get out ahead of this. But

360
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:30,080
it does require us to let go of this idea that you've either got it right, or you need

361
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:35,960
to learn more. The bash command line, not a friendly user interface, exactly as you

362
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,960
said.

363
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,680
And yet the default in many areas.

364
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:45,160
Yeah, absolutely. And we've got people working on the graphical UI and so on. And I think

365
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:54,120
a lot of the, or at least a decent proportion of the accusations leveled at our desktops,

366
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:58,600
that you spend all your time opening a terminal, they are not the truth. They're being leveled

367
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:05,760
at us by people who've not actually sat down and used Ubuntu, for example, or elementary

368
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:15,240
or whatever it is you prefer. But I'd like to see us be better at things. And one of

369
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:20,320
the areas where I do think we ought to be able to steal a march on this is with something

370
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:29,200
like the Echo, or with chatbots, with textual interfaces, at least partially because we're

371
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:38,200
not attempting to overcome a massive entrenched victory on someone else's part. Making the

372
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:43,480
Linux desktop be popular, even if it was literally the best thing that ever existed, will be

373
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:51,440
hard because we're at 2% and the rest of the market is 98%. Whereas the Echo or Google

374
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:59,200
Home is essentially untouched ground. There's no one there with any entrenched advantage

375
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:03,160
other than Amazon and Google themselves, of course. And I'm not talking about building

376
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:08,880
an alternative to the Echo, I'm talking about building on the Echo as a platform. So this

377
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,760
is not what Mycroft are doing. Mycroft are working away at this and I have one on my

378
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:19,520
desk and well done to them. But the thing that they don't have, and Amazon do have,

379
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:26,260
is a billion customers already. But I see no reason why we can't use existing platforms

380
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:33,080
and then build software on top of them, a way that really exhibits the skills that we

381
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:43,240
as a community should have. I mean, think about it this way, right? A decent textual

382
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:48,640
interface needs to be good at two things, doing text and being the underdog and getting

383
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:53,040
stuff done anyway. And if there's anything more suited to the Linux community, I don't

384
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:57,440
know what it is. It seems absolutely ideal.

385
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:03,320
Well, perhaps what you're saying is we've been good at this and yet we've been holding

386
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:10,160
on to old ideals around these technologies. And so we've got to progress and move on and

387
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:16,240
use those skills and improve them to be more appropriate for modern times.

388
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:23,520
This is another one of my people don't necessarily agree with this thought. But I am of the opinion

389
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:31,760
that our community's worst enemy is itself. There is a reasonable proportion of the community

390
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:37,840
who are, first of all, louder than everybody else. But secondly, consider it more important

391
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:48,200
that their rivals in open source lose than the open source as a whole wins. There are

392
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:54,360
people out there who would rather see open source not become a success if that meant

393
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:58,920
that Ubuntu were the people who'd done it. They'd rather say, no, we'd rather open source

394
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:04,040
wasn't a success than have it be successful through a distribution or a piece of software

395
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:08,040
or a person who they personally don't like.

396
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:12,920
And I find it infuriating. I mean, we're not alone in this. Other people who feel like

397
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:22,720
this are, for example, phone manufacturers or phone carriers. If you are T-Mobile, apparently

398
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:29,840
doing something which means that you win and Vodafone wins and Sprint wins and AT&T wins

399
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:35,400
is not that important. You're OK with doing things where T-Mobile wins and everyone else

400
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,400
loses.

401
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:42,220
I'll give you another example. Think about storage formats. You know how Sony every five

402
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:46,440
minutes would bring out a brand new format which is incompatible with everything else?

403
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:50,400
And that's because businesses tend to have this thought where they go, we've invented

404
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:56,480
a new thing. We'd like it to be the massively dominant monopolistic thing in whatever field

405
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:02,160
it's in because then everyone on Earth buys one and we get $1 every time they do that.

406
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:07,160
And it normally takes about five years for the four or five different competitors in

407
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:12,760
that market to say, you know what, maybe we should start cooperating after all. And why

408
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:16,840
people don't learn the lesson from this and start cooperating on day one because they're

409
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:21,960
going to eventually anyway escapes me, but they don't.

410
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:29,320
So this is something which I think our community is guilty of as well. That for everyone who

411
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:34,120
says, OK, let's build a great new graphical interface that people said, oh, that's because

412
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:38,760
you hate the command line or why are you doing this in GTK? It's the worst. Or why are we

413
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:44,900
not building this in Rust? Or Gnome Shell uses JavaScript or KDE's got too many clocks

414
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:45,900
or whatever.

415
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:50,120
And it's just, I mean, I hate to sound trite about this, but if you can't find anything

416
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:54,440
nice to say, don't say anything. Sounds like something one's grandmother might say, but

417
00:38:54,440 --> 00:39:01,720
there's a certain amount of truth in it. Not necessarily because your objection isn't viable,

418
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:12,440
but because it degrades the viability of open source as a whole in the eyes of the mainstream.

419
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:20,040
It's a negative externality. So for every time that someone in open source attempts

420
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:26,080
to do something outreaching and they're clawed down by other people in open source, people

421
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:30,160
in the outside world don't look at this and go, great, there's a good Darwinian process

422
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:34,440
going on there and I'll definitely choose whichever one wins. They just go, what the

423
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:37,840
hell is this? Every time one of these open source things comes up, it just seems to be

424
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:41,840
an enormous bun fight. I just don't want to be involved in that. And then they go and

425
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:45,340
buy Windows 10.

426
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:48,380
Because I mean, yeah, Microsoft might have a bunch of problems, but what they don't do

427
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:57,720
is fight with themselves about which one of their computers you should buy. I think for

428
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:01,520
those people who've read Unseen Academicals by Terry Pratchett, this is a crab bucket

429
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:06,400
thing, where if you've got a bucket full of crabs and one crab tries to crawl out of the

430
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,160
bucket, the other crabs will all pull it down.

431
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,920
What a terrible situation, really.

432
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:17,280
I know. As far as I can tell, the success we have achieved, we have achieved despite

433
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:21,920
ourselves or at least despite some of our community. And it makes me sad because I mean,

434
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:26,920
I was about to say, I've dedicated my life to open source, which sounds way more like

435
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:30,440
I want to be a martyr than I actually am. And I haven't, because at least some of my

436
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:35,320
life is dedicated to getting paid, which comes back to a point you made earlier. But I've

437
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:42,120
certainly spent a lot of my life building, releasing, working with open source software.

438
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:48,120
I worked for Canonical for five years. I release software to this day. I constantly agitate

439
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:57,480
for the web to be and remain open. So I have a certain amount of skin in this game, right?

440
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:05,520
And I'd very much like to see us and our mindset become more successful. But I'd like to see

441
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:12,720
it become more successful along with the ideals behind it. I mean, if you look at the technology

442
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:20,720
world outside strictly open source things, most of it is open source. We won that battle.

443
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:24,680
If you go looking for programmers now, they're all doing JavaScript, right? JavaScript itself

444
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:32,960
is open source. NPM is the library of JavaScript libraries, the repository of JavaScript libraries,

445
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:39,200
and that's all open source. People routinely publish their source code on GitHub. We are

446
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:45,360
now in a world which was unimaginable 20 years ago, where most of the software you need to

447
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:52,200
use most of the time. You could see the source code if you wanted to. That's great. We won,

448
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:58,240
you know, but no one seems to be taking a victory lap about that because the last 10%

449
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,240
isn't done.

450
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:04,640
Are you saying that perhaps many of us and perhaps I should say those that are causing

451
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:11,200
us issues in our own community are fighting a battle that we've already won? So it's an

452
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:16,880
outdated mission or effort to try to win that over?

453
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:20,920
Some people are. Not that many, but there's still enough of them. The sort of people who

454
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:27,880
still put a dollar sign in the word Microsoft are fighting a battle that was over years

455
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:31,400
ago. I mean, I don't know whether we won or we lost. It's like asking who won the Cold

456
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:34,040
War, right?

457
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,040
Nobody did.

458
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:42,000
Exactly. Either nobody did or everybody did. Difficult question to answer, but the point

459
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:49,520
is it doesn't matter. Stop litigating the old battles. So yes, since I mentioned Microsoft,

460
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:56,040
let's take them as an example. They now own GitHub, who now own NPM as of about two days

461
00:42:56,040 --> 00:43:01,520
ago, so being topical. They also produce VS Code, which came from nowhere to be as far

462
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:06,840
as I can tell the most popular editor around. They're doing a lot of open source stuff more

463
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:11,960
generally as yours become quite dominant and a lot of the work they're doing there is open.

464
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:16,880
And there are certainly reasons to take a step back and say, maybe we shouldn't just

465
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:21,720
stick all our eggs in one basket, especially a basket with the Microsoft logo on it. But

466
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:28,100
I think that's different from just flat up mistrusting them the whole time without any

467
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:33,760
way of them proving things to be different. If you find someone who says Microsoft shouldn't

468
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:37,120
have all this stuff because they're Microsoft and they embrace extended extinguished and

469
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:42,840
they think Linux is a cancer, you say, well, okay, they did 18 years ago. I get that, right?

470
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:48,760
What could they do today to prove they're no longer like that? And if the answer is

471
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:53,920
nothing, then you're not making a rational argument. If the answer is something, then

472
00:43:53,920 --> 00:44:00,160
I mean, for me, it took a while to change this and I still don't fully trust their company

473
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:04,320
and say, well, I don't fully trust Apple or I don't fully trust Google. You said yourself,

474
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:09,640
you don't use Google very much because you've presumably taken a stand on this front. And

475
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:15,760
that's cool. But there are still products they do that I find useful. There are moves

476
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:22,200
they make that I'm prepared to treat with an open mind. And if there is a list of things

477
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:29,440
that would convince that what Microsoft are doing is becoming a better company, I'm sure

478
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:33,320
that some of the things on that list have already been ticked off.

479
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:34,320
Yeah.

480
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,400
Well, at least one would hope so.

481
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:43,480
I agree completely. And what more could they do? You know, I think they have been fairly

482
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:50,340
good stewards of open source in the last few years. And I don't know if you could come

483
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:54,000
up with a reasonable list and I'd love to hear it if there is one, but a reasonable

484
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,360
list of what they could do better if you kind of look at it from an objective perspective.

485
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:02,600
Yeah. I mean, I think the key word there is reasonable because there'll be some people

486
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:05,200
who go, okay, thing number one on the list, open source windows.

487
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,200
But what would that give? That's the question.

488
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:13,080
Yeah. I mean, it helped wind people quite a lot, I imagine. And there certainly are

489
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:18,540
a whole bunch of things that the company as a whole do, which I don't particularly like

490
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:25,580
to this day. And Microsoft is a very big church, right? And certainly some parts of the business

491
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:34,920
have moved in our direction quite a lot more than others. Try and get open source stuff

492
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:38,120
working on the Xbox, for example.

493
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:39,120
Okay.

494
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:45,920
You know, when Windows Phone was around, attempting to get anybody to even tell you how to send

495
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:50,920
things to it by USB was close to impossible. But at least there are some parts of the business

496
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:55,960
who are doing that. And what I want to see is culture change. But I think there is some

497
00:45:55,960 --> 00:46:04,280
value in our community deciding what it is they want to stand for. Because if what you

498
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:08,840
want to stand for is that you won't work with anything unless it's all completely open source

499
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:14,440
and you don't like the phone you've got because it has a non-free firmware to run the baseband

500
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:19,920
control or whatever, then okay, you're making a stand for that and that's great. But it's

501
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:25,920
fundamentally incompatible with being mainstream. And if you're okay with that, then I'm fine

502
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:31,960
with that too. But if someone is interested in getting into the mainstream, stop throwing

503
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:36,460
stones at them because they're pursuing a different goal.

504
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:37,460
And both are honorable.

505
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:44,440
Yeah, absolutely. There's no problem with doing either of them. But it feels like, I

506
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:48,600
don't know, what does it feel like? It's like seeing that the people next door are cooking

507
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:54,960
a curry and then shouting at them because they're not cooking Chinese food or fish and

508
00:46:54,960 --> 00:47:00,240
chips. And you say, well, there's not one that's any better than any other. I just happen

509
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:04,560
to fancy that this evening. That's what I wanted. The fact that you happen to prefer

510
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:14,560
this other food. I mean, that almost captures the absurdity of it to my mind that there's

511
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:19,760
criticism because they're failing to meet up to goals that the person doing it doesn't

512
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,760
have in the first place.

513
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:30,640
Well, it's taking someone else's project, ignoring perhaps their intentions for that

514
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:39,320
project and then throwing it into your own system with your own objectives and seeing

515
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:44,360
how it doesn't align. But that's completely unfair because it was never designed to align

516
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:47,960
with your objectives. It was designed to align with theirs.

517
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:50,880
Yeah, absolutely correct. I completely agree with that.

518
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:57,840
So Stuart, I would say typically I spend the first part of this conversation getting to

519
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:05,160
know you a little bit, but we took a single topic and extrapolated it in about 20 different

520
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:12,800
fascinating angles. And so thank you for that. To give some transparency in my process a

521
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:17,440
little bit, I usually have this little page in front of me. I talked with Chris on his

522
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:21,800
podcast, The Chris Last Cast, a bit about my process. But I just have a page here that

523
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:26,680
I write some notes on for us to maybe dive into during the conversation. And I've crossed

524
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:35,640
off exactly one out of a list of maybe 20. But I loved all of those directions that we

525
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:42,000
went in. I think I'm going to need to definitely have you on a few other times to check off

526
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,400
some more items on this list.

527
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,040
I'm fine with that.

528
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:54,000
Lovely. I will put a question to you and maybe it will hit on some points that we discussed

529
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:59,080
earlier. Maybe it'll even be a manifesto of sorts. But is there something that you want

530
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:03,280
to put out to the community? Something you want them to think about? Something you want

531
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:06,400
them to try or go see or put their energy into?

532
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:10,080
I have been thinking about this a bit.

533
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,080
Perhaps you have a list.

534
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:18,800
Well, I kind of do have a list. But I think to be honest with you, the importance of any

535
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:22,680
list I might have is probably obviated at the moment by the fact that the world is in

536
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:29,080
a massive crisis. And one of the things I've seen, I've been looking into recently and

537
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:35,100
hearing people talk about is the number of people who are going to end up disenfranchised

538
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:42,000
and suffering by the fact that we have a world in lockdown through essentially no fault of

539
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,640
their own. I mean, and I have to put up my hand declare a certain amount of self-interest

540
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:51,960
here. I work for myself, right? We are currently in a position where because everything's very

541
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:56,000
uncertain and everyone's very worried and no one really knows what's going on. There

542
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,760
aren't that many people who are saying, you know what we should do? Start this new project

543
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:04,560
that Man Language was pitching for. But there are an awful lot of people in my position

544
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:10,360
who are going to increasingly find it difficult to find work and so on. I mean, I have the

545
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:15,640
advantage that I do a few different things. So I consultant CTO kind of thing, but I also

546
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:22,660
do development work and I also write for a living. So I'm shading myself more towards

547
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:28,400
the writing end of things for the moment, because that's easier to convince people that

548
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:33,520
you want me to write about this thing for you. Here it is. But there are a lot of people

549
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:40,800
both in our community and out there in the world who run a restaurant or who run a pub

550
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:47,180
or who run a flower shop who are going to struggle an awful lot. I don't think anyone

551
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:53,320
knows how long this whole coronavirus crisis is going to go on, but the bite is really

552
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:57,000
going to start to set in. We're currently about, well, it depends on where you are in

553
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:02,280
the world, but here in the UK, things went from, oh, blimey, I wonder if the coronavirus

554
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:06,240
is going to be a problem to, oh my goodness, no one leaves the house in the space of about

555
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:12,560
three days and that was last weekend. So we're currently about four days into this and it

556
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:21,560
might last months. So basically what I'd like to ask people to do is kind of be kind. We

557
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:28,920
as a community, we have a reasonably high proportion of people who work on their own

558
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:34,680
or live on their own, whose primary contact with people is maybe over the internet. We

559
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:42,720
have a reasonably high proportion of people who are introverted, who maybe feel more anxious

560
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:50,000
than others. And it would be lovely to see the depths of love that I've experienced within

561
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:57,080
our community actually coming out in this fashion. Because for all that I complained

562
00:51:57,080 --> 00:52:07,040
about loud vocal complainy elements of our community earlier, most of it's lovely. I

563
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:13,720
wouldn't have spent 20, 25 years doing this stuff if it wasn't for the warm embrace of

564
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:18,920
the community. And one of the things that we are good at, in theory at least, is pulling

565
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:26,920
together when there are problems, having people's back. And I'd like to see people thinking

566
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:34,440
of ways to make that happen. So small example, did you see the thing about the 3D printed

567
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:35,680
respirator valves in Italy?

568
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:38,960
No, but tell me more. I'm very curious.

569
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:44,920
So they are having difficulty getting enough respirators. I don't understand the medical

570
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:48,980
details here. So if I'm explaining this slightly wrong, cut me some slack, medical engineers.

571
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:55,120
But they need more respirators for people in hospital and they didn't have enough. And

572
00:52:55,120 --> 00:53:00,720
one of the things that we're short on is a particular kind of a valve. So a couple of

573
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:05,520
people from, as far as I can tell, it's the local maker space, took a 3D printer into

574
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:10,640
a hospital and then measured one of the valves they already had and then 3D printed a replica

575
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:15,720
and went, here you go, try it out. And it worked. And so now the hospital's got loads

576
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:21,280
of valves. Now, there are a bunch of legal issues around this and apparently the people

577
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:26,380
who make the valves are suing them for it, which we're not going to get into. And obviously

578
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:33,600
this is a temporary stop gap. And the people who make the real things, you know, are probably

579
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:38,280
making them to high tolerances and they'll last 10 years rather than a 3D printed one,

580
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:47,480
which will last a week. But equally, probably a good idea to have a shedload of respirator

581
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:51,640
valves more than you need, even if they do only last a week because we can 3D print more.

582
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:59,240
And that kind of thing, I think, is something we're just cutting through the red tape and

583
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:05,280
being direct, a direct person to person connection. We're good at interoperating with people over

584
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:12,400
the internet. We're good at seeing places for technology to help humanity. And we talk

585
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:17,360
a big game about how that's what open source is good at and it's what proprietary companies

586
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:21,520
are not good at because all they want is money. So this, I think, is our chance to put it

587
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:28,080
into practice. So look at how your software can help people or how you might build software

588
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:32,400
that could help people. Check out the members of our community who might need your help,

589
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:38,280
who might not want to reach out, but would really appreciate just a note saying, hey,

590
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:41,920
everything okay? You know, I haven't heard from you for a couple of days. Just want to

591
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:48,800
make sure you stay connected. This is a chance, I think, to demonstrate that we're decent

592
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:59,280
people, that the underlying ethos of our community about supporting everyone, about making sure

593
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:06,480
that everyone is included. This is our chance to do it for real. And frankly, the world

594
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:12,080
needs it. So much as I'd like to say, well, here's this bit of software I've written,

595
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:19,360
you should all go and download it. I think there are more important things on everyone's

596
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:24,080
minds and now is maybe the time to put those into practice.

597
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:30,720
I think you're right. It's our time to shine. So I will put something out there. If anyone

598
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:36,600
wants to reach out to me and say hi at any point, please do. You can find me either in

599
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:41,120
the Jupiter Broadcasting Telegram group, which I'll link to. You can find me on Twitter,

600
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:45,000
which I'll also link to. And just say hi if you want to have a five-minute conversation

601
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:49,600
or something like that. That's my little gift out there in the world. Stuart, do you have

602
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:54,800
a place where people can reach you or a place where people can find a community around bad

603
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:55,800
voltage or otherwise?

604
00:55:55,800 --> 00:56:01,680
Certainly. First of all, I will say exactly the same thing that Brent did. If you just

605
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:06,160
want to chat to me, check in, that's fine. Just give me a shout, no problem. Places you

606
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:11,760
can find me, badvoltage is at badvoltage.org and you can get the podcast there. Cool. Download

607
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:17,640
it, listen to it, you'll like it. Me personally, probably the best couple of places to get

608
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:24,440
hold of me are either on Twitter where I'm at, S-I-L, SugarIndigoLima. It's the advantage

609
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:28,440
of Twitter. I think popped up, I think today or yesterday, saying it was my 13th anniversary

610
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:30,320
on Twitter, which is rather disturbing.

611
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:31,320
Congratulations.

612
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:36,280
And then the other way of getting hold of me, or all the other ways of getting hold

613
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:43,800
of me are via my website, which is Cryogenics.org, K-R-Y-O-G-E-N-I-X.org. There are about a million

614
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:49,760
different content details there. I write things there. You can get talks that I've done and

615
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:54,560
things that I've written and work that I've done and people I've worked with and things

616
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:59,000
like that are all there. But yeah, if you want to get hold of me quickly, Twitter is

617
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:05,000
the way. If you want to get hold of me more detailed, then my email address is on my website.

618
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:11,000
I love email, send me email. I hang out in a few Telegram channels, but Twitter is probably

619
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,000
a better way.

620
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,800
Great. Well, Stuart, thank you so much for your time. And as promised, I think you and

621
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:21,360
I are going to have to do this again to fill out some extra details. So I'm looking forward

622
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:22,360
to that.

623
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:29,200
I am more than happy to come back on and use another hour and knock another one thing off

624
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:33,560
your list. I apologize for that.

625
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:47,120
That's great. Looking forward to it.
