1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,120
Hey, Wes, hello, I thought you know what that's the most ridiculous thing I'd ever heard.

2
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,960
I mean I was bouncing in my seat.

3
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,340
It's got a great name name too.

4
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:17,680
It's called the eff up theme.

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,680
You know, the eff up theme.

6
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:19,680
Let's see.

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,680
It describes what we're doing here.

8
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:21,680
Yeah.

9
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,360
So we thought, let's get meta for a little bit.

10
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:26,300
And I would do a little Wes and Chris reacts.

11
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,740
This is something the YouTubers do.

12
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:29,280
Now we're bringing it to the podcast medium.

13
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,480
Well, what are we reacting to ourselves?

14
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,480
This is that's the thing, you know, like old clips of yourself and stuff.

15
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,480
But I hate me.

16
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,480
Oh, my God.

17
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,480
Oh, my God.

18
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,600
You should hear old me.

19
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,680
It's so bad.

20
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,360
So bad.

21
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,600
So I thought I thought we kick it off with like a really bad one of me.

22
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,320
So we go back in time to episode 100 of Linux Unplugged.

23
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,440
Far back.

24
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,440
Your first episode.

25
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,360
What is this like 2015?

26
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:58,480
Episode 100 right on the number like you just that's a pretty I mean, of course, it was

27
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,240
because of a special event that you were there.

28
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,240
That's pretty cool.

29
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,240
Anyways.

30
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,760
But this is me.

31
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,760
This is me back then doing the introduction.

32
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,600
You know, for episode 100, I wanted to do a meetup, but we have so much going on.

33
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,680
We've just done a bunch of meetups and we have a couple of coming up kind of didn't

34
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,040
really fit in the schedule.

35
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,560
So why not just have people over to the studio and do a little cookout?

36
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,480
We had six people RSVP and we had a pool going.

37
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,480
I said three would show up.

38
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,020
I nailed it.

39
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:25,020
That wasn't sped up.

40
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,160
That was going to be my question.

41
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,720
No, it wasn't.

42
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,960
You can tell because it's it's like a little brighter.

43
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:36,560
You've got a you've got this weird eagerness sort of going forward.

44
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,520
I was young, foolish.

45
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,840
We were having like a big day.

46
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,840
That was episode 100.

47
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:49,640
Yeah, we were doing the old barbecue for what started as like a just sort of a spinoff from

48
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,640
last.

49
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,640
Yeah.

50
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,640
Yeah.

51
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,900
In episode 99, which would only have been one week before I said anybody in the Pacific

52
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:03,480
Northwest that wants to come up and do a barbecue for episode 100, come on up.

53
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:08,900
And in the back of my mind, I was thinking this would be a great way to find a new co-host

54
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:09,900
for the show.

55
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,560
Like, wouldn't that just work out great?

56
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:16,360
And I thought, yeah, no, no, that's probably crazy.

57
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,360
So we eat.

58
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,440
Do you remember what you brought something good?

59
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,720
Can't remember now.

60
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,720
I don't know what I brought.

61
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,720
I know.

62
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,240
I mean, I know I brought beer.

63
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,240
Yeah.

64
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:29,800
You might have bought, you may have been beer brats too.

65
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,160
That would be my style.

66
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,160
Yeah.

67
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,160
Something that stuck out.

68
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:38,520
And so then after we ate, we all came into the studio and we did a show and it was pretty

69
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:45,800
clear like right there with no prep, you were sort of like a natch co-host, check out, like

70
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,240
we're just sitting here shucking and jiving and you jump right in.

71
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,520
I think that's one of the best things about Unplugged is you can connect developers with

72
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,160
the people who are actually using them.

73
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,160
Yeah.

74
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,160
They come into the room.

75
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,160
Yeah.

76
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,160
Right there.

77
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,160
Look at me go.

78
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,160
Right on point.

79
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,160
Your first time on air.

80
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,480
Like we had almost planned like that kind of thing.

81
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,880
Had you done a podcast before?

82
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,880
I had not.

83
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,880
Really?

84
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,880
No.

85
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,160
Well, you were quick on your feet.

86
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,160
Man.

87
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,160
So, okay.

88
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:17,440
So that was for episode 100 and we just finished recording.

89
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,440
314.

90
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,440
Yeah.

91
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,440
314.

92
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,440
Wow.

93
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,440
Yeah.

94
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,440
I did some digging around.

95
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:29,000
There's like a big change from like from about 100 to 200.

96
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,800
I mean, I much prefer the way it sounds now.

97
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,840
We've changed quite a bit there.

98
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,160
It's come a long way.

99
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,400
So why don't we go back in time?

100
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,880
So that was a couple of clips I pulled.

101
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:42,660
You pulled a couple of clips and I don't know exactly what this one's about.

102
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,720
It just says Gnome crashes and we are back.

103
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,100
So Gnome just crashed on us.

104
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,100
That's kind of ironic.

105
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,100
I'm not joking.

106
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,520
Summary of the show, folks.

107
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,360
This is a bit of an awkward thing for me right now.

108
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,580
This is my love song to Gnome because I think it's such a great desktop and I think it has

109
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:00,400
such a strong future and yet I think I'm switching away.

110
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,400
And I'm going to be talking about that more.

111
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,020
But I just I want to continue being positive about Gnome, but I do have to acknowledge

112
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:09,720
that we just had to stop broadcast and we had to stop and re-edit here and all of that

113
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,240
because Gnome crashed on us again.

114
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,240
Oh, man.

115
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:16,760
I know that what I'm really struggling with is I am very upset, but I also am trying to

116
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,720
be more positive because I know people work really hard on this.

117
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,060
And the rest of the show, you're like, oh, man, it's getting there.

118
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,200
It's really come a long way.

119
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,200
Yeah.

120
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:29,760
And I'm trying to be positive because my new outlook on this kind of thing is it just doesn't

121
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,240
work for me, but it could be great for other people.

122
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,240
That's my outlook now.

123
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,240
It's a very accepting view.

124
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,480
And so here I am in the middle of a crash during a live show.

125
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:41,840
And what used to happen back then, and it's the most awkward thing for me, it's the thing

126
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:47,960
I hate the most, is when Gnome Shell would go, it would take out Pulse Audio, which would

127
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,880
leave dead air on the stream.

128
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,880
Just nothing.

129
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,200
Even for like 30 to 40 seconds, it's just dead air.

130
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:58,440
Or sometimes we'd switch to Barry White mode where it would shift us and we'd be in the

131
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,660
wrong phase.

132
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:04,420
And for me as a broadcaster doing a live event, like...

133
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,040
That's the whole thing you're focusing on.

134
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:10,280
It's just like the Achilles heel of a crash.

135
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,640
And nothing you did, right?

136
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,400
You set it all up perfectly.

137
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,400
It was rough.

138
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,720
And I was trying in this moment to stay very positive.

139
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,000
So we are going down a path, but...

140
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,240
And this is a system, by the way.

141
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,040
The one that crashes the most is the system with almost no extensions.

142
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,040
Just for the record.

143
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:32,400
The only extension it has is Dash to Dock and the ping extension.

144
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,400
Yikes.

145
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,880
There you have it.

146
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,880
Yeah.

147
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,880
Yeah.

148
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,880
It's good times.

149
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,880
It's good times.

150
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,680
Do any other machines suffer from this in the studio?

151
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,280
We have three Gnome desktops that crash every day.

152
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:52,120
They're all similar hardware, NVIDIA, Arch, Core i7, like a generation ago.

153
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,120
Yeah.

154
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,120
It's happening quite a bit.

155
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,120
That's kind of...

156
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,120
Wow.

157
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,120
I had forgotten how bad it got.

158
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,120
Oh, it was pretty bad towards the end.

159
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,760
Now, we have some issues right now.

160
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,440
So I thought it would just be interesting to sort of reflect on where we've been and

161
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,440
where we're going.

162
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,960
Boy, I'd say the issues we have now pale in comparison to that.

163
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,260
It's so much more stable.

164
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:15,640
And so these systems have been installed for a year and a half.

165
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:22,560
And the main issue we're really having probably results from switching from Plasma.

166
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,560
We jumped on the recording computer from Plasma to XFCE because we were having video artifact

167
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:32,160
issues that we thought might have just been a combination of NVIDIA Driver and Kaywin

168
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,680
or something.

169
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:39,320
However, weird video artifact issues have continued even on...

170
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,320
They remain.

171
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,320
Yeah.

172
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:44,400
So we think it's just time to do a reload and re-swap a video card out and just do a

173
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,120
general work.

174
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:52,000
But this system, actually, like the OBS machine, which was the one that was crashing, which

175
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
is not...

176
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,400
We're not really having problems with it as long as we restart about once a week.

177
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,840
Once we started using Jack, we had to restart once a week.

178
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,840
But that's acceptable.

179
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,240
We do some security updates.

180
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,240
We reboot.

181
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,280
Otherwise, you're right.

182
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,280
It just works.

183
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,120
You kind of set it, forget it, which is exactly how I want it.

184
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,240
That's acceptable to me.

185
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,240
You're right, though.

186
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,640
I had forgot about that.

187
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,020
Do you remember...

188
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:20,320
We've had a conversation in a couple of forums over the years, but do you remember the conversation

189
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,480
around submitting bugs when you're doing testing and all of that?

190
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,480
That's something we've talked about, like when we're reviewing a distro.

191
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,240
I mean, we all love to complain, right?

192
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:31,600
But we don't all often submit bugs about things we're complaining about.

193
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,120
Going back to Poby's argument about filing a bug, this is not one, I think...

194
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,980
And I don't know, maybe it's my bias.

195
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,300
I've been around for a while.

196
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:43,680
This is not one I think is worth my time, because it's...

197
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,680
Yeah.

198
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:48,240
That's what I heard for six months from the people complaining about wireless on 1604.

199
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,560
I disagree with that.

200
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:54,480
I didn't actually have that problem, but that would have been one that would have been.

201
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,320
But that's exactly the problem.

202
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,320
Not everyone had this problem.

203
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:02,960
There were people very close to you ranting about how wireless on 1604 was completely

204
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,120
busted and everyone should avoid it on 2604.

205
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,800
It turns out, no, it's not busted for everyone.

206
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,000
It's not busted for anyone in Canonical.

207
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,320
It's only busted for certain select people with certain chipsets in certain environments.

208
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,320
That's crazy.

209
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:17,480
Those f**kers wouldn't tell us what the details of that system was.

210
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,720
If you don't tell us, we can't f**king fix it.

211
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,040
I think this is a real problem.

212
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:25,160
I think the core problem that that issue...

213
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,800
The thing is, is I'm not going to spend my time.

214
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,800
I'm not going to spend...

215
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,800
I'm not going to...

216
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,560
Like I said, if I'm working 65 hours this week, I'm not going to work 67 hours so that

217
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:37,200
way I can report a bug and then watch them tell me it's an Nvidia problem.

218
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:44,800
I think the thing that I would articulate or attempt to articulate now that I wasn't

219
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,000
because I was so surprised by how fired up Popey got that I wasn't really articulating

220
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,680
very well is the core...

221
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:57,520
I was trying to play the part of this is how people feel.

222
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,520
We're not...

223
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:03,160
I, Chris, am not going to file a bug, but people who are working 65 hours a week aren't

224
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:08,520
going to work an extra two hours for Canonical, who maybe they barely even like to begin with,

225
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:12,560
to help out with something like this that should be caught in basic Q&A.

226
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:18,240
I wasn't trying to say I don't ever want to submit bugs, but I was just trying to...

227
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,080
I guess I was trying to have a conversation around, how do you solve that problem?

228
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,080
Because...

229
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,680
You're not arguing for that position.

230
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,680
It just...

231
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,680
It's a human problem.

232
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,680
It's how people feel.

233
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,680
Yeah, exactly.

234
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,280
I don't think I did a very good job there listening back to that.

235
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,000
And I don't know that too much has changed, right?

236
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,480
I mean, maybe it's a little easier.

237
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:42,400
GitHub is popular, PRs are okay, but it's still a lot of hoops.

238
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,680
I think we as a team are...

239
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:51,880
We participate more in funding open source projects, bug tracking, issues that...

240
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:57,140
Or we'll follow issues on GitHubs for projects that we are using actively in production.

241
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:03,900
So we have improved our skills there, mostly because we now have a team that has a culture

242
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:04,900
of doing it.

243
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:12,040
But I think if you don't have that, and you don't have a strong motivator to improve Canonical's

244
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:15,040
product, you're not likely to do it.

245
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,040
You're right.

246
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,040
I don't think it's changed.

247
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,040
Well, it's a culture issue.

248
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,040
You're right.

249
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,320
I mean, that's exactly it.

250
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,720
I think the only way you could change it would be, I don't know, a lot of evangelism and

251
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,800
tooling to make it as easy as possible.

252
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,040
So, you're right.

253
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:33,160
We are on the precipice tomorrow, we're reloading the studio machines.

254
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:41,480
But one machine stands alone now in the studio, and that's Westpain's ThinkPad.

255
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,480
So let's...

256
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,480
One more Plasma thing.

257
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,400
And I wanted to pick up from where we left off last week with you.

258
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:50,360
So during the show last week, you switched over to the Plasma desktop for a little bit.

259
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,360
Oh, that's right.

260
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:57,680
I also got the state of Plasma that was posted at Netrunner-Mag.com, which we'll have linked

261
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,260
in the show notes.

262
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:06,120
So I kind of wanted to go over your experience, cover his experience, because I've been so

263
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:13,320
impressed with the Plasma desktop, specifically 5.9, that I've had a hard time articulating

264
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,800
what's wrong with it.

265
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,240
People said, so what's not working still?

266
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,080
And I'm having a hard time articulating it because I'm not like in review mode, I'm just

267
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,600
like in use mode, I'm just like geek out mode.

268
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,400
And so I haven't really had to turn on that part of my brain until I started really getting

269
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,760
this question more and more.

270
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:32,520
And so now I've slipped into more review mode of the Plasma desktop, and so I've got some

271
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,620
observations of things that I think should be improved.

272
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,280
But they're still not major things.

273
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,560
And so I'm curious to hear what your experience has been so far.

274
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,880
I've been pretty impressed.

275
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:48,520
I think it's been a year or two since I really had like Plasma KD anything as my main desktop.

276
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:53,000
Some things I like, like I already use Quossel and other cute applications, so it was nice

277
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,160
to kind of have that be my native environment.

278
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:01,160
But I have been approaching it very much like what you said, just install and the defaults

279
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,160
work.

280
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,160
I was kind of interested in exploring with that, because that's really what I do a lot

281
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,800
of the time with GNOME, at least on like this laptop, which we refresh for the show a lot,

282
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,740
that kind of thing.

283
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:14,000
So I really just kind of installed KD or Plasma, started working with it.

284
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,720
It took me a while to get used to some of the trivial things, just like the mouse cursor

285
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,140
is a little bit different, plus some of the applications I use, like I have a lot of like

286
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:27,120
Telegram or Slack, they didn't integrate quite as nicely or look quite as nice with just

287
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,200
the default theme as I found that they did with GNOME.

288
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,100
But I have not customized that much.

289
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,800
So I'm kind of interested to hear.

290
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:38,760
So another part that I like, I've been using Unity at work, mostly just because I got my

291
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,600
desktop refreshed there.

292
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:44,080
Not taking the time to customize that either, because, you know, get work done.

293
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,680
But I have been thinking about either installing GNOME or Plasma.

294
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,320
So now Plasma is on the list.

295
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:53,340
But like one of the things I think Unity does well is imitate a tiling desktop or give me

296
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,340
some of those features.

297
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:59,160
A lot of times really what I want, and Cinnamon does this well, is just like quadrants, even

298
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,440
just splitting half their screens, but especially quadrants.

299
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,720
So now you're still on Plasma.

300
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,360
That was back in 2017.

301
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,360
Oh, boy.

302
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,920
Could you pull up like something there to tell you what version of Plasma you're on?

303
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,240
There's probably something in the system preferences.

304
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,240
So you're still on it.

305
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,240
You really stuck with it.

306
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,900
KDE Neon 5.16 at the moment.

307
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,220
Does that happen to say which version of Plasma desktop?

308
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,960
Because you were in that clip, it was 5.9.

309
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,440
Yeah, that's the same.

310
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,560
KDE Plasma version 5.16.4.

311
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,560
Hmm.

312
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,560
So 2017.

313
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,560
Wow.

314
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:35,340
That's like, you're like, that's the longest running, nobody else has been stuck to one

315
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,340
desktop that long.

316
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,840
Well, so it wasn't that long.

317
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,760
There was a long known period in between, I have to admit.

318
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,800
So that's what's funny about this, because this was kind of the, I said it had been like

319
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:50,720
one or two years, but that was just like trying a desktop that came with KDE as part of an

320
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,760
other OS review.

321
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:56,920
That is kind of the first time I did like a real, I'm going to use Plasma for a while,

322
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,540
at least the modern version of Plasma.

323
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:04,240
But it still feels just shallow in comparison to what I've been doing now.

324
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:11,200
So I feel like change is in the wind, you guys, you're just selling me on Fedora on

325
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,940
this ThinkPad.

326
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:16,680
And you're right, like I have an ancient kernel, we've been playing with Jack, like I'm not

327
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:20,800
too worried about compatibility issues.

328
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:26,300
So I'm loving Plasma, I still don't know that I take full advantage of the configurability.

329
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:30,320
And honestly, part of the reason it's lasted so well, and like, I don't have the same complaints

330
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,560
is because you tuned this for me when it got set up.

331
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:37,360
So it's not really the defaults.

332
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,880
Have you ever experimented with the tiling or the quadrant stuff?

333
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,120
Yeah, a little bit.

334
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,600
Kwin's great.

335
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:48,560
I could probably be doing a better job of taking advantage of it.

336
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,560
Yeah, Kwin is really great.

337
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,760
I mean, you do have wobbly windows.

338
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,040
I have wobbly windows and exploding windows are still in effect.

339
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,040
Yeah.

340
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,640
I mean, you just do this and you go, yeah, no, I totally understand.

341
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:06,440
I'm just looking over here at my Xfce desktop going, is it worth trying to retrofit this

342
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,440
thing with Compass?

343
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,440
No, no, leave it alone.

344
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,440
Leave it alone.

345
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,440
We don't need Compass.

346
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,920
I mean, unless Compass fixes our weird glitches, then okay.

347
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,920
No, you're right.

348
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:15,920
We don't.

349
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,440
It's just, wouldn't it be cool if the windows exploded?

350
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,880
It would be cool.

351
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,040
So one extra clip.

352
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:25,700
This isn't Linux Unplugged, but Wes and I, back in the day, did TextMap together.

353
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:30,400
And this is funny because it's a story arc that we did complete on Linux Unplugged later

354
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,400
on.

355
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:35,600
And we ended up replacing this install.

356
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:41,480
But we did it initially on the TextNet program and then finished the job by replacing it

357
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,760
with Fedora later on.

358
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,920
On Linux Unplugged, amazing.

359
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,240
After a few years of basically working seven days a week, the Jupyter Broadcasting Studio

360
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,480
has accumulated a bit of technical debt here and there.

361
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,760
And we've been kind of going through and cleaning it up, trying to address it.

362
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,280
But there's one that we've been putting off because it's just worked.

363
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,800
If it ain't broke, don't fix it.

364
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,800
It's always the same.

365
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,720
And this thing is essentially not broke.

366
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:07,080
But the reality is we have a very old FreeNAS mini.

367
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:10,000
When IX first started selling the product, I bought one.

368
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,440
And it's even running, or it was running, a beta version of FreeNAS.

369
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,720
And we just went to the races and never really went back and addressed it.

370
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,320
It's been in production all these years.

371
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,320
Yeah.

372
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:25,600
And really, it's one of those things that once it's in production, you have a hard time

373
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:31,240
stopping everything and taking this thing offline and interrupting everybody's workflow

374
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,240
and upgrading.

375
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,240
Right.

376
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,920
It's pretty essential to the day-to-day operations of, you can't put shows out.

377
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:37,920
We can't do anything.

378
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,920
No.

379
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:39,920
So it's kind of a key thing.

380
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:45,160
And the other issue is that it's growing so rapidly that we're having a hard time backing

381
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:48,160
it up because you can't really back it up online because we need the connection for

382
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,160
other things.

383
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,520
And it would just dominate our connection constantly.

384
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:55,240
And I haven't gotten, Dan almost convinced me, but I haven't yet gotten like a tape system,

385
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,960
which is kind of where I'm actually going with it.

386
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,960
Okay.

387
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,720
Before we get to the backup thing, I said something in that clip that I wanted to follow

388
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,280
up with you now that we have our new system, which is based on Fedora.

389
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:07,040
Everything's in containers, ZFS for the storage.

390
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:10,320
The one thing I said in there is you really don't want to have to take this thing down

391
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,360
for a long period of time and interrupt everybody's workflow.

392
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:18,120
And now the team more than ever is going to rely on services on these things, especially

393
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,120
the ones...

394
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,120
Ain't that true?

395
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:23,600
Do you feel like we solved that problem?

396
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:28,120
Maybe not completely, but I think we're a lot closer, if only because we understand

397
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,400
the system a lot better.

398
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:35,340
One thing that we definitely are doing differently is we won't be taking the Nextcloud system

399
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:40,080
down to upgrade the storage ever in its current configuration.

400
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,040
So in the past, we'd have limited sets of disks.

401
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,040
Yeah.

402
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,520
We have a lot more expandability.

403
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,080
We'd have to swap in a drive like animal.

404
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,600
We wanted new storage.

405
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:54,560
But this time around with our Team Nextcloud instance, we decided to use DigitalOcean Spaces

406
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,460
as the backend.

407
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,160
So in theory, it'll just grow...

408
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,120
Well, in theory, it grew 50 gigs in usage yesterday.

409
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,120
I guess I'll go check.

410
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,120
That would be interesting.

411
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,240
Now, it hasn't been super...

412
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:09,520
It's not completely smooth, I'll admit, but that's a huge advantage.

413
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,520
Yeah.

414
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:15,080
I mean, yeah, I guess it hasn't been super smooth, but it seems like the goal...

415
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,080
Actually, no.

416
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,080
I'm wrong.

417
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,080
It's been very smooth.

418
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,080
It's been a few...

419
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,080
Small things.

420
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,080
Yeah.

421
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:26,400
And the goal, theoretically, not having to swap in new disks every time we have like

422
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,920
a new project that we take on, boy, that could be a game changer.

423
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,600
You just don't have to care what anyone else does.

424
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:36,600
And then because the applications are all in containers, it does really reduce the downtime

425
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:41,320
of the application services because we're upgrading the OS, but the containers remain

426
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,320
up.

427
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,120
And when we upgrade the containers, we generally...

428
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,160
It's just a quick take them down.

429
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,600
Pull and stop and start the new one.

430
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,600
Yeah.

431
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,600
Should we continue?

432
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,600
Yes.

433
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:56,120
We need the connection for other things and it would just dominate our connection constantly.

434
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,120
And I haven't gotten...

435
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,400
Dan almost convinced me, but I haven't yet gotten like a tape system, which is kind of

436
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,400
where I'm actually going with this.

437
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,400
Oh, yeah.

438
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,400
But I haven't gotten there yet.

439
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:07,200
If I could find a good deal on eBay, I might get a tape system for it though.

440
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,400
But I haven't yet.

441
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:13,640
And so it's in production, we're using it seven days a week, and I don't have the best

442
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,640
backup.

443
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,360
It's not paid, but I'm working on that.

444
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,560
So it's time for some tender loving care.

445
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:24,640
We decided we needed to get this thing upgraded because the next step we have to do is address

446
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:29,440
our storage, get our pool back in the right shape, and get backups working.

447
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,440
We're going through the dependency tree to get this thing to a state where it needs to

448
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:36,320
be a reliable piece of enterprise equipment again, and digging it out of its hole.

449
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:41,000
And step one is getting it off of a beta release of FreeNAS, so that way we could get it on

450
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,360
a supported version of FreeNAS that was getting maintenance, that had full features, and then

451
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:49,000
we use that to readdress the storage.

452
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,240
But in the meantime, we got to get there and we thought, well, how would the audience do

453
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,240
it?

454
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,240
Would they make a leap?

455
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,640
Would they try to upgrade in between?

456
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,640
What would you do?

457
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:59,400
And so what we thought is, let's go out there, we'll go out into the Jupyter Broadcasting

458
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:04,160
Data Center, aka our garage, and we'll just record the whole process and share with you

459
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:14,920
how it went, so you can learn from our mistakes, or potentially our victory.

460
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,840
So we've been looking at this, we have two options.

461
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:23,480
We can either go straight to FreeNAS 11, or we can go to 9.3 and then try to go from 9.3

462
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,480
to 11.

463
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,480
What version are we on now?

464
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,480
9.1.

465
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,480
Okay.

466
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,480
Beta.

467
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,480
Right.

468
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,320
And so we thought the audience would be most likely to do the graphical update options,

469
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,320
so we're going to try that.

470
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,320
So we've downloaded the 9.3 image.

471
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,320
I'll go over to log in and give it a go.

472
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,320
Yep.

473
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,320
You ready?

474
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,320
I think we should have a break.

475
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,320
We'll be fine.

476
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,680
You can hear the old server.

477
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,680
It's so much smaller.

478
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,680
No kidding.

479
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,680
It's so much more low scale.

480
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,680
Yeah.

481
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:52,400
This was a fun upgrade because we really were kind of out.

482
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,760
Both of us have managed servers for a long time.

483
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:59,720
Basic storage server is not that complicated, but both of us just sort of felt out of our

484
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,720
element with FreeNAS.

485
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,720
Yeah.

486
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,720
I've used FreeBSD.

487
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,720
I've used ZFS.

488
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,240
I've used ZFS on FreeBSD, but never FreeNAS.

489
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,240
Yeah.

490
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,240
That's the other thing here, right?

491
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,240
This is a...

492
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:13,200
I mean, it's not like we're not going to break it, but it's not a test system, so we would

493
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,880
prefer to have the FreeNAS working at the end of the day.

494
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,880
Yeah.

495
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,440
I mean, it's so out of date because it was one of the very first FreeNAS minis, and it

496
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,600
was a beta build, and we just never...

497
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,480
It turns out you're running a podcast network.

498
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,520
It went to work, and we never revisited it.

499
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,840
It's a testament to the reliability.

500
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:27,840
Yeah.

501
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,080
But it's now, as we get to the point where we want to do a bunch of storage changes,

502
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,800
we got to get this thing updated.

503
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,960
Now we might want to do the save config option also.

504
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,960
Right.

505
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:36,960
Yes.

506
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,960
I did recommend that.

507
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,960
Yeah, we will.

508
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,960
Yeah.

509
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,960
So you can click here.

510
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,960
It'll download your configuration, which is good.

511
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:42,960
Perfect.

512
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,960
And so that's step one.

513
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:48,600
And then step two is you have to choose your upgrade image, which is different than their

514
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:53,440
regular ISO image if you're in the 9 series and you're upgrading.

515
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,440
So that's something to keep in mind.

516
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:57,160
They've got like an XZ packed tar that you can just do.

517
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,640
It doesn't have all the ISO stuff.

518
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,640
Yeah, exactly.

519
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,640
Okay.

520
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,640
So you can select it.

521
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,640
And hit upload.

522
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,160
A whopping 364 megs of FreeNAS goodness.

523
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,240
So I guess there's no step after this.

524
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,240
You just hit apply update.

525
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,240
All right.

526
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,240
Let's hit it.

527
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,240
It's uploading the firmware.

528
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,240
It's going pretty fast.

529
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,240
Okay.

530
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,240
Hey.

531
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,560
30%, 60%, 80%, 90%.

532
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,640
It's uploaded.

533
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,420
I think it's probably doing the checksum now.

534
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:22,640
And extracting the firmware.

535
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,360
The FreeNAS mini is in this.

536
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,840
We're in the garage of the studio, and it's out here.

537
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:27,840
So we're sitting next to it.

538
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,240
We can start to hear it, start thinking here in a second.

539
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,240
This is it.

540
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,240
Extracting firmware.

541
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,720
Do you feel like the 9.1 to 9.3?

542
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,720
That's not a significant jump.

543
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,320
I feel like if we can get the 9.3 pretty safely, we don't lose our configs, it should be a

544
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,320
pretty straightforward process.

545
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,640
And we're like a standard place.

546
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,920
I think a lot of people probably upgraded from 9.3 to 11.

547
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,720
And then it's storage time.

548
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,840
Then we're redoing the entire storage setup, adding a whole bunch more storage.

549
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,840
Excellent.

550
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,840
Yeah.

551
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,840
I think it needs it, right?

552
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,840
Yeah.

553
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,960
We're at, I shouldn't even say it, but we're at 94% capacity right now, which is, we've

554
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:58,960
got to change it.

555
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,960
Oh, file system loves that.

556
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:04,000
We've got to get that down to like 80% max, which is, that's a future goal, but that's

557
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
why we need more storage.

558
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
All right.

559
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Well, the firmware updates, I'll get our Etcher backup.

560
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,080
Just in case this image based upgrade, they call it the graphical upgrade, doesn't work.

561
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:18,640
We have a backup plan, which is to go straight to FreeNAS 11 via the ISO image and just plug

562
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,640
in a USB port.

563
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,640
It's faster than the iDrive.

564
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,640
Yeah.

565
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,640
Although if we have to plug in a USB port, we're also going to have to get a monitor

566
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,640
and a keyboard.

567
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,640
Oh, system is rebooting.

568
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,640
Oh, here we go, Les.

569
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,640
Okay.

570
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,640
Fingers crossed.

571
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,640
Oh, boy.

572
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,000
Now you just wait, when you're doing these things remotely, you just wait for the system

573
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,600
to come back up online and you're like, you're always tempted to like bring up a terminal

574
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,600
window and start a ping.

575
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,600
Yeah.

576
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,600
Just run a ping.

577
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,600
Absolutely.

578
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,600
Why not?

579
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,600
Should I?

580
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,600
Okay.

581
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,600
Sure.

582
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,600
Yeah.

583
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,600
You just want to know, right?

584
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,600
Resist.

585
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,600
I can't help it.

586
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:55,040
You know what's interesting is that helped us get in the position to then move over

587
00:23:55,040 --> 00:24:00,780
to that super micro box, which then it really set us up to swap out the whole thing again

588
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:02,980
to Fedora.

589
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:07,540
But like that was the crucial piece is we needed to get the OS normalized and we had

590
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:08,540
to get more storage.

591
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:09,540
Right.

592
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:13,500
But then we brought it over to a more general purpose system and eventually, yeah, added

593
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:18,520
more storage and eventually, I mean, a Linux upgrade.

594
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:23,540
That was one of those upgrades that took a really long time because it was when we were

595
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:26,540
still an independent company on a very, very small budget.

596
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:30,540
So I bought the drives on a Black Friday sale.

597
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:31,540
Right.

598
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:34,360
And they sat in storage here at the studio for a while.

599
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:39,440
Then when I finally got a great deal from Unix Surplus, I got a great machine.

600
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:45,080
I got that in here and then a listener of TechSnap very kindly donated some memory.

601
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,440
That was amazing.

602
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:50,440
And really put it over the top and then we were set.

603
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:54,980
And it was just it all kind of just eventually came together over like a six month period.

604
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:58,660
I love that that same data set just keeps chugging away.

605
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:01,420
Yeah, really, really.

606
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:04,700
It's really being put to the test right now because it's so freaking hot out there.

607
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:08,780
So if it survives the summer in that garage, I'll be really impressed.

608
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:09,780
It's the ultimate test.

609
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:10,780
It's a pressure cooker.

610
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:23,600
It's a pressure cooker.
