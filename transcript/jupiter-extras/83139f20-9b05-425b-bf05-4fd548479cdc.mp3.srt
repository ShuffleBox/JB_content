1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,280
We've got together on the live stream today to really put Brent to the test.

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:13,640
He's in the studio, and if he can get all the way to $32,000, he will earn 1,000 Satoshis.

3
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:17,960
Brent, are you ready to become a Linux millionaire?

4
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:18,960
I'm sweating already.

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,240
I think that's a good sign.

6
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,720
Now, none of these questions have anything to do with Linux, but we're still going to

7
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:27,960
have fun.

8
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:28,960
Welcome in, Brent.

9
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,240
Good to have you here.

10
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,240
Thank you.

11
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,240
This seat feels hot.

12
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,240
Did you turn it up?

13
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,240
Yeah.

14
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,300
We definitely have the seat turned up when you're in here.

15
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:39,560
It's just part of the intensity of it, you know, to get you really kind of in the zone,

16
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,560
get you stressed out.

17
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,560
Thank you.

18
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,200
Plus, the sweating looks really good on camera.

19
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,200
It's the shine.

20
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,200
Yeah.

21
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,680
So, you're in from out of town.

22
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,040
Let's see, where are you from there, Brent?

23
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,040
Well, there's a place north.

24
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,040
You may have heard of it.

25
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,040
Canada?

26
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,040
Yeah, the land of the snow.

27
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,040
Yeah.

28
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,040
Yeah.

29
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,040
It's a little colder there.

30
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,040
So, Brent's in from out of town.

31
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:01,680
He crossed many borders many times to be here.

32
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,680
Did I ever?

33
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:03,680
Took the long way, I think.

34
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,440
Do you have any friends or family listening today, Brent?

35
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,720
Oh, I don't know if I do, but if I do, I'll give a wave.

36
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,880
Yeah, give them a shout out for us.

37
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:10,880
I'm waving.

38
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,880
They can't see.

39
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,560
Yeah, you let them know that you're here and that you acknowledge them and that you appreciate

40
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,560
them being here, okay?

41
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:20,080
Yeah, I think my mom actually is tuning in from a snowy, snowy cabin.

42
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,080
Good.

43
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,080
Everybody say hello to Brent's mom.

44
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,080
Hi, mom.

45
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,080
Hi, Brent's mom.

46
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,080
Thank you for joining us today.

47
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:30,960
So, Brent, if you win the 1,000 satoshis, what are you going to do with them?

48
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,440
Well, I'm trying to wrap my head around exactly how much they're worth.

49
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:38,040
At this point, I haven't got a good sense of that.

50
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,520
It sounds like a heck of a lot.

51
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,520
It does.

52
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,520
I'll tell you what.

53
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,640
As a little treat, if you win them at the end, I'll tell you how much it is.

54
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,640
What do you say?

55
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,640
You want to do that?

56
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,640
Yeah, that sounds fun.

57
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,720
1,000 satoshis to you or the cause of your choice.

58
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,720
Oh, wow.

59
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,640
Brent, are you ready to try to become a Linux millionaire?

60
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,640
I'm ready.

61
00:01:53,640 --> 00:02:05,640
Okay, Brent, which of these subjects is taught at a graduate school informally, known as

62
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:16,000
B school, A, business, B, Bible studies, C, biology, or D, basketball?

63
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:24,680
Which of these subjects is taught at a graduate school informally, known as B school, Bible

64
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,580
studies, business, biology, or basketball?

65
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,840
The first question is supposed to be easy, right?

66
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,840
Yeah, it is.

67
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,840
It is.

68
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,840
If I get this wrong, do I get a second chance?

69
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,840
No.

70
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,840
Yeah, listen.

71
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:41,980
You got to figure this is the first question, right?

72
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:45,320
So they probably are going to make it pretty easy, right?

73
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:48,960
So you could probably think the most obvious answer is probably that one, right?

74
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,080
You don't know the answers, though.

75
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,320
I can't tell you if I do or not.

76
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,320
All right.

77
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,320
I can't tell you.

78
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:59,600
But I can tell you it'd be horribly embarrassing to lose at this stage.

79
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:04,280
Well, the one that seems the most obvious to me would be basketball because the others

80
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:08,280
seem like, no, I don't want to say anything bad about basketball.

81
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,280
Taught at a graduate school.

82
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,280
Mm-hmm.

83
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,280
So graduate school fields.

84
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,000
Informally known as B school.

85
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,160
Oh, I misunderstood this.

86
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,160
Oh, oh, oh.

87
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,160
I don't know.

88
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,840
I'm not saying either way, but I'm just saying that's it.

89
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:26,400
Which of these subjects is taught at a graduate school, informally known as B school?

90
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,400
Oh, got it.

91
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,400
Got it.

92
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,400
Got it.

93
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,400
I misunderstood the question the first time around.

94
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,400
I'm glad we did this.

95
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,400
Well, it's all in the cases, really.

96
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,400
Yeah.

97
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,400
Yeah, thanks.

98
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,400
I don't know if that really changes anything for you, though.

99
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,400
Well, I'm going to not go with basketball.

100
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,400
I think it's now the worst answer.

101
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,400
Okay.

102
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,400
All right.

103
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,400
Okay.

104
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,400
That's a big shift.

105
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,400
It's exactly opposite, actually.

106
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,400
Yeah.

107
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,400
Okay.

108
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,400
Yeah.

109
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,400
It's a big shift of business.

110
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,400
All right.

111
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,400
Final answer?

112
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,400
Yeah.

113
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,400
Let's go for it.

114
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,400
All right.

115
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,400
Let's see what we say.

116
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,400
Locking it in.

117
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,400
And survey says...

118
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,400
You got it right, Brent.

119
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,400
Nicely done.

120
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,400
Nicely done.

121
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,400
I almost sunk it there.

122
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,400
What does that say about MBAs?

123
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,400
You know, B school?

124
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,400
Not very creative.

125
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,400
Oh, Wes.

126
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,400
Wes is here.

127
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:13,840
He'll be our emergency call a friend and also color commentary, as you can tell.

128
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,560
Are you ready to continue, Brent?

129
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,560
Yes.

130
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,560
Wait, wait, wait.

131
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,560
What am I at?

132
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,560
$200.

133
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,560
Oh, okay.

134
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,560
We don't really fret about that at the beginning, Brent.

135
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,560
Oh, sorry.

136
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,560
Yeah.

137
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,560
I know.

138
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,560
Wait.

139
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,560
You said dollars.

140
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,560
Yeah.

141
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,560
$200.

142
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,560
Yeah.

143
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,560
Dollars.

144
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,560
You got to get to...

145
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,560
When you get to $32,000 to get to Satoshi...

146
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,560
I know.

147
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,560
It's very confusing.

148
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,560
You got to earn the dollars to get the SATs.

149
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,560
Okay.

150
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,560
Okay.

151
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,560
Okay.

152
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,560
According to a popular saying...

153
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,560
Although now the timer is going.

154
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,560
It's all a mess.

155
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,120
According to a popular saying about hot tropical weather, it's not the heat.

156
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,120
It's the what?

157
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,400
Humidity, rash, cold, or fuzz?

158
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,400
Humidity.

159
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,400
Final answer?

160
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,400
Yeah, go for it.

161
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,400
All right.

162
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,400
I like your confidence there, buddy.

163
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,400
Survey says...

164
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,400
All right.

165
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,400
Nicely done, Brent.

166
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,400
Thank you.

167
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,400
Under pressure.

168
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,400
15 seconds.

169
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,400
All right, Brent.

170
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:06,320
Which of these terms is used for the most luxurious section of accommodations on an

171
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,600
airplane, on a ship, or on a train?

172
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:15,360
The psychology class, first class, Ritz class, or alpha class?

173
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,840
This should have been question one.

174
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,480
I think it's first class.

175
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,480
All right.

176
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,480
No, no.

177
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,480
I know it's first class.

178
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,760
You know, I got to say, I prefer alpha class.

179
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,760
Well...

180
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,920
I'd like an alpha class seat, please.

181
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,920
That's the future.

182
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,920
We're not there yet.

183
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,920
Okay.

184
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,920
All right.

185
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,920
So you're just going to boldly say B, first class?

186
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,920
Sure.

187
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,920
All right.

188
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,920
Here we go.

189
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:40,040
Attention.

190
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,040
You got it, Brent.

191
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,040
Thank you.

192
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,040
You got it.

193
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,040
Good job.

194
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,040
All right.

195
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,880
Now for $500.

196
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:53,400
Which of these is not one of the Energizer Bunny's primary characteristics?

197
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:57,080
I'm trying to read it without laughing, dude.

198
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:03,440
Which of these is not one of the Energizer Bunny's primary characteristics?

199
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,440
Okay.

200
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,440
He carries a bass drum.

201
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,440
Yes.

202
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:13,960
He has a buck teeth, wears sunglasses, wears sandals.

203
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,200
Not one of his primary characteristics.

204
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:24,000
A bass drum, buck teeth, sunglasses, or sandals.

205
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,200
I'm going to go with buck teeth.

206
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,200
All right.

207
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,200
Buck teeth.

208
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,200
Final answer?

209
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:33,800
Final answer.

210
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,800
You got it, dude.

211
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,800
I know.

212
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,800
I wasn't sure about the sandals.

213
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,800
I wasn't either.

214
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,800
I have to be honest.

215
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,800
All right.

216
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:46,240
You're now at $1,000, halfway to earning 1,000 Satoshis.

217
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,840
Only a few questions left.

218
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,400
What happens if I go above 32?

219
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,080
Well, then we'll have to figure that out.

220
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,080
Okay.

221
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,080
Okay.

222
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,080
Maybe you will.

223
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,080
Maybe you're in 2,000.

224
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:59,600
Which of these shapes also fits the common definition of a rectangle, a circle, an ellipse,

225
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,380
a square, or a triangle?

226
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:12,120
The common definition of a rectangle, circle, eclipse, square, or triangle?

227
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,720
I think they must be saying ellipse.

228
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,720
What did I say?

229
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,720
Eclipse.

230
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,720
It's almost the same thing.

231
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,720
Oh, jeez.

232
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,720
Oh, yeah.

233
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,720
Obviously.

234
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,720
Did I say eclipse both times?

235
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,720
I don't know.

236
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,720
I don't think so.

237
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,720
Let's say you didn't.

238
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,720
Okay.

239
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,720
I'm going to go with a square.

240
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,720
A square?

241
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,720
Similar shape.

242
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,720
All right.

243
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,720
Final answer?

244
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,720
Yes, please.

245
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,720
You got it.

246
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,720
Oh, man.

247
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,720
Almost had me there.

248
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,720
I'm sorry.

249
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,720
I'm sorry.

250
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:45,440
It's a little too early for me to read, apparently.

251
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:53,720
What continent is closest to Antarctica, Africa, Asia, Australia, or South America?

252
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,880
Closest to Antarctica?

253
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:05,840
I believe there are penguins in Argentina, so I'm going to say South America.

254
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,560
D final answer?

255
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,560
I think so.

256
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,560
Yeah.

257
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,560
Let's go for it.

258
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,560
All right.

259
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,560
Submitting to the computer.

260
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,560
And survey says...

261
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,560
You got it right, Brent.

262
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,560
Nice.

263
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,560
Nicely done.

264
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,560
Thank you.

265
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,980
Now for $4,000.

266
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:24,120
Just a few away from those sweet, sweet sads.

267
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:31,440
In 1981, the movie Chariots of Fire, in that movie, one athlete refuses to compete for

268
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:40,120
religious reasons on what day of the week, Thursday, Sunday, Friday, or Saturday.

269
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,720
You do have a couple of lifelines here.

270
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,720
Thank you.

271
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:48,120
You got the 50-50, you got the phone a friend, and you got the audience survey.

272
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,800
I'd like to go with the audience survey here.

273
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,800
All right.

274
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,800
Let's do it.

275
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:56,080
We're going to stop and we're going to ask the audience, okay, Brent, here's what we

276
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,680
got coming in from them.

277
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:03,840
Coming in right now, it looks like 61% of them say B.

278
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,080
What was B again?

279
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,920
B is Sunday.

280
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,280
That was my inclination.

281
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,600
Eight seconds.

282
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,600
Let's go with Sunday.

283
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,600
All right.

284
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,600
Final answer?

285
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,720
Sunday answer.

286
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,720
You got it, buddy.

287
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,720
Thank you.

288
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,720
Wow.

289
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,040
Thank you to the crab.

290
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,400
I did not know that one.

291
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,980
All right.

292
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:29,600
The Puget Sound is located in what US state?

293
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:37,820
Alaska, Washington, Massachusetts, or Maine?

294
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:41,320
You will be kicked out of the studio if you get this wrong, Brent.

295
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:46,600
Is that a hint?

296
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:51,360
I think I should do a 50-50.

297
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,360
Okay.

298
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,360
All right.

299
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,920
We are going to take away two wrong answers from the board.

300
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:00,760
Massachusetts and Washington remain on the board.

301
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,680
Washington or the nuts.

302
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,840
Which one is the Puget Sound located in?

303
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,400
I'm going to go with Washington.

304
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,400
Final answer?

305
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,400
Final.

306
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,400
All right.

307
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,400
Let's lock it in.

308
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,400
All right.

309
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,400
Yes.

310
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:18,320
Okay, Brent.

311
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:23,160
One away from 32,000 and unlocking 1,000 SATs.

312
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,760
And I still have a West.

313
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:30,840
The state of Montana derives its name from a Latin word meaning what?

314
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:35,720
Northern, snowy, mountainous, or vast?

315
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,720
I'm going to go with mountainous.

316
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,720
Wow.

317
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,720
You're just down.

318
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,720
Ready?

319
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,720
It's the Canadian French that's helping me out.

320
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,720
Okay.

321
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,720
Final answer then.

322
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,720
Yeah.

323
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,720
Go for it.

324
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,720
All right.

325
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,720
Locking her in.

326
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,720
Oh, you got it.

327
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,720
Nicely done, sir.

328
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,720
All right.

329
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,600
Now, get this one right and you get 1,000 SATs.

330
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:58,040
For $32,000, a brown recluse is what kind of creature?

331
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:05,560
A spider, a snake, a bird, or a fish?

332
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,880
I'm going to call a West on this one.

333
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,080
Oh, you want to phone a friend.

334
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,080
Very good.

335
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,680
Mr. Payne, we're going to dial you up here.

336
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:16,320
And we'd like to know what you think a brown recluse is.

337
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,320
You got 30 seconds.

338
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,960
I do not have a sound effect for dialing me up.

339
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,960
Oh, yeah.

340
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,960
This is it right here.

341
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,960
Ready?

342
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,960
Starting now.

343
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:27,900
A spider, a snake, a bird, or a fish?

344
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:28,900
Can I talk to West?

345
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:29,900
Yeah.

346
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,320
West, I'm leaning to the legged one.

347
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,320
Yeah.

348
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,360
No, I think I'm familiar with these.

349
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,360
Let's go spider.

350
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,360
Yeah.

351
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,360
Because they have caves and stuff.

352
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,360
Yeah.

353
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,360
Final answer.

354
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,360
Yeah.

355
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,360
West and I.

356
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,360
Lock it in?

357
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,360
Do it.

358
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,360
Five seconds left.

359
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,360
Locking it in.

360
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,360
Do it.

361
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,360
Do it.

362
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,360
Do it.

363
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,360
All right.

364
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,360
And you got it, Brent.

365
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,360
Nice.

366
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,360
Thank you, West.

367
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,360
Nicely done.

368
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,360
I think they're even here in Washington.

369
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,360
So watch out.

370
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,360
Now you're on a roll, Brent.

371
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,360
You've just secured 1,000 SATs.

372
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,360
You get these right.

373
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,360
I think we're going to do 2,000 if you can get to a million.

374
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,360
Here we go.

375
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,360
All right.

376
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:15,480
Weston Bernstrand is a 1981 book, the breaks of the game is an account of a team in what

377
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,880
professional sport league?

378
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,880
Okay.

379
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:22,680
So David's book in 1981, the breaks of the game is an account of a team in what professional

380
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,680
sport league?

381
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:29,720
In the NBA, the NHL, MLB, or the NFL?

382
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,720
You can ask the Mubaroo.

383
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,720
Maybe the Mubaroo.

384
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,720
Please help me.

385
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,720
We've got a freebie here for Brent.

386
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,720
This will be the moment.

387
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,720
We've got, what, 18 seconds?

388
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:39,120
I feel like Brent should get a translation of what those league names are to the sports.

389
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,120
MLB, Major League Baseball, NBA is basketball.

390
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,120
Breaks of the game.

391
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,120
Eight seconds.

392
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,120
I'm going to say...

393
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,120
You take it, Chris.

394
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,120
Oh, no.

395
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,120
I don't want to do it.

396
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,120
Do it.

397
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,120
Okay.

398
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,120
Here we go.

399
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,120
A.

400
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,120
Unbelievable.

401
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,120
Oh, no way.

402
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,120
Unbelievable.

403
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,120
Well done.

404
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,120
Wow.

405
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,120
All right.

406
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,120
Moving on.

407
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,440
I don't even know what A was.

408
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:12,920
For $125,000, which of these substances contain no carbon atoms, dynamite, sugar, rust, or

409
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,320
grain alcohol?

410
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,720
No carbon atoms.

411
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:29,320
Dynamite, sugar, rust, or grain alcohol?

412
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,880
What was C again?

413
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,880
Rust.

414
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,520
25 seconds.

415
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:41,440
I'm getting conflicting answers from...

416
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,440
Chat room.

417
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,440
Chat room.

418
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,440
You've got 15 seconds.

419
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,640
Yeah, rust is...

420
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,800
Well, since we love rust so much...

421
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,800
Let's do it.

422
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,800
I think we're going to go with rust.

423
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,800
Oh, my gosh.

424
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,800
Can you handle that?

425
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,800
Let's do it.

426
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,800
Oh, my God.

427
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,800
Two in a row.

428
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,800
Unbelievable.

429
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,560
I think this game is rigged, but I can't quite tell, but I'm okay with it.

430
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:12,160
For $250,000, who was featured in the 1998 Time Magazine cover with the headline, Is

431
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,280
Feminism Dead?

432
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:20,880
Martha Stewart, Callista Flockhart, Pamela Anderson-Lee, or the Spice Girls?

433
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,720
1998.

434
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,360
Time Magazine.

435
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,600
Is Feminism Dead?

436
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:31,640
Martha Stewart, Callista Flockhart, Pamela Anderson-Lee, or the Spice Girls?

437
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:35,040
Martha Stewart had that big hoopla back then.

438
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,040
She did, yeah.

439
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,480
So I'm going with her.

440
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,760
I think that's a pretty good guess.

441
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,760
She was in the news a lot.

442
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,760
Yeah, it was a big deal.

443
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,760
She went to jail.

444
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,760
She did.

445
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,760
That was crushing.

446
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,200
For stuff that the banks would later do just as a matter of practice and totally not get

447
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,200
in trouble.

448
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,600
Well, I mean, she led the stage.

449
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,600
All right.

450
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,600
So A, final answer?

451
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,600
Yeah, go for it.

452
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,600
All right.

453
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,600
Logging it in.

454
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,600
Oh, no.

455
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,600
No.

456
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,600
Oh, Brantley.

457
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,600
I'm so sorry.

458
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,600
What was the answer?

459
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:03,600
It was B, but I didn't actually see what it was.

460
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,600
I don't know if anybody caught it.

461
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,600
Callista Flockhart.

462
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,600
Oh, it was Callista Flockhart.

463
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,600
I don't know anything about Callista Flockhart.

464
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,280
Who played Ally McBeal, which is apparently what this image is referring to.

465
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,280
Yeah, okay.

466
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,280
Wow.

467
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,280
You still got a thousand sets, though.

468
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,280
Okay.

469
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,920
But my heart is still sunk in my chest.

470
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:17,920
Yeah.

471
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,920
Well, 2,000 is better than 1,000.

472
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:19,920
All right.

473
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,920
Yeah.

474
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,920
Does anybody else want to play?

475
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,920
That was fun.

476
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:23,920
Thank you.

477
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:24,920
Mr. Wimpress, would you like to play The Millionaire before we wrap it up?

478
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,920
I think, culturally, I'm going to struggle.

479
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:26,920
I'll join the club.

480
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,920
It's true.

481
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,920
But you know what?

482
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,920
You are a worldly man, so you may have a better shot than, say, myself, for example.

483
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,920
No, I'll pass.

484
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:31,920
Thank you for the offer, though.

485
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,920
That's fine.

486
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:33,920
That's absolutely fine.

487
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,920
Make Wes do it.

488
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,920
Come on.

489
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,920
Yeah, we got to work on Wes.

490
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:37,920
Wes, you want to do it?

491
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,920
Sure.

492
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,920
Okay.

493
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,920
Well, we'll flip it around, Wes.

494
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,920
And you can phone a Brent if the situation comes up.

495
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,920
Does that sound fair?

496
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:43,920
Oh, all right.

497
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,920
All right, yeah.

498
00:15:44,920 --> 00:16:02,120
All right, let's do this thing.

499
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:06,360
Welcome into the show, Wes, a Seattle native, or at least a Washington native now based

500
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,560
in the Seattle area.

501
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,560
You doing good today, Wes?

502
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,120
You got any friends or family watching?

503
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:14,320
No, they all don't think I could make it here, but I'm going to prove them wrong today.

504
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,320
All right, Wes.

505
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,160
Well, let's kick it off.

506
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:21,440
Which of these words is often used to describe a very successful movie?

507
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:27,240
A flamethrower, a blockbuster, a Smash Mouth, or a water world?

508
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,400
This is way easier than your first one, right?

509
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,040
I love the idea that it's a water world.

510
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,040
I know, me too.

511
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,340
Well, water world was one of them, I think.

512
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:39,440
Water world is historically a financial failure, and yet it's a movie I actually enjoy.

513
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,200
I thought there were some cool ideas in there.

514
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,200
That's true.

515
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,200
That's true.

516
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,200
Blockbuster.

517
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,200
Final answer.

518
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,200
All right.

519
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,200
B. Blockbuster.

520
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,200
Final answer.

521
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,200
Checking the computer.

522
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,200
Yeah.

523
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,760
Yeah, you got that one right, Wes.

524
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,760
Yeah.

525
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,760
I know, right?

526
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,760
Okay.

527
00:16:55,760 --> 00:17:07,040
For $200, if you want someone to stop bothering you, you might ask them to get off your what?

528
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,040
Your sidebar?

529
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,040
Your brief?

530
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,360
Your case?

531
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:15,100
Or your closing argument?

532
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,720
You want them to get off your what?

533
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,440
A sidebar, a brief, a case, closing argument.

534
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,360
Let's go with case, although, I mean, there's a lot of good options here.

535
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,520
Yeah, I like them all for some reason.

536
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:30,200
All right, we're doing C, case, and survey says...

537
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,240
Yeah, that's right, Wes.

538
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,000
Okay, here we go.

539
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,040
I'm gonna start saying get off my sidebar, though, so, I mean, it might not work, but

540
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,040
they'll at least be confused for a moment.

541
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,040
Can you just get off my closing argument, please?

542
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,600
How come lawn wasn't part of the options?

543
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,600
I know!

544
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,600
That's what I was expecting.

545
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,600
That's why I started laughing when I read it first.

546
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:51,280
Okay, Wes, according to a popular phrase, a person who achieves success through others

547
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,320
is riding their what?

548
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:59,960
A, coattails, B, rickshaw, C, golden goose, or D, sidecar?

549
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:05,160
Oh, man, rickshaw is a fantastic answer, but no, coattails.

550
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,160
You sure?

551
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,040
I mean, I feel like I've heard a lot of people say that guy's just riding his golden goose.

552
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,040
Yeah.

553
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:19,680
All right, coattails, locking it in, and we'll see what the computer says.

554
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,720
You got it, Wes, and now we're at $500.

555
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,240
You're one away from a thousand sats.

556
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:30,840
Which of these terms best describes money set aside to use for improper purposes, like

557
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,960
we're doing right now?

558
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:39,160
For improper purposes, pension, slush fund, net worth, or margin account?

559
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:44,600
Okay, well, there's a lot to unpack in margin account and how you want to judge things with

560
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:48,800
improper there, I think.

561
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,800
But slush fund.

562
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,800
All right, final answer?

563
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,800
Final answer.

564
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,800
Okay, locking it in.

565
00:18:52,800 --> 00:19:00,880
All right, Wes, very nice.

566
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,760
This one gets you the sats.

567
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:09,080
The plumage of an adult male cardinal is predominantly what color?

568
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:15,640
Blue, red, yellow, or orange?

569
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:23,840
The foliage of an adult male cardinal is predominantly what color?

570
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,840
Let's go with red.

571
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,840
All right.

572
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,840
Final answer.

573
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:27,840
You feeling good?

574
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,840
I like that.

575
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:29,840
I'm feeling good.

576
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,840
It's an attention catching color, right?

577
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,840
Yeah.

578
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,840
I mean, who wouldn't want to be bright red?

579
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,840
Right.

580
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,840
Locking it in.

581
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,840
There's no bird cops out there to pull you over.

582
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,440
Oh, you got it, Wes.

583
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,720
That means you get the sats.

584
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,280
You get the sats.

585
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:46,480
I would like to officially donate my sats to the Brent cause.

586
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,480
Whoa.

587
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,480
Wow.

588
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,280
Such a generous gentleman.

589
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:55,880
All right, Wes, the capital of Nevada is named after whom?

590
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,280
Jedediah Smith?

591
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,760
Kit Carson?

592
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,160
Jesse Lee Reno?

593
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,240
John C. Fremont?

594
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,240
The capital of Nevada?

595
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,760
I feel like Wimpy would know this one.

596
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,760
It's true.

597
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,000
The Mumble Room can always jump in.

598
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,040
You also have a couple of lifelines here.

599
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,480
You got the 50-50.

600
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,000
You got the poll the audience, and you got the call of Brent.

601
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,840
I'm going to go with Kit Carson.

602
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,960
Kit Carson.

603
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:20,960
I love it.

604
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:21,960
Makes sense.

605
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,160
Let's lock that sucker in.

606
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:27,280
B, final answer, and survey says.

607
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,880
I think you knew that one, Wes.

608
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,880
I did.

609
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,200
I mean, I don't know why I know that.

610
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,200
That is close enough, I guess.

611
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,200
Yeah.

612
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,200
You know, they try to get you with that Reno one.

613
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,200
That's true.

614
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,200
Tricky, tricky.

615
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,200
That was.

616
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,200
All right.

617
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:44,120
For $4,000, which of the following is a common symptom of cerebriolic dermatitis?

618
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,480
I'm sure you know what this is, right?

619
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,760
Baldness, gray hair, split ends, or dandruff?

620
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,760
Okay.

621
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,840
It's something to do with the head, it seems.

622
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,840
So it's cerebriolic.

623
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,840
How do you say that?

624
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,840
Cerebriolic.

625
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,840
Cerebriolic.

626
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:57,840
Thank you.

627
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,840
Cerebriolic.

628
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,840
Dermatitis.

629
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,840
Cerebriolic.

630
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,840
Dermatitis.

631
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,840
Is it balding?

632
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:03,840
Is it gray hair?

633
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,840
Is it split ends?

634
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:05,840
Is it dandruff?

635
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:06,840
Let's go with the 50-50.

636
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,840
All right.

637
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,440
Eliminating two wrong answers.

638
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:22,640
And what you have left now, Wes, split ends or dandruff, 17 seconds.

639
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,640
Let's go with dandruff.

640
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,640
All right.

641
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,640
Here we go.

642
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:29,120
It was tense.

643
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,120
You got it, Wes.

644
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,240
Nicely done.

645
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,240
That was a blind guess.

646
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,240
I'll be honest.

647
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,240
All right.

648
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,240
Now for $8,000.

649
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,240
Thank you, PixelPimp.

650
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,240
I'm impressed.

651
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,240
Okay.

652
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:44,600
For $8,000, by definition, which of the following might be portrayed in a still life painting?

653
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:51,700
A bicycle race, a fruit basket, a flowing river, or a singing choir in a still life

654
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,700
painting, Wes?

655
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:56,960
I'm going to phone Brent.

656
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,200
Make sure you have his Canadian line, though, right?

657
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,080
Yeah, we have to actually pay a little long distance for that, so I got to limit the length

658
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,080
of the call.

659
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,120
All right, Brent, you've got 28 seconds.

660
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,320
You probably heard the question.

661
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,600
By definition, which of the following might be portrayed in a still life painting?

662
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,680
A bicycle race, a fruit basket, a flowing river, or a singing choir.

663
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,040
You've got about 15 seconds.

664
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:23,780
Well, I know of still life photographs that they're generally inanimate, and all those

665
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:26,000
other activities seem pretty animate.

666
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
So I'm going to say fruit basket.

667
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Yeah, I was thinking fruit basket, right?

668
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,560
I mean, there's stuff going on down there, but we just-

669
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,560
All right, I'm locking it in.

670
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,560
You're out of time.

671
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,560
You're out of time.

672
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,560
Yeah.

673
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,560
You got it!

674
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,560
Thank you, Brent.

675
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,560
You're welcome.

676
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,560
Nicely done.

677
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,840
I am really impressed, you guys.

678
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:48,720
All right, for $16,000, what shape's volume is calculated by multiplying the area of the

679
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:55,800
base by the height and then dividing by three a hemisphere, a cube, cylinder, or a pyramid?

680
00:22:55,800 --> 00:23:00,120
So a shape's volume is calculated by multiplying the area of the base by the height and dividing

681
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,120
by three.

682
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,120
30 seconds.

683
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,120
Hemisphere, cube, cylinder.

684
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:08,800
What lifelines do I have?

685
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,360
You've got an audience poll.

686
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,440
Yeah, let's do the poll, all right?

687
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,840
We're doing the audience poll, and okay, we're getting numbers in right now.

688
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:23,160
The audience is voting D by 44%, which is pyramid.

689
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,160
Which is pyramid.

690
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:27,920
Okay, and then what was the formula again?

691
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,600
By multiplying the area of the base by the height by dividing by three.

692
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,600
Five seconds.

693
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,240
Okay, yeah, let's trust the poll here.

694
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,240
Let's go with pyramid.

695
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,240
Okay.

696
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:41,560
The automatic pilot system is not functional.

697
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,560
Is it going?

698
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,560
Uh-oh.

699
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,560
It seems stuck.

700
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,560
It does seem stuck.

701
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,760
I don't know if it's going to take your...

702
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,760
Maybe that means...

703
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,760
Oh, I think we lost internet.

704
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,760
That's what that means.

705
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,760
Now we have to wait to find out.

706
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,760
Oh, Chris!

707
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,400
Oh, it worked, you got it!

708
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,480
Oh, nicely done.

709
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,800
There was a disconnect, but you got it.

710
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,600
I can't even believe it, to tell you the truth.

711
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,600
You got it.

712
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:08,200
You got that last one, but an internet interruption reset our progress.

713
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,440
But I feel like you were probably going to win.

714
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,440
I mean, I don't know.

715
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,440
I think so.

716
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,840
And you know what?

717
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,240
I think something just released that's a present for everyone listening at home too.

718
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,240
Oh, yeah.

719
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,240
Oh, yeah, right.

720
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,240
We should probably wrap it up.

721
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,240
All right, let's wrap it up.

722
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,240
Let's wrap it up for the day.

723
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,240
Good job, Wes.

724
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,240
Good job, gentlemen.

725
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,880
I couldn't have done it without the Mumble Room, without Brent.

726
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,880
Same.

727
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,880
I mean...

728
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,680
And Brent needs to find out what he's won today.

729
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,440
Brent, you need to figure out...

730
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,440
Let's see.

731
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,440
So let's see.

732
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,440
Why don't you do the math?

733
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,440
You tell me.

734
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,440
You tell me what 2000 SATs is.

735
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,440
Well, you can ask Google.

736
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,440
Google.

737
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,440
Google will tell you.

738
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,440
You have to do a little math.

739
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:45,200
So first find the volume of the pyramid and then find out.

740
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,600
Divide by three, is it?

741
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:54,120
All right, I want everybody to head over to extras.show right now because we just released...

742
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,120
Yep.

743
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,120
Extras.show.80.

744
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:00,960
We just released a really fun one-off episode that Brent and I just recorded.

745
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:06,680
And it turns out, surprise, we were recording during the entire road trip to Denver and

746
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,680
we had a whole mountain of audio.

747
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,680
We still have more, actually.

748
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:12,320
Is this like that Beatles movie?

749
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,320
Turns out.

750
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,320
Turns out.

751
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:19,880
It's the behind the scenes stuff that we captured and we played some of it in the road trip

752
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:24,280
memories episode, which just released on extras.show and there'll be more.

753
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:28,040
There'll be one on Thursday too, I think, is when the next one comes out.

754
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,920
So go over there and check it out.

755
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:35,920
I feel like we wanted to have a clip for you guys, but then we didn't really know.

756
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,920
We didn't want to.

757
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,920
We didn't want to spoil it.

758
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:40,760
We both thought of the same clip at the same moment and then we thought, no, no, that's

759
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,760
the...

760
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,760
Yeah, we didn't want to spoil it for you guys.

761
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:45,360
So go over to extras.show and grab that.

762
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,360
And that's it.

763
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,360
Thank you for being here today.

764
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,360
I think that was fun.

765
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:51,960
That's all we had planned and I feel like we've accomplished it.

766
00:25:51,960 --> 00:26:13,280
So podcast out.
