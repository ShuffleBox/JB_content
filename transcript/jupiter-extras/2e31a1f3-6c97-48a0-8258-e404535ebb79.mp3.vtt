00:00.000 --> 00:15.360
Hello, everyone. Welcome to Brunch with Brent. My name is Brent Gervais. Joining me today

00:15.360 --> 00:18.480
is Kyle Rankin. Kyle, how are you doing?

00:18.480 --> 00:20.320
I'm doing well. How about yourself?

00:20.320 --> 00:26.660
Doing great. Thanks so much for joining me today. I really appreciate it. Some of maybe

00:26.660 --> 00:31.920
our community members would know you, Kyle, for you currently are the chief security officer

00:31.920 --> 00:36.260
at Purism, and I believe vice president as well. Is that accurate?

00:36.260 --> 00:39.080
That is correct. Yeah. Many hats.

00:39.080 --> 00:44.280
That's kind of how it goes, right? You also have quite a history with the Linux Journal.

00:44.280 --> 00:50.080
You're a tech editor there for something like 10 years and freelance columnist there for

00:50.080 --> 00:51.080
a long time.

00:51.080 --> 00:54.900
Yes, it's pretty crazy, especially when you think about, you know, if you're a columnist,

00:54.900 --> 00:57.240
that means you're writing something new every month.

00:57.240 --> 00:58.240
Right.

00:58.240 --> 01:04.280
And my column was all about a new tip, or a tech tip, or, you know, hack or something

01:04.280 --> 01:09.820
like that every month. And the first year, no problem. Second year, still pretty much

01:09.820 --> 01:15.000
no problem. On the third year, when you're looking at every month to write something

01:15.000 --> 01:20.720
new that you've never written about before, it really becomes a challenge at that point.

01:20.720 --> 01:25.080
Did you find that helped you kind of grow your skill set because you're constantly hunting

01:25.080 --> 01:29.460
for something kind of curious or something new or novel?

01:29.460 --> 01:34.200
It's true. Sometimes people would ask me if I'd ever considered writing full time. And

01:34.200 --> 01:39.360
I said, no, there's no way I could write full time because I need to work in technology

01:39.360 --> 01:44.080
just to have enough new information to write about. You could sort of tell when I was really

01:44.080 --> 01:48.580
engaged at whatever I was doing at work because I would instantly have, you know, five or

01:48.580 --> 01:53.600
six or seven column ideas that would play out over the next year, you know, and flesh

01:53.600 --> 01:55.080
it out with other ones in between.

01:55.080 --> 02:00.780
Nice. I guess you would probably keep a running list of kind of those ideas and pluck them

02:00.780 --> 02:05.720
as they seem appropriate for the writing that you're doing. That sounds like a lot of fun.

02:05.720 --> 02:10.080
Well, at the beginning, I had a year or so mapped out already.

02:10.080 --> 02:11.080
That seems like a luxury.

02:11.080 --> 02:15.240
Exactly. Yeah. At some point, the well runs dry and you do find yourself every month saying,

02:15.240 --> 02:18.800
yeah, and the other challenge is, you know, let's say we're going five or six years into

02:18.800 --> 02:23.640
this. The next challenge is, wait, did I write about this? I don't remember anymore.

02:23.640 --> 02:27.320
Of course. Right. Right. Right. Our memory is only so good.

02:27.320 --> 02:31.160
Yeah. Yeah. So I would find myself coming up with an idea and then looking and finding

02:31.160 --> 02:33.960
Nope, nope. I already wrote about that four years ago.

02:33.960 --> 02:36.520
Oh, wait. Past me already thought of that.

02:36.520 --> 02:37.640
Yeah, exactly.

02:37.640 --> 02:43.000
That's funny. And do you find yourself sort of missing that in your everyday now?

02:43.000 --> 02:49.640
I do. I miss the Linux journal community in particular. They were always very supportive.

02:49.640 --> 02:53.600
And I would always get really good feedback. I mean, I know sometimes tech writers get

02:53.600 --> 02:57.700
the opposite where the only feedback they get is someone correcting them or giving them

02:57.700 --> 03:02.840
a nice well actually to the gut. But yeah, in my case, it was always pretty positive

03:02.840 --> 03:07.240
when I got feedback at all. You know, usually you're just sort of writing into a void. But

03:07.240 --> 03:11.560
that's the thing I think I miss the most is you would go to a conference and every now

03:11.560 --> 03:15.700
and then you would run into someone who's like, Oh, I read your column. I really enjoyed,

03:15.700 --> 03:20.700
you know, such and such an article you wrote, you know, just kind of really gratifying that

03:20.700 --> 03:24.200
would give you that extra bit of fuel to continue on for another year.

03:24.200 --> 03:30.120
Did that kind of connection also make you realize how many people you were having an

03:30.120 --> 03:35.520
impact on? Because sometimes as writers or even podcasters, we don't always know how

03:35.520 --> 03:40.640
many people are reaching or how profound that impact can be. Was that something that hit

03:40.640 --> 03:41.640
you?

03:41.640 --> 03:46.760
Most definitely. Because without that, for example, if I hadn't gone to various free

03:46.760 --> 03:53.200
software Linux conferences, I would have never even really known that anybody read my column

03:53.200 --> 03:57.960
except for the occasional email I would get or something. But yeah, meeting actual people

03:57.960 --> 04:02.920
and, you know, in some cases, a number of people that, you know, got to know me through

04:02.920 --> 04:08.400
my writing, and they would recall different things that I wrote in the past. And yeah,

04:08.400 --> 04:11.720
it really built this kind of interesting set of community to where now there's a couple

04:11.720 --> 04:17.240
of conferences that pre coronavirus, you know, I would go to annually. And you sort of run

04:17.240 --> 04:21.200
across the same group of people that you met initially, just because it said, Hey, hey,

04:21.200 --> 04:24.960
your name sounds familiar. Oh, I've read your column before, you know, that sort of thing.

04:24.960 --> 04:29.400
That's amazing. It's also nice to hear that that community is still sort of reaching out

04:29.400 --> 04:34.880
to you in a way. To use a big word, one of the tragedies when projects change or shift

04:34.880 --> 04:39.880
or sort of change, you know, change directions is that sometimes the community doesn't know

04:39.880 --> 04:44.200
where to go anymore. So I'm glad to hear that they're still finding you here and there.

04:44.200 --> 04:48.520
Yeah, well, and it helps that right now the Linux journal site is still online. At one

04:48.520 --> 04:53.400
point when it shut down, it was unclear whether that would be the case. And there's a lot

04:53.400 --> 05:00.440
of it. I mean, I got so many solicitations from people to mirror it or to offers to host

05:00.440 --> 05:05.120
it and all of that sort of thing, which of course, you know, I, I had nothing to do with

05:05.120 --> 05:10.320
that one way or the other. There's I was just a editor and columnist. But fortunately, because

05:10.320 --> 05:13.560
it's still online, you know, there's still quite a few people that come across these

05:13.560 --> 05:18.440
articles because, you know, at one point, I even considered the idea of maybe sort of

05:18.440 --> 05:22.460
rounding up all of the articles that were still relevant, which I started reviewing

05:22.460 --> 05:26.880
them and it turned out there are quite a few, even some that were, you know, almost 10 years

05:26.880 --> 05:32.160
old that still were as, as usable today. And I considered maybe like doing some sort of

05:32.160 --> 05:37.520
ebook or, you know, something like that. But yeah, so because they're still online, I'm

05:37.520 --> 05:41.600
getting still, you know, people that come across, I mean, I come across my articles

05:41.600 --> 05:46.080
sometimes when I'm trying to look up how to do something. And I realized, oh, wait,

05:46.080 --> 05:50.640
I already wrote that for a Linux journal, you know, seven years ago or whatever.

05:50.640 --> 05:54.720
And I think that's sort of in a nutshell, part of what can be a little bit challenging

05:54.720 --> 06:00.140
about our internet decentralized world is that some of this great information just sort

06:00.140 --> 06:06.380
of disappears sometimes and somehow maintaining that reference, especially with the number

06:06.380 --> 06:12.380
and the quality of articles that was in a place like Linux journal just seems valuable.

06:12.380 --> 06:18.240
And so, I mean, I guess that's the way back machine, you know, but if we can somehow maintain

06:18.240 --> 06:21.440
those, I think you're on the right track with that sort of thinking, but it's not always

06:21.440 --> 06:22.760
obvious how to accomplish it.

06:22.760 --> 06:26.360
Oh, you're absolutely right. And yeah, thank goodness for sites like the Wayback Machine

06:26.360 --> 06:31.160
that archive some of this stuff. And thankfully they started archiving shortly after some

06:31.160 --> 06:38.880
of my early GeoCities attempts on the internet. So they didn't capture those, thank goodness.

06:38.880 --> 06:42.680
And then all of the stuff they capture for the most part is ready to survive forever.

06:42.680 --> 06:46.760
I think you're beginning to date yourself there a little bit with that GeoCities mention.

06:46.760 --> 06:51.440
That's right. Drop the GeoCities mention and hey, tell me about your first laptop. Well,

06:51.440 --> 06:57.040
it was the size of a VHS tape, you know, oh, you know, let me tell you what those are.

06:57.040 --> 07:08.000
Oh, yeah. Luckily, I can relate to all of those. But for those who don't know the Linux

07:08.000 --> 07:13.120
journal and sort of the history and the let's say the trials and tribulations that went

07:13.120 --> 07:17.880
through, can you give us sort of the the Coles notes version? Because it was around for a

07:17.880 --> 07:22.160
long time and it was really important for a lot of people. And yet today we don't we

07:22.160 --> 07:26.200
don't have it anymore. So can you give us the quick, quick sort of version? Because

07:26.200 --> 07:30.560
I know it kind of hit you personally as well. If you want the full, you know, unabridged

07:30.560 --> 07:36.200
story, I gave a couple of talks on the subject called the death and resurrection of Linux

07:36.200 --> 07:42.200
journal. I gave a keynote at Freenote live on that subject, but the clip notes version

07:42.200 --> 07:48.080
of it is, you know, Linux journal started shortly after the announcement of the Linux

07:48.080 --> 07:54.360
journal. And so it pretty much tracked the history of Linux itself, and started, you

07:54.360 --> 08:00.200
know, relatively relatively modestly, and grew pretty rapidly along with Linux, Linux,

08:00.200 --> 08:06.760
and it sort of became this mirror of Linux for a long time. And then I joined about at

08:06.760 --> 08:12.520
this point, maybe 12 years ago, I guess, and started writing as a columnist. And this was

08:12.520 --> 08:21.160
during the heyday. So I interviewed to be a columnist at a Linux World Expo conference

08:21.160 --> 08:25.960
back when they did those, if I remember correctly, it was the same one where IBM was spray painting

08:25.960 --> 08:31.440
tux penguins on the sidewalk, just to date that a little bit. That's awesome. Yeah, so

08:31.440 --> 08:36.040
that was, you know, that was that brief period of that period of time where IBM had become,

08:36.040 --> 08:40.600
you know, before that, they were sort of like the the original 800 pound gorilla that everyone

08:40.600 --> 08:44.920
was thought was evil. And then at that point, they embraced Linux, and everyone just just

08:44.920 --> 08:49.880
sort of changed their minds almost overnight, you know, because at the time, we needed 800

08:49.880 --> 08:54.360
pound gorilla in our corner. And you could argue now that Microsoft this is, you know,

08:54.360 --> 08:57.640
we're seeing something similar. Yeah, even news today, right? Something similar. Yeah,

08:57.640 --> 09:00.600
you could argue that Microsoft's doing the same thing now, because they've sort of traditionally

09:00.600 --> 09:05.300
followed in IBM's footsteps as far as that goes. But anyway, yeah, so back to Linux journals.

09:05.300 --> 09:11.540
So started there, then and sort of along with the heyday of Linux, where you started seeing

09:11.540 --> 09:17.620
it very easily show up in corporations, you didn't really have to fight to get it installed,

09:17.620 --> 09:22.080
there was, you know, professional support options, Red Hat was huge, they went public,

09:22.080 --> 09:26.960
that sort of thing. And then, you know, if we fast forward, maybe five, six years, the

09:26.960 --> 09:31.720
publishing industry itself was undergoing a lot of problems. For example, borders had

09:31.720 --> 09:37.320
closed their shops and periodicals that were getting a lot of revenue from just store shelf

09:37.320 --> 09:42.520
sales, including Linux journal, you know, had some had some trouble there. Because at

09:42.520 --> 09:46.560
that point, you had a couple of, you know, you had small book retailers, and Barnes & Noble

09:46.560 --> 09:51.360
were pretty much the only games in town if you were a magazine. So the Linux journal

09:51.360 --> 09:57.640
made the difficult decision to go digital only at shortly after that, just because they

09:57.640 --> 10:02.120
needed to make ends meet, you know, I mean, it's very expensive. The publishing costs

10:02.120 --> 10:09.100
kept going up. It's very expensive to print and ship magazines. So they were digital only,

10:09.100 --> 10:16.400
that was very controversial. But it was necessary to survive. And then fast forward, another

10:16.400 --> 10:22.520
handful of years, and it basically just I, there's a lot of analysis about why but just

10:22.520 --> 10:26.200
the community changed a bit. And the way that we were approaching the community was really

10:26.200 --> 10:32.400
based more on sort of traditional, the traditional core audience, because that was the most vocal

10:32.400 --> 10:39.100
audience of ours, and the one that really was was supportive of us the most. But in

10:39.100 --> 10:44.480
the meantime, we didn't really branch out into what had become the greater Linux community,

10:44.480 --> 10:48.380
at least in the way that we really should. And as a result, that combined with the fact

10:48.380 --> 10:52.680
that it's easier to pick up new readers, if you have a magazine on a shelf that they can

10:52.680 --> 10:57.160
see, like, Oh, what's this? And then, Oh, I want to subscribe. So in the absence of

10:57.160 --> 11:02.920
those things, it was kind of challenging. And we ultimately ran out of steam announced

11:02.920 --> 11:08.120
that we were closing up shop, which is really difficult. And then in the last minute, we

11:08.120 --> 11:13.560
were we were resurrected someone, private internet access came in and, and save the

11:13.560 --> 11:18.640
company. And so we sort of had this opportunity for rebirth. And so all of us, you know, that

11:18.640 --> 11:21.720
were involved were really excited, you know, because right before that, I had written this

11:21.720 --> 11:27.920
really heartfelt sort of eulogy for Linux journal, sort of encapsulating the last 10

11:27.920 --> 11:32.280
years. So we came back, and we really started focusing on on learning all the lessons that

11:32.280 --> 11:36.280
got us there and started, you know, turning things around. And I was very excited about

11:36.280 --> 11:41.480
the future of it. And then just sort of out of the blue, a number of months in, we got

11:41.480 --> 11:47.640
word that everything needed to be shut down, that we weren't quite to the point where we

11:47.640 --> 11:53.520
could make it 100% on our own. Although, arguably, we probably could have with a little bit more

11:53.520 --> 11:59.320
headway to prepare. But yeah, so it's just sort of the the cord was pulled. And then

11:59.320 --> 12:05.360
we died a second time, man. So then I wrote a second eulogy, you know, about a maybe year

12:05.360 --> 12:09.640
and a half after the first one, which is weird, because I had already said everything I wanted

12:09.640 --> 12:15.900
to say before. So I ended up calling the column the awkward goodbye, because it really reminded

12:15.900 --> 12:20.120
me of, you know, if you've ever gone to a restaurant with somebody, and you know, you

12:20.120 --> 12:23.720
you eat, you have a great time. And well, back remember when you went to restaurants

12:23.720 --> 12:28.200
with people? Yeah. So if we can go back in time to when that happened, and you would

12:28.200 --> 12:33.240
you would eat with people that you didn't live with. And then when you were done, you

12:33.240 --> 12:37.360
go out and go out to the front of the restaurant, right? And you would say your goodbyes. If

12:37.360 --> 12:41.360
you're close friends, you would hug, remember, we would hug people. So you would hug people,

12:41.360 --> 12:44.600
or you would shake your hand back when we did that, then you'd say goodbye, and you'd

12:44.600 --> 12:49.280
leave. But then every now and then, you both would realize, oh, wait, we're both parked

12:49.280 --> 12:53.000
in the same area. So we just did our goodbyes, we did our really good goodbyes. And now we

12:53.000 --> 12:58.280
have to awkwardly walk to the same parking lot, you know, and then you get to your your

12:58.280 --> 13:02.520
cars or whatever. And then you're deciding, well, what do we do now? You know, do we just

13:02.520 --> 13:08.360
high five? Or do we wave? Or do we just like, repeat the whole thing? Yeah, repeat the whole

13:08.360 --> 13:13.040
thing? Or do we just kind of like, like, ignore each other while we're walking? I mean, what

13:13.040 --> 13:16.840
it's super awkward. And that's, that's sort of what writing that column reminded me of,

13:16.840 --> 13:21.280
because I'd already said goodbye. And now I'm trying to do it again. I don't know. So

13:21.280 --> 13:28.720
I mostly just talked about the concept itself. And awkwardly, awkwardly, close down the column.

13:28.720 --> 13:33.800
And I would imagine was pretty emotional for you to, you know, trying to bring it back.

13:33.800 --> 13:39.240
And it sounds like PIA was sort of a funding body there in a way, and then it just sort

13:39.240 --> 13:45.080
of disappeared. And having that lack of control sometimes can be really challenging for the

13:45.080 --> 13:47.360
people involved who are putting their hearts into it, right?

13:47.360 --> 13:50.520
I can't speak for everyone. But at least for me, I think the biggest emotional hit was

13:50.520 --> 13:56.320
the first time. Because we didn't know how the story was going to go. So for as far as

13:56.320 --> 14:00.360
we knew, it was dead for good. And so I sort of went through the grieving process, then

14:00.360 --> 14:07.040
and did, you know, all of the soul searching I was going to do. And honestly, I would say

14:07.040 --> 14:12.480
that it's the death of Linux Journal, that that was at least partially if not mostly

14:12.480 --> 14:15.960
instrumental in me making the decision to go work at Purism full time.

14:15.960 --> 14:16.960
Oh, wow.

14:16.960 --> 14:22.000
Yeah, because before that, you know, I've been involved with Purism on the sidelines

14:22.000 --> 14:27.000
and sort of behind the scenes since the beginning. So I wrote one of the first reviews of the

14:27.000 --> 14:33.520
Librem 15 laptop when it was still in the crowdfunding phase. I met with Todd in person.

14:33.520 --> 14:39.400
And apparently, the laptop he had for me to review was like the Librem 15 prototype, like

14:39.400 --> 14:45.240
there was one, you know. And so we're sitting there and I think, you know, I'm sort of feeling

14:45.240 --> 14:48.540
him out to see, you know, what kind of person sort of is starting this company? Is this

14:48.540 --> 14:53.240
the real deal? And he's sort of feeling me out a little bit to say, hey, do I trust giving

14:53.240 --> 15:00.800
this guy my one laptop that I have? In any case, he did let me review it. And I wrote

15:00.800 --> 15:05.880
what I consider to be a fair review, talking about the pros and cons. But what really interested

15:05.880 --> 15:11.800
me about Purism at the time was that Todd really seemed like the real deal because,

15:11.800 --> 15:15.280
you know, a lot of times in this community, you see people that know the right words to

15:15.280 --> 15:19.680
say and know how to sort of rally the community by saying the right things. But you know that

15:19.680 --> 15:23.420
they're not really they don't really believe it or they, you know, don't have any history

15:23.420 --> 15:27.920
with it. But, you know, I discovered, no, he's the real deal. He believes what he's

15:27.920 --> 15:32.960
saying and there's a future here with this. So from that point on, I sort of on the on

15:32.960 --> 15:37.000
the background, I would, you know, sort of work behind the scenes, emailing him, giving

15:37.000 --> 15:41.920
advice and helping out with various things, including some of the internal PRS projects

15:41.920 --> 15:45.760
early on. And then every now and then we would talk back and forth, hey, you know, maybe

15:45.760 --> 15:49.960
I should go work there. But it never you know, the timing just wasn't right. And then once

15:49.960 --> 15:56.880
Linux journal died, and I was sort of grieving that I started looking at my own life, I guess,

15:56.880 --> 16:00.700
my first eulogy for Linux journal started off as like a eulogy, and then it turned into

16:00.700 --> 16:06.600
a rant by the end. And while I was ranting, you know, at, you know, the community is maybe

16:06.600 --> 16:11.600
lost its way. And we're, you know, we've changed and what's going on. I realized, you know,

16:11.600 --> 16:16.320
I'm kind of pointing some fingers at myself, too, because, you know, I felt like I haven't

16:16.320 --> 16:20.820
been doing enough to support this thing. I really cared about, you know, I'm spending

16:20.820 --> 16:26.440
my days job, you know, doing perfectly fine things, but, you know, an interesting work,

16:26.440 --> 16:30.420
but it was just sort of traditional system and work. And the companies that I was working

16:30.420 --> 16:35.560
for didn't necessarily forward free software or Linux in any way, other than the fact that

16:35.560 --> 16:36.560
I use them.

16:36.560 --> 16:40.560
So it sounds like there was a bit of a disconnect between your own personal ideals and where

16:40.560 --> 16:42.560
you were putting most of your time.

16:42.560 --> 16:47.180
Oh, most definitely. Yeah. I mean, I realized, you know, I was fortunate enough in the way

16:47.180 --> 16:52.820
that I've worked my career so far that I could make the choice to work, you know, somewhere

16:52.820 --> 16:58.960
that aligned with my ideals and that I should if I can. And again, I had, you know, worked

16:58.960 --> 17:02.440
long enough in the industry and built enough of a career that I was fortunate to be able

17:02.440 --> 17:07.080
to make that kind of choice, which, you know, not everyone can. But the timing was right.

17:07.080 --> 17:11.840
And I realized, no, I need to I should be spending eight hours a day or more, you know,

17:11.840 --> 17:15.520
forwarding my beliefs instead of, you know, just on the side, writing some articles here

17:15.520 --> 17:16.520
and there.

17:16.520 --> 17:22.920
There are always sacrifices that come with sort of making that leap, I would imagine.

17:22.920 --> 17:27.200
Although, you know, here you are today doing still amazing work, doing that kind of stuff.

17:27.200 --> 17:31.880
So good for you for sort of re-evaluating what was important to you. And it sounds like

17:31.880 --> 17:37.640
Linux Journal had a major part in that for you and sort of was a nice segue for you to

17:37.640 --> 17:45.740
move into purism. And I'm curious about what purism is in your everyday now. You're putting

17:45.740 --> 17:47.420
your main focus on security.

17:47.420 --> 17:52.320
It's interesting, because I'm in an executive role. Sometimes when you work at a startup,

17:52.320 --> 17:56.360
especially their startups often, I mean, you know, purism has been around long enough,

17:56.360 --> 17:59.560
I don't know that it necessarily qualifies as a startup anymore. But a lot of times when

17:59.560 --> 18:04.400
you work for a small company or startup, there tends to be title inflation, where, you know,

18:04.400 --> 18:08.120
someone who would be a manager is now a director and someone who'd be a director is now a VP.

18:08.120 --> 18:13.080
And so I mean, I this happened to me as well, you know, you just you start sort of in you

18:13.080 --> 18:16.920
have, you don't necessarily have the roles and responsibilities of the title, but you

18:16.920 --> 18:18.080
have the title.

18:18.080 --> 18:19.560
Someone has to have the title, right?

18:19.560 --> 18:23.760
Exactly. Someone has to have the title and you you are the head of a department. So let's

18:23.760 --> 18:27.560
give you a VP or now a C level title, you know. And in this case, though, it's a little

18:27.560 --> 18:33.320
different because it's, you know, it ends up actually having a lot of executive responsibilities,

18:33.320 --> 18:38.540
which I was expecting, of course. But yeah, so my day to day really varies because on

18:38.540 --> 18:43.120
some days I'm working full time on security related work. And then so some days I have

18:43.120 --> 18:47.600
sort of the chief security officer hat on. And then other days, I sort of have the company

18:47.600 --> 18:53.040
vice president hat on. By that I mean, it just sort of looking at the overall machine

18:53.040 --> 18:58.680
that we have as a company, just sort of helping every department wherever there needs to be

18:58.680 --> 19:03.240
help, I suppose, is a way to put it. So there's a lot of times where, you know, you may have

19:03.240 --> 19:09.320
a team that is working on getting something done, but they need someone with responsibility

19:09.320 --> 19:13.080
for the company to make a decision. Should we go this way or that way? Both ways are

19:13.080 --> 19:17.620
equally valid. They have pros and cons. What should we do? And without the answer, they

19:17.620 --> 19:23.080
maybe are blocked and can't go forward. So in some cases, some days I spend my days answering

19:23.080 --> 19:28.760
those kinds of questions. So they just unblock teams. And other days, you know, I may need

19:28.760 --> 19:33.880
to put on the hat as a as a leader of a particular team just to help get something done, just

19:33.880 --> 19:38.440
because they need extra help on a project or something. Every day is a little bit different,

19:38.440 --> 19:39.440
actually.

19:39.440 --> 19:42.240
And I would imagine that's that's what keeps it interesting for you. If you're sort of

19:42.240 --> 19:46.520
in a position that's the same every day, you know, day in and day out, that can get sort

19:46.520 --> 19:51.380
of old pretty fast, I would imagine, which, which you've alluded to, like, you know, you've

19:51.380 --> 19:56.040
automated yourself out of many jobs in the past. But in this case, it sounds like there's

19:56.040 --> 20:00.560
always something new thrown at you that can keep you sort of curious and interested and

20:00.560 --> 20:02.320
really quite valuable, really.

20:02.320 --> 20:06.600
Never really a dull moment. I can say that for sure. There's always something, you know,

20:06.600 --> 20:10.520
there's always a new challenge, something new to work on and always definitely new things

20:10.520 --> 20:15.380
to learn. You know, I've learned about all kinds of other disciplines, not just learning

20:15.380 --> 20:20.600
more about either systems administration in the past or security. But just, you know,

20:20.600 --> 20:24.880
anything from marketing to, you know, we're we're a hardware company, we sell hardware

20:24.880 --> 20:29.480
and just that whole supply chain, all the operations and all the things required with

20:29.480 --> 20:33.700
sourcing hardware and selling hardware and all of that's all been, you know, just fascinating.

20:33.700 --> 20:37.720
And because I work with so many smart people who are just experts in whatever the field

20:37.720 --> 20:41.980
is that that they happen to be responsible for, I have this great I love learning new

20:41.980 --> 20:46.520
things. And so I constantly have this opportunity to learn from people who really know what

20:46.520 --> 20:47.520
they're talking about.

20:47.520 --> 20:53.560
I would imagine a place like purism, because of its strong ideals and commitment to those

20:53.560 --> 20:59.520
ideals, you know, a lot of free software ideals and open source ideals as well would attract

20:59.520 --> 21:07.120
a certain kind of person who someone like you or I or so many of our listeners would

21:07.120 --> 21:12.840
just love to be surrounded by that kind of person. Would you say that is sort of accurate

21:12.840 --> 21:17.800
versus some of your past corporate experiences, for instance?

21:17.800 --> 21:23.480
Almost universally. In fact, I, I can't think of anywhere I've been where I have spent more

21:23.480 --> 21:29.200
time in chat having conversations about ethics than we have here. You know, it's, it's really

21:29.200 --> 21:35.000
interesting. Whenever we are deciding, making some new decision about some way to go, whatever

21:35.000 --> 21:38.880
it is, whether it's a new product, software, that sort of thing. One of the foremost things

21:38.880 --> 21:44.800
that ends up coming up is, is how does this fit in with the overall free software ethos?

21:44.800 --> 21:49.600
How does this fit in with our own ethics beyond that with respect to privacy and security?

21:49.600 --> 21:53.720
Are we taking freedom away from our customers or giving them more freedom? That sort of

21:53.720 --> 21:57.800
thing. It's just, it's wonderful to also have so many people in the company that already

21:57.800 --> 22:02.760
understand all of those issues. So, I mean, it's not universal, but we do have a great

22:02.760 --> 22:08.080
number of people who are already experts in free software licenses and understand all

22:08.080 --> 22:12.840
of that background. So, you know, when we're discussing things like licensing or how we

22:12.840 --> 22:16.880
treat a particular piece of software, a lot of us are already on the same page.

22:16.880 --> 22:21.440
Do you find that ends up, you know, because you're practicing those kinds of questioning

22:21.440 --> 22:28.600
skills professionally, that it also helps you personally to kind of look at those topics

22:28.600 --> 22:30.240
in your own personal life?

22:30.240 --> 22:36.680
It certainly helps reinforce looking through the lens of your, whatever your personal values

22:36.680 --> 22:42.440
are. If you're doing it at work for something that you could argue is maybe is less important

22:42.440 --> 22:47.860
than how you treat your personal values and yourself, right? It definitely sort of reinforces

22:47.860 --> 22:52.120
that if you're spending your time at work thinking about your corporate values and how

22:52.120 --> 22:56.520
that affects people, it certainly spills over into thinking about how you deal with everyone

22:56.520 --> 23:01.120
in your daily life. Especially if the ethics, if there's crossover in the ethics, you know,

23:01.120 --> 23:04.680
just treating, making sure that people are treated fairly, that you care about people's

23:04.680 --> 23:06.260
privacy, things like that.

23:06.260 --> 23:10.900
One of the reasons I mentioned that was something that kind of gave me a smile when I was just

23:10.900 --> 23:18.440
exploring through your website. And you mentioned on there that some of your sort of explorations

23:18.440 --> 23:25.160
in Linux and open source and free software led to changing the way that you shave, which

23:25.160 --> 23:30.400
I laughed at because I sort of approached the exact same thing and went through the

23:30.400 --> 23:35.220
same trajectory as you did. So I was like, Oh, that's so, it's so great because some

23:35.220 --> 23:41.120
of what we believe in with where we put our time, you know, into open source software

23:41.120 --> 23:46.220
and all of that, and hardware, of course, in your case, sort of spills into other areas

23:46.220 --> 23:52.800
of our life that are seemingly inconsequential, but they can equally bring us great joy, I

23:52.800 --> 23:53.800
think.

23:53.800 --> 23:59.560
I would say that safety razors and that whole technology and the advance of that technology

23:59.560 --> 24:04.440
beat the issues we have with proprietary software by a number of decades. But you can follow

24:04.440 --> 24:11.440
that history, right? You're right. I changed how I shaved, largely because of my free software

24:11.440 --> 24:12.440
values.

24:12.440 --> 24:16.000
That's a great quote.

24:16.000 --> 24:20.640
I was using a Mach 3, like a lot of people did at the time it had just come out and use

24:20.640 --> 24:24.240
it for a while. And then, you know, a number of years later, I was locked in, I had to

24:24.240 --> 24:30.280
buy razor blades just from one company, that sort of thing. And time went by, and I found

24:30.280 --> 24:34.680
out that they had decided to switch to a new, they had upgraded, you know, to a new version.

24:34.680 --> 24:35.680
They left you behind.

24:35.680 --> 24:40.160
Yeah, I had like four blades and two aloe strips or something, I don't know. I had

24:40.160 --> 24:44.360
a choice then, I could continue to try to get my old blades, which are already super

24:44.360 --> 24:47.920
expensive or, you know, move to the new one. And I tried the new one, and I didn't really

24:47.920 --> 24:51.920
like it, and the blades were more expensive, and it was okay. But then I got to the point

24:51.920 --> 24:56.080
where I said, you know, I'm just going to use the old one. And I stopped being able

24:56.080 --> 25:01.360
to source locally, those razor blades, at least the official ones, you know, I think

25:01.360 --> 25:05.060
they eventually they were able to make some knockoffs that worked. But I couldn't find

25:05.060 --> 25:08.940
compatible razor blades. And I'm sitting there thinking, I'm trying to find compatible razor

25:08.940 --> 25:13.560
blades. I got vendor locked in with shaving. You know, this is ridiculous. This is against

25:13.560 --> 25:18.640
everything I stand for. Around the same time, I read this article about, you know, it was

25:18.640 --> 25:23.080
from this website called the art of manliness. And it was about it was about how your grandpa

25:23.080 --> 25:27.080
used to shave or something like that. And I discovered, wait, there's safety razors.

25:27.080 --> 25:32.080
And wait, those razor blades are cross compatible. They, you know, they have a standard public

25:32.080 --> 25:38.880
domain compatibility between all of them, you know, and, and that's it. That's what

25:38.880 --> 25:45.640
I have to do. And so I ended up just diving headfirst, I guess, pun always intended, into

25:45.640 --> 25:50.640
shaving with a safety razor. I ended up writing a whole article about this topic for Linux

25:50.640 --> 25:55.080
Journal, even talking about I mean, pretty much the 10 years of Linux Journal is just

25:55.080 --> 26:01.320
a brain dump for me, one way or the other. But yeah, because it really is this case where

26:01.320 --> 26:06.520
you see why cross compatibility is better for the consumer and lock in is almost never

26:06.520 --> 26:11.520
better. It always creates a better situation because it requires competition. And so, you

26:11.520 --> 26:16.320
know, in the case of safety razors, I can buy a pack of 100 safety razors for $10. And

26:16.320 --> 26:21.320
that pack of 100 safety razors will last me for two, maybe three years, maybe longer now

26:21.320 --> 26:24.940
that we're all in lockdown and you don't shave as much, you know, when you work from home,

26:24.940 --> 26:29.960
that's the first thing to go. Yeah. But yeah, I mean, so it's amazing, you know, instead

26:29.960 --> 26:33.840
of $3 a blade or whatever people pay nowadays, I you know, I feel sorry for those people

26:33.840 --> 26:37.740
just like I feel sorry for them when they when they're locked into some vendor that's

26:37.740 --> 26:42.600
charges them a whole lot of money for stuff. I just love the parallel between those two

26:42.600 --> 26:48.560
worlds. And it's like the open source ideas came a long time before software did, you

26:48.560 --> 26:54.440
know, and we need to not forget about that. It's sort of a human ideal before it's a software

26:54.440 --> 26:59.360
or hardware, computer hardware ideal. So we can apply it in many areas in our lives. That's

26:59.360 --> 27:03.780
for sure. I mean, I'm seeing it all over the place. For instance, I recently, you know,

27:03.780 --> 27:09.680
two years ago, I remodeled my kitchen. And the popular thing to do now with kitchen sinks

27:09.680 --> 27:14.440
is to have a you know, you get a new countertop and do it we've saved up forever. And finally,

27:14.440 --> 27:18.600
we're gonna get a new countertop and you know, in our house and everything. So we save up,

27:18.600 --> 27:23.160
we do that. And then the question comes, well, how many holes are you going to drill in your

27:23.160 --> 27:27.680
countertop? Of course. And so like, Okay, well, let me think about this. Well, you know what,

27:27.680 --> 27:33.240
I will do the single hole sink, or the single hole faucet. So that way, later on, someone

27:33.240 --> 27:36.720
could choose to drill a new hole if they wanted to, but they wouldn't be stuck with a hole

27:36.720 --> 27:41.840
that they had to plug. Well, that means you get one of those large single hole faucets

27:41.840 --> 27:47.240
that have the little pull down sprayer instead of the separate separate sprayer, right? Well,

27:47.240 --> 27:52.740
what I discovered, because I'm a home brewer, and before I had a regular kitchen sink in

27:52.740 --> 27:57.480
regular kitchen faucet, and a regular kitchen sink has one of those little aerators that

27:57.480 --> 28:02.000
you can unscrew, and there's it's threaded with a standard thread. And I had a water

28:02.000 --> 28:07.960
cooling system to cool my wort when I was brewing, before I would put it in a fermenter.

28:07.960 --> 28:11.720
And it was designed to screw on to one of those threaded faucets like you would have

28:11.720 --> 28:17.620
on a kitchen faucet. Well, when I up, quote unquote, upgraded, I discovered that the new

28:17.620 --> 28:24.700
world of kitchen faucets is all proprietary. It really is. No, it is. And so I have this

28:24.700 --> 28:29.120
worthless now. I mean, I had to modify it to hook up to a to a garden hose because they

28:29.120 --> 28:35.740
haven't gotten their hands on making garden hoses proprietary yet. Because like it's followed

28:35.740 --> 28:40.180
me into my kitchen now my kitchen, even the kitchen sink is proprietary. They're trying

28:40.180 --> 28:45.640
to take everything over, which just makes you know, to bring him back a little bit,

28:45.640 --> 28:51.680
which just makes some of the work that purism is doing feel really quite important. And

28:51.680 --> 28:56.360
there are other people doing that similar work. I think we've got an amazing community

28:56.360 --> 29:02.600
who's pushing really hard to implement these ideals as much as possible. And in many ways,

29:02.600 --> 29:11.360
it feels like we're lucky enough to be winning the sort of open source software game. And

29:11.360 --> 29:15.900
it feels like you're on the sort of trailblazing side of the hardware game. Does that feel

29:15.900 --> 29:21.560
pretty rewarding for you? It's definitely rewarding. I mean, it's at the time that we're

29:21.560 --> 29:27.520
facing now, it's extra important, because for a while, and this kind of also goes hand

29:27.520 --> 29:32.420
in hand with that grieving session I had with Linux Journal, went out of business,

29:32.420 --> 29:37.520
but it goes to sort of the sense that the community has changed. And it's not in a bad

29:37.520 --> 29:41.880
way. It's just the community is made up of different people. So for instance, 20-30 years

29:41.880 --> 29:47.200
ago, technology was not very ubiquitous, not everyone had a computer with internet access.

29:47.200 --> 29:50.960
But these days, it's more or less expected. I mean, there's some expectation that someone

29:50.960 --> 29:55.960
has a computer in their pocket with forever internet connectivity at all times now. But

29:55.960 --> 30:01.800
beyond that, even with free software, it has also become more ubiquitous. So when I got

30:01.800 --> 30:06.380
started, you had to fight your way to get Linux installed in a company, you had to justify

30:06.380 --> 30:12.680
using it for a file server or any kind of server at all, a web server. But then, starting

30:12.680 --> 30:17.200
in, let's say, like 2005 or so, or even before that, but let's say around that time was sort

30:17.200 --> 30:21.520
of this golden era where it was just assumed, well, yeah, Linux is a completely viable option

30:21.520 --> 30:26.520
for anything you might want to do on the server side. Beyond that, free and open source software

30:26.520 --> 30:29.800
was a viable option for software. There's a point in time before that where that was

30:29.800 --> 30:34.520
considered, well, why would you want to see the source code that's not desirable? But

30:34.520 --> 30:39.040
now it's sort of second nature. So you have this whole generation of people that grew

30:39.040 --> 30:44.500
up and became adults in a world where they had instant access to technology, native access

30:44.500 --> 30:48.600
to technology, and lived in a world where free software and open source software was

30:48.600 --> 30:53.140
just an expectation. You'd see a project and, oh, I want to contribute to that, and you

30:53.140 --> 30:57.760
expected that there would probably be source code on GitHub or some other repository that

30:57.760 --> 31:03.240
you could edit, which all of that is great, but there's a downside to it, which is people

31:03.240 --> 31:08.400
who grew up in that world now don't really understand why vendor lock-in would be a problem

31:08.400 --> 31:13.480
because they've never really experienced vendor lock-in in the same kind of way in that it

31:13.480 --> 31:18.840
was, how vendors can use it to restrict you. Because at this point, people, a lot of vendors

31:18.840 --> 31:24.340
are still sort of building their influence and their power and haven't really, the other

31:24.340 --> 31:31.000
shoe hasn't dropped yet in many cases for how vendors can misuse lock-in to affect the

31:31.000 --> 31:33.080
choices of their customers.

31:33.080 --> 31:38.760
I feel like we're seeing a different kind of vendor lock-in these days. And to me, that

31:38.760 --> 31:45.320
feels like a vendor lock-in of services. Like if you look at the Googles and the, I don't

31:45.320 --> 31:53.680
know, those kind of large surveillance capitalism style entities, it brings the conversation

31:53.680 --> 31:57.720
in a whole other direction because we're not just talking hardware and software anymore.

31:57.720 --> 32:02.480
We're talking sort of the kind of things that touch our everyday lives.

32:02.480 --> 32:06.720
You may point out, well, if you use this product, this particular product will lock you into

32:06.720 --> 32:11.480
this ecosystem where you have to only get products from the same vendor because that's

32:11.480 --> 32:16.120
the only way it's compatible. And a lot of people these days would say, well, so what

32:16.120 --> 32:18.540
does that matter? It's not a big deal.

32:18.540 --> 32:22.740
Or if you start using this vendor, you will not be able to change to a different vendor

32:22.740 --> 32:27.360
without a lot of pain and difficulty. And they'll say, well, but why does that matter?

32:27.360 --> 32:33.080
And it's simply because they grew up in a world where there was a lot of ubiquitous

32:33.080 --> 32:38.080
compatible technology due to the success of Linux in the free and open source software

32:38.080 --> 32:45.360
movements that they could appreciate an internet with open protocols that were ubiquitous and

32:45.360 --> 32:47.200
were cross compatible.

32:47.200 --> 32:53.400
But now it's more important than ever to have, for example, stuff that Purism is doing to

32:53.400 --> 32:57.780
try to forward those ideals and to build products that don't have vendor lock-in because it's

32:57.780 --> 33:01.920
almost an assumption. People don't necessarily even know the risks because they haven't lived

33:01.920 --> 33:09.720
through the downsides. And so they are, in some cases, unaware of the world and the effects

33:09.720 --> 33:10.800
that their choices have.

33:10.800 --> 33:16.360
So one thing that we try to do with Purism is when we're designing a product, we heavily

33:16.360 --> 33:21.560
factor in whether this would lock a customer into us as a vendor. And if it will, we actively

33:21.560 --> 33:26.080
avoid using that technology. It's a completely sort of different approach, especially when

33:26.080 --> 33:28.760
it comes to security than most vendors take.

33:28.760 --> 33:33.560
If you were to ask some average person in information security to design a product that

33:33.560 --> 33:38.680
was for high security to protect a user from something, they would take a very sort of

33:38.680 --> 33:44.200
paternalistic approach to it that sort of maybe looks down on the user a little bit

33:44.200 --> 33:49.920
as maybe a child where the vendor is the adult who can save them from themselves, that sort

33:49.920 --> 33:55.320
of thing, and build a solution where the user has to come to the vendor for everything.

33:55.320 --> 34:00.840
They have to anchor all of their trust in the vendor because the vendor knows best.

34:00.840 --> 34:05.480
Almost all of the solutions you see out there are based on that because those engineers

34:05.480 --> 34:11.120
who designed them didn't really think about the same kind of free software ethics that

34:11.120 --> 34:16.720
we do. And it's also in the vendor's advantage to lock a customer in.

34:16.720 --> 34:21.680
But because we don't have any desire to lock the customer in, when we're designing these

34:21.680 --> 34:26.280
security measures, we have a completely different playbook and we end up coming up with completely

34:26.280 --> 34:30.680
different technologies to achieve a similar goal.

34:30.680 --> 34:37.560
But in many cases, it would be to our advantage in some ways to try to lock in people or do

34:37.560 --> 34:40.240
all of that sort of things that we don't agree with.

34:40.240 --> 34:44.640
But in other ways, we have an advantage that a lot of other companies don't because there

34:44.640 --> 34:48.500
are things that we're willing to do that they would never be willing to do, such as build

34:48.500 --> 34:54.040
technology that's compatible with a competitor's technology just so that we have interoperability

34:54.040 --> 34:59.440
or build a technology that puts the user in control and doesn't require them to come to

34:59.440 --> 35:02.480
us for everything just because that matches with our ethics.

35:02.480 --> 35:10.800
Yeah, it seems like with that paradigm shift comes real innovation simply out of need to

35:10.800 --> 35:14.800
make it possible to match the ideals. And I think that's really honorable.

35:14.800 --> 35:21.040
Well, a good example of it, I guess, is the first project I did for PureZone when I started

35:21.040 --> 35:26.800
full time, which was work on the Librem key, which is a USB security token we have and

35:26.800 --> 35:33.520
integration with this secure boot software called Heads, which is a different approach

35:33.520 --> 35:40.040
to sort of a traditional secure boot software that your average laptop might have as an

35:40.040 --> 35:41.700
option today.

35:41.700 --> 35:46.920
So the way that the traditional solution works is the vendor has keys that they sign and

35:46.920 --> 35:52.640
each system has a list of trusted certificates that they can use to validate a software as

35:52.640 --> 35:57.080
it boots. If it matches signatures, they allow it to run. If it doesn't match, they don't

35:57.080 --> 36:01.940
allow it to run. Early on when this was put in place, the free software community kind

36:01.940 --> 36:06.560
of went up in arms because they thought, well, this is going to stop people from booting

36:06.560 --> 36:11.480
Linux. That never really happened. And it probably wasn't necessarily going to happen.

36:11.480 --> 36:18.160
Who knows? But it didn't happen. What happened instead was that major Linux vendors such

36:18.160 --> 36:23.480
as Red Hat and Canonical had to go to Microsoft and get their software approved and signed

36:23.480 --> 36:26.500
so that it could boot with secure boot enabled because you either have a choice of having

36:26.500 --> 36:30.300
it on or off, trusted or insecure.

36:30.300 --> 36:36.780
So we didn't want the customer to have to come to us or go to Microsoft to get a signature

36:36.780 --> 36:41.280
to be allowed to secure their boot process. So we took an approach where the keys that

36:41.280 --> 36:45.600
we use to sign software, we don't necessarily sign it in the same traditional way, but the

36:45.600 --> 36:49.720
keys that we use are customer controlled keys.

36:49.720 --> 36:50.720
User generated, right?

36:50.720 --> 36:54.040
Yeah, they can generate them. We generate some at the factory that are temporary just

36:54.040 --> 36:58.160
to protect the user in shipment. And when they get the laptop, we encourage them to

36:58.160 --> 37:03.800
change them completely with their own keys and make it as easy as we can to do it. But

37:03.800 --> 37:08.320
it required a completely different approach than you traditionally would have and a lot

37:08.320 --> 37:14.200
of extra work and a lot of extra engineering to do it. But the end result to us is at least

37:14.200 --> 37:18.320
a lot better because it puts the user in full control of their computer, which we don't

37:18.320 --> 37:23.800
feel like a user should have to come to us and anchor their trust in us wholly for them

37:23.800 --> 37:25.760
to be safe.

37:25.760 --> 37:30.580
That's amazing. I think as someone who really, you know, I really care about those things

37:30.580 --> 37:37.560
and understand how difficult they are to implement and also to have accepted widely, especially

37:37.560 --> 37:43.000
when it's such a different, you know, a change of mentality with how some of this is working.

37:43.000 --> 37:46.840
I think pushing the envelope in this area is really valuable. So thank you for doing

37:46.840 --> 37:48.680
the hard work. That's for sure.

37:48.680 --> 37:56.040
I want to ask you if there's anything you feel about purism that is either about its

37:56.040 --> 38:03.440
products or its culture or its values that you feel is at all sort of misrepresented

38:03.440 --> 38:10.000
or misunderstood in the wider either Linux community or in the public eye?

38:10.000 --> 38:14.000
I suppose one of the main things that I see and I've seen, I saw this from almost the

38:14.000 --> 38:20.060
very beginning before I even worked at Purism, was that this whole Linux community has been

38:20.060 --> 38:27.440
hurt so many times by companies that come in and say the right words but don't actually

38:27.440 --> 38:34.320
believe in the movement, who then take advantage of sort of the good nature and the efforts

38:34.320 --> 38:38.880
of the free software community without either contributing back or, you know, using it at

38:38.880 --> 38:42.040
the beginning and then sort of doing a bait and switch. I mean, you could argue a lot

38:42.040 --> 38:48.200
of open core projects are kind of this approach to of getting the free software community

38:48.200 --> 38:53.280
to provide initial free labor to build a product when they're in the seed round. And then once

38:53.280 --> 38:57.560
they have a proof of concept, they – a lot of these companies get Series A funding or

38:57.560 --> 39:01.680
Series B funding and then at that point, they hire up some of the top contributors and pay

39:01.680 --> 39:06.200
them to work on a proprietary product, you know, that they're going to sell and ultimately

39:06.200 --> 39:07.640
kind of abandon the original.

39:07.640 --> 39:11.680
So this has happened time and time again with the community and so that the community just

39:11.680 --> 39:17.780
really been hurt over and over again. Purism has gone to a lot of extremes to demonstrate

39:17.780 --> 39:22.460
that it believes what it says and going as far as incorporating as a social purpose corporation

39:22.460 --> 39:27.140
so the ethics are, you know, we're legally bound to the ethics. So an investor can't

39:27.140 --> 39:32.000
force us to abandon them for profit. But even with all of that, because the community has

39:32.000 --> 39:36.560
been hurt so many times, it's natural to conclude, well, this is a – Purism is yet

39:36.560 --> 39:41.200
another company that is saying the right words but doesn't actually believe it and they

39:41.200 --> 39:44.760
say things but they don't really want to follow through. They have all of the, you

39:44.760 --> 39:49.280
know, there's an assumption that pretty much every company has nefarious intentions. So

39:49.280 --> 39:54.200
I suppose the biggest thing to clear up if necessary is that, you know, I see this applied

39:54.200 --> 39:58.280
to Purism from the very beginning, like when Todd first said our goal is to make a laptop

39:58.280 --> 40:03.240
that for example has free software firmware. We want it to run core boot. We had people

40:03.240 --> 40:08.800
including some people that were like core boot developers at the time said you're lying.

40:08.800 --> 40:12.100
You have no intention of ever doing that. You will never do that. You're just saying

40:12.100 --> 40:17.300
it to sell laptops. Even after, you know, they put a job description out to hire a full-time

40:17.300 --> 40:20.780
core boot developer, they said the same stuff even after they hired the position and started

40:20.780 --> 40:25.680
working on it. Same sort of thing. I mean, the only thing that actually silenced that

40:25.680 --> 40:31.200
kind of critique was shipping a laptop that had core boot on, you know, shipping it.

40:31.200 --> 40:35.880
Exactly right. But I think in some ways you're always going to have those skeptics because

40:35.880 --> 40:40.640
it's some of this has never been done before. And so maybe it means you're headed in the

40:40.640 --> 40:41.640
right direction.

40:41.640 --> 40:45.080
I mean, yeah, I mean, it's all very difficult. You know, I mean, we're doing in some cases

40:45.080 --> 40:49.020
like we've run into similar things with the phone because we have these huge ambitions

40:49.020 --> 40:55.840
that are long term goals with the phone that are really difficult to do and incredibly

40:55.840 --> 40:59.360
challenging because in many cases that means we have to do everything from scratch because

40:59.360 --> 41:04.280
it's so different from what's out there. I mean, I've had conversations with many people

41:04.280 --> 41:10.220
on the subject over the years. And what I've discovered is ultimately the only thing that

41:10.220 --> 41:14.120
really silences critics, at least most of them, is doing the thing.

41:14.120 --> 41:18.240
I think it's going in amazing places. And I hope that it continues to go in amazing

41:18.240 --> 41:21.560
places. It seems like you have wonderful people working on all this stuff. So I'm sure some

41:21.560 --> 41:27.700
really amazing things will come out of it. One question I want to ask is whether you

41:27.700 --> 41:33.560
have an ask of the community or of listeners, something maybe you'd like them to see, go

41:33.560 --> 41:37.400
see something you'd like them to try or something you'd like them to think about.

41:37.400 --> 41:42.440
So I have something I want to say to two different sides of the community that are sort of both

41:42.440 --> 41:48.720
part of the overall Linux or free software community, which is, you know, what I've noticed

41:48.720 --> 41:54.200
and this is something I realized in my soul searching about Linux Journal was that what's

41:54.200 --> 41:59.680
happened is as technologies become more ubiquitous and everyone just sort of now grows up and

41:59.680 --> 42:04.480
is using computers. Well, that hasn't always been the case. And when it wasn't, people

42:04.480 --> 42:09.800
who were in the free software community were people to get that kind of knowledge to develop

42:09.800 --> 42:14.800
software to use computers. It was not very accessible. And so it attracted, well, it

42:14.800 --> 42:19.720
attracted nerds. I consider myself among them. You kind of had to be a nerd to be willing

42:19.720 --> 42:25.840
to spend the time isolated in front of a computer, learning all of this arcane knowledge to contribute

42:25.840 --> 42:31.800
to this community and to build software. Well, if you fast forward, you know, 20 years, 30

42:31.800 --> 42:36.400
years from that, the world's a completely different place and technology is ubiquitous.

42:36.400 --> 42:40.640
Computers are ubiquitous and programming is ubiquitous and very accessible. You don't

42:40.640 --> 42:46.320
have to spend years in a basement, you know, in front of a green and black screen to develop

42:46.320 --> 42:51.840
software anymore. It's very accessible. And as a result, as part of that, you have a way

42:51.840 --> 42:57.360
more diverse non-nerd group of people who have entered the technology realm, technology

42:57.360 --> 43:03.560
careers and the free software community as a byproduct of that. Well, it's created this

43:03.560 --> 43:11.280
culture clash. And so I liken it to these nerds who decided to throw a party and it's

43:11.280 --> 43:16.160
a Dungeons and Dragons party and they have this really great campaign and they're having

43:16.160 --> 43:22.280
a lot of fun and word gets out to everybody else that, hey, I heard this really great

43:22.280 --> 43:26.680
party is on such and such a street, this address. And then you have the rest of the school show

43:26.680 --> 43:31.220
up and like all of the jocks and all the everything else, everybody else shows up to this party

43:31.220 --> 43:37.360
and they're like, oh, wow, this party sucks. And they, you know, throw a kegger in the

43:37.360 --> 43:41.720
middle of this Dungeons and Dragons campaign. Right. And so I would say that that's sort

43:41.720 --> 43:47.260
of what's happened in our community now where we have completely diverse group in the free

43:47.260 --> 43:51.380
software community. So you have everything ranging from the traditional diehard, nerdy

43:51.380 --> 43:57.340
geeks like myself, and you have people that have average social skills and come from a

43:57.340 --> 44:01.560
completely different background. I mean, it wasn't that common 30 years ago for someone

44:01.560 --> 44:05.520
to say, well, yeah, I want you to go to business school, honey, and get your degree. And then

44:05.520 --> 44:10.280
I want you to be a tech entrepreneur. It was more like be a doctor or a lawyer or something.

44:10.280 --> 44:13.440
But now a lot of people are doing this. So you have a lot of people with MBAs. I mean,

44:13.440 --> 44:18.440
there's this whole notion of people being a brogrammer. They're crushing their code

44:18.440 --> 44:20.640
and crushing beer cans against their head and stuff.

44:20.640 --> 44:23.480
I've never heard that before. That's hilarious.

44:23.480 --> 44:29.280
I mean, can you imagine 30 years ago, someone doing that? It just wasn't the culture. So

44:29.280 --> 44:33.720
anyway, all that to say, we have this culture clash now. And what I want to say to both

44:33.720 --> 44:39.000
groups, I guess, is one is to recognize that everyone's in the same community, whether

44:39.000 --> 44:44.420
you're this old diehard geek that knows all of these original kind of truths about free

44:44.420 --> 44:50.820
software, or you're someone who's just come into the community more recently and who isn't

44:50.820 --> 44:56.080
aware of these things. One, both groups are part of the community. And number two, what

44:56.080 --> 45:04.560
I would say to the people who were the hardcore original members of this community is to guide

45:04.560 --> 45:09.200
the people who have just entered this community, teach them about the original ethics and the

45:09.200 --> 45:13.960
original things that you take for granted that you learned that they were never exposed

45:13.960 --> 45:17.000
to in a very understanding way.

45:17.000 --> 45:20.800
Sometimes I see people in the community use these sorts of things as almost like a litmus

45:20.800 --> 45:26.360
test, or are you geeky enough to be in this community, that sort of thing, which is pretty

45:26.360 --> 45:32.300
worthless in my mind. So I would beg people that have been for a while, use your knowledge

45:32.300 --> 45:38.640
of all these things beneficially to the community, to all the newcomers in it, to explain to

45:38.640 --> 45:42.840
them why all these values matter, make them relevant. The people who have just joined

45:42.840 --> 45:49.640
the community, I would ask them to please be patient with all of these hardcore old

45:49.640 --> 45:57.440
geeks who are still learning all of these new social rules that they're being exposed

45:57.440 --> 46:03.000
to now that this community is very diverse, people of all kinds of backgrounds. If you're

46:03.000 --> 46:09.080
new to the community and you're very extroverted, then you also take certain things for granted.

46:09.080 --> 46:15.480
Just like the hardcore geeks may take knowledge of the Four Freedoms for granted, people who

46:15.480 --> 46:20.240
are very extroverted may take for granted that it's easy to talk to other people, it's

46:20.240 --> 46:24.880
easy to have a conversation and not really understand that sort of thing. I guess the

46:24.880 --> 46:32.240
final thing is I would also go back to the original group and ask them to please try

46:32.240 --> 46:36.360
to be more open to learning these new social protocols. I see a lot of times flare ups

46:36.360 --> 46:41.440
in the community that really come down to certain people digging in their heels and

46:41.440 --> 46:45.560
saying, you know what, I don't want to know what new social rules are. I don't want to

46:45.560 --> 46:53.060
follow any sort of new protocol. I'm also incapable of doing it, which I don't buy because

46:53.060 --> 46:59.440
the same kind of person could recite verbatim the coming of age ceremony in Klingon and

46:59.440 --> 47:04.840
will get into a flame war about proper mailing list etiquette. God forbid you pop post on

47:04.840 --> 47:10.600
their mailing list. They memorize all of these very complex rules of social engagement. So

47:10.600 --> 47:16.920
having empathy and social skills for regular human beings is not beyond them. It's just

47:16.920 --> 47:18.120
a matter of putting in the effort.

47:18.120 --> 47:22.800
Yeah, I feel like the thing to remember there is that we're all chasing very similar goals

47:22.800 --> 47:28.320
and we just have to communicate a little bit and understand each other to get there together.

47:28.320 --> 47:35.760
And also the value in community managers. We've gotten to know a few here and they are

47:35.760 --> 47:42.680
golden. It's not a skill that was necessarily recognized early on in software development.

47:42.680 --> 47:45.040
But man, does it ever feel important these days?

47:45.040 --> 47:51.240
Yeah, more important than ever, because, you know, we finally realized that that contribution

47:51.240 --> 47:56.840
to a community isn't simply I wrote some code and submitted it. You know, there's all of

47:56.840 --> 48:01.480
these different ways the community needs contribution. You know, everything from that code is very

48:01.480 --> 48:08.000
useful, but also documentation, also solid bug reports. Also, I mean, there's 50 different

48:08.000 --> 48:12.160
levels of contribution in most of those areas we were lacking in, in a great way. We weren't

48:12.160 --> 48:14.000
necessarily lacking in the code.

48:14.000 --> 48:19.880
Well, Kyle, if people wanted to get connected with you to say hi, or otherwise share a little

48:19.880 --> 48:22.500
bit of social connection, where can they find you?

48:22.500 --> 48:27.960
If you are part of the Fediverse, you can reach me at Kyle at Libram.one. If you use

48:27.960 --> 48:32.120
like Mastodon or clients like that. And if you use something like Twitter, you can see

48:32.120 --> 48:39.720
me at Kyle Rankin with no space. And I also have a personal website that is at kylrank.in.

48:39.720 --> 48:45.720
Which I love. Kyle, thanks so much for your time. This was a lovely chat. I really enjoyed

48:45.720 --> 48:59.360
it and hope we get to chat soon again.
