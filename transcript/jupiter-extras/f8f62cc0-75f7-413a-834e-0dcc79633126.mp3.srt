00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,760
Hello, everyone. This is Brunch with Brent. I'm super happy to be joined here by Joe

2
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:15,760
Ressington. Joe, how are you doing?

3
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:20,080
Yeah, good. A bit tired, a bit hungover, but, you know, the usual.

4
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:25,440
Well, as we record, it's, you know, the holidays are just ending, and I know I've been trying

5
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:30,200
to somehow gather myself after all of that, so I imagine it's much the same on your end

6
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,200
of the pond.

7
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,800
Yeah, and I didn't really have that much time off because I had some pre-recorded shows

8
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:40,920
to do. I could do them in my own time, but I didn't have a full break, but I don't mind,

9
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:47,520
really. I tweeted about it, actually, that normally Christmas for me has been this great

10
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,840
time where I could have a couple of weeks off totally guilt-free, whereas this time

11
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:59,080
I just basically did what I normally do, which is more or less whatever I want, you know,

12
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:06,400
because I get paid to either play around with Linux or talk to people that I like about

13
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:12,560
it and have fun chatting and have interesting conversations, or I get to do a bit of the

14
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,380
pre-production and audio stuff, which is all the things that I love doing.

15
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,080
So why would you want a break, right?

16
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,080
Yeah, exactly.

17
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:23,760
I guess that's a nice segue. We should give some people a bit of maybe some context or

18
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:28,960
background for those who don't even know you that well. I guess if you had to introduce

19
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,960
yourself, what would you say to someone who, you know, this is their first time running

20
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,960
into you?

21
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:40,040
I'd say I'm a full-time podcaster, and the subject of those podcasts is generally IT

22
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:44,480
stuff, and then narrowed down a little bit further to Linux and open source.

23
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:50,880
Yeah, in terms of podcasts, I mean, you're involved with quite a few. I was looking at

24
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,480
OMG Ubuntu's, you know, Joey was talking about some New Year's resolutions, and in there,

25
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,800
I don't know if you saw it, but there was a list of podcasts that he was recommending,

26
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:05,440
and you were on like two of only a handful of them, or at least involved in them. He

27
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:12,880
mentioned late night Linux, which you've been co-hosting for quite a while now. Linux Unplugged,

28
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:18,200
you're deeply involved on the back end on that. So those were the two he mentioned.

29
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:24,080
And I guess also, in terms of Jupiter broadcasting, Linux Action News, co-hosting that with Chris

30
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,720
for what is that, like, two years now?

31
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,880
I think something like that. Yeah.

32
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:35,360
Yeah, it's, it's great. Choose Linux as well. You're there with Ellen Drew. User Error,

33
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,560
which is a lot of people's favorite show. I'm laughing because it's definitely mine.

34
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,320
Yeah, it's my favorite show of all the ones that I do, definitely.

35
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,600
Oh, really? Why is that?

36
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:48,880
I think because it's not all about Linux, it's something different. I do enjoy the Linux

37
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:53,720
shows, but just having a chance to talk about random stuff like family arguments and how

38
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:58,840
to deal with them is just a bit of fun and something different.

39
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:05,480
I think the thing I enjoy about it is that it's sort of Linux related in that, of course,

40
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:10,400
you guys are going to talk about Linux, since you're all deeply involved in it. And yet

41
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:16,960
it's a bunch of topics that, you know, all of us have to deal with in a day to day, day

42
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:24,080
to day fashion. And yet can relate even though it's not technology specific, necessarily,

43
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,480
some of the questions you guys are answering and topics you're discussing, and yet it just

44
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,960
comes across as deeply hilarious. So I really enjoy it.

45
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:35,720
Yeah. And what's also good is that some of the questions come from the audience. And

46
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:39,200
so they're just completely out of left field. And it's stuff that we've never thought about

47
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:44,560
before. But I also have the opportunity, well, all three of us do, to throw in our own questions.

48
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,000
So if there's something that we really want to talk about, we have that opportunity. So

49
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,760
it's a pretty good balance, I think. And it's really fun working with Dan and Poppy as well.

50
00:03:53,760 --> 00:04:00,240
They're both pretty funny guys. I often put a little bit of kind of off air banter at

51
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:08,320
the beginning. And the last one that we did, it was just completely out of context. And

52
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,240
hilarious to me, but no one else knew what it was about. It was something to do with

53
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:19,000
coins on a dance floor. And nobody wanted them back. So yeah, I won't spoil it on here.

54
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,960
But if anyone really, really wants to know, they can ask me on Telegram or something.

55
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,560
Yeah, that's sometimes some of the best parts are the stuff that happened, you know, just

56
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:32,560
before just after a show, right? That, you know, you throw the three of you into a room

57
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,800
and some magic's gonna happen. Each of you have a pretty great personality. So it's been

58
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,640
fun to hear the recorded stuff. That's for sure. Yeah, well, the key to it is that as

59
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:44,400
soon as we start talking, we make sure that if there's anything that we don't want recorded

60
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,240
that we need to discuss, we get that out of the way and then we just hit record. And then

61
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,200
just and see what happens. Yeah, just what we have the set questions and you know, the

62
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:58,440
intro and everything. But otherwise, we just record a bunch before and a bunch afterwards.

63
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:04,560
And we record for anything up to like an hour and 15 minutes, and then it gets cut down

64
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:11,920
to about 40 ish minutes. And I just look for something I just look in the waveforms for

65
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:17,680
the laughter. And okay, what was that? Oh, I remember that. Yeah, that was funny. Yeah,

66
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,720
let's put that at the beginning. Those are the anchor points, right? Yeah. It actually

67
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,080
now that you're you're talking a little bit about the process there, it reminds me a little

68
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:30,160
bit of how I approach this show, actually brunch with Brent, like you were mentioning

69
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,920
when we were talking just getting connected, you're like, it's so strange not to have any

70
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:40,240
show notes. Because you just, you know, part of I think the magic that sometimes happens

71
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,360
here is you just hit record and see where, you know, my brain connecting with your brain

72
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:50,160
takes us sometimes into unknown territory, right? Yeah, it is very strange to not have

73
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,440
a shower doc, I must say, but it's refreshing, refreshing. Okay, I'm glad you didn't say

74
00:05:54,440 --> 00:06:02,000
uncomfortable because that's not what we're after. But I guess I also need to mention

75
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,640
late late night Linux. That's something you've been co hosting for a while. Yeah, that's

76
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:12,040
something that evolved out of Linux Luddites. And it's funny that a lot of people assume

77
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:17,680
that it's part of Jupyter broadcasting, but it's just not at all. It's completely independent.

78
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,280
It's it's kind of how I attracted Chris's attention, I guess you might say, because

79
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:29,720
we started Linux Luddites about five or six years ago. And that ran for a couple of years.

80
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:35,080
My my brain's a bit foggy on history. But we did that for a few years. And then that

81
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:41,440
stopped and then immediately late night Linux came out of that. And then that has had two

82
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:47,800
incarnations. We had a kind of personnel change after about a year or so, I think. And then

83
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:53,200
the last couple of years, we've had the new crew, I think just over a year. I don't know.

84
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,160
Like I said, it all gets a bit foggy.

85
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:02,600
Late night Linux reminds me of user error in many ways, except that it's Linux related,

86
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:07,800
because it's just like the four of you sitting in a room. It's almost like you're at the

87
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,240
pub just kind of chatting about the topics. And yet there's this, at least I find there's

88
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:17,640
this deep insight in those conversations. So I've I've really appreciated it. It's another

89
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,640
good mix of personalities, I would say.

90
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:24,800
Oh, yeah, and experience as well. The three guys that I do that with all know loads about

91
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:30,640
Linux from kind of different angles. Will was the head of the Ubuntu desktop for a few

92
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:36,600
years. And you don't get to that position without being very knowledgeable. And he gained

93
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:41,640
a lot of experience with their fail him, who is lesser known, you might say, but he has

94
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:46,080
been a sys admin for 20 odd years. And so he really knows the stuff there. And then

95
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:52,160
Graham has been in Linux publishing for a because he was the editor of Linux format,

96
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:57,960
and then Linux voice. And they had their podcast go in for years. So he's got lots of experience

97
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:01,360
as well. And I think that it really does just gel the four of us.

98
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,240
Yeah, well, you're all coming at like, from different angles of Linux all into, you know,

99
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,840
it's all intersecting in a really nice way. How did the four of you ever get connected?

100
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:16,480
Like it? It feels to me like, certainly, you've got a lot of pretty deep connections in the

101
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,840
Linux community. But how about the four of you specifically?

102
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:27,440
Well, I knew Graham from just events and things really, and the fact that he was doing, it's

103
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:32,160
had so many different names, I think it was called tux radar at first, and then then it

104
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:36,240
was Linux lifestyle for a couple of weeks. And then it was Linux voice, and then bug

105
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:43,040
report before it kind of fizzled out. And I just knew him from the scene, I suppose.

106
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:48,920
And it just seemed like an obvious person to us because he had been the person doing

107
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:52,560
the audio and stuff for them. And he knew really knew quite a lot about podcasting.

108
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:59,000
And he was the driving force behind that podcast. And so he seemed obvious. And Will, I'd heard

109
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,520
interviewed on the Ubuntu podcast, and he seemed like just a good personality. And so

110
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:09,720
I just got in touch with him. I can't remember, it must have been through Wimpy and Poppy,

111
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:15,520
and got in touch with him and asked him, did he want to do it? And he said yes. And so

112
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:24,520
the rest is history, I suppose. And Phelan had met at odd camp, I think. And what stuck

113
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:29,400
out to me there was that he runs Android with no Google Apps. And so we got him on Linux

114
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:33,880
loadouts to talk about that. And I thought he did really, really well, and came across

115
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:41,360
as this funny guy that he is and really knowledgeable. And so when it came to changing the personnel

116
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,400
the first time, he just seemed like an obvious choice.

117
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:49,560
Yeah, well, there's some magic in that combination. So obviously, it was pretty serendipitous

118
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:57,480
to bring it all together. So kudos to you guys. You mentioned odd camp. I listened recently

119
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:06,180
to the panel that is in the Jupiter extras of the most recent odd camp, where you sort

120
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:10,800
of moderated a discussion that went in many directions that were super fascinating. So

121
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:16,320
I would definitely recommend some people check that out. But do you have a closer connection

122
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,720
with odd camp? It feels like I don't know, maybe it's close to your heart or something.

123
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:27,640
Well, yeah, I've been going since I think, 2011. So nearly, I think, yeah, I went to

124
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:32,880
the second or third one. Again, history is not my strong point.

125
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,880
Yeah, me neither, actually.

126
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:41,880
But I've been going to it for many years, and I've only missed one or two for just clashes

127
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:47,940
with other stuff I had to do. And I'm on the organizers mailing list, but I never really

128
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:57,320
do anything. I'm not an organizer. I kind of took over the panel, I think, three or

129
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:03,980
four years ago. And because no one really wants to take on the organization of that,

130
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:07,720
they just said, yeah, okay, and let me do it the first time. It wasn't great the first

131
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:13,260
time I did it, to be honest, because it turns out that moderating a panel is not like hosting

132
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:18,160
a podcast because when you're hosting a podcast, you're giving a lot of your own opinions.

133
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,080
And it's a conversation, whereas a panel is not supposed to be that if you're moderating

134
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:26,400
it. You're supposed to allow everyone their chance to speak, but not have too much of

135
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:30,920
your own input. And so I did that completely wrong. Got some feedback about that.

136
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,960
What a tricky balance, right?

137
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:38,920
It's very difficult to do. It's far more difficult than it looks. And I'm still not that good

138
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:44,600
at it. And that's why I want to do it because I love doing live stuff. I always have my

139
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:52,160
background as a musician, which we may get into a bit later. And so I really love doing

140
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:57,240
live shows. It was really daunting the first time because even though I've done a bit of

141
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:05,400
stand up, and I say a bit, like three or four times, and I've been on stage in various guises

142
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:09,920
in bands drumming and playing guitar and singing and stuff. But the first time I did the old

143
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:15,280
camp panel, it was so daunting because it was during the day, everyone was sober, lights

144
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:20,720
were bright, and it was a completely different experience for me. And so I was really nervous.

145
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:26,080
But it kind of went all right. But I wanted to just get better at it because it was just

146
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:32,840
this new challenge for me. And so I think I've been slowly but surely every year getting

147
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:36,640
a little bit better at it. And I think this one went pretty well.

148
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:42,600
The reason I asked was that it felt like certainly you had done it for more than once. And you

149
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:46,960
just said for a few years there. But at the same time, the thing I appreciated was that

150
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:52,160
you were aware of your involvement. And at one point, you mentioned, Okay, I'm not supposed

151
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,640
to do this. But here's my opinion.

152
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,920
I just couldn't resist at one point.

153
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:01,520
But at least you're aware of it. So that's good. But yeah, that's, it's so interesting

154
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:07,320
to me when, you know, you're, you're taking a skill that is curious to you, but you're

155
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:11,640
not really that maybe that great at and you just keep persevering with it. I think that

156
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:16,200
is really valuable. And it sounds like you've gotten a lot of it out of it. Do you think

157
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,680
it's helped you in the podcast realm, even though it's a little bit different?

158
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:24,880
I think so. Yeah, it's it's helped me ask more questions, I think, when I'm hosting

159
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:30,520
late like Linux, I try not to give too much of my own opinion, and try and just throw

160
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:35,200
it to the guys and ask them what they think about stuff. And that is, I think come from

161
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,420
what has been influenced by doing these panels. Definitely.

162
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:43,560
One thing I've noticed is sometimes you get the best information out of people by just

163
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:48,040
not saying a single thing, right? If you just let them go on and go on and go on, they'll

164
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,360
eventually get somewhere interesting that they've never been before.

165
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,800
Yeah, especially if you're editing it yourself. And you know, you can edit out any of the

166
00:13:53,800 --> 00:14:00,240
boring stuff. Because that's what I am, you know, primarily an editor. And somehow I've

167
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,560
managed to trick everyone into thinking that I'm reasonably good at podcasting, just by

168
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:09,640
the fact that I know that I can edit stuff. And I can edit out whenever I say anything

169
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:15,640
stupid. And whenever I have huge pauses to think about stuff or trip over my words or

170
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:22,280
whatever, I know I can edit it. And a good edit, you should never hear, you should never

171
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:26,440
notice. So I will probably end up editing this. And you should hopefully not notice

172
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:30,720
any of the edits that have taken place in it. I don't think there'll be that many, because

173
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:36,560
this is kind of more of a free flowing conversation. But something like Linux Action News, where

174
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:41,340
we kind of stop to look stuff up sometimes, and we make sure that we try and say things

175
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:48,160
in a proper way. That requires quite a lot of editing, but hopefully no one notices.

176
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:53,760
Yeah, it's similar to your moderating that obcant panel is that if you're, if you're

177
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:59,680
doing that task really well, no one will even notice that it's happening, right? There are

178
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:07,520
a few professions like that. And I think they're important still to be mindful of and to congratulate

179
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:11,760
because it's like, that it's not noticeable is a complete success.

180
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,920
Yeah, well, it goes back to being a drummer, which I was for many years. If people notice

181
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,200
the drummer, then you've done something wrong as far as I'm concerned. And this is, you

182
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:23,140
know, you might notice them in flashes of, you know, a little bit here and there. But

183
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:27,200
generally speaking, the drummer is not there to attract attention. The drummer is there

184
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:32,440
to lock in with the bass player and be the backline and the rhythm section and allow

185
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:36,200
the singer and guitarist to shine or whoever's upfront.

186
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:41,520
That is so fascinating. I never really. So I tend to lean towards drumming when I enjoy

187
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:47,400
songs. It's a goal of mine to get into it because I'm always tapping on stuff. So maybe

188
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:52,640
I'll reach out to you for some tips there. But it's interesting to me that intersection

189
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:58,760
between music and some of the podcasting and editing that you're doing. The chat I did

190
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:04,860
with Catherine, she's deeply into music as well. And she had some really neat intersections

191
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:11,680
between coding and music, some of the patterns and pattern recognitions and stuff like that.

192
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:18,100
But I actually had no idea that you were well, you're a multi instrumentalist, I would say.

193
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:24,120
But the drumming was was a new thing to me. So super curious to me to hear that.

194
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,720
One thing about it that I should have mentioned is that I'm talking about kind of standard

195
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:33,940
rock and pop type music. If you're talking about metal or jazz, then it kind of doesn't

196
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:38,520
necessarily count that if you notice the drummer, like Mastodon, for example, that's all about

197
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:44,680
Brand doing his ridiculous drum fills all the time, whatever. But I'm talking more the

198
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:48,440
kind of music that I used to do. So I need to caveat that because people might be disagreeing

199
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,440
with me there.

200
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:54,760
Well, I think there's an exception to any, any of those style of rules, right? Can you

201
00:16:54,760 --> 00:17:01,080
give us a tiny bit of a bigger taste of some of the music you might have been doing previously?

202
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:06,400
Well, I would just say it's this is like that follow up tweet to a viral one, check out

203
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:14,360
my soundcloud because there's that represents a fair kind of spread of the music that I

204
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:21,680
had done with some electronic stuff, kind of hip hop, more dance type music, and then

205
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:29,660
some kind of rocky towards the harder end of rock kind of but I always kind of ended

206
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:34,480
up being pulled into melodic poppy stuff. I don't I don't know why really, even though

207
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:42,500
I listened to a lot more. Well, a lot less poppy stuff, I just tend to prefer a nice

208
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,840
melody and harmony if possible.

209
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:48,160
Interesting that the stuff you listen to is different than the stuff you you lean towards

210
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,160
creating?

211
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:53,880
Well, not not completely. But I'd listen to I've never understood how anyone can say what

212
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:59,100
kind of music they like and say I like metal or I like country or I like reggae, whatever.

213
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:03,700
That doesn't make sense to me. I like good music and it doesn't matter who is doing that,

214
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:08,000
whether that is Mastodon or Taylor Swift. If it's good music, then I'm listening to

215
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
it.

216
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
You are a big Taylor Swift fan I've learned.

217
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,100
I really am. I mean, I don't have albums or anything like that. But I really admire her

218
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:21,720
I think is the bottom line because she has just kind of just done whatever she wants

219
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:30,800
really and made herself this huge success by just doing what she wants. And not really.

220
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:35,400
Maybe she is taking influence from managers or whatever, but she just seems to be in control

221
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,760
of everything. And I really admire that.

222
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:43,040
I don't know her very well. But I because of you actually decided to check out her NPR

223
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:50,280
Tiny Desk concert and it just felt she just felt really genuine. Yeah, and full of heart

224
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:53,760
as well. And those two combined is pretty powerful stuff.

225
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,480
Yeah. And some of the songs she writes, I would say it's a bit hit and miss. I'm not

226
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:01,600
going to say everything she writes is brilliant, but she does have a knack for sometimes writing

227
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:07,080
really catchy tunes that might be only two or three chords. And that you need to calm

228
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:12,960
down song is literally two chords, the whole song. And yet it was a massive success for

229
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,960
her.

230
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,600
Sometimes simplicity is the best thing, right?

231
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,600
Exactly.

232
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:22,680
And talent as well. Sometimes it takes talent to make something look simple. I know that's

233
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:27,400
certainly true in photography, some of the stuff that I do, but even, you know, I'm getting

234
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:34,960
more of an insight into what it takes to make a podcast. And there's a lot of brilliance

235
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,240
that goes into the back end of stuff. And it looks simple from the outside, but that's

236
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:45,960
not always true. I'm curious about your like, does music have an influence? Well, let me

237
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:52,440
back up a little bit. I'm just broadly assuming that you were editing your own music creations.

238
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,440
Is that a safe assumption?

239
00:19:53,440 --> 00:20:00,200
Yeah, well, that's kind of how I got into computers generally, really. I'd always played,

240
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:06,000
ever since I was a little kid, I'd been musical. Not like Katherine, though. It's funny that

241
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:12,180
she is properly musical, reading music and everything. I've always been the kind of person

242
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:18,840
who plays by ear. And although I can roughly read music, I never do. So I don't have that

243
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:25,960
mathematical approach to it. I'm really playing by feel. But just wanting to play and record

244
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:31,320
music is what got me into computers. Because I had originally been playing with a four

245
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:37,440
track, which I've actually still got, I think, which uses a tape, just an audio cassette.

246
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:43,160
And you could record one thing and then dub another one over it and then mix it a little

247
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:48,400
bit. But then, when I wanted to start making something that had a bit more of an electronic

248
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:53,240
feel, that's when I started to get into computers. And I made friends with someone who was making,

249
00:20:53,240 --> 00:21:00,200
well, he was making dubstep before dubstep was even a thing really, really, really early

250
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:07,800
on. And he kind of taught me how to do the basics. And because I've been so busy playing

251
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:13,880
music in bands and everything, I hadn't really learned much about computers. And then I got

252
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:21,740
my first one when I was 19. And because I was too poor to get a Mac, it was Windows.

253
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:25,360
And because it was Windows, it broke all the time. And I was forced to learn how to fix

254
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:30,440
it. And I have that kind of inquiring mind of wanting to know how things work. And so

255
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:36,320
I got used to reinstalling Windows and learned about all the drivers situation and partitioning.

256
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:41,700
And this was back when it was IDE hard drives, and you had to get the jumpers right for master

257
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:48,680
and slave and all that kind of stuff. And that, in turn, led me into Linux because I

258
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:52,560
wanted to get the most performance that I possibly could out of these machines. Well,

259
00:21:52,560 --> 00:22:00,520
my one desktop computer that was, it was old and rubbish even by the standards of the time.

260
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:06,960
And that led me into wanting to get more performance out of it, which led me to discovering nLite,

261
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,920
which is the thing that you can configure Windows ISOs with. And you can use that to

262
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:15,920
strip out all the security stuff, which makes it run much more quickly. But it's obviously

263
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:21,560
very insecure. And so I then wanted to find a way to have a secure operating system that

264
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:26,200
was also lightweight. And in comes Linux and the rest is history.

265
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:30,200
Did someone suggest it to you? Or did you come across it on the web? Or how did it first

266
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,920
come in, you know, in front of you?

267
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:36,560
Well, my brother had introduced me to it, and he'd given me some Mandrake CDs or Mandrake

268
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:44,280
or something. And I just never bothered installing them. And then when I wanted to get into Linux

269
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:49,580
again, I think I must have researched it a little bit. And Ubuntu was fairly new-ish

270
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:56,680
back then. This was kind of 2007, I think. And I just heard that Ubuntu was where it's

271
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:02,280
at. And I was so impressed. The thing that grabbed me instantly was that I downloaded

272
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:07,520
this file, burnt it onto a CD, rebooted my computer, booted from that CD, and I had an

273
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:12,520
operating system that was there and running. And then I could just reboot my computer and

274
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:19,520
go back to Windows. That was just such a revelation to me because the process of installing Windows

275
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:25,480
to this day to be quite lengthy. And this, it was just this mind-blowing revelation.

276
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,240
And I was just hooked straight away, I think.

277
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,000
There's just something about it that grabbed you, right?

278
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Yeah.

279
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,480
And it sounds like it's still grabbing you.

280
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:37,960
Yeah. And at the time, I had this P4, three gigahertz, whatever processor with 512 megabytes

281
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:45,360
of RAM. And GNOME 2, it ran well, but I just thought, hmm, I wonder if there's something

282
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,080
a little bit faster than this.

283
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,080
And I know where this is going.

284
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:54,800
Yeah. And then I discovered XFCE and then tried a bunch of other stuff as well and Openbox

285
00:23:54,800 --> 00:24:02,080
and everything. And although there are faster and lighter desktops than XFCE, for me, it

286
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:06,520
was then and here we are 10 years later, it hasn't really changed much. It is the perfect

287
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:10,280
balance for me between features and weight.

288
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:17,800
And I've tried everything that you name a desktop, I have tried it, but I always come

289
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:21,200
back to XFCE. And that's what I'm staring at right now.

290
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:26,360
I think that's very similar to my history, actually, I would say I discovered Linux a

291
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:31,000
little later than you. But I went through a similar trajectory of just trying a whole

292
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,400
bunch of desktops. Because I didn't really know, you know, I kind of knew what the standards

293
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:42,240
were at the time. And it was, you know, GNOME 2, or it might have been three at the time.

294
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:47,680
And I also was using some older hardware, and I landed on XFCE. And it was the first

295
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:53,760
sort of desktop that I stayed with for multiple years. And it was amazing, even back then,

296
00:24:53,760 --> 00:25:00,320
you know, it wasn't perfect, and nothing is. So I am right there with you. I know it's

297
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,960
kind of a funny joke now that everybody says that you're, you know, so in love with XFCE.

298
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:09,760
But there, there are some pretty good reasons, some, some deep reasons for that kind of stuff.

299
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,400
And so I'm right there behind you.

300
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,000
Yeah, I do like plasma as well. I think that's a great desktop. That's what you use. I was

301
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,500
listening to you earlier today talking to Rocco on Linux spotlight. I'm only halfway

302
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:27,640
through it, because it's two hours long, right? Sorry. It's okay. But you talking about plasma

303
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:36,680
on there. That is a great desktop. There's no doubt in my mind. And LXQ is great. Marte

304
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:43,680
is great. And I always say the one thing I love more than XFCE is choice. And if you

305
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:49,000
like GNOME, I personally cannot stand GNOME. It has improved significantly. But I just

306
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,440
can't get on with it. But I know that a bunch of people love it. And that's great. You know,

307
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:59,080
crack on. Excellent. I'm happy for you. And you know, you'd be happy for me running XFCE

308
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,520
and we'll all be happy together.

309
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:05,400
Yeah, that's, that's definitely the best part is everybody has a different preference. And

310
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:10,920
we've got so many desktops for everyone. So that's like the land of choice. We've, we've

311
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:18,160
got it right. So we're really fortunate in that, for sure. Can we just go back to music

312
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:26,680
for a little bit? So it might be true that you had that the theme song for Brunch with

313
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:33,240
Brent came from your fingers and from your mind and your heart. Can you give us a little,

314
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:36,800
you know, I feel honored that it's at the start and the end of these crazy conversations

315
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:41,880
that I have. But you mentioned that there might be a tiny bit of a story there.

316
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:50,200
Yeah, well, it came from my desire to eat Thai food. Because so it's a riff. It's a

317
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:56,280
very basic thing. It's just a couple of jazzy ish chords. And it's something that I've been

318
00:26:56,280 --> 00:27:05,600
playing around with about 20 years ago, with a band that I was in. And then, I think this

319
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:12,000
must have been three or four years ago, maybe a bit longer. My friend who does post production

320
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:21,000
sound for TV, adverts, movies, that sort of thing. He texted me or called me on a Sunday

321
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,720
and said, I need some music for a short film that I'm doing tomorrow. It only has to be

322
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:33,720
short. And it's for hold music for someone holding on the phone. And I need something

323
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:38,760
sort of jazzy and cheesy. And I was like, Oh, man, I've got to do the next Action News

324
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:43,320
later. And I was preparing for that. And I really didn't have time. He said, Well, I'll

325
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:51,120
buy you Thai Cottage, which was a really nice restaurant in on Darbly Street in London,

326
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:55,960
sadly no longer there. That's a funny story, actually, I don't want to get off on too many

327
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:01,120
tangents. But one day, it was sold to someone and it kind of continued. And then apparently

328
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:06,440
one day, they just disappeared with no notice or anything. They just disappeared. And there

329
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:11,600
was lots of speculation about what happened. And it was just there one day, and then just

330
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:17,160
literally gone the next. So that was a real shame, because he used to love going there.

331
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:23,040
But anyway, so I only had about an hour to do this. And so I just quickly programmed

332
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:29,000
the bottom of the beat, and then the baseline, which is really simple, and then put an electric

333
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:35,200
piano type thing down. And then played the riff. And I think I did it in I think I did

334
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:40,760
that guitar riff in one take, but I'm not sure I may have done two. But yeah, just smashed

335
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:45,920
it out made it a perfect loop so that he could use it for as long as he wanted, sent it off

336
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:50,160
to him. And he said, Yeah, that's perfect. That's exactly what I wanted. And then a week

337
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:55,040
or so later, ran out for my Thai meal, and even bought me some cider, I think with it

338
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,880
as well, which is it was extra delicious.

339
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:03,160
Well, I have a deep love for Thai food as well. It might be one of my number one go

340
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,160
tos.

341
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:07,680
I'm surprised with you being vegetarian because there's do you fish?

342
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:13,400
You know, I try to be a pregnant because I have a few allergies, as you know, and I try

343
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:19,400
to be as pragmatic as possible, especially around the vegan stuff. Because I would say

344
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:25,680
the vegan option is more of a preference. So I try not to be sort of very caught up

345
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:29,600
on it. But a lot of Thai restaurants I've been to will give you the option, actually,

346
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:33,600
they'll take some of the fish sauce out and stuff like that.

347
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,600
Interesting.

348
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,640
You sometimes you just have to ask. Yeah. So yeah, Thai food is definitely my number

349
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:43,160
one go to and I'm always I can, you know, the airports that have Thai food in them tend

350
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:46,680
to be my favorite ones for layovers. That's for sure. So I can tell you exactly which

351
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:49,560
ones have it and where to where to go to find it.

352
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:55,480
Oh, I would not eat Thai food from a from an airport. I might go to his pizza generally

353
00:29:55,480 --> 00:30:00,880
when I'm traveling pizza because it's very hard to get food poisoning from pizza because

354
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:07,640
it goes in a really hot oven. And this well, I mean, obviously is possible to get it. But

355
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:12,080
I think if you're going into the realms of Thai food and stuff, that's where you could

356
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:15,560
easily get food. And that is the last thing you want when you're traveling.

357
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:19,700
You know, that's really logical. I would say for sure the hot oven temperatures that makes

358
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:27,520
a lot of sense. You and I, you and I recently at the JB sprint actually in the late summer,

359
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:32,000
went for a few walks to get some pizza, which was fun.

360
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,920
It's just my go to because pizza generally, it's going to vary in quality, but even rubbish

361
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:43,160
pizza is better than no pizza. And it's, you know, you're gonna get it wherever you go.

362
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:46,800
And so just when I'm traveling, that's my go to I don't really eat that much of it while

363
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:52,080
I'm at home. But I just know that it's something I can rely on no matter where I am in the

364
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,080
world pretty much.

365
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,080
Yeah, you'll find it anywhere, right?

366
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:58,120
Yeah. And the thing is, I can eat it every day as well, because it's so delicious. Even

367
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:05,920
terrible pizza, I find delicious. The worst pizza I had was at Sea-Tac. And I think that

368
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:11,320
it speaks volumes that I was there twice last year, and I had a pizza twice last year at

369
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,320
Sea-Tac.

370
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:19,480
Yeah, I you know, because some of my allergies, I've got a gluten and a dairy allergy. Pizza

371
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:24,320
would otherwise be my go to because I absolutely love it as well. And there are a few really

372
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:28,760
amazing gluten free pizzas, but they are tough to find. Yeah, they're super tough to track

373
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:31,520
that down rather than just an airport.

374
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:36,920
Yeah, those those I have a text file for the ones I record where to find gluten free pizza

375
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:43,440
worthwhile, because most of it isn't. There's a moment actually, when you and I first met

376
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:48,800
that I will always forever stick in my mind. And I don't know if it will for you. Because,

377
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,240
you know, when two people experience something, it's a little bit different. But you and I

378
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:56,680
first met, we had the chance to meet at Linux fest, the last Linux fest that happened this

379
00:31:56,680 --> 00:32:02,080
past year. And I guess you had probably at that point been hearing my voice quite a bit,

380
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:07,580
because you were editing Linux unplugged for quite a while. But I specifically remember

381
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:12,080
when we landed at the JB studio, and you and I are in the same room, we kind of looked

382
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:15,960
at each other. And we were meeting a bunch of people and said, Hey, I'm Joe. And I said,

383
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:21,960
Hi, I'm Brent. And I remember specifically what you said, you said, Oh, you're not quite

384
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:26,640
what I expected. And I said, Well, you're not quite what I expected either.

385
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:31,840
Yeah, it's weird. You kind of have a mental image of people whose voice you hear all the

386
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:35,800
time, and then you meet them. And a lot of people say that to me, they don't think that

387
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:41,560
I'm going to look like this man mountain.

388
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:46,880
I guess we have to do that as humans, you know, draw images in our minds of the things

389
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:51,720
that we're imagining. You know, because we're only using one sense our ears to try to get

390
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:56,440
this a sense of this person. But that moment, it's just hilarious to me. And it kind of

391
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:02,560
set the scene for for the rest of the time and has taken us to now and I feel like you

392
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:06,440
and I joke about quite a lot of really ridiculous things. And that kind of set the stage. So

393
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,920
I like that quite a bit.

394
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:11,800
Yeah, we probably shouldn't mention too much about our last physical encounter when you

395
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:16,960
drove me to the airport. When I'd basically been up all night drinking and stressed because

396
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,920
I thought I'd lost my passport. And then it turned out to be just in a pair of trousers

397
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:27,320
that I'd set aside. That was tearing that hotel room apart was not fun. I tell you.

398
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:34,280
It made at least for me a really good story. And gave us lots to talk about on the way

399
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:41,720
to the airport. I think I started to sober up during that car ride down there.

400
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:46,520
That was during the JB sprint. And and was it true that you hadn't met? Oh, I guess it

401
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:51,640
was at Linux fest that you hadn't met Chris yet until that Linux fest, right? And you

402
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:55,800
guys have been? Had you been doing Linux action news for quite a while?

403
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:59,360
Yeah, we've been doing it for nearly a year.

404
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:03,040
It's like six months or something like that, if I remember. Yeah.

405
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:09,120
And I would kind of known each other a bit before then, as well. So yeah, it was weird

406
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:18,660
to meet him. And it was the first transatlantic flight that I had done for 20 years, maybe,

407
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:24,080
maybe more than that. 25 since I was a little kid. I've traveled around Europe and stuff,

408
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:29,400
but it's been a long time, or it had been a long time since I'd done long haul. And

409
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:33,480
I got off that plane and I was just like a zombie. And it was just really weird meeting

410
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:40,840
everyone and just sitting around in this, like wings bar or something, or a sports bar.

411
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:45,560
And it was just quite surreal, really. Once I had a good night's sleep, I was fine after

412
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:50,920
that. But yeah, that was weird. And then the second time I went for the sprint, I was much

413
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:55,920
more used to the long flight. And it wasn't really anywhere near as bad. But that first

414
00:34:55,920 --> 00:35:01,400
one, that first night there, I remember meeting Alan, her saying to me, man, you look like

415
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,960
a zombie. And I was like, I feel like one.

416
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:12,360
Oh, man. Yeah, I'm lucky enough that I don't have to travel quite as far. But that leads

417
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:19,080
me, I guess, to a curiosity. How did you ever first get connected with JB and the network?

418
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:23,360
That's a good question. Because the first podcast I ever listened to was the Linux Action

419
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:26,440
Show. Not the Linux podcast, but the first podcast.

420
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,440
Oh, wow.

421
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:31,440
There was this thing called Groove Shark. I don't remember it. It was like free Spotify.

422
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,960
I use Groove Shark.

423
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:38,120
Yeah. And I had no idea why they got away with it and how they got away with it for

424
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:44,400
so long. And eventually they got shut down. But I was listening to a lot of audio books

425
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:49,680
at the time. And just getting into Linux, I suppose, and just type Linux in randomly

426
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:55,600
and then, oh, what's this Linux Action Show? And then I worked out how to do the RSS feed

427
00:35:55,600 --> 00:36:00,800
and everything. And I think it was just when they were doing the Computer Action Show for

428
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:04,920
a bit. They kind of tried that for a season and that didn't really go that well, I don't

429
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:08,320
think. And so they went back to the Linux Action Show. And it was around then that I

430
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:14,080
started listening. Yeah, then listened to a few JB shows and discovered Linux Outlaws

431
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:19,560
and listened for a while. And then I kind of drifted away because there's so many Linux

432
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:26,240
and I didn't have as much time to listen to stuff. And then I was concentrating on doing

433
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:34,200
my own stuff. And then went on Linux Unplugged a little bit because my wife was away and

434
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:38,260
so I could stay up late because she normally goes to bed around the time that LUP used

435
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:42,920
to record. And so it was very difficult for me to go on there, but she was away. And so

436
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:47,300
I went on and talked to Chris and that was around the time he was thinking about killing

437
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:52,840
Linux Action Show and that he was thinking about doing this new show. And he actually

438
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:58,920
asked someone else before me to do Linux Action News. I won't tell you who it is on air, but

439
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:03,160
there is a person that I believe has been on Brunch with Brent, put it that way. But

440
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:08,180
that person did not have time to do it. And Chris swears that he only asked that person

441
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:13,760
to be polite, but I know he would have preferred that person to me. But anyway, that person

442
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:18,280
recommended me knowing that I was looking to do more podcasts at the time. And then

443
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:24,920
Chris and I connected and spoke for a couple of times actually for quite a long time, like

444
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:28,300
over an hour, kind of thrashing out what we were going to do and whether it was going

445
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:35,760
to be video and just eventually settled on not doing it live, it being audio only and

446
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,800
focus on editing it properly.

447
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,000
All good decisions, right?

448
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:47,400
Well, I mean, that's what I went into it wanting. But I think that's what he ultimately wanted.

449
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:53,480
He's spoken about how video, it was kind of all geared up towards video at one point due

450
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:58,840
to broadcasting, but then he was kind of wanting to go more in the audio direction and focus

451
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:05,920
on that. Because if you're focusing on video, it's very difficult to serve both audiences

452
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:09,960
because you inevitably end up talking about things that are on the screen or you have

453
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:14,480
visual jokes and stuff like that. And it means that the audio suffers as a result and the

454
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:19,720
quality can suffer as well. So it was the direction that he wanted to go. It was the

455
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:27,480
direction that I had been going and we kind of just aligned for that. And then when the

456
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:36,520
Linux Academy acquisition merger thing happened, Chris took me on. And that was about 18 months

457
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:42,720
ago because I got hired actually. I was the first to be hired because it's weird. Like

458
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:47,040
I'm really badly organized. If you looked at my desk now, you'd just laugh at how terribly

459
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:52,160
organized it is. But with some things, I'm really on it. And when it comes to that, it

460
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:56,400
was like, right, let's make this happen. Let's have the contract. Let me read through it.

461
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:01,400
Let's get it signed. And so I was the first of everyone to come on board. And at first,

462
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:06,640
the first week or two, I didn't have all that much to do because things were still ramping

463
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:12,080
up and everything. And so it was a bit weird, but it didn't take long before suddenly I

464
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:17,800
was very busy once user error got going and especially then once Choose Linux got going.

465
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:25,160
And so I'm now very, very busy with it. I basically work seven days a week, but not

466
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:31,160
a full day every day, if you know what I mean. Well, does reading RSS feeds and news counters

467
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:35,560
work? I guess it kind of does now. It's what I would probably be doing anyway, but I do

468
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,360
at least a bit of that every day.

469
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:42,920
It's almost like a lifestyle more so than a job or anything like that. You described

470
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:51,080
earlier how you were kind of doing these things anyways. And so to have someone who's willing

471
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:56,260
to bring you on and that's like getting paid for the things you're interested in previously

472
00:39:56,260 --> 00:40:00,920
and kind of diving into on your own time anyway. So it's kind of a sweet little spot to be

473
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:03,600
in, I would say in many ways.

474
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:09,280
So Joe, if you wanted to ask something of the community, maybe something you'd like

475
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:15,600
them to do or think about, try, go and see. Is there something you would throw out there

476
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,600
for them?

477
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:24,080
One of the things, don't click on clickbait articles and videos and listicles and stuff.

478
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:31,120
If it looks like clickbait, we have to vote with our mice and whatever it is that you

479
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:36,120
click the clickbait with. The only way that it will ever go away is if people stop clicking

480
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:41,760
on it. Now that is just a dream that will probably never, ever come true. But just stop

481
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:46,680
doing that, especially in Linux content and stuff. And it's somewhat related to that.

482
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:53,400
I want people to think more critically. I want people to kind of look at what is being

483
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:59,720
said or what's happening and really think about it. Don't just take what some person's

484
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:06,960
opinion is. If it's my opinion, don't just accept it. Think about why I'm saying it and

485
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:12,360
do some research. You can't always do that, obviously, the research stuff, but you can

486
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:17,040
at least think critically about why I'm saying what I'm saying.

487
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:25,280
A prime example of this is the Microsoft situation. Microsoft, over the last, well, I don't know,

488
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:30,080
five, 10 years, have become more and more involved with Linux and open source. Some

489
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:37,440
people say M$ and are really resistant to them and think that anyone who says anything

490
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:43,520
positive about them must be a shill or whatever, and there must be some motivation behind it.

491
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:51,120
Whereas I find myself reporting the fact that Microsoft has been doing WSL and freeing up

492
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:55,680
the ex fat patents and everything. And I asked myself, why are they doing that? Well, they're

493
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:59,920
doing that to make more money because there is money to be made in Linux, especially with

494
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:05,600
Azure. Driving people towards Azure is a real moneymaker for them, and they want developers

495
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:12,320
and users to be using that. And it's just such an obvious thing to me. And when you

496
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:18,840
see people, it's a very small minority of people saying things like people are shilling

497
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:27,280
and stuff about that. Hayden Barnes, who works for Canonical now on the WSL stuff, he posted

498
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:34,360
recently about some of the backlash and flack that he'd had from people calling him a shill

499
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:42,680
and everything. And that really made me think about it. But also, just when people are asking

500
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:48,240
for money for something, think critically about it. And I'm not going to name any names,

501
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:55,320
but there are some obvious examples of this, that people are asking for money and not necessarily

502
00:42:55,320 --> 00:43:00,800
delivering on that. And look at people's track records or companies' track records on what

503
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:08,040
they have delivered before making that decision to give them money, or give them time and

504
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:13,900
talk about them. Just think more critically, try not to be as forgiving, because that's

505
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:18,320
something that people who are involved with Linux and open source tend to be, at least

506
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:26,880
desktop Linux, is very forgiving of what otherwise they wouldn't forgive in other areas of life.

507
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:35,200
So yeah, think critically, don't click clickbait links and videos, and consider people's motivations.

508
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:43,620
Yeah, I feel like that is a skill set. And, you know, part of what I really enjoy about,

509
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:51,640
for instance, Linux Action News is sort of your insights there and your critical thinking

510
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:55,440
on some of the news. You know, it's easy to just throw out the news on a blog post or

511
00:43:55,440 --> 00:44:01,520
in a podcast or something, but some of the background and the experience that you have

512
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:06,280
to give context around that news feels really valuable. And so I guess the question I would

513
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:13,360
put to you is, how do you cultivate critical thinking? You know, it's a skill that you

514
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,360
need to build up.

515
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:19,880
I think to some extent you do, but you need to start from a place that not everything

516
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:25,280
is awesome and great and positive. And some people say, oh, you're being a negative, toxic

517
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:29,600
person by saying that. But if you just take a step back and judge everything on its own

518
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:35,080
merits, rather than assuming that everything is positive, then you're generally going to

519
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:41,160
have more of a critical view of that and a critical not in a negative way, but a critical

520
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:48,280
thinking way and judge things for what they really are rather than just everything's great.

521
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:51,360
And let's just assume that it's all going to work out.

522
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:56,160
Yeah, we've gotten in a lot of trouble in the world, you know, thinking it's just going

523
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:02,000
to work out without putting our minds to it in a deep kind of meaningful way. So great

524
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:08,080
advice. Thank you for sharing that. Joe, thank you so much for joining me. Thank you for

525
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:13,960
your time. I know it's a little late for you out there as we speak. But I've really, really

526
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:18,760
appreciated this. And I'm really, yeah, happy we can have a chat. So thank you.

527
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:21,960
Yeah, we've been meaning to do it for a while. And we finally did it. So yeah, it's been

528
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:22,960
great.

529
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:40,560
Okay. Thanks so much.
