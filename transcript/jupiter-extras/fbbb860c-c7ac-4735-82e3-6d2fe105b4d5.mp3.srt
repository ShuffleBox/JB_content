1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,400
It's Tuesday. Hello, guys. Looking nice, Brent and Sharp. Welcome back. You weren't supposed

2
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,840
to be here. What the hell are you still doing here?

3
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,960
Well, come on. I can't miss another Tuesday, especially because you're wearing your robe.

4
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,960
Yeah, well, I had to be comfortable.

5
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:23,160
Wes is looking good right there. Although, sorry, Wes. Brent kicked you out of your spot.

6
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,600
You know, he just came in here early.

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,640
I know. Between Brent and Levi. I mean, I'm just sitting on the floor at this point.

8
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,240
Yeah, space is a premium, you know, in a recording studio. It's just how it goes.

9
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,800
We have just started the stream up on a Tuesday, just kind of hanging out when we normally

10
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,520
be doing the unplugged program. And the Mumble Room is trickling in. So, if you'd like to

11
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:48,440
join us in the Mumble Room, come on in. And the IRC room is also open at irc.geekshed.net

12
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:53,200
pound Jupiter broadcasting or go to bit.ly slash Jupiter chat.

13
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,240
We had some good blues playing earlier, but then Brent wrecked the whole thing because

14
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,040
somebody gave him access to the mixer.

15
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:05,160
Geez. That's my bad. I also told them about FreeBSD and we've seen how that's gone.

16
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:12,520
Yeah, I know, right? I tell you what. I was talking to my co-host Mike yesterday on Coda

17
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:16,720
Radio and I was saying, hey, you know, I noticed something weird is going on at Blizzard. They

18
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,800
just fired like 40 people this morning. And I was like, oh, that's interesting. I wonder

19
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:25,000
what's going on there, you know? And then this morning I wake up and there's news that

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:33,720
Microsoft plans to acquire Blizzard for $68.7 billion in cash. That's at $95 a share. It's

21
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:40,800
going to go down in financial quarter 2023. And of course, the stock's up 25% on Activision

22
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:47,680
side. And Microsoft is kind of pitching this as with this acquisition, Microsoft is going

23
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:54,320
to give the gift of Blizzard games to quote everyone across every device. So, Microsoft

24
00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:00,560
is going to give you the gift of more Blizzard games if you pay for their streaming service.

25
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,840
This is another company that they've kind of scooped up.

26
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,960
I think that feels like a pretty smart idea though. They're kind of buying a bunch of

27
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,320
reputation, aren't they?

28
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:16,280
Boy. I mean, some of the biggest games in my life, Starcraft, Diablo, those were Blizzard

29
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,280
games.

30
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:23,200
I'm kind of interested in how the, yeah, definitely. But I'm kind of interested in how the reputations

31
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,720
align because, I mean, I don't think Activision Blizzard was anyone's current favorite in

32
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,120
terms of, I mean, employee treatment, just their behavior over the past couple of years.

33
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,320
And then of course, we know that many have mixed feelings about Microsoft already.

34
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:39,280
Yeah, but you're right. Activision sort of dirtied the waters a little bit when they

35
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,280
came in.

36
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,280
Yeah, right.

37
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:48,120
It says here that through the great teams and great technology, Microsoft and Activision

38
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:57,480
Blizzard will empower players to enjoy the most immersive franchises like Halo and Warcraft.

39
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:03,120
The CEO is out. So even though this is going to remain as a brand, the CEO is out.

40
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,040
The people they fired seem to have been involved in perhaps some sexual harassment issues in

41
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:12,940
the company. And so the question becomes, why were they not dealt with sooner?

42
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:17,080
And it seems pretty obvious that as this deal went down, they're like, these people have

43
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,920
to be dealt with before they're Microsoft employees. Deal with your stuff.

44
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:27,080
And then the CEO tweets, yeah, I'm not going to stay on, but I will be totally an advisor,

45
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:31,700
which is code for I'm going to fade away, but they give me because it's like it's part

46
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:35,600
of the deal because they still want to have everyone to walk away from this deal with

47
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:41,120
a smile and a safe face. They allow him to claim he's an advisor, but they're not going

48
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,080
to take any advice from him.

49
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:52,640
I just don't know. Do you see a lot of Microsoft games on the Steam store? I don't. I don't

50
00:03:52,640 --> 00:04:00,200
go out looking for them, but I have looked for Age of Empires and I just I guess I don't

51
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:04,280
feel like this is a net good for Linux users.

52
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,880
Because it's subscription only. Well, it's going to be the access to it. I think ultimately

53
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:12,400
it's about pushing. Ultimately, it's about Xbox. I would totally say so. Yeah, it's about

54
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:18,680
Xbox's. It's about Xbox's. It's about Xbox streaming service. And it's, you know, not

55
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:25,080
intentionally, but it will have the net effect of also continuing to cement DirectX's dominance

56
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,880
as Microsoft owns more of these shops.

57
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:32,000
Like, do we know? We should look this up. They're probably seeing some of the movement

58
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,360
and trying to hold on dearly to it. That's what I would imagine this motivation is.

59
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:42,120
So this isn't the first time somebody's Google very quickly completes gaming company's

60
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:49,800
Microsoft owns when you search for that. Not good. Oh, it looks like PC Gamer has an updated

61
00:04:49,800 --> 00:05:00,520
ongoing page that. Oh, my God. Really? So they own Zenimax, which owns id Software

62
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:06,200
where Doom comes from. Right. They have Bethesda Studios. They have more studios than I've

63
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:11,400
ever even seen the names of here. This list is massive, actually. So I'll name it by games

64
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:16,160
that people might recognize. They own the they own the companies behind these games.

65
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:26,720
Wolfenstein, Ghostwire, Fallout 3, 4 and Fallout 76, Elder Scrolls Online, Halo, we know,

66
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:34,320
of course, Psychonauts, Broken Age, Wasteland, Bard's Tale, Minecraft, South Park, the Stick

67
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:40,800
of Truth. OK, that's weird. Obviously, Gears of War, Frozen Motorsports, State of Decay

68
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,760
and like I just mentioned, Age of Empires. And that's actually not even everything on

69
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,880
the list. Those are just games I've heard of before. There's other ones on this list

70
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:54,360
I haven't heard of. But Microsoft also owns. Those are they're like the Disney of game

71
00:05:54,360 --> 00:06:00,160
franchises, but I'm not a gaming expert by any means, but those all sound like pretty

72
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:06,600
old titles to me. Like Wolfenstein, obviously. Yeah, but they sell those all sell. There

73
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,120
seems to be a fair amount of I don't know if you should call it sentimentality or not,

74
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:14,160
but yeah, right. Like some of these franchises have a lot of mindshare. And I mean, I can't

75
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,800
speak for gamers really, because I am a casual gamer at best. But yeah, some of these titles,

76
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,480
you know, like there's just a lot of emotional response to them. The other thing that strikes

77
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:26,680
me is if these aren't on Steam, they're pretty much a nonstarter for the deck unless people

78
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:31,620
put Windows on there. And you know, we kind of yeah, we kind of joke around about what

79
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:35,360
happens if people buy a deck and put Windows on it. But when you look at the games that

80
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:41,200
are really popular, I think only only I don't know, but I think only a small percentage

81
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:45,720
of them or at least a not a complete chunk of them are on Steam anymore. Like they're

82
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:50,100
on either the Microsoft Store or the Epic store or some, you know, Blizzard has their

83
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:53,460
own thing. They're all on these independent platforms sort of like we're seeing happen

84
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:59,180
with streaming services. We're seeing the same thing happen with these game stores.

85
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,180
It's the same example.

86
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:03,940
Are you now saying that Steam is cable?

87
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:07,560
Seems like the ultimate cable bundle. And then these other streaming services are like

88
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:12,240
the add ons that you got to everybody's everything's turned into cable television, hasn't it?

89
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,560
Maybe it already was.

90
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:20,140
All right. Well, so there you go. That's what's going on today. Microsoft became the Disney

91
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:26,620
of video games and now owns all of the properties. But moving on, it is I was just commenting

92
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:33,740
this to the guys before we started streaming. It is frickin impossible now. It is frickin

93
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:38,880
impossible now to have any kind of tech news headlines that don't have a ton of crypto

94
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:44,560
stories in them, cryptocurrency stories. And so yesterday, it seems, Crypto.com, which

95
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:50,900
I was just talking to Wes about, halted withdrawals on their exchange and is forcing users to

96
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:56,680
sign back in and reset their two factor authentication. Research shows that they lost forty six hundred

97
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:04,960
Ethereum worth about 15 million dollars in a presumed hack. Yeah, Crypto.com, which just

98
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:12,740
bought that stadium, which has Ben Affleck as a spokesperson. Crypto.com tweets, quote,

99
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:16,800
we have a small number of users reporting suspicious activity on their accounts. We'll

100
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:22,240
be pausing withdrawals shortly as our team is investigating. All funds are safe.

101
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,760
What's a small number? Do they state that there?

102
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:30,320
What is a small number? A thousand? Five thousand? What's a small number? I don't know.

103
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:34,800
It's probably number times account balance. Right. That's how that's how support prioritizes

104
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,800
it.

105
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:42,760
I think the tell in this is that they're forcing users to reset their two factor. That is interesting.

106
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:47,640
Also, it appears that some people did lose funds, but Crypto.com has already covered

107
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:53,080
them and made them whole. And I guess that's kind of the upshot to these centralized wealthy

108
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:58,920
exchanges is when they do have something like this happen now, crypto insurance. Yeah, they're

109
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:03,440
basically covering it. And what's interesting is Crypto.com does have their own token called

110
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:11,680
Crow and Crow's price was completely unaffected by this news, which if you were to rewind

111
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:17,560
the clock a year ago and you had news about an exchange hack, the currency would tank.

112
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,720
Yeah. Yeah. In fact, the whole crypto market might tank that day.

113
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,600
So what gives? Why? Why not?

114
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,780
I think because we haven't seen any of these hacks that aren't pretty quickly contained

115
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:32,200
and covered. Like the companies seem to have processes in place where they identify the

116
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:37,540
issue like the day of or around then they isolate it and then they cover everything

117
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:40,880
and then they pay out bounties for the bug finders.

118
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:46,720
But is it also suggesting that this is just regular everyday business? Like these hacks

119
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,320
are just like just the way it's going to go?

120
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:53,960
Well, the banking system definitely has normalized them. Like, you know, my wife called into

121
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:59,160
Bank of America and gave them the wrong address accidentally because she'd forgot that she

122
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:03,400
had still had it at her old business address and they locked her out of her account and

123
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:08,020
they told her she can't do phone banking anymore. She has to go into a branch now because fraud

124
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:14,760
is so rampant that they have to do these extreme measures. I worked at a small bank and 40

125
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:20,340
branches and in our operations quote unquote department where we had people who are responsible

126
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:24,820
for maintaining the ATM network and helping branches with logistics and stuff, we had

127
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:31,560
an entire row of cubicles. So about 13 gals that just dealt all day long their entire

128
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:39,320
workday with debit card fraud because the debit card fraud is so rampant that the banks

129
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:43,980
don't even make a big deal about it. They just cover the cost because to them they've

130
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:47,960
done the math and they've identified that if they set X amount of millions aside and

131
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:52,640
they just cover the fraud costs and just let the system operate, everyone makes more money

132
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,640
on the net.

133
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:59,040
But is that cheaper than, I don't know, getting better technology around debit cards?

134
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,840
They have decided it is. Yeah. I think in part because they're so constrained by regulatory

135
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:07,920
movements so, you know, anything they invest into is a massive five-year process.

136
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,880
I also think it sounds worse than it necessarily is. I think that's pretty common in a lot

137
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:16,560
of businesses is you just make pragmatic trade-offs, right? Like it's kind of a benefit for us.

138
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,120
Like I don't really worry about it too much. I mean, yes, like Hadid has had a really bad

139
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,440
experience, but by and large I feel like, oh yeah, well you've set up, this is a normal

140
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,600
part of your workflow, you're accustomed to dealing with it, even if I don't love how

141
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,600
you deal with it.

142
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,880
Yeah, I agree. I think it works until it doesn't. Like for example, if the fraud, you know,

143
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,400
were to exponentially grow, obviously they would have to figure out something quick and

144
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:41,920
probably wish they would have addressed it. Like I can imagine, you know, a situation

145
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:46,320
where it's business as usual and that's fine and then all of a sudden it becomes kind of

146
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:51,200
a big burden. And, you know, it seems like the right move would be to invest in something

147
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,760
and build a system and I don't know.

148
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:58,960
Yeah, I agree, Wes. It's kind of the same kind of thinking though that leads to how

149
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:04,080
they plan for cybersecurity attacks where they kind of just do the math and figure out,

150
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:09,520
well with insurance it's cheaper for us to take a breach and maybe we take a five million

151
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:14,560
dollar drawdown, but, you know, we don't have to spend ten years investing five million

152
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:19,480
dollars every year for a decade to get a system that's impenetrable. We'll just spend one

153
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:24,280
time five million dollars and take the loss. And so they don't invest in their cybersecurity,

154
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:27,900
but meanwhile they're fine financially and it does work out for them. The insurance pays

155
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:32,520
out and they get to cry cyber victim, but all of their customers' information is just

156
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:36,600
once again leaked. And, you know, everybody works out, it's fine for everybody except

157
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,960
for the customer. And it kind of feels like that's what happens with these, this kind

158
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:45,320
of banking system. Like everything was fine until one day my checking account got compromised

159
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,400
and they shut it down immediately because they're constantly dealing with this kind

160
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:53,040
of stuff. So now they've just codified sort of this one size fits all approach. They shut

161
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,860
down my checking account. Well, the next day my credit card went to go clear and my credit

162
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:02,080
card payment failed. So then my credit card company deemed me as delinquent and insufficient

163
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:05,620
funds at both of those things, which both went on my credit report, which I'm still

164
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:11,120
dealing with. And I kind of just stop and go, well, if they just built a better system

165
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,000
that I thought I could rely on, but it turns out I was just getting lucky. If they just

166
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,600
built a better system in the first place or switch to something superior as it came along,

167
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,120
perhaps something like that wouldn't happen. And if that happens to me, it's probably happening

168
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,120
on a larger scale.

169
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,240
I think the question is, does that exist? And I think the good banks are doing both,

170
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:29,520
right? Like you have to have insurance and you have to work on your security.

171
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:34,760
That's pain throwing shade on my bank, but you're probably right. Oh, I hate your bank.

172
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:42,040
Yeah, it's a really moment. It's really a factor of momentum, not out of selection.

173
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,840
Partially because I've worked with someone who used to work in their security operations.

174
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:50,120
Oh boy. I've been thinking about it. You know, I have been thinking about it. Speaking of

175
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:54,760
maybe unbanking. How about this one? So there's a couple of crypto stories in here. Coinbase

176
00:13:54,760 --> 00:14:00,200
has partnered with MasterCard to let users pay with a credit card in its upcoming NFT

177
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,200
marketplace.

178
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,200
Of course.

179
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:08,880
Just all pain points. Buying NFTs on a credit card, that sounds like the worst possible

180
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:18,920
idea. The only possible upshot is that some sucker is willing to buy the NFT at a price

181
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:23,640
that outpaces your interest rate and your payments on that credit card. But that seems

182
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:28,960
like a long shot. Unless you could turn it around within a couple of days. I mean, you

183
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:33,120
give that market three months and then nobody's going to be interested in your stupid ape.

184
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:42,040
So could you imagine buying a bored ape picture on your credit card? I mean, I'm pretty bullish

185
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:45,840
when it comes to a lot of crypto technologies. And I even think the concept of NFTs is going

186
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:51,120
to be very useful. We're just seeing the very first ideas around it. But this doesn't seem

187
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:57,400
like a great idea. Is it just to try to enable simpler transactions via credit cards? Yeah,

188
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:03,480
for sure. But yeah, that's sort of it. I think if I was assuming I didn't want to spend cryptocurrency

189
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,680
on it, or I was just getting into the space, I think that credit card is how I would buy

190
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:12,020
it. That's how I buy almost everything in my life. And if it gets stolen, then the credit

191
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:15,120
card has a little bit of insurance you can bank on. Yeah, maybe it's better than hooking

192
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,720
up your bank details to your account. Hey, credit card, I'd really like to return this

193
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:24,200
NFT. Right. I bought it on accident. Here's how you really leverage it. Somehow, maybe

194
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:30,200
one day there'll be like a cryptocurrency perks credit card, right? So you buy with

195
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:34,560
your credit card, and you get perks and points for buying the NFT. Like right now, I get

196
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:39,080
points for buying gas. Well, don't you have that Coinbase card? Yeah, you could use the

197
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:45,600
Coinbase card and make cryptocurrency on the transaction. That's true. Or there's some

198
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:51,920
interesting stuff like M1 Finance has as you get like rebates if you shop at a company

199
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:59,080
and you own some of their stock. Oh, that's interesting. Yeah. What a system. That's a

200
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:04,640
definitely know your customer set a circle to get that working. But wow, huh. Okay,

201
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:10,240
we got one last one last crypto story. These are all just taken from the tech feed headlines.

202
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:17,940
We didn't go out and look for crypto stories. But this one's pretty shocking, I think. Intel

203
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:26,280
has announced plans for a low voltage, energy efficient Bitcoin mining ASIC. They're gonna

204
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:31,800
have a session on February 23rd to talk more about it. They call it the bonanza mine, an

205
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:39,040
ultra low voltage energy efficient miner. They plan to go into direct competition in

206
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:43,960
the Bitcoin mining ASIC space going up against Bitmain and Microbit. And of course, a lot

207
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:50,720
of the Chinese manufacturers as well. And I guess the idea here is is make a little

208
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,880
bit of money on this thing, you know, as especially as you really I think the beam out there is

209
00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:00,320
that people are using graphics cards to buying Bitcoin. But the reality is, nobody's been

210
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:07,800
doing that for a while. It's all on these ASICs now. And so this would give US companies

211
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:12,400
a US manufacturer to pick from, which I think is a really interesting development. But did

212
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:17,580
you see this coming? Like, I thought Intel was too busy throwing shade at the M1 to actually

213
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:21,040
have their head above water enough to see something like this.

214
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:26,440
Well, it sounds like maybe they want in the game too. And that's just their way to get

215
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:32,360
in. But it does sound like maybe it also addresses the energy issue that everybody's all up in

216
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:38,040
arms about, you know, if they can put some real smart heads together to try to address

217
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,040
that.

218
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:43,080
Yeah, they also I think it, it plays into some of their stuff, you know, where they're

219
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:48,560
farming out more their, you know, really next gen stuff to TSMC. And so maybe this is some

220
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:52,080
of their attempt to, you know, diversify their fab business.

221
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:57,200
Yeah. Let's go into the mumble room. Hello, mumble room. Hey, guys. How you doing?

222
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,460
Hello, everyone.

223
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:03,280
So would anyone in here buy, let's say this is never going to happen, but let's say Intel

224
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:10,000
got the price point to $1,000. You could get like a NUC sized device. You plug it in, it's

225
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,680
lower power and it just quietly mines Bitcoin at a slow rate. But, you know, interesting

226
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,960
rate. Would you buy one?

227
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:25,000
Now, here's the advantage of mining your own Bitcoin. Number one, you could join a pool

228
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,680
so you could make smaller amounts when anyone else in the pool mines so that you could,

229
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:34,240
you know, it's not just an all or nothing thing. You could have a lower power Bitcoin

230
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,800
miner that still makes a nice little steady income. Secondly, you're offering security

231
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:44,280
to the network. But third, a very interesting reason to mine your own Bitcoin is, is then

232
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:49,620
it really has no traceability because when you buy from an exchange, an exchange knows

233
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:53,580
who you are. When you buy a Bitcoin, they know the address that you bought. When you

234
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:57,800
send it out of their exchange to your wallet, they know what address you sent it to. That's

235
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:01,000
all available. That's all available to anybody that needs to audit that, that has the right

236
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,560
to audit that. But when you mine a Bitcoin, there's no originating address. You are the

237
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:11,600
originating spot. So it's your own private Bitcoin. So there's that advantage as well.

238
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,720
Perhaps maybe you'd want to collect a few Satoshis that are original and untraceable

239
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:21,080
for whatever means. So there could be another incentive to buy yourself a cheap little miner.

240
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:25,440
Would anyone do it? The thing is Bitcoin for me, it's still a

241
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:33,000
black box. But yeah, maybe. I don't know. Yeah. What about you, Wes? Would you buy one?

242
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,680
We're at a thousand bucks. A thousand bucks. Hmm. You know, I could see it. I suppose it

243
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,880
would depend on. Yeah. What's the operating cost?

244
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:45,040
I think you dropped off Mike or something fell off there. Where'd you go? Come back.

245
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:48,000
We can hear you a little bit, but you just got quiet. Yeah. What's the, what's the, I

246
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,360
think what you said is what's the run cost. Yeah. What's the run cost. What's the like

247
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:57,240
time to realistically perhaps see a net return. Yeah. I mean, it does kind of sound fun. It

248
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,720
is interesting. I think what would happen more is that you'd have the data centers that

249
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,040
are being built out with, you know, they'd be able to say, we're, we're, we're working

250
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:09,520
with us companies. We're using us renewable energy, you know, that kind of thing. You

251
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:14,360
could really see that being a branding thing. I think I would buy one if I could plug it

252
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:19,200
in and at the same rate that I listen to podcasts, I can invest that back into those podcasts.

253
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,200
So it's like a one to one. Wouldn't that be something I like the way you're thinking.

254
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,880
Okay. Then the last little, Oh, go ahead. Somebody else wants to jump in. Yeah. I was

255
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:35,840
just going to say that I would possibly, if it was, would do like alt coins. I don't know

256
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:40,920
about just Bitcoin itself, but I mean, I would probably pick it up either way. I'm trying

257
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:45,560
to get into crypto right now. So I have another question. Um, what else could this thing be

258
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:52,560
good for? Or is it so purpose built? That's the thing about a six. Yeah. They're like,

259
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:58,080
they're like application specific processors. Um, optimus gray in the chat room points out

260
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:04,000
that if you could maybe have it pay itself off in a year, I wonder, I don't know. All

261
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,240
of that said, I would be shocked. It'd be stupid. It'd be really stupid for them to

262
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:16,600
get into a low cost mining with the exception of pools because the difficulty rate is at

263
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:21,440
an all time high right now. And in two years, I think it is, I don't remember, but I think

264
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:27,560
it's two years from, from about now, the distribution rate is going to half. They call it the having

265
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:31,100
the halving or whatever they call it. But anyways, it's going to have, so rewards are

266
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:37,360
going to drop down in half, same amount of mining work, half the amount of rewards. Um,

267
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:44,280
so that's going to make the price, the operational cost to mine Bitcoin more higher. And so you

268
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:48,320
got to imagine it's going to be even less appealing to average consumers and you're

269
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:53,320
going to have more of these public companies that are now Bitcoin mining companies. And

270
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:58,640
the really fascinating thing that's happening there is these Bitcoin mining companies are

271
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:03,280
holding their Bitcoin a because they think the price is going to go up, but B because

272
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:08,200
it's an equity that looks good on their balance sheet. And so it is attractive to investors

273
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:15,360
to buy their stock if they're holding Bitcoins. It's like this weird proxy way for companies

274
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:20,100
to get in on the Bitcoin action via the stock market without having to actually own Bitcoin.

275
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:24,960
They just buy stocks in these mining companies that are holding their Bitcoin. And yeah,

276
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,960
that's weird.

277
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:29,200
Like people buy stocks and people, you know, when you, when gold is up, people buy gold

278
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:34,440
mining stocks. Sure. Yep. And they don't have to hold the gold directly. Uh, and you know,

279
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:38,520
it, it, it seems like a, it seems like a way for companies to get in on the action before

280
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:42,720
they can own the pure asset directly without having to go through all the hoops that large

281
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:47,000
companies already familiar with that system. Comfortable. Maybe. Yeah. Are we going to

282
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:53,760
see a big push in the next, you know, before that drop happens to mine like crazy? I wonder

283
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:59,440
maybe it seems like a huge incentive. Yeah, I will bet. They better get on it. Just about

284
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,560
that time. China's going to realize what a mistake they made kicking all the miners out

285
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:06,360
and they're going to be, they're going to be kicking themselves. So Apple shipped an

286
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:13,900
estimated 22% of the global smartphones in Q4 of 2021. Uh, which is not bad, but it's

287
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:22,080
down from 23% in Q4 of 2020 Samsung is following up. So Samsung is number two at 20% Yame at

288
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:28,560
12% and Oppo at 9% with Vivo at 8%. And of course, when we think about these percentages,

289
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:32,320
we got to remember the insane number in the absolute term. So even the, you know, that

290
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:36,600
1% down difference ends up being a lot of millions of devices. I would imagine, right?

291
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:42,280
I would have to think, but it makes the iPhone the most popular smartphone during the 2021

292
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:48,680
holiday quarter, which is quite the feather in Apple's cap. Yeah. That's the thing you

293
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:52,760
can, you know, tout around in your marketing PR. Yeah. I wouldn't, I would imagine looking

294
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:59,120
up there on stage at some point and fluff their feathers about it. Uh, oh yeah. Oh yeah.

295
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,480
This is the last story that I thought was interesting. They want to talk to you guys

296
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:06,720
about, um, and this is by the way, I'm skipping, I'm skipping the other crypto stories. There

297
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:11,920
are more crypto stories in the general, but I'm just, it's enough already. Um, variety

298
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:18,840
is reporting amongst others that YouTube is winding down its YouTube originals program

299
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:27,680
after six years of pouring money. I mean millions and millions and millions into this hole.

300
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:31,620
They're shutting it down. They're only going to fund programs that are part of its black

301
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:39,720
voices and YouTube kids funds program. Does anyone remember a YouTube original? I, I thought

302
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:43,780
it was, you know, the first thing they did is they tried to, they really screwed it up.

303
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:49,160
They launched it with celebrities that were not native to the YouTube platform. Oh yeah.

304
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:53,480
Mistake number one. Yeah. And everybody's like, but I'm on YouTube to watch the YouTubers.

305
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:58,720
And so it took them about two years and then they figured out, Oh, we'll work with the

306
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:03,400
most popular YouTubers. So then, you know, like MKBHD and some of the others that I follow

307
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:09,080
started doing these YouTube originals, but they just sucked. They just were like, why

308
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:14,720
did they suck? Cause they were, um, they were like a low budget discovery program. Like

309
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,280
if you remember good old discovery TV, when you could learn about something. Yeah. Uh,

310
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:23,800
they were like that, but worse. And, um, you know, you go to watch sometimes YouTube to

311
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:28,720
see somebody that's slightly unscripted and what you get is a very flat scripted version

312
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,160
of a YouTuber. Cause there's a committee or something that's making sure that it's all

313
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:37,320
scripted. There's a whole crew there cause they're spending millions on these shoots.

314
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:43,440
And so it's a giant operation with an entire crew, you know, right producers, et cetera,

315
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:49,160
which is the opposite of what made YouTube successful. And it's just the most basic misunderstanding

316
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:52,360
of the very own platform. It shows you that the people in charge have no idea what they're

317
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:56,960
doing and now they're shutting it down. And you know, they wanted it to be the big competitor.

318
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,080
They thought they were, they actually thought they were going to have their own Netflix

319
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:05,440
on their hands. They already do. Just it's different. They could have, they just won't

320
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:10,880
recognize what they actually have right now. Yeah. And meanwhile we're like, just make

321
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,640
the platform better. And you know, some of the things you could do is just roll back

322
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:18,840
some of the changes you've made. You can just undo stuff. You don't even have to make new

323
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:24,040
stuff and they can't get that right. It's so sad. Just sell YouTube and they'll be independent.

324
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:30,080
I mean, wouldn't that be something? Wouldn't that be, although can you imagine Wes, the

325
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:38,920
operational costs of running YouTube? I mean, it has some of the best streaming, um, resiliency

326
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:43,320
out of any streaming service I use. Like I can watch a YouTube video in places I can't

327
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:46,760
watch any other streaming service. Well, they've been doing it pretty much everybody else.

328
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:51,040
Yeah, exactly. Yeah. You're both right. Yeah. It just works and they've been doing it for

329
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:55,380
a long time. They've got all these partnerships. They've got a good client that's good at adapting

330
00:26:55,380 --> 00:27:00,800
to different bandwidth situations. And um, I also really appreciate the shortcuts that

331
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:06,720
you can use keyboard shortcuts on the videos. I'm constantly shifting sort of time speeds

332
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:12,160
and going back and forth, 10 seconds and that kind of stuff. I am always craving on other

333
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:16,640
platforms and can never get. Oh, it really feels like Microsoft's looming large. You

334
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,360
know, looking back at over these stories we just talked about, the one that really strikes

335
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:25,480
me as like this is going to have a long term impact on us is these Microsoft game studio

336
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:29,360
purchases. And it just seems like a massive headwind against the deck. I can't, I can't

337
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,920
help but feel some any other way about it. And maybe I'm wrong. Maybe most of the Microsoft

338
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:38,200
games are on steam, but the ones I've looked up aren't. I haven't done an exhaustive check,

339
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:44,800
but I think you're going to be forced to, you know, buy this deck if you like, say Age

340
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:50,080
of Empires, which is one of my all time favorite games. You guys ever play it? Oh, really?

341
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:55,600
Oh, man. Wes, you ever play Age of Empires? Oh, yeah, definitely. I mean, it's been a

342
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:03,120
long time now, but yeah, just a classic, you know, classic. What do they call it? But you

343
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:08,560
built you build up a society and you it's an RTS. Yeah, it's a real time strategy. Exactly.

344
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:13,760
And I used to play Stronghold a lot. I never really played Age of Empires a lot, but I

345
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:17,960
love Stronghold. So it's a similar, very similar game. OK. Yeah. Well, they own that too. So

346
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:24,160
we do. I think so. I think the studio that owns that. Yeah, I'm not positive. I don't

347
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:28,280
keep it. I don't keep extensive track of this. But every time I glance over it, their list

348
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:32,400
of studios and you know, because part of what happened is over the last decade, a lot of

349
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:37,640
these gaming studios consolidated and then Microsoft came in and bought the company that

350
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:41,520
owns three or four companies underneath it. So that's why they have a bunch of game titles

351
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:46,680
that we don't even realize because they've they've bought these parent companies. And

352
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:51,600
I wonder if we're not going to end up in a scenario where we've got these expensive decks

353
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:56,480
with these incredible AMD GPUs and these impressive feats of engineering to get the drivers inside

354
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,840
the kernel and everything working really great and hours and hours and hours and hours of

355
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:04,960
valve engineer time trying to optimize the entire graphics pipeline and make everything

356
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,900
as possible, get just the right screen, make sure, in fact, perhaps they even chose the

357
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:14,080
plasma desktop because of some of the limitations in terms of refresh rate on the GNOME desktop.

358
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:19,400
And then everybody ends up loading up streaming services to play games on a Microsoft server

359
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:24,120
and it's just an H2 64 video stream to the deck. That's a really sad scenario and it's

360
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:27,640
not going to be the only scenario, but it may end up being like.

361
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:32,000
Honestly, if I were Microsoft, I'd publish the Xbox streaming service in the Steam store

362
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,840
and just get done, get it over with and just let everybody use their thousand dollar deck

363
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:41,440
or whatever it is as a streaming device. Here's the thing. If they actually did release like

364
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:48,320
the the game pass for the Steam Deck and or Linux, I would actually subscribe to that

365
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:53,360
because I would do I would do I used to subscribe to it back when I was on the Expo. And when

366
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:59,320
I moved to PC, I just let it expire because I didn't really have a need for it anymore.

367
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:04,080
But I would subscribe to it if they if it worked on Linux because I want more games

368
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:08,760
on Linux. Yeah. The reality is, if you have the Internet connection for it, streaming

369
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:15,600
games is a lot like the promise of the consoles. You just turn it on and it just works. Every

370
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:20,600
time it's always updated. Yep. You know, and like with the GeForce now, they're there.

371
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:24,200
They've already read the graphics cards, one revision since I've been a subscriber. So

372
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:28,240
I just got an upgrade in my graphics. My only issue is until I had Starlink, I'd never

373
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,080
had service good enough at home to use game streaming. Our buddy Alex, actually, before

374
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:36,880
we just got on the air sent us a video. He just set up his Windows PC headless and he

375
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:41,640
set up the NVIDIA streaming stuff and he's using Moonlight. Nice. Yeah. And it looks

376
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:46,000
great. It looks so good. It looks like he's running it right there on his machine. Yeah.

377
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,160
He's got a nice high speed plan. So it does kind of make me go, oh, be cool to have like

378
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:56,160
a headless Windows box. But. I'm just not ready until you start having to administer

379
00:30:56,160 --> 00:31:01,400
it. Yeah. Well, and what I'd really want is the ability to stream like three games or

380
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:05,120
four games. So, you know, me and the kids could play and then you're really talking

381
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:10,760
about a beefy box. It'd be easier just to just to do the gaming streaming service. So.

382
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:14,800
We'll see. I'm sure Microsoft is going to play. You can just pay Alex to set up your

383
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:19,680
own custom, you know, hosting platform. Hey, Alex, come on over. We'll do it on. We'll

384
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:25,040
do it on like a prox box and two GPU pass through. And yeah, exactly. Yeah. I think

385
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:31,600
it's like I'm down. I'm smiling and I can't hear my smiling. I think you're down for it.

386
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:39,160
I like it. I'm down for just pushing the envelope, I think. Well, there you go. There's the headlines.

387
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:44,840
That's it for today. There's a lot going on today. Tuesdays, I guess. I guess. Yeah. Tuesday,

388
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:49,040
actually, we've noticed. There's a lot of times when we move the show, we didn't want

389
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:54,800
a lot of news to help us make the show. It made it too easy. Well, it does give a few

390
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:59,280
days to digest the news. There is that come up with a good line on it. Because, you know,

391
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:04,960
your instinct really a lot of times is to just go hot on the mic with your first take.

392
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:10,400
But not always the best option. Sometimes it works out. But not always the best option.

393
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:14,760
And I think sometime in the next decade, you might learn that lesson. Oh, this is interesting.

394
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:21,160
Unrelated, I'm sure. Just saw this pop up. YouTube's global head of original programming,

395
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:26,760
Susan Daniels, is leaving in March after seven years. Well, the original program has been

396
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:31,080
going for eight years. Yeah. So not only are they shutting down the program, but she's

397
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:37,880
out. Hmm. That wasn't in the first headline. That came out later. Funny how that works.

398
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:44,360
Yeah. Huh. I guess that, you know, in a way is actually a healthy sign. I think there's

399
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:48,080
not enough corporate accountability. When, you know, a corporate initiative like that

400
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:52,160
fails, they really should be looking at why and make corrective actions. I mean, it sucks

401
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,560
to see someone lose their job.

402
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:59,280
And then I guess I hope, I hope that they're actually doing that and not just, you know,

403
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:03,440
acts in this position and not questioning anything further about how it went on for

404
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:09,800
so long, what the incentives internally were, etc. Not that I love Google, but like they

405
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,920
own so many things that I kind of like and or use. It'd be nice to see them get their

406
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,480
corporate house in order a little bit.

407
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:20,880
Mm hmm. That's a good way to put it. Brent Lee. Yes, sir. Why don't you tell us about

408
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:26,080
why you're still here? Why are you still here? Weren't you supposed to be home by now?

409
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:32,960
Yes. So. Hmm. Where to start, Chris? I guess it's tricky. I did move my flight one time.

410
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:37,560
Why did I do that again? Projects. And I stole your bag so that you couldn't leave. So that

411
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:43,920
didn't help. That's true. So I was supposed to fly out yesterday. But it so turns out

412
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:53,440
that Washington has this kind of unadvertised testing COVID testing shortage. Yeah. And

413
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:57,880
not just like a kind of a shortage. So you got to go to the next place over like state

414
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:03,260
wide shortage of code of COVID testing. Right. Right. To the point where like the Walgreens

415
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:08,000
and the right aides are picking up the phone and saying, hey, you've reached Walgreens.

416
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,920
We don't have any COVID tests. Can I how can I help you? The reason that's important to

417
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:17,280
me is that to get back into my own country in Canada, I need one of these before I can

418
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:21,480
get on a flight. And it has to be the PCR variety has to be the PCR one, which is the

419
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:26,480
one that takes a few days. It can't just be the the quick test was OK to get into the

420
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:33,000
US, but it's not OK to leave. So. It's been tricky to try to line up all the ducks in

421
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:39,980
a row to try to get home, really. So I think Chris and Wes are conspiring and have something

422
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:46,520
to do with this. But I had to. Job one was I kicked out the sunroof in the focus so you

423
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:49,920
wouldn't have a car while you were here. So that way you'd be reliant upon us for all

424
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:55,640
transportation. I get that. Yeah. Yeah. That was that was me thinking. I did that like

425
00:34:55,640 --> 00:35:00,520
a solid three weeks before you came down. And oh, yeah, the repair place just can't

426
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:05,180
get the window despite the Volvo getting a new window in like a day or two. Yeah. Yeah.

427
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:09,320
This has actually been an ongoing. We have been trying to get a new sunroof for our Ford

428
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:15,040
Focus for a frickin month and a half. And it's just nobody will get us at the sunroof.

429
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:19,440
Like nobody has it. They just it keeps never like your tests. They don't tell you. But

430
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:24,280
then it turns out when you press them. Yeah, we can't get a hold of it. Could have said

431
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:29,000
that in the first place. So you ended up you ended up having to go all the way down to

432
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:36,360
the airport. Yeah. Wes was kind enough to after our Linux unplugged episode last week.

433
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:40,160
Sunday I always think Sundays are last week, but that's like the first day of this week

434
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:45,380
for some people. Right. I don't know why I think that. So anyway, Sunday, Wes was kind

435
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:50,200
enough to let me stay at his place and try to figure all of this out. But was it ever

436
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:57,980
a journey? The only testing place I could find and had yet to confirm had tests was

437
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:02,500
at the airport. I figured, sure enough, they have a lab set up right at the airport. They're

438
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:07,700
not going to want to run out of tests. Right. Yeah. Well, and people's entire like transportation

439
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:12,440
plans hinge on these damn tests. That doesn't seem important to airlines or testing places

440
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:20,820
at this point. But so Wes and I figured after much consulting and exploring of options that

441
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:26,400
it would be best to just go there and to just assess the situation. And of course, they

442
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,720
have a website and of course, you can book an appointment. But it's all over the place.

443
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:36,720
Like there were no appointments until after my flight should have left. So I just figured,

444
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:43,120
OK, well, there's no way I'm getting on this flight with what I require. So. I had to call

445
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:51,440
the airline, but the wait times are crazy, like 50 minutes. So, Wes, you can certainly.

446
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,480
You know how long I stayed on the phone and I got kicked off. Oh, my God. I mean, it must

447
00:36:54,480 --> 00:37:00,400
have been like six hours of total hold time. It was ridiculous. And holy crap. Yeah. The

448
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,200
thing that was most frustrating is the last time I did this, which unfortunately was only

449
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:08,320
a week ago, they had this cool system that everybody should have where they would just

450
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,240
call you back and say, oh, OK, the wait time is going to be like an hour and a half. We'll

451
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:16,680
just call you back. No problem. But that option never showed up this time. Of course, different

452
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:21,520
phone tree, different number. Who knows that stuff? Well, and really, the other thing that

453
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:27,200
is sort of ridiculous is when we were in Denver, you had to go through the same process and

454
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,840
there was plenty of testing available at Denver. I could just show up at a Walgreens, do a

455
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:37,720
drive through test and it was free. Yeah. But now as time has gone on, we've bungled

456
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:41,320
the system up so badly that we have less test availability and they don't want to panic

457
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:45,160
people. So they're not saying anything. Yeah. And the other thing is the cost. The only

458
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:49,560
test I could find at the airport, which it turns out they could do a test and I got in

459
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:57,760
yesterday somehow by some miracle, is 250 US dollars. You know, basically the price

460
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:03,440
of your flight home. Basically the price of my flight home. Wow. Think about that. So

461
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:09,080
I actually have COVID right now. Oh, I'm sorry, man. Oh, it's all good. Very, very mild symptoms.

462
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:14,320
So not really worried about it. But I thought, you know, because I found out by taking one

463
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:18,240
of those at home tests because I was feeling a little bit under the weather and it came

464
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:25,200
back positive. Um, but I was, I thought for work I'd have to go get a PCR test. So I was

465
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:30,700
looking everywhere for them, uh, try to find one and I can't, they're out everywhere. My,

466
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:35,880
the closest appointment I could find would be next Friday or this like upcoming Friday.

467
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:40,880
And I eventually called work and this was like, Hey, just FYI, I have COVID. I got it

468
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:46,760
from an at home test. All right. Found out from the at home test. Um, but, uh, I can't

469
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:50,320
find a PCR test anywhere. They're like, Oh, we actually accept the at home test. Now I'm

470
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:58,080
like, what? Well, that's good. Yeah, it is. I'm glad about that. But I was like that,

471
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:02,960
that information was never communicated to anyone. Of course not until, until it's an

472
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:09,200
absolute, right? They need to find it. Right. Yeah. It's kind of weird because for the PCR

473
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,640
test, you know, it takes several days. If you go through a lab to get these results

474
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:19,280
unless you pay $250 and it only takes 60 minutes, but you know, so, but what's curious about

475
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:24,240
that to me is, you know, I take the test 72 hours before I'm actually flying. So what's

476
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:27,960
the guarantee that I didn't pick it up in those 72 hours? So, yeah, you could get sick

477
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:31,280
while somebody comes over to the studio and then you had to, I mean, I was coughing all

478
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:35,080
over you or I could even get sick while I'm waiting in line to get these tests because

479
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:39,480
it's these giant lineup seems very likely that you would be exposed at the airport actually.

480
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:45,320
Exactly. That's what I mean. They're not thinking through the whole system. And so it seems

481
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:51,600
like it might be a better idea to take several quick tests, like maybe, you know, two days

482
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:55,520
before you leave the day you leave or something like that. And then, and then you have more

483
00:39:55,520 --> 00:40:02,080
data points. I don't know why that's not a thing. Sounds cheaper. Well, you know, this

484
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:05,880
whole thing just got off, just got started. So, you know, give us a couple of years and

485
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:10,960
we'll have it figured out. Oh yeah. I know it takes time. You know, here would be like

486
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:17,740
have the 72 hour one, right? And then maybe while you're waiting in line at the airport

487
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:24,560
to actually take off, they have you do the Binax like the, the rapid or the essentially

488
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:28,160
at home test to say, Hey, I don't have COVID right now.

489
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:32,960
Hey, you know, I've been, these guys have heard me say it a dozen times, but I don't

490
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:38,680
think I've actually said it on air. But if fricking Joe Rogan can rapid test every podcast

491
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:42,960
guests for the last year and eight months, we should be able to rapid test ourselves

492
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:48,200
before we get on an airplane. I mean, it just is so silly, right? You said that on the unfilter

493
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:53,920
one. Yeah. Yeah. I'm filter, but nobody listens to that. So I can say it again. Um, so I want

494
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:59,600
to get a new beverage and then, um, we were going to do an impromptu brunch on the air,

495
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:04,920
right? We probably, uh, we probably have a couple of minutes while I refresh. So, um,

496
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:08,520
we could slip in probably one more topic. Oh, what do you think? Anything else? Any

497
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:11,880
other? So yeah, basically you had to delay the flight. So that way you had time for the

498
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:16,160
testing to clear, which means I get to work on a few other projects. That's true. It was

499
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:21,100
really fun. So many projects. Were you impressed West when you came over and saw the state

500
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:25,180
of the bathroom? Holy crap. Yeah. I can see why we're trying to trap Brent here because

501
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:28,420
I mean, we can just get so much more done. I know. Imagine what I could get them to do

502
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:33,800
for the RV, right? You know, one thing I discovered at West's place, cause I had the chance to

503
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:39,240
stay over, which is always a great thing. West, your shower is plumbed incorrectly.

504
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:46,960
Oh, the hot water and the cold water is backwards. It's a ridiculous thing. Um, I grew up in

505
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:53,160
a shower like that. So it's kind of normal for me. Well, I didn't even notice. I cranked

506
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:57,160
it to like, Oh yeah. Most checks, cause as you might imagine with travel, you know, most

507
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:02,440
checks, I have an average of where most places. That's okay. That's a good way to put it.

508
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:05,560
But I'm like, okay, a good place to start is like the three quarter mark. Cause it's

509
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:09,160
generally not scalding, but if it's a little too cold, then at least he got the hot water

510
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:13,360
kind of coming through. I did that at your place and thankfully I tested the water before

511
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:19,280
getting in, which I don't usually do. And it was frigid. So I quickly sort of had to

512
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:24,120
figure that out. I don't actually know. I'll have to warn future guests. Yeah. Right. Make

513
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:28,720
a nice little sign with. The other thing is you have a lovely washroom. It's got this

514
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:34,320
skylight with like daylight coming in, which is my such a luxurious way to do it. But your

515
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:39,120
shower curtain, there's just a man staring at me the entire time I'm in there. Why does

516
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:44,120
he have as a shower? Are you not used to that? What does he have? What does he have as a

517
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:49,320
shower curtain? What is it? Is it, uh, what's the gentleman's name? Oh, he's got, he's got

518
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:56,320
this hilarious Jeff Goldblum. Jeff Goldblum is like there with an ape and he's got his

519
00:42:56,320 --> 00:43:01,680
arm around an ape or something. And it's just see-through enough that you can also see Jeff

520
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:09,520
Goldblum's, you know, mug while you're trying to take showers. So anyways, it ended up being

521
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:17,400
a great experience. I'll post a link in the IRC for anyone curious. I mean, if you got

522
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:21,120
a stare at something, right? Like I'd rather that than boring old color. Oh, it made me

523
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:29,160
smile. So there's something to that. Um, did you ever see the, um, Jeff Goldblum had a

524
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:35,080
show for a while? Um, and one episode I watched, yeah, I'd like to watch more. One of them

525
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:40,560
was all about shoes and he, you know, he's got this way, but it was a fascinating exploration

526
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:45,420
into the world of high-end shoes. And then I think that may have been the only episode

527
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:51,040
I saw. But, um, if anyone's interested, I say dive right in. It was, it was really well

528
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:57,160
produced and super funny and like kind of quirky and awkward in the way that I think

529
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:02,320
most of us in this community either are like or love or have come to appreciate. So it

530
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:03,320
was really nice.

531
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:09,160
It's nice when he's like, um, it's always nice to see genuine curiosity and excitement

532
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:13,000
about stuff, you know, and he can portray that pretty well, I think.

533
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:17,400
I completely agree with that. And yet he's okay to say when he doesn't know something,

534
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:18,400
which is really important.

535
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:22,240
Mm-hmm. Yeah. That's the other part, right? That being, uh, being cool enough in your

536
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:25,000
own skin to be like, nope, no idea what's going on with that.

537
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:30,320
My frog is out today. I tell you what it is out and about, uh, we have a studio frog and

538
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:34,180
he is all over the place. You know, this has been a lot of fun. We should just make this

539
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:46,440
a podcast. Wouldn't this, let's just figure out how to turn this into a podcast.
