00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,680
Well, hello, everyone. Welcome to Brunch with Brent. My name is Brent Gervais. And joining

2
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:19,880
me today, I'm very excited, is Carl Rochelle. Carl, how are you doing?

3
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,440
I'm doing great. Thanks for having me.

4
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:25,460
Oh, thanks so much for joining me. I've been looking forward to having a chat with you

5
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:32,840
for quite a long time now. I will say I've had many recommendations, both from within

6
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:41,320
the Jupiter Broadcasting crew and also outside to have you join me on a brunch. So thank

7
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,000
you for taking the time. Really appreciate that.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,480
Glad I can be here and the honor's all mine.

9
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:54,720
Thank you. So we should, I suppose, give a little idea of who you are. You are the CEO

10
00:00:54,720 --> 00:01:01,260
and founder of System76. And for those who don't know System76, could you give maybe

11
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:04,600
a brief description of System76 as you see it?

12
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:11,440
So System76 was founded in my basement in 2005. It was myself and a friend of mine.

13
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:15,640
And we started System76 because we believe that open source had advanced to the point

14
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:21,140
where it was a better operating system than the proprietary alternatives from Apple and

15
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:27,720
Microsoft at the time. We thought that it deserved high quality and professional representation

16
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:33,120
from an OEM and that that didn't exist today. It was common on servers, but not on the desktop.

17
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:39,840
So we set out to be kind of great representatives of open source through hardware, building

18
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:46,800
a product where you could consume it and be backed by both engineering that ensured that

19
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:52,560
the product worked as it should and also by a great support team and knowledgeable people

20
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,420
that when you contacted us for help, you knew you wouldn't be turned away because you were

21
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:01,660
using Linux. It's our first class citizen.

22
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:07,160
That aspect of being turned away because you're using Linux is still kind of present today

23
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:15,040
in most of the hardware, most of the common hardware suppliers. I know I've got a ThinkPad,

24
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,640
my father's ThinkPad that has a few little issues, and I've been so hesitant to kind

25
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,960
of reach out to them. Since then, I've learned from a few of my friends that they're actually

26
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:31,200
kind of fine with it these days. But so often, that is a tricky place. And it feels like,

27
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:37,160
at least for me, when I started being full time on Linux, it felt like you were making

28
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:42,780
some compromises and risks there. And so I could see how that being the initial vision

29
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:47,680
would be really a powerful motivator for you. And it sounds very similar to your vision

30
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,680
today as well.

31
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:55,320
It hasn't changed much. Our capabilities have changed dramatically. But I also don't see

32
00:02:55,320 --> 00:03:01,600
that in any kind of way to disparage other OEMs. It's also something that's very understandable

33
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:08,560
to me. We are not a window shop. And so we do our best when a customer needs to do a

34
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:16,160
boot window for whatever reason. But that's also not our prime focus or prime expertise.

35
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:20,240
Linux is what we do. It's what we do well and know well. So I can understand those big

36
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:26,720
behemoths being, for them, for being challenging to pivot and offer support and the engineering

37
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:34,160
and the effort that's required to offer another operating system. It also applies to us for

38
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:43,440
Linux in general. We focus all of our engineering and our QA and our effort on POP OS, and to

39
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:49,360
an extent, but to a lesser extent, on Ubuntu as well as we ship it. And we can't, the expense

40
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:56,600
and the efforts to put the polish that we put into POP OS into other desktop environments

41
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:02,640
would decrease to us the standard by which we hold ourselves. So even within the Linux

42
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:09,480
space, what we do well, we do make the hardware work well with Linux. So at the base level,

43
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,540
you know you can put any Linux on there and it's going to work well, particularly now

44
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:18,980
that we're building open source firmware. But even with that, I understand and know

45
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:23,720
the challenges because that focus is what enables us to ensure the product is going

46
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,400
to reach a very high standard.

47
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:32,380
There's something to be said about picking a niche and really digging into it and trying

48
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:38,680
to support everyone all the time is a surefire recipe to not really be special to anyone.

49
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:45,140
And it sounds like you've found kind of a nice recipe that both scratched your own itch

50
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:52,560
at the time and still is, but also you've, from what I've seen, found some really passionate

51
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,920
people who love using your products as well.

52
00:04:54,920 --> 00:05:02,960
The formula has certainly worked and I attribute a lot of that to the focus and to caring about

53
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:11,360
our customers and their interactions. When something goes wrong, we feel it emotionally.

54
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:18,760
It's not just some of us, it's we all care a lot. And so these are complex interactions

55
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:25,800
with lots of different hardware and software and firmware all operating in unison and while

56
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:32,160
some mistakes might be made or we learn new things, what's important is how rapidly one

57
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,840
responds to those and makes a situation that might be poor better.

58
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:45,320
And in 15 years, QA is very interesting. So Quality Assurance, our QA team, we have all

59
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:49,840
of these different tests that we do across the board whenever we release new software

60
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:56,200
or new firmware or new hardware. And in 15 years, that living document, all those living

61
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:01,400
documents, we've still learned new things and new situations that had never occurred

62
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:10,140
before in 15 years that now we need to test for this one scenario where it was never a

63
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:16,360
problem before, but now we've learned that. So it's quite fascinating. But in doing so,

64
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:21,360
because we've collected all of that knowledge over all of those years and documented all

65
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:27,320
of it, it means our standards are very, very high these days and it's rare that something

66
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,320
slips through.

67
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:32,880
I would imagine every day is a little different than the next with all of these new challenges

68
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:39,800
cropping up and things you don't expect and a way to grow yourselves personally as well

69
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,800
with these challenges.

70
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:47,840
That's technology for you. If you're ambitious and curious and want to explore, then there's

71
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:53,160
no shortage of opportunity to find new things and learn new things every day. It doesn't

72
00:06:53,160 --> 00:07:00,040
end. And in hardware in particular. So while I do believe this is the case in software

73
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:05,680
as well, in hardware, there are just more variables. You have memory manufacturers that

74
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:12,160
are all working to accelerate what they're building and processor and Intel and AMD and

75
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:18,040
storage manufacturers, everyone's working to drive their technology forward. And we

76
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:22,440
are at the point or we are at the point in the supply chain where we collect all of those

77
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:26,760
things together along with the firmware and along with the software and build a product

78
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:34,120
out of it. And so we have the opportunity to touch everything in the stack, which makes

79
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:40,040
it even more interesting and there's more to learn. And we're going into new areas that

80
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:47,480
are fascinating to me. We're working on a new keyboard that it's designed to work very

81
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:56,080
fluidly with pop OS and auto tiling in particular. So it's a unique keyboard that doesn't alienate

82
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:01,160
those that are used to your typical keyboard. But at the same time, once you use it, especially

83
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:04,960
if you enjoy using tiling and you like tiling, you find its efficiency to be kind of your

84
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,200
cup of tea. It's the type of thing that's addictive. You can't like, you just can't

85
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:14,480
go to a different keyboard once you start doing, using this thing. Back to the point

86
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:20,840
of the, we have electrical engineers working on it with our firmware developers and electrical

87
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:27,320
engineer who also has electrical engineering background. And it's just an absolute pleasure

88
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:33,520
to me to watch these experts in their craft, discuss their craft and then conduct their

89
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:39,800
craft. It is an absolute pleasure to see real professionals do incredible work together

90
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,920
and what the outcome is.

91
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:49,120
Jeremy joined us on the Linux Unplugged and gave us an insight on sort of the background

92
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:56,080
process that goes into some of the firmware tweaks and engineering there. And it was fascinating.

93
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,560
I could have listened to that for hours, maybe.

94
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:05,700
That's exactly what I'm talking about. It's the same thing, the same thrill I get listening

95
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:14,300
to Jeremy on Linux Unplugged. I get that every day watching this team talk in Slack and discuss

96
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:18,920
the things they're building for a geek like me who just loves every day to learn something

97
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:24,800
new and to be, I'm a roll up your sleeves kind of person. I like to be very, very involved.

98
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:31,920
And it's a thrill for me. I learned so much from the team that it's a special place to

99
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,920
be.

100
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:36,400
It's easily something that gets you up in the morning just to go hang out with all these

101
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,040
wonderful people, I'm sure.

102
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,280
It does, yeah.

103
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:42,840
To me, it's like a chicken and an egg thing, which is really interesting to approach, which

104
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:47,800
is surrounding yourself with great people. I would imagine once you surround yourself

105
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:53,920
with a few great people, maybe in the infancy of system 76, then all of a sudden you get

106
00:09:53,920 --> 00:10:03,000
that kind of amaze at just what that can do for a team. And then so you go and chase other

107
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,680
great people to add to the team. And that just grows and grows and grows because everything

108
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:15,040
I've been able to peek at about the team, and I know a few of them, like Emma and Ian

109
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:20,700
as well, I've spent time with them at Linux Fest Northwest. They're just such great people

110
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:24,960
and they have nothing but amazing things to say about the team they're on. And they've

111
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:30,920
been there for quite a while now. So I'd imagine that sort of internal culture is really exciting

112
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,920
for you as well.

113
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:40,920
Yeah, it certainly is. We have something special in our ambition and our desire and our fearlessness.

114
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:48,040
And it helps that when we took on different projects that seemed maybe that were outside

115
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:57,080
of our normal course of action. For instance, when we made the decision to build Papawesk,

116
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:00,600
we had already known that there were a lot of things that we felt we could improve in

117
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:07,480
the desktop. But we didn't know what the market reaction necessarily would be. I mean, after

118
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:12,720
I guess it would be 12 years of offering one operating system and then rolling out your

119
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,980
very own and saying, hey, customers, trust us to build an operating system for you now.

120
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:18,980
That's a big leap, isn't it?

121
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:26,400
It is a big leap. And out of the gate, I was very, very encouraged because the response

122
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:30,960
was solid. And we only had a few months to pull it together. So we were able to pull

123
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:34,920
together a good product that kind of established where we were going with an operating system

124
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:40,080
and the type of things that we were hoping to, of the value we're going to provide to

125
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:47,360
our customers in doing this project. And the response was overwhelmingly positive. And

126
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,800
with each release, the distinction that we were building with an operating system and

127
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:57,640
how it benefited our customers grew and it was recognized.

128
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:06,640
So the pre-installed orders from system 76 started at 50% pop and then 60 and then 70

129
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:16,880
and then 80. And it's going to continue to grow, which also means that we could put more

130
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:22,200
resources and more effort and more focus on building a holistic experience between the

131
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:28,220
hardware and the firmware and the operating system. But in doing all of that, it grew

132
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:36,240
our confidence that we could take on more. And so the next step was building a factory

133
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,900
and bringing design and manufacturing in-house.

134
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:40,900
Another big leap.

135
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:47,800
It's a completely wild leap to take for a manufacturer, for anyone, because it's just

136
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:55,440
not done these days. But our size of the company, we don't have the volumes that make it easy

137
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,700
for us to plug into the supply chains in China. So we can't just go say, this is what we want

138
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:03,720
to build. Will you build it for us? And they'll say, that's too small. We're not going to

139
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:09,880
do that. But we are big enough to make an investment in a factory and manufacture these

140
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:16,080
things ourselves. And there's also the added benefit. In doing so, we're able to respond

141
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:20,120
much more quickly with the hardware design the same way that we respond in software.

142
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:24,760
When there's an improvement that's been identified, we're able to roll it into production very

143
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:33,400
quickly. And now instead of waiting for the typical supply chain latency, it's a few days

144
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:38,480
when that's rolled in instead of up to six months, as it was before.

145
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:43,320
It sounds like being smaller is a huge advantage in this case.

146
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:49,160
It certainly isn't. Smaller, along with what you had alluded to early on, that smaller

147
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:57,360
plus just an incredible team to work with. And being able, as a group, to stack those

148
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:04,520
successes on top of each other have only increased our confidence and willingness to take a chance

149
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:11,640
and take a risk on building new things and different things for our customers that, along

150
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,760
with listening to them and understanding the challenges and the different things that they're

151
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:21,600
doing, we feel like we can make their computing life. The thing that they use as a professional

152
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:28,680
tool every day, there are lots of areas to make these products better. And we feel like

153
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,160
we can contribute for our customers in that way.

154
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:36,480
Yeah, we were talking the other day, you and I, about how computers have sort of come to

155
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:49,280
be the very most versatile and most widely used tool ever, really. And so how you can

156
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:55,480
use your own vision to shape the way that others use this tool and to make it easier

157
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:59,720
and hopefully a pleasure, I would imagine feels really powerful.

158
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:07,600
Just to do something challenging and be working on it for months and then to release it to

159
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:12,080
the public and say, here's this thing we've built for you. We've listened to you. We've

160
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:17,080
heard what you said. We think you're right. We think that we can make advances in these

161
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:24,320
ways and here you go. And then to see that it's received with the same kind of passion

162
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:32,520
and pleasure that we had building it is very, very satisfying. We feel like we are building

163
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:36,080
things that truly make our customers' lives better.

164
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:43,520
And make the world a little bit better. It's pushing others to also try to do better things,

165
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:49,120
I think. It feels like you're kind of trailblazers a little bit. I remember when I first learned

166
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:54,480
about System76, this would be, oh, I don't know, seven, eight, nine years ago, something

167
00:15:54,480 --> 00:16:00,160
like that. I felt like, oh, geez, these are people who are actually making some of my

168
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:06,000
ideals a reality. And that's powerful. That feels like the things we need in the world

169
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
a little bit more.

170
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:14,720
We're talking about this now very much from a System76 outward perspective. But when we're

171
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:20,240
building these things, it's much more about what our customers are able to do with the

172
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:25,840
products we make. We just want to give them the best possible tool because while we love

173
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:31,120
what we do and we're passionate about every single part in the stack, the customer and

174
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:37,540
what they're doing is what makes it all worthwhile when they're out there working to put humans

175
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:45,620
on Mars to cure cancer, to find a vaccine for COVID, to make autonomous vehicles. These

176
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:54,040
are incredible people making amazing advances for humanity. And we consider it our job to

177
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,720
build them the best tool.

178
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:03,840
If that's the subset of some of your customer base, I could see how that is very motivating

179
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:13,960
to know that you're, okay, maybe you're a tiny piece of some greater team who's advancing

180
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,840
space exploration and stuff like that. That feels pretty cool.

181
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:23,240
Yeah, it does. I mean, whenever SpaceX is landing, well, it's a little different today

182
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:28,360
because we're all spread out. But before being spread out, we would watch those landings.

183
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:34,880
We put them up on the big screen in the office and just the thrill of seeing that engine

184
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:45,560
land on a platform in the ocean. And there's the elation of that success for humanity and

185
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:51,280
we get to be, SpaceX is one of our customers. So it's just to be a tiny, tiny part of that

186
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,280
is special.

187
00:17:53,280 --> 00:18:00,080
I have recently listened to this fascinating podcast as a slight aside. It's called 13

188
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:09,960
Minutes to the Moon. And it's a sort of audio exploration of the last 13 minutes of communications

189
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:17,800
for some of the moon landings. So Apollo 11, Apollo 13. And one of the episodes that I

190
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:22,720
would love to share with everyone is one where they explore the computer systems that went

191
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:31,280
into making all of that possible. And I just started thinking of some of our small Linux

192
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,920
based manufacturers who are kind of doing some similar things. And the computer on the

193
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:42,360
spaceship was like custom built and in that day was a tiny thing and was built just to

194
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:47,880
do enough. It had no room for expansion, but it did everything it needed to. And that was

195
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:53,600
a fascinating exploration. And it feels like that history is repeating again here in a

196
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:59,080
tiny way, you know, that some of your efforts, because, you know, all of that space exploration

197
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:03,440
stuff takes thousands and thousands of people in so many different industries. And so to

198
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:08,400
be a part of that is kind of, kind of cool, kind of a slice of history.

199
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:14,040
Yeah. Well, in a way you're talking about Linux in general. This is where there are

200
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:19,520
some things within our community that this was the way I thought also very, very early

201
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:26,800
on was that, well, if everyone would just work on this gnome desktop thing, then we

202
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:30,760
could make a better product and then, you know, everybody would just jump on board and

203
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:35,800
there wouldn't be any more proprietary windows and so forth. And I learned over the years

204
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,400
that that is not the point.

205
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,400
You've evolved.

206
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:47,960
Right. No, what's special about open source is that this thing that we know is the most

207
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:55,880
versatile and powerful thing, the computer that we've ever invented is limited, if it

208
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:01,320
weren't for open source, to just two proprietary operating systems. That seems absurd. You've

209
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:07,720
had more brands of cereal than operating systems. And this is the most versatile and powerful

210
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:16,120
thing we've ever made. I think that in and of itself is the reason that the variety and

211
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:21,520
innovation that occurs throughout the Linux ecosystem is so important. If you want a distribution

212
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:27,800
that's specific for penetration testing, you have that. If you want one that's very specific

213
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:37,160
for perhaps security and containerized workflows, then that exists. There should be more variety,

214
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:43,920
more desktop environments. There can be no, there's no such thing as too many Linux distributions.

215
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:49,120
Go out there and make things and build things because that specialization is how we got

216
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,120
to the moon.

217
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,120
Yeah, right.

218
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:55,080
Specialization in that computer is how we got there, that the ability for people to

219
00:20:55,080 --> 00:21:01,600
experiment and try and build for a special case is what Linux provides that cannot be

220
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,040
provided by proprietary software.

221
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:10,840
Well said. Let that sit for a bit. What has fascinated me as well in gaining in recent

222
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:19,180
years some insight into some of the development that goes into Linux and some of the collaborations

223
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:25,340
that happen behind the scenes is that despite some of these specializations, there's a lot

224
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:32,360
of collaboration happening between companies, between different distributions. And so it's

225
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:42,040
at once a collective effort and also an individual sort of vision with that kind of base foundation.

226
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:47,960
And that I found really fascinating because in our simplistic minds, or at least mine,

227
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:51,060
I sometimes thought it was like, oh, either people collaborate or they don't, but there's

228
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:56,720
this really beautiful mix from what I've seen. And is that your experience as well in the

229
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,840
past 15 years?

230
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:09,600
Absolutely. Yeah. There's no black and white. It's all the shades of gray. There are areas

231
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:15,040
that matter to our customers and therefore matter to us. And so that's where we spend

232
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:22,360
our time and effort. There are other companies with a different customer base who have different

233
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:27,660
requirements or needs and those companies work to suit those. And in the world of open

234
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:33,400
source where things cross, we get to work together where they're different. That's not

235
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:37,040
even competitive. It's just that they happen to be different.

236
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:44,980
Different is good. Different is very good. I'm interested a little bit more in sort of

237
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:52,860
young Carl and how system 76, the idea sort of came to fruition because I think we have

238
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:57,600
a good sense of what's happening now and it's all very exciting. But I'm curious, you know,

239
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:03,520
the 25 year old Carl who started this all and was chasing his vision, maybe without

240
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:08,400
knowing exactly where it would head, you know, what were you doing at that time? What sort

241
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:15,880
of was the spark that made you take the leap into creating your own business really? Can

242
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,040
you walk us through that a little bit?

243
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:26,120
It sounds like a dirty word to me now. I don't know why, but I was a consultant.

244
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:31,960
Oh yeah, it is dirty.

245
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:36,640
So I started out, actually I think it was 18 or 19, I started at Liston Technologies

246
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:44,360
as what they called a systems consultant, which is really a project manager who programmed

247
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:48,840
to PBXs. PBX is a private branch exchange. It's a phone system that goes into a company.

248
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:56,240
This was before VoIP was the new standard. So I would go in and talk to the, you know,

249
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:02,400
usually an operations VP of operations or somewhere along that line and discuss the

250
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,600
technology and the company and how the company operated and then apply the technology to

251
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:10,760
the way the company operated and make sure the project got done correctly.

252
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,760
That's important.

253
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:17,920
Right. But that also kind of created a, you know, I was, there's a lot of independence

254
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:25,440
and I only ate if I was doing projects. So there is a, you know, there is already that

255
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:32,300
kind of built in need to make something or to make something that was profitable and

256
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:37,880
had a good foundation. Because, you know, there's no such thing as a VC for consulting

257
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:45,600
individuals. So from that, I started moving to technology, offering more services, but

258
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:51,280
it was still just a man, one man shop really. It was just me helping companies get the most

259
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:56,480
that they could out of technology. And then a friend of mine and I were both into Linux

260
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:03,080
and we started talking about making a company and eventually a lot of beer and so a few

261
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:12,480
years later we started System76 and with that ambition to build a OEM that really showed

262
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:17,520
the progress and the polish that open source had become by that point.

263
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:25,720
It's not for lack of trying, but we attempted to get funding many times and were rejected

264
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:33,120
resoundingly with every attempt, sometimes nicely and sometimes not. I remember being

265
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:37,800
told once that we were, you know, we don't invest in box pushers.

266
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,800
Oh, ouch.

267
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:47,560
Yeah. That was another time I was told, well, you should probably get some gray hairs on

268
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:57,040
your board. Yeah. So I like to say that, well, instead of getting gray hairs on my board,

269
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:03,560
I just kept working until I got gray hair and it worked out just fine for us.

270
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:09,940
Was some of that rejection a blessing in disguise? Like, could you imagine what System76 might

271
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:15,360
be if that, you know, that cash came in? It would probably be very different.

272
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:21,880
I'm certain it would be different. I'm also certain that we would have probably fallen

273
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:29,660
into the typical trap of throwing people at problems instead of as is required when you

274
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:33,720
don't have funding, getting down into the nitty gritty details and then learning these

275
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:40,680
things on your own, how to get past the problems and challenges that are natural and building

276
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,160
and operating a company.

277
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:48,200
It sounds like the hard work that was required there versus, you know, large amounts of cash

278
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:54,920
that you could just spread around actually led to some sounder foundations and harder

279
00:26:54,920 --> 00:27:01,040
work, I'm sure. And you getting, you know, your hands dirty on a variety of different

280
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:05,280
projects and experiences within the company, which I'm sure is helping you today.

281
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:12,600
It certainly does. And those are things that I enjoy anyway. So in hindsight, I'm thankful

282
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:26,960
that no one stepped up or believed in us. It was great. I got the opportunity to build,

283
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:31,800
you know, imaging systems and drivers and supply chains and support teams and sales

284
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:39,880
teams and, you know, and work through each one of those and in doing so, I was the person

285
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:44,840
that worked in every department doing everything for a long time until we started hiring and

286
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:53,680
bringing people on. So doing it the hard way was better than had we had funding for kind

287
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:58,400
of leapfrogging those pains in the early days. When you're in the middle of it, it doesn't

288
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:08,720
feel that way. Not one bit. It feels painful and it was that type of thing where I worked

289
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:18,120
for three years every day and that was just what was required to just to get to where

290
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:22,900
we needed to be to hire people to start taking on different tasks and do different things

291
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:28,160
that were required of building a company. But I'm also kind of a workaholic, so I don't

292
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:36,200
know. It was painful and what's hard about working every day isn't necessarily that you're

293
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:40,480
working every day. It's that when you're doing it early on in the company, you're also doing

294
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:46,220
it without making any money. So you're hungry and you're working every day and you're worrying

295
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:52,040
about your house payment or your apartment or wherever you're living and you're just

296
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:56,680
waiting for it to crack open and start making a regular living.

297
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:03,280
How do you know to stick with it? You know, that seems like a really challenging problem

298
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:08,520
because it sounds like, you know, yesterday we were, you and I were talking about endurance

299
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:14,720
and sticking with things and yet, you know, you had almost almost a decade of sticking

300
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:19,160
with it and just believing in it. How do you, how do you, how did you maintain that, I suppose?

301
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:22,720
Well, I think it was two things. One being stubborn.

302
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:27,160
It's helpful in this case.

303
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:36,920
Yeah, it definitely is. And perhaps a bit naive. The other part was that I could tell

304
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:45,080
that people cared about what we were doing and wanted the product. That was there. The

305
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:49,880
money wasn't there from doing the work. It's just we were simply not big enough. But it

306
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:54,000
was clear that people did care and people wanted what we were making. We just had to

307
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,480
keep going until we, until it was sustainable.

308
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:06,240
Yeah. That's the challenge of any business, I suppose. You know, I'm curious if you would

309
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:12,160
give, you know, younger Carl a little bit of advice. What would that be? Is there anything

310
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,160
that comes to mind there?

311
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,160
No.

312
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:24,880
I feel like that's the kind of thing that if I had, if I'd given that some piece of

313
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:31,280
advice that the past would have been altered and I have no idea what would have happened.

314
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,560
Playing with time is dangerous, right?

315
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:42,200
Maybe not advice. What everyone needs is encouragement. So, you know, advice is good. And so I think

316
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:47,840
just like we're, you know, I've talked about here is that, say, stick with it. If you're

317
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:52,240
passionate about it and you love what you're doing, you feel like people care, then you

318
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:58,800
have very good chance of it succeeding. And so just keep sticking with it. There's a good

319
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:06,040
probability that you're going to come out the end doing something that matters to people.

320
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:13,100
And I think that's for a lot of people starting out and building things, encouragement and

321
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:20,540
knowing that, understanding that, yeah, I know it's challenging, but there's no replacing

322
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:26,960
going through the fire with just leapfrogging that effort. You just can't replace it.

323
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:33,360
Yeah. The experience you come out with on the other end is endlessly valuable, right?

324
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:41,280
And to be successful in a company, you have to do a lot of things really well. You don't

325
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:44,880
have to be perfect at everything, but you need to do marketing well, you need to do

326
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:49,520
engineering well, you need to do your sales and your support, you need to do them well.

327
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:52,800
And over time, you can become really, really good at it when you have the opportunity to

328
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:59,120
hire and bring on your team, the expertise in those areas that push your standards forward,

329
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:04,880
push you beyond what one person could ever do on their own. And in doing each one of

330
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:11,120
those different things well, it means that you've gained the experience that when I talk

331
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:16,160
to our director of marketing, we can get into the details about digital advertising and

332
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:21,760
return on advertising spend. And when I'm talking to Jeremy in engineering, we can get

333
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:28,480
into the details about firmware and firmware security and hardware enablement. And I can

334
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:39,120
talk to the support team about ways to take a situation that might be desired results

335
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:43,680
for the customer and using the technology that we've built to reach that result rather

336
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:51,600
than circumventing it with some older technology or something. So I'm nowhere near the expert

337
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:56,560
that all of these folks are in their different areas, but I've had enough experience that

338
00:32:56,560 --> 00:33:03,360
I can discuss these things with them in enough depth and detail that I can help them.

339
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:10,480
It sounds to me like what you're an expert in is bringing experts together and that has

340
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:17,360
huge value. Bringing people together with a shared vision has an endless possibility

341
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:21,520
to it. And so that sounds like quite a gift to the world, really.

342
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:31,440
The things that people can do are incredible. And so yeah, to be around the experts and

343
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:41,280
they're just watching them in their craft and seeing what's possible is quite satisfying.

344
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:44,960
Hopefully you feel that every single day too, and it sounds like you do.

345
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:51,920
Yeah, every day. It's just an honor to be a part of a team building and incredible things.

346
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:59,200
Well, lucky you. I wanted to touch a little bit because our audience might be interested.

347
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:06,960
I know you and Chris Fisher, Jupiter Broadcasting, I don't know, what do I call him?

348
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:12,480
Prospector, the guy who's been around forever doing the things we love. I was curious,

349
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:16,960
you guys have a long history there. You started maybe around the same time

350
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:22,320
and you've been friends for a long time. Anytime I see Chris, it's like seeing an

351
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:28,240
old friend and you get that warm feeling inside, right? Yeah, so we started about the same time

352
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:32,960
and he started with Jupiter Broadcasting. So it was just this kind of symbiotic relationship.

353
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:38,240
They were talking about Linux, we were building Linux computers. And so we could put computers

354
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:45,600
in their hands to provide content and different things that they could discuss on the show.

355
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:54,320
I think on one of them we sent this Leopard Extreme desktop and it's the most powerful

356
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:59,840
hardware that's available at the moment. And Chris and Brian were doing a show on it and

357
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:11,200
Brian hugged it and kissed it and I think he might have licked it. But it was just always fun

358
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:19,280
watching Chris and the shows and the things that he's done over the years. I just take a lot of

359
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:26,240
pleasure in seeing other people grow and succeed and what they've done. And so seeing what Chris

360
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:33,520
has done has been a real pleasure to watch. Yeah, I agree completely. And like you were just

361
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:38,320
mentioning for you, I feel really lucky to be a part of it now and to have watched it sort of

362
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:46,080
grow to where it is. So kudos to the audience for supporting everyone. It's a strange thing

363
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:50,400
thinking back because I actually don't feel very different than the 25 year old Carl.

364
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:57,440
Right. You're still Carl. I'm the 40 year old Carl. I don't feel that different. But we are,

365
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:01,840
of course, different. If we're not different than we were, then that means we never got better. We

366
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:07,120
never advanced. We never pushed forward. And there are certainly lots of things I learned.

367
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:12,960
I guess now Chris and I are getting to be the old guys in the room.

368
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:31,360
I mean that lovingly, Chris. But I guess now we have the responsibility to encourage and help

369
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:37,920
those folks that are the 25 year old versions of us working to advance society as well.

370
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,680
It's your job to inspire.

371
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:46,160
Yeah. Let's inspire people and bring them up. And you can only see what's possible if you're

372
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:52,960
encouraging and enabling people. There's enough breaking people down in the world.

373
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,360
There's no reason to be a part of that.

374
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,800
It's not constructive anyways.

375
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,200
No. No one gets anywhere that way.

376
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,800
Is there something you're looking forward to in the next five or so years? Either

377
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:08,720
something you're working on personally or within System76 or just some technology coming our way?

378
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:16,960
Well, this is a pivotal and exciting time for us because right now we've designed and

379
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:21,360
we're now manufacturing desktops in our own factory.

380
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:27,360
Which full stop is pretty unbelievable, right? To think where that's come, it's quite something.

381
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:33,040
Just walking in there and seeing it and feeling it and all the motion and all the machines and

382
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:42,160
everything working is a thrill. It's incredible. I just want to take all of that and make more stuff.

383
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:48,080
That's where we're at today. Now we're learning new techniques. We're learning precision milling

384
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:54,240
because precision milling can be used for manufacturing laptops. Our step in between

385
00:37:54,240 --> 00:38:01,040
desktops and laptops, we're working on some of those techniques and expertise. Well, it was

386
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:05,680
today, but it's actually two days from now. I get to go in and work with the machinists and

387
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:13,520
mechanical engineers on our new Haas mill. That's going to be a lot of fun. I like to understand

388
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:18,640
the machines because then I get to apply what the machines are capable of in our product design.

389
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:25,920
I get to go see the machines and work on the mill a bit. Then from there, we'll start working

390
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:30,880
on our continued additional work on bringing our laptop design and manufacturing in-house.

391
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:34,880
That, of course, will be a huge watershed moment for us as a company.

392
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:38,880
I can't wait to celebrate it with you guys. Is there something you would like to put out

393
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:43,040
to the community? Maybe an ask of the community, something you'd like them to

394
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:48,640
try, something you'd like them to think about, something you'd like them to go see or visit?

395
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:54,160
Absolutely. The thing that comes to mind when I'm thinking about the open source community is

396
00:38:54,160 --> 00:39:02,640
it's vibrant. It is the wellspring of creativity and innovation in technology today. My message to

397
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:13,520
the community would be to be bold. Anything that you've seen, we don't have to do copy features or

398
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:18,320
clone things, do any of those types of things. Whatever Microsoft and Apple are doing, who cares?

399
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:24,400
Be bold, be brave, go out and make stuff. Try things, break stuff, just-

400
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,600
Push the envelope.

401
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:31,040
Push the envelope, right. You can tell. You have a pretty good idea what's going to happen.

402
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:43,680
Let's say we try to build an operating system that's more like an iOS because that was successful

403
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:49,200
for them. They've done that and they've been successful at it. It's already done. If we're

404
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:57,840
going to build something, then we can certainly learn from prior art and we should, but we have

405
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:03,520
to be bold and innovative and creative and push the envelope to really make a difference for people.

406
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:10,480
Otherwise, it's just not going to be exciting enough or valuable enough to

407
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,280
turn heads. Turning heads is where it's all about.

408
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:19,120
I think one thing I'm realizing by having these brunch conversations with a variety of people as

409
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:31,920
well is that anyone can have that boldness and to go do a thing. That's the beauty of open source,

410
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:37,280
but also the beauty of the time we live in is that you have vision and a little bit of

411
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:46,480
stick-to-itiveness, I suppose. You can create some pretty amazing things with some pretty basic

412
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:54,400
tools. You grab a laptop and you can build an entire business on one tool. That sounds like

413
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,360
some great advice for anyone, anywhere, really.

414
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:07,520
Yeah. System76 was built with a desktop, a VoIP phone, and a lot of grit. That was it.

415
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:11,360
And I think the grit is the most important part in that recipe, right?

416
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,240
Probably so.

417
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:19,840
Well, Carl, if people wanted to get in touch with you, where would they reach you?

418
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:25,600
It's carlruchelle at twitter.com or my Twitter account is carlruchelle at twitter.com.

419
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:28,720
Or my handle is carlruchelle at twitter.

420
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:37,440
And I want to say thanks so much for joining me with this conversation. I had a lot of fun

421
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,160
and I hope we get to do this again soon.

422
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:43,760
Hell yeah. It was a pleasure. I really appreciate you having me on.

423
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:57,520
Well, thank you.
