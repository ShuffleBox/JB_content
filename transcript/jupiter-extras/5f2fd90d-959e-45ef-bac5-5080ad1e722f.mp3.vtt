00:00.000 --> 00:15.000
Well, hello, everyone. Welcome to Brunch with Brent. I'm Brent Gervais and joining me today,

00:15.000 --> 00:18.400
I'm very excited, is Philip Muller. Philip, how are you doing?

00:18.400 --> 00:19.640
I'm fine. How are you?

00:19.640 --> 00:25.200
I'm doing really good. Thanks for joining me. Many will know you from your involvement with

00:25.200 --> 00:33.200
Manjaro. For those who haven't heard of Manjaro, could you give us a one to two sentence introduction

00:33.200 --> 00:34.200
to it?

00:34.200 --> 00:39.960
Well, Manjaro is a Linux distribution or an OS where you can have a free operating system

00:39.960 --> 00:46.840
with a lot of desktops. So we have the standard Xfce, KDE, and GNOME, and many more in our

00:46.840 --> 00:54.400
community like Deepin, E3, MATE, and so on.

00:54.400 --> 00:57.040
Sounds like you have all of them.

00:57.040 --> 00:59.240
Mostly, yes, yeah.

00:59.240 --> 01:03.760
Which is no small feat either. It feels like, you know, those are some of the community

01:03.760 --> 01:09.440
additions you were mentioning there. And it sounds like there is this really large community

01:09.440 --> 01:16.360
around Manjaro that is kind of coming together and making a lot of it happen. I would imagine

01:16.360 --> 01:18.440
for you that feels exciting.

01:18.440 --> 01:24.680
Yes, it is exciting because a lot of people are there and we created a tool so everybody

01:24.680 --> 01:30.840
can use it and create their own Manjaro edition. So all the official versions are just examples

01:30.840 --> 01:37.840
and the examples are so good that we got some momentum there and everybody is liking them

01:37.840 --> 01:44.100
and try to put out their own version of Manjaro and we don't hinder them to do that.

01:44.100 --> 01:50.240
That's kind of the open source spirit, right? Here are the tools we used and do with them

01:50.240 --> 01:56.000
what you will. But it sounds like that is kind of exciting for the community as well

01:56.000 --> 02:01.280
because there's whichever desktop you would like to use is definitely available as one

02:01.280 --> 02:02.280
example.

02:02.280 --> 02:07.560
Yeah, we have a lot of varieties and some niche stuff like only window managers and

02:07.560 --> 02:14.000
people put even their own new creation on our platform cause it's easy to create the

02:14.000 --> 02:20.800
base system and then put their own operating system or desktop environment on it. The latest

02:20.800 --> 02:27.880
what we have is the Jade desktop, just another desktop by Vitor and he is our homepage creator

02:27.880 --> 02:34.880
and he said, hey, when I use HTML and web designs, then I create an own version of Manjaro

02:34.880 --> 02:41.600
and use only JavaScript and stuff like that. And boom, we have a new, and I think the last

02:41.600 --> 02:48.800
version, which is the first alpha version I did just yesterday, loaded up and he posted

02:48.800 --> 02:54.600
me back a YouTube video about the newest version of Manjaro and he laughed at me and asked

02:54.600 --> 03:01.880
why I, well, he used the old version three years ago from back then and didn't review

03:01.880 --> 03:06.560
the new one. So I missed it a little bit.

03:06.560 --> 03:11.360
That's funny. And so if someone wanted to go see that, for instance, where could they

03:11.360 --> 03:12.360
go check that out?

03:12.360 --> 03:19.480
Well, they can go to our download page and to the OSDN servers and it's in the community

03:19.480 --> 03:21.360
folder and it's called Jade.

03:21.360 --> 03:22.360
Perfect.

03:22.360 --> 03:29.360
It's the desktop, but we have it named as WebDat cause Jade is trademarked, so we cannot

03:29.360 --> 03:31.440
use Jade. So for that reason.

03:31.440 --> 03:38.400
Got it. Yeah. The joys of trademarks. I did skip over sort of how important you are to

03:38.400 --> 03:45.240
the Manjaro project. As far as I understand, you co-founded it with a few others back in,

03:45.240 --> 03:50.320
oh, I don't know, like something like eight or so years ago. Was it in 2012, 2011?

03:50.320 --> 03:58.160
It was 2011. It was, yes. It was kind of funny cause I was back then in a different project

03:58.160 --> 04:04.800
that was called the Chakra project, which was emerged out of the Kadimod project, which

04:04.800 --> 04:11.600
was again an addition of just the KDE packages in split version cause back then Arch Linux

04:11.600 --> 04:22.720
didn't had, so it's like the KDE in one package and more or whatever applications there are,

04:22.720 --> 04:29.040
they always were packed in this huge tarballs and you had always this issue with getting

04:29.040 --> 04:35.280
only one application and we said KD mod would be that modification and we created split

04:35.280 --> 04:42.440
packages and it was always the Kadimod game chasing Arch cause whenever they updated library,

04:42.440 --> 04:44.080
we had to repack our packages.

04:44.080 --> 04:50.160
Oh my goodness. And that's quite a bit of work for seemingly nothing, right? Like that

04:50.160 --> 04:52.280
was sort of the motivation then?

04:52.280 --> 04:57.400
To create the Chakra project cause we said, okay, we can back then take the package bills

04:57.400 --> 05:02.600
and create our own base system. Only the package is what we need. So we did a semi-rolling

05:02.600 --> 05:10.960
version like a solid base system and put only then our Kadimod packages on our top and it

05:10.960 --> 05:21.200
worked I think three years and then the project itself split it up. So one of the female developers

05:21.200 --> 05:27.960
created the Chaos project, it was Anke and I was a little bit not with the team anymore

05:27.960 --> 05:34.240
and looked for something else and then there was Roland Singer and he has this nice installer

05:34.240 --> 05:42.440
for Arch called Manjaro and I said, hey, let's meet up cause I like to see what you guys

05:42.440 --> 05:48.800
are up to cause I had a project and it's similar and maybe we find something better to do a

05:48.800 --> 05:55.340
thing which might be last longer as just installer. And it was really funny cause he lived two

05:55.340 --> 06:00.960
towns away. So I went in my car, drove over to him and had a cup of coffee with him and

06:00.960 --> 06:09.080
talked about it and he said, yes, let's do it. And so it started and yeah, there we are.

06:09.080 --> 06:14.820
I think most open source projects don't necessarily start over a cup of coffee. So that actually

06:14.820 --> 06:20.880
sounds like a really nice way to go about it. And quite clearly, you both seem to have

06:20.880 --> 06:27.600
gotten along and it was just the two of you who kind of were there in the beginning or

06:27.600 --> 06:29.760
was there a bit of a community surrounding you as well?

06:29.760 --> 06:36.060
No, we had also one who was doing the artists and the theming, creating wallpapers and stuff.

06:36.060 --> 06:41.920
And we had a French teacher who was doing the package manager. So we were four people

06:41.920 --> 06:48.560
starting it up and I said, okay, let's do it properly. Get one year dark, really dark.

06:48.560 --> 06:54.760
Nobody know what we're doing. And we established all the base systems. And then out of that,

06:54.760 --> 07:00.640
we emerged and said, here is the new version of Manjaro, which is not arch. It's not based

07:00.640 --> 07:07.600
on arch. It is just using the packages, but we have our own servers and yeah, it's something

07:07.600 --> 07:09.960
new and you can install it easily.

07:09.960 --> 07:17.200
And how does it feel like Manjaro has sort of evolved for you from that beginning year,

07:17.200 --> 07:19.800
for instance, and where it is now?

07:19.800 --> 07:27.060
In the beginning, we only focused on one desktop environment, which was Xfce. And then we started

07:27.060 --> 07:33.680
to see, okay, Roland liked to have the GNOME desktop, so he was keen to use that. So we

07:33.680 --> 07:39.920
added that as well. And since I had the past with the KDE, I said, okay, beside Xfce, I

07:39.920 --> 07:46.080
would also do KDE and we had the main editions and we kept them maintained a couple years

07:46.080 --> 07:48.200
ago or so.

07:48.200 --> 07:51.880
And it seems like your team has grown as well. You've got quite a few people on the team's

07:51.880 --> 07:56.040
page now and I would imagine lots of community contributions.

07:56.040 --> 08:02.040
Exactly. So we have 14 people in the core team and many more as forum moderators. So

08:02.040 --> 08:10.200
yeah, a lot of people are joined the project and now we have this new thing called Manjaro

08:10.200 --> 08:16.600
Company and with that we will establish the security of the operating system itself. And

08:16.600 --> 08:23.640
one of the goals is to employ people out of our community and give them an opportunity

08:23.640 --> 08:27.000
to do their hobby as the job if they want to.

08:27.000 --> 08:30.240
That sounds really interesting. Can you tell me a little bit more about the motivation

08:30.240 --> 08:31.240
behind that?

08:31.240 --> 08:38.640
Well, it was kind of fun. It started with a large donation of some person and the person

08:38.640 --> 08:44.640
came over and asked again and said, hey, let's do it properly. I want to meet you. And then

08:44.640 --> 08:51.480
we went over and this person was Clemens Tuners and he said, well, what is needed? And we

08:51.480 --> 08:59.280
talked about it and then in September 19 we signed the contracts and from there we went

08:59.280 --> 09:00.560
with the company.

09:00.560 --> 09:05.400
And so you are currently holding that CEO position. Is that right?

09:05.400 --> 09:11.240
Exactly. So I'm one of the CEOs. The second CEO is Bernard Landauer, who is from Austria.

09:11.240 --> 09:18.840
I met him also through the community and he was back then the community manager. And there

09:18.840 --> 09:25.920
was a nice thing called with the emails. We got a lot of emails, hey, you have momentum

09:25.920 --> 09:31.440
created and we want to create a project with you guys with the hardware. And the funny

09:31.440 --> 09:40.720
thing was, we got one time with starlabs, which is an UK company. And the second time

09:40.720 --> 09:45.360
with station x. And we went for the second company because the first company didn't have

09:45.360 --> 09:53.920
the homepage. And the CEO of station x was Eddie and Eddie said, okay, let's meet up

09:53.920 --> 09:59.920
in person. And we said, yes, why not? And Bernard said, okay, let's go to Salzburg.

09:59.920 --> 10:06.260
And in Salzburg, he knew someone who owned the Red Bull area with all the airplanes.

10:06.260 --> 10:12.080
So we were there on this. And since we did the research and Eddie was in pilot, so he

10:12.080 --> 10:21.200
was really keen that we meet on that airplane. And we did a normal tourist tour. And then

10:21.200 --> 10:25.960
we went over on the roll field, which is not part of the tourist tour and went into the

10:25.960 --> 10:33.480
garage and then we showed them how the airplanes get fixed. And it was all this old airplanes

10:33.480 --> 10:39.280
with the Spitfire and stuff like that. And our research was really good because his laptops

10:39.280 --> 10:44.440
also called the Spitfire because he was a fanatic of old airplanes. And this gave us

10:44.440 --> 10:53.160
the deal. So we went over to London and he has an office in London in an old building

10:53.160 --> 10:57.960
and also Batchelor Park, the second office. And we went there as well and did some YouTube

10:57.960 --> 11:02.040
videos like repairing the Spitfire and stuff like that. Doing a little bit of a tourist

11:02.040 --> 11:09.680
tour in the Batchelor Park, drinking a lot of pines with him and had really good fun

11:09.680 --> 11:17.320
and released the laptop. The laptop was 1k and back in 2007, as it was, it was too high

11:17.320 --> 11:26.200
and we didn't sell as many as we thought. So this project died, but we kept the relationship.

11:26.200 --> 11:32.680
And yeah, so recently, Eddie telegrammed me and said, Hey, Philip, I need a laptop, which

11:32.680 --> 11:39.800
Mancero laptop you recommend to me and said, let me check with our vendors, which of them

11:39.800 --> 11:40.800
best for you.

11:40.800 --> 11:43.560
And check if there's one that's still called the Spitfire, right?

11:43.560 --> 11:51.320
No, I didn't call it the Spitfire in Tuxedo laptops, the same laptop called Infinity Book.

11:51.320 --> 11:58.280
And then we got the second time written by Starlabs and we had no time because we weren't

11:58.280 --> 12:04.000
involved with Tuxedo. And then the third time is a charm. Starlabs is also one of our vendors.

12:04.000 --> 12:11.640
So if you are interesting and keep pushing us and we have the right time, then you might

12:11.640 --> 12:13.280
get a partnership with Mancero.

12:13.280 --> 12:18.720
Yeah, it sounds to me like hardware has been a really interesting area lately. I know you've

12:18.720 --> 12:24.160
joined us on Linux Unplugged quite a few times in the last several weeks, just talking about

12:24.160 --> 12:29.200
some of the updates to hardware that's available there. And I would imagine for the project

12:29.200 --> 12:34.720
that probably seems really motivating as well, because not only are you creating software,

12:34.720 --> 12:38.520
but hardware that's so nicely paired with it, and you're creating these relationships

12:38.520 --> 12:47.080
as well. Does that feel sort of like a nice round way of approaching open source software

12:47.080 --> 12:48.880
and hardware for you in the project?

12:48.880 --> 12:55.360
Well, the operating system itself is always free. And if you wanted to gain some revenue

12:55.360 --> 13:00.080
out of it or something like that, you have to create projects around it. And having a

13:00.080 --> 13:07.320
hardware project might help you to get some traction out. And based on the sales, the

13:07.320 --> 13:12.920
company earns a little bit. And also the other companies gain more customers because our

13:12.920 --> 13:21.840
community is really large. And each partner we look up is have to have the same vibe.

13:21.840 --> 13:31.640
So Tuxedo, we met up in a trade show in Chemnitz, north of Germany. And we were actually at

13:31.640 --> 13:38.040
the same hotel. And one of my colleagues said, hey, there's a Tuxedo car. And he had his

13:38.040 --> 13:42.760
magnet stickers. And he plastered the car full of the magnet stickers. We went the next

13:42.760 --> 13:48.240
day to our booth, and then some new person is coming over from Tuxedo and said, hey,

13:48.240 --> 13:52.600
what the heck? Why he plastered our car with the stickers? How we can take them off? We

13:52.600 --> 13:58.680
said, hey, they're magnet sticks. Easy going. Enjoy the simplicity. And it was so funny.

13:58.680 --> 14:07.640
And that's how we met them. And a year before we met Pine64 in Forstam, also a trade show

14:07.640 --> 14:13.240
where everybody you meet there and one of them, Lucas, got ill. And we said, hey, we

14:13.240 --> 14:19.720
are a lot of people from Manjaro. And we went there, took over the booth and plastered again,

14:19.720 --> 14:27.040
the pine books. It was then the classic one with the Manjaro sticker, go to CEO and gave

14:27.040 --> 14:32.520
him a sticker on the t-shirt. And he said, hey, it looks good on me. And he put a sticker

14:32.520 --> 14:40.640
of him on my t-shirt. So we had the Manjaro pine 64 t-shirts there. From there we go.

14:40.640 --> 14:46.000
The power of stickers. Yeah. It sounds like you know how to have a lot of fun around some

14:46.000 --> 14:49.800
of these relationships. And why not? Right? They don't need to be all serious, but they

14:49.800 --> 14:54.340
do lead to some really neat collaborations, it sounds like. Yeah, you have to be special

14:54.340 --> 15:00.840
and to be remembered. So with those little tricks we do there and there, it works out

15:00.840 --> 15:06.080
just fine. It sounds to me like that's maybe something you learned in some of your sales

15:06.080 --> 15:10.940
experience because I know you did sales for quite a while before starting Manjaro. Can

15:10.940 --> 15:16.180
you tell us a little bit about that sort of part of your history? Well, I was a sales

15:16.180 --> 15:24.360
manager from Conrad Electronics, which is an electronic store in Germany, has many shops

15:24.360 --> 15:29.600
around Germany in the north and the south in the middle of Germany. And I was there

15:29.600 --> 15:35.920
a team lead for the telephone department and later on, additionally, for the computer department.

15:35.920 --> 15:42.160
So I always was with hardware and doing contracts, talking a lot of people and figuring out what

15:42.160 --> 15:47.880
they want and always selling them the right things and selling them additional things

15:47.880 --> 15:56.880
as well because that was a policy of the shop. And they go from selling lamps to telephone,

15:56.880 --> 16:03.560
mobile phones, some picture frames nobody uses after Christmas and everything else around

16:03.560 --> 16:11.760
the Fritz boxes, which is routers and computer as far as parts of computers, laptops, monitors

16:11.760 --> 16:18.640
and so on and so on. Everything what is electronic was my thing. And I used also Linux and when

16:18.640 --> 16:27.240
I got some money for Christmas, they gave us coupons and we had to use them in the shop.

16:27.240 --> 16:33.640
So I bought hardware and every year my hardware stack goes up and up and I didn't know what

16:33.640 --> 16:41.120
I should put on them. So I choose Linux and did my projects there. So was that your like

16:41.120 --> 16:46.000
around that timeline? Was that your first introduction to really using or getting familiar

16:46.000 --> 16:51.760
with Linux? No, it was pretty early because my father has a computer shop. And back in

16:51.760 --> 16:57.880
the day, I got the parts and I had to build a computer, install the operating system and

16:57.880 --> 17:11.080
do everything. So I had MS-DOS with my games and then Windows 3.1, XP, Millennium, 20,000

17:11.080 --> 17:18.680
and so on. And at some point I said, I don't like Windows anymore after I coded my application

17:18.680 --> 17:29.520
to rip some DVDs to learn English. And it was really fun because I was coding all the

17:29.520 --> 17:36.480
time. And then when my mom was angry and said, Hey, dinner is ready. And it didn't hear the

17:36.480 --> 17:46.360
power off. So I had to learn how to do backups. That's one way to learn, isn't it? Thanks mom.

17:46.360 --> 17:54.800
And based on that, I always bought the DVDs and I want to have them collected on my media

17:54.800 --> 18:01.960
server. So I had to figure out how to rip them on the hard drive and store them a little

18:01.960 --> 18:09.360
bit less compressed, but the same quality. I created a tool which helped me and it was

18:09.360 --> 18:15.640
one of those things. I changed also just doing one application when I do the operating system

18:15.640 --> 18:20.000
as well. So it sounds like almost a natural progression for you from a relatively young

18:20.000 --> 18:24.040
age sort of playing with hardware and software and that just evolving and evolving and evolving

18:24.040 --> 18:32.880
to where you are now, really. Did you ever think you'd be where you are today? No, actually

18:32.880 --> 18:40.560
not. I did a lot of things. I did IT support. I did refurbishing, repairing computers and

18:40.560 --> 18:48.600
stuff like that. And each station of my area of my life, I learned a little bit something

18:48.600 --> 18:54.160
new and all comes together. And now I'm here where I'm doing something totally different

18:54.160 --> 18:59.040
than before. It sounds like those evolutions for you these days are really quite exciting

18:59.040 --> 19:03.620
because you're getting to sort of meet people from all over the world and collaborate with

19:03.620 --> 19:09.580
people from all over. And you know, just our conversation before we hit record here today,

19:09.580 --> 19:14.480
you were talking about how you've sort of have your finger on the pulse of some of these

19:14.480 --> 19:19.680
sort of hardware companies and the software evolutions that are happening on a daily basis.

19:19.680 --> 19:26.360
I would imagine that feels pretty neat and rewarding as well. Yeah, because if you are

19:26.360 --> 19:34.200
in the pulse and develop and see what is going on and going with the flow, then you get emails,

19:34.200 --> 19:40.480
for example, from Canonical. So Wimpy, Martin Wimpress wrote me, hey, we have this Snapcraft

19:40.480 --> 19:48.760
summit in Montreal, and it would be keen to have you there. And I said, Why not? I can

19:48.760 --> 19:53.720
ask around in my team if somebody else wants to join as well. And what Wimpy said, Yes,

19:53.720 --> 20:00.320
why not? If you find some, then tell me. And we'll pay everything and we fly you guys over.

20:00.320 --> 20:08.280
But no one had time. So I flew over alone. And the goal was to have snaps integrated

20:08.280 --> 20:16.600
in Mancharo. And, well, I already had it integrated. And I said, Hey, what about making it full

20:16.600 --> 20:24.600
compatible equal to Ubuntu standards. And then I talked with Alan Pope and everybody

20:24.600 --> 20:32.120
else there. We had a lot of fun and some pines went around in Montreal, had dinners. And

20:32.120 --> 20:38.720
I was one of the persons who had a tuxedo laptop. So I did a little advocating with

20:38.720 --> 20:43.580
the hardware we had. And everybody was amazed about the battery life because I was always

20:43.580 --> 20:49.760
on. And even when they got their drinks, I was still hacking because I wanted to have

20:49.760 --> 20:58.800
the snaps thing done. And in the end, it was integrated and Wimpy and Alan was really off

20:58.800 --> 21:05.720
the hook. What only one developer of Mancharo achieved in this week of summit.

21:05.720 --> 21:10.480
I'm getting to know some of these really great people around the open source community. Like

21:10.480 --> 21:17.880
I did a brunch with Wimpy, with Martin Wimpris. And I also did one with Popey, Alan Pope,

21:17.880 --> 21:23.400
as well. And what I'm always amazed with and what I'm hearing from you here is all of these

21:23.400 --> 21:30.520
collaborations that are happening amongst projects to really forward everyone's ambitions.

21:30.520 --> 21:35.700
And it feels like we are all getting quite far together, especially when those interactions

21:35.700 --> 21:41.540
in person are happening. So kudos to you for sort of making that happen and being willing

21:41.540 --> 21:45.200
to work with them as well. I think that's super important.

21:45.200 --> 21:51.800
I think that the tribal wars, which is still there, is only at the communities and not

21:51.800 --> 21:59.440
the companies or projects itself. They are always helping each other. So if you see what's

21:59.440 --> 22:05.960
pine 64 community does, there are several groups trying to get the pine phone ready.

22:05.960 --> 22:11.680
But everybody else has a telegram chat and everybody is there and help each other. Here's

22:11.680 --> 22:18.560
a kernel bug and I fix it already take that patch and then it will also a new distribution.

22:18.560 --> 22:25.280
Other guys do the UI and put other stuffs together. So in the end, everybody's helping

22:25.280 --> 22:32.680
and this is also seen by canonical and other projects. I already met in person. And also

22:32.680 --> 22:41.120
calamari is one of the installer we use on our end. There is Adrian and last foster.

22:41.120 --> 22:49.440
I missed him. He was in the same pub, only two desks away. I didn't have time to change

22:49.440 --> 22:57.240
desks because it was interesting discussions on my desk. And last foster, which was this

22:57.240 --> 23:03.800
year, I met him in person and we connected there as well. And yeah, so it's always good

23:03.800 --> 23:11.280
to see a person in person cause if you only see an online, then the connection is not

23:11.280 --> 23:18.760
as solid. And if you meet them and drink with them, talk with them, chat with them in person,

23:18.760 --> 23:23.800
you make a really strong bond, which is long lasting and everybody understands you better

23:23.800 --> 23:28.680
as just texting and writing costs, lost in translation, stuff like that.

23:28.680 --> 23:33.100
Of course. And I would imagine with so many different languages, people collaborating

23:33.100 --> 23:38.880
in different countries, different continents, that sometimes it's nice to meet in person

23:38.880 --> 23:44.400
and to share some of those cultural differences too. I know that's some of what happened the

23:44.400 --> 23:50.080
last time I was with wimpy and poppy. We just laugh about all the differences, but that's

23:50.080 --> 23:56.920
such a nice way to connect and to then bring those in person relationships to, you know,

23:56.920 --> 24:03.200
the next four months of collaborations that you do online and through code and through

24:03.200 --> 24:09.880
chat. So that feels, I would imagine, especially important these days, considering many of

24:09.880 --> 24:15.720
us can't meet in person, but we will soon. So it sounds like those relationships, those

24:15.720 --> 24:18.640
investments that you've made in the past are really paying off.

24:18.640 --> 24:27.240
Yeah, you always have to be keen to keep the connections ongoing cause if you, if you stop

24:27.240 --> 24:33.840
them, maybe they will break up. But if you're one of the persons who's always on the buzzer,

24:33.840 --> 24:39.520
always following everything, keep in touch with them, then it's good. And they will help

24:39.520 --> 24:44.840
you as well and say, Hey, we have this new release. Did you test it already out? Or as

24:44.840 --> 24:49.960
we mentioned in the summit, you had these and that problems. We already fixed it. Here's

24:49.960 --> 24:54.380
the patch. Can you check it to double check it? And if everything is fine, we will give

24:54.380 --> 25:01.040
it to the new release. So those kinds of corporations only get established if you have meet them

25:01.040 --> 25:03.800
in person or at least did a video chat.

25:03.800 --> 25:09.780
Because I know how you're a bit of a person who looks forward. You were mentioning how

25:09.780 --> 25:15.140
you, you tend to look to the next five years and be a little bit maybe visionary or at

25:15.140 --> 25:19.160
least try to place your mind in the future to see what's possible. And I'm just curious

25:19.160 --> 25:25.560
if some of those collaborations help you point in the same direction as some other projects,

25:25.560 --> 25:29.280
not in a sort of, uh, well, more in a collaborative way, I suppose.

25:29.280 --> 25:34.880
Well, if you not look into the future or what the future might be, you never changed the

25:34.880 --> 25:39.920
future cause then why should you change it when everything what is now is perfect for

25:39.920 --> 25:47.760
you. And it's always a lack of vision in the future to see what can be done or what might

25:47.760 --> 25:55.840
have been done the better way. And we also learn from things we did in the past and maybe

25:55.840 --> 26:03.020
stuff will be more simplified as them now. And this is one of our things we do at Mancharo.

26:03.020 --> 26:09.480
So keep the tools open, keep them easy so everybody else can use them. And if there's

26:09.480 --> 26:14.880
a person said, Hey, why not do this? It's much more easier as the things you did in

26:14.880 --> 26:21.760
the past, then we will adopt and take the better things. And in the end, it is what

26:21.760 --> 26:27.640
it is. The operating system is there and we want that more people will use it.

26:27.640 --> 26:33.200
And are there some things that you have your eye on in the next five years that are kind

26:33.200 --> 26:38.680
of exciting you some, some things you maybe are your, your projects that really kind of

26:38.680 --> 26:39.680
get you inspired?

26:39.680 --> 26:45.280
Well, I think that the current project, which is really inspiring me is the pine phone.

26:45.280 --> 26:51.900
So we have now the opportunity to have a hardware which is open and everybody can hack on it.

26:51.900 --> 26:57.840
It's not restricted like you have an Android base and then you have to put your stuff on

26:57.840 --> 27:05.680
top of it. You can really use the hardware as is and use it like a normal PC and just

27:05.680 --> 27:12.920
plug stuff in, get it started and work with it. And just the first thing I think will

27:12.920 --> 27:18.160
help the whole open source community to get things also in small form factors.

27:18.160 --> 27:23.920
I can remember myself five years ago, imagining that this should be possible and that we should

27:23.920 --> 27:29.740
have this as an option. And at first I was a little disappointed that it took this long

27:29.740 --> 27:37.760
and yet it's still so exciting and it feels like there's some real momentum and lots of

27:37.760 --> 27:44.520
collaborations with different projects making it happen. So I could see why, you know, quite

27:44.520 --> 27:49.520
a bit of effort is going into it because it's a game changer that we really need. At least

27:49.520 --> 27:50.520
that's how I feel.

27:50.520 --> 27:56.580
Yeah, especially because the things are now everybody is starting to track you. And if

27:56.580 --> 28:01.600
you have a Linux phone, this is not happening because you are the king of the software as

28:01.600 --> 28:08.960
well and don't have to relate on big companies and you can verify everything what's happened

28:08.960 --> 28:15.880
on the devices and having the network with all the projects. One project is better to

28:15.880 --> 28:22.360
do applications, the other project is better to do the base UI and other projects doing

28:22.360 --> 28:27.640
better with the base system like kernel and libraries and stuff like that. And if you

28:27.640 --> 28:35.480
put everything together, then you have this Linux phone which is working and only small

28:35.480 --> 28:44.080
things, the distributions change will make it attractive to the community. But overall

28:44.080 --> 28:46.320
you use the same base.

28:46.320 --> 28:52.740
You know, I'm not a developer, but I'm certainly a deep user and it excites me to no end to

28:52.740 --> 28:56.880
know the possibilities that might come in the next five years around these kinds of

28:56.880 --> 28:57.880
projects.

28:57.880 --> 29:04.400
Yeah, but you don't have to be a developer. You can also join projects like you just translating

29:04.400 --> 29:10.640
stuff or what you do talking about the Linux community or about the trend is coming on

29:10.640 --> 29:15.960
or you want to translate stuff. So there is no need to be the developer itself. It's only

29:15.960 --> 29:21.480
one part of the community and there are a lot of other things you can do to help open

29:21.480 --> 29:27.280
source. Even if you're a singer or just an artist and provide a wallpaper, same thing.

29:27.280 --> 29:33.200
You know, I'm so glad you said that. And it's a theme that comes up relatively often during

29:33.200 --> 29:38.880
these conversations is that yes, yes, yes, the developers are great, but so too are the

29:38.880 --> 29:44.040
designers and so too are the translators and so too are the community managers and so too

29:44.040 --> 29:49.440
are all of the people who kind of collaborate to make this big open source city that we

29:49.440 --> 29:56.040
have run as it does. So thank you for mentioning that again. I think that's super important.

29:56.040 --> 30:01.280
You can be the expert on everything. So you have to have experts around you to help you

30:01.280 --> 30:09.760
to be the collective mind and then you can fight against Goliath.

30:09.760 --> 30:16.920
You did mention a little bit of privacy stuff earlier around the phone. I'm curious about

30:16.920 --> 30:22.640
where that sits for you. It's certainly a topic that I feel quite deeply about, but

30:22.640 --> 30:29.860
I don't find necessarily comes up as often as it should. Can you give me a sense of sort

30:29.860 --> 30:36.320
of what motivates you there? And also, I know it may be a little bit of a difference in

30:36.320 --> 30:42.280
Europe versus North America, just culturally around how important privacy feels.

30:42.280 --> 30:46.960
Well, I think the stickers on the webcam on your laptop is a common thing all over the

30:46.960 --> 30:54.800
world. And it's good to see that open source hardware have those kill switches for the

30:54.800 --> 31:00.720
pine phone, you have to open up the battery pack and under there you have some switches.

31:00.720 --> 31:10.040
And those you find also on the pine phone on Pinebook. And when we delivered the Pinebook

31:10.040 --> 31:17.960
Pro, we forgot to deactivate the kill switch for the VLAN. So everybody has to activate

31:17.960 --> 31:24.120
the Wi-Fi to get Wi-Fi. Right, right. No, we wanted to be secure. So that's a sort of

31:24.120 --> 31:31.360
teaching mistake. But it forces, I guess, an education around that we've figured out

31:31.360 --> 31:39.720
pretty well, because some users posted, Hey, there's no Wi-Fi. And we said, Yeah, we tested

31:39.720 --> 31:46.040
it was on the Wi-Fi. Okay, you know, and then pine 64. And as opposed to Hey, you have to

31:46.040 --> 31:50.720
do this switch and this keyboard combination, and then you have Wi-Fi.

31:50.720 --> 31:55.040
So that's on the hardware side of things. But how does it touch you sort of on the data

31:55.040 --> 32:01.480
side of things? And you know, all the services that are being offered these days, and just

32:01.480 --> 32:07.480
sort of hoovering up all of this personal stuff? How does that sit with you? And where

32:07.480 --> 32:09.640
do you feel like we should be going?

32:09.640 --> 32:15.840
And always depends how collective you are with your own daughter. Some people say, Hey,

32:15.840 --> 32:22.040
it doesn't matter if the government or companies earn money with my daughter, others say I

32:22.040 --> 32:28.120
know data at all, because I'm a private person, why should my daughter be free for everybody

32:28.120 --> 32:34.160
when I browse the net. So that's why Linux creates some projects like the p Hall was

32:34.160 --> 32:42.200
a Raspberry Pi, which will direct everything to DevNow. And then Amazon and Google can

32:42.200 --> 32:46.640
search DevNow for all the data, which is they're not anymore.

32:46.640 --> 32:49.040
They'll find quite a lot in there, I think,

32:49.040 --> 32:55.480
if we have an open source operating system, you can decide yourself how far you want to

32:55.480 --> 33:00.960
give your data away or not. And this is not given with Android and Apple phones anymore.

33:00.960 --> 33:06.980
I hope there's a day in the near future where that's the default for most people. But I'm

33:06.980 --> 33:12.840
unfortunately a little skeptical and not convinced. But I sure am glad we're headed that way,

33:12.840 --> 33:14.800
at least for some of our devices.

33:14.800 --> 33:20.740
Well, the phone, I don't think it will be soon. The one and only phone you have to use

33:20.740 --> 33:26.160
if you have online banking, you might need to steal an Android phone because the banks

33:26.160 --> 33:31.040
is really complicated to get them on board on a Linux phone. So of course, you have to

33:31.040 --> 33:39.760
have a standard. That's why Canonical is trying to get snaps out there. And Fedora over Gnome

33:39.760 --> 33:46.240
wants to spit out the Flatpak. So we have two systems and we will see if both of them

33:46.240 --> 33:53.120
have good, good ways. And if we see some banking applications, either on Flatpak or snaps,

33:53.120 --> 33:58.360
then maybe, you know, that's fascinating to me. I had never realized that that was a problem

33:58.360 --> 34:04.360
that some of these package standards could solve. But of course, it makes it easier for

34:04.360 --> 34:10.720
the banks to sort of roll out that software in one place. And hopefully, it can be fairly

34:10.720 --> 34:15.760
smooth and fairly quickly. But just occurred to me, like, thank you for sharing how those

34:15.760 --> 34:21.600
are, that's just an example of some of the problems that we are trying to deal with.

34:21.600 --> 34:26.920
And everybody, well, most of us are doing some banking, right? So these are the hurdles

34:26.920 --> 34:27.920
we have to go over.

34:27.920 --> 34:32.240
Yeah, you can create a lot of applications like video player, audio player and stuff

34:32.240 --> 34:37.160
like that. But if you have a key application, which is banking, you have a hurdle and you

34:37.160 --> 34:41.840
have to take that hurdle. And if you say, Okay, Linux distributions, how many are there

34:41.840 --> 34:48.600
200? And there is no standard and the bank director says, What the heck is Linux doesn't

34:48.600 --> 34:56.400
work. And if you say there is two versions, and there are companies behind them, and they

34:56.400 --> 35:02.280
help you to get your application even packaged for that. And if you get involved and call

35:02.280 --> 35:08.400
right with them, then you get the software in it. And that's how it goes. But you have

35:08.400 --> 35:14.960
to have persons out there talking to them and say, Hey, this software would be nice

35:14.960 --> 35:22.400
to have on Linux over and I really don't understand why people hate snaps and flat packs so much.

35:22.400 --> 35:27.080
Because there are so many distributions and we need a standard and the standard in Linux

35:27.080 --> 35:28.320
is not given yet.

35:28.320 --> 35:34.120
It sounds a little bit like I'm hearing your your sales voice there again, you know, going

35:34.120 --> 35:38.840
to see some of these companies and creating collaborations is a sales process. I know

35:38.840 --> 35:43.080
it might not be a monetary one, but it's a really important one to build those relationships

35:43.080 --> 35:51.680
and build that trust moving forward so that we can make this possible. So I really appreciate

35:51.680 --> 35:52.680
that perspective.

35:52.680 --> 35:53.840
Exactly. Yeah.

35:53.840 --> 36:02.680
One question I have for you that's come to mind for me in the last week is around development,

36:02.680 --> 36:08.760
specifically and how open source is a combination of so many different types of development,

36:08.760 --> 36:16.080
but I'm interested in your perspective on paid developers who work on open source versus

36:16.080 --> 36:22.880
unpaid developers. And do you have a sense of sort of where that is, where the trouble

36:22.880 --> 36:28.920
is with that, where you'd like it to be, how to make it sustainable, etc. It just feels

36:28.920 --> 36:34.760
like one of those things that we need to make sure exists. And so how do we take care of

36:34.760 --> 36:35.760
everyone?

36:35.760 --> 36:44.580
Well, if you start in Linux, around this Linux open source platform, you have the problem

36:44.580 --> 36:50.800
that operating systems and stuff you cannot sell. So you have to have something around

36:50.800 --> 36:55.840
it or you have some supporters which say, hey, I support you, what are you doing? If

36:55.840 --> 37:01.920
you concentrate on the operating system because I'm using it, then I pay you the money for

37:01.920 --> 37:10.960
that. And based on that, we can go on and make this company and employ people. So that's

37:10.960 --> 37:18.080
how we do it on our end. And sure, community developers are given and they do it in the

37:18.080 --> 37:24.800
spare time. And some of them do that for fun, because that's a hobby, and it will still

37:24.800 --> 37:31.520
be the hobby. And others say, Okay, if there's opportunity to make the hobby a real job,

37:31.520 --> 37:32.520
then why not?

37:32.520 --> 37:40.040
Mm hmm. Yeah, I hope we can all sort of support those who do such good work. I think that's

37:40.040 --> 37:47.000
really important. Philip, if there was something that you'd like to ask of the community, something

37:47.000 --> 37:52.500
you'd like them to go see experience, and maybe something you'd like them to think about,

37:52.500 --> 37:53.760
what would you put out there?

37:53.760 --> 38:00.880
Well, if you're interested in open source, then look not at the big projects like KDE

38:00.880 --> 38:06.680
and Nome and all the out there. And there are little projects as well, which might help

38:06.680 --> 38:15.120
you to understand how open source works cause less people less problems. And if you see

38:15.120 --> 38:21.880
a bug tracker in GitHub, and you have a solution for it, simply start provide a patch and merge

38:21.880 --> 38:29.320
request. And with that, you can get you started as a open source developer. And if you have

38:29.320 --> 38:36.720
the opportunity to join a company out of that, then you will be paid developer doing open

38:36.720 --> 38:45.160
source. So many ways and little projects like if XFC and others which are in need of developers,

38:45.160 --> 38:47.560
might will thank you to join them.

38:47.560 --> 38:54.200
Start small and grow. Sounds like a nice trajectory. If people wanted to get in contact with you,

38:54.200 --> 38:55.200
where would they reach you?

38:55.200 --> 39:01.680
They can write me an email, go to the forums, ping me there, write me a PM. Look at me at

39:01.680 --> 39:05.560
telegram. I have many ways to contact me.

39:05.560 --> 39:11.080
Great. And we'll certainly link to those. Philip, thank you so much for joining me today.

39:11.080 --> 39:15.440
I really appreciate your time. And I definitely learned a lot. So thank you.

39:15.440 --> 39:28.080
You're welcome. No problem.
