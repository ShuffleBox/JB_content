WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:14.400
Well, hello, everyone. This is Brunch with Brent. I am so pleased to be joined today

00:14.400 --> 00:17.680
by Alan Pope. Popey, how are you doing today?

00:17.680 --> 00:22.160
I'm doing very well. It's Friday, so end of the week, getting ready for the weekend.

00:22.160 --> 00:27.680
Of course. We're lucky to be recording on a Friday here. It's seeming very quiet this

00:27.680 --> 00:34.200
Friday, so it's a good day to be doing this kind of stuff. And of course, we are on completely

00:34.200 --> 00:37.520
different time zones for you. You're in the UK, right?

00:37.520 --> 00:44.040
Yeah, we're on the time zone. Everyone should be on, you know, UTC. Everyone should just

00:44.040 --> 00:46.240
switch to UTC.

00:46.240 --> 00:51.960
The standard. Everybody else is lesser. So for me, it's midday. For you, it's a little

00:51.960 --> 00:56.920
bit later. But yeah, great to be connected with you. Could you give us a little bit of

00:56.920 --> 01:00.760
introduction? Some people already know you. I know that. But can you introduce yourself

01:00.760 --> 01:02.920
for some of those who might not?

01:02.920 --> 01:10.040
Yeah, so I'm some guy on the internet who uses Ubuntu. And I used it enough that I got

01:10.040 --> 01:17.080
hired by Canonical to start working on Ubuntu. So since 2011, I've had a number of roles

01:17.080 --> 01:27.280
at Canonical. I'm, as I said, based in the UK. And I'm an enthusiastic fan of computers

01:27.280 --> 01:33.400
in general and IBM ThinkPads specifically. I also like cats.

01:33.400 --> 01:35.280
You're starting to get known for that, right?

01:35.280 --> 01:39.640
Yeah, just a bit.

01:39.640 --> 01:42.960
You were mentioning cats. I heard a cat in there somewhere.

01:42.960 --> 01:49.160
I live with my wife and two children. And we've had cats ever since we moved in together.

01:49.160 --> 01:56.960
And yeah, a bit of a fan of cats. Even just laying in bed at night, I'll browse the cats

01:56.960 --> 02:05.640
subreddit. And there's also a subreddit that Joe introduced me to called Chonkers. And

02:05.640 --> 02:13.080
it's like large cats. And so I'll just sit and browse our Chonkers and just tap my wife

02:13.080 --> 02:17.760
on the shoulder and show her my phone and it will just be a big fat cat waddling down

02:17.760 --> 02:19.480
the street or something.

02:19.480 --> 02:21.440
Perfect bedtime content, right?

02:21.440 --> 02:22.440
Exactly.

02:22.440 --> 02:27.000
That's pretty funny. Yeah, I did notice that you have a cat emoji in your Twitter handle

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
currently.

02:28.000 --> 02:41.520
I put emojis in my Twitter handle intentionally. And I try and insert emojis in fields on websites.

02:41.520 --> 02:45.600
Not to break them, but in order to uncover bugs, because there are some websites that

02:45.600 --> 02:53.280
still don't support emojis. And this all came about years ago when Fedora Linux had a code

02:53.280 --> 03:00.440
name called Schrodinger's cat. And the name Schrodinger has an apostrophe and an accented

03:00.440 --> 03:05.440
character in it and it broke the bug tracker and it broke a few tools around the release

03:05.440 --> 03:10.720
of Fedora. And someone in the Ubuntu project rather confidently claimed that it wouldn't

03:10.720 --> 03:16.360
happen here. And I thought, hmm, I bet it would. So I started changing my launchpad

03:16.360 --> 03:22.840
name to have emoji characters in and sure enough, I broke stuff. Most recently Thunderbird

03:22.840 --> 03:29.380
email client, if people get emails from me, they'll see a list of email and then mine

03:29.380 --> 03:37.960
will be in the middle at like 72 point text for some reason. There's some bug in Thunderbird,

03:37.960 --> 03:42.280
but it's great because they're scrolling through their email and then suddenly mine jumps out

03:42.280 --> 03:49.860
at them. So it was successful finding bugs by just putting emoji all over the place.

03:49.860 --> 03:52.600
So yeah, there was method behind that madness.

03:52.600 --> 03:55.560
I suppose you're getting a lot of replies to your emails as well.

03:55.560 --> 04:01.640
Well, more angry ones saying, Oh God, another email from Alan, especially people who are

04:01.640 --> 04:07.180
subscribed to bug trackers. Like if you subscribe to the launchpad bug tracker, it's mostly

04:07.180 --> 04:12.840
people who work for Canonical. So people who work on NumShell or back in the day Unity

04:12.840 --> 04:17.600
and I would file a bug and so they would get bug mail and it would say from Alan Pope and

04:17.600 --> 04:24.340
it would, my bugs would stand out a lot more than anyone else's because giant emoji penguin

04:24.340 --> 04:27.840
took up half their screen.

04:27.840 --> 04:30.400
That's one way to get things at the top of the priority.

04:30.400 --> 04:35.940
Exactly, exactly. But it uncovers, there's two things there. There's, I've got attention

04:35.940 --> 04:40.280
for the bug that I actually filed, but then there's also clearly a bug in their email

04:40.280 --> 04:44.280
client that we have now discovered that that also needs to be raised and that's probably

04:44.280 --> 04:48.720
going to be fixed more quickly because it annoys more people whenever I send them an

04:48.720 --> 04:52.240
email. So yeah, double win.

04:52.240 --> 04:58.560
Two bugs in one. That's great. But that shows just the importance as well of testing fringe

04:58.560 --> 05:05.820
cases, right? And you've kind of taken it upon yourself to test a whole bunch of services.

05:05.820 --> 05:10.760
Have you found any bugs in other services that you're not so related to on a daily basis?

05:10.760 --> 05:18.080
So sometimes, yeah, like I get frustrated when you sign up for something and they don't

05:18.080 --> 05:24.200
allow certain characters in email addresses or, you know, it's often, nerds will often

05:24.200 --> 05:29.220
tag their emails with a plus sign and some characters or a dash and some characters in

05:29.220 --> 05:36.200
order to, if the email address spreads and is used for sending unsolicited spam, you

05:36.200 --> 05:41.080
can tell where it originated, right? And there are a lot of websites that don't accept those

05:41.080 --> 05:44.560
tagged email addresses. They don't accept a plus sign as a valid character in an email

05:44.560 --> 05:50.440
and I kind of rant at those companies. But it's unfortunate because they probably just

05:50.440 --> 05:55.480
bought an off-the-shelf web package or they just didn't realize that a plus sign is something

05:55.480 --> 05:59.920
people use in email addresses and they're probably not going to fix it. But it still

05:59.920 --> 06:06.160
makes me a bit cross. Yeah, but I like breaking stuff. I like discovering, pushing the boundaries

06:06.160 --> 06:13.480
of software and doing stupid stuff with software in order to identify bugs. I did one a little

06:13.480 --> 06:18.560
while ago where I have a tendency to hold down keys on the keyboard to see if that breaks

06:18.560 --> 06:24.100
anything because people don't do that. And there's a couple I've found by doing this.

06:24.100 --> 06:29.960
If you hold down the mute button on a ThinkPad, there's a hardware mute button, you know,

06:29.960 --> 06:36.720
the media keys. Some years ago, I discovered that if you just hold that down, it mutes

06:36.720 --> 06:43.400
and then un-mutes, so auto-repeats. But after a while, it gets out of sync with the mute

06:43.400 --> 06:48.080
indicator on your desktop. So you get to the point where you press the mute key and the

06:48.080 --> 06:52.560
light comes on to say it's muted, but the thing goes off on the desktop to say you're

06:52.560 --> 06:58.480
not muted. And so they're completely out of sync. So I filed a bug and one of the guys

06:58.480 --> 07:02.680
on the desktop, I filed a bug saying, if you hold down the mute key, it gets out of sync

07:02.680 --> 07:07.080
with the indicator. And the reply from someone on the desktop team was, why would you do

07:07.080 --> 07:10.960
that? I'm like, doesn't matter. I did do it.

07:10.960 --> 07:16.160
Well, you know, I was, because I have a ThinkPad in front of me here in X220 with that mute

07:16.160 --> 07:20.000
button, I was tempted when you first started explaining it to give it a try. And then I

07:20.000 --> 07:22.040
thought, I better not.

07:22.040 --> 07:27.640
That's the other flip side is sometimes you find bugs that if you tell someone to do it,

07:27.640 --> 07:32.160
you have to give them a warning beforehand. So there was a similar bug where if you hold

07:32.160 --> 07:39.000
down the print screen key, when you press print screen, it flashes the screen either

07:39.000 --> 07:46.180
black or white to like a photo being taken and makes a photo sound and takes a screenshot.

07:46.180 --> 07:50.760
And it's, it does this kind of fade effect. And I discovered that the print screen key

07:50.760 --> 07:56.220
on one release of Ubuntu auto repeats. And so if you hold down the print screen key,

07:56.220 --> 08:03.040
it will rapidly fire off multiple screenshots and it will keep trying to flash the screen

08:03.040 --> 08:10.840
repeatedly causing your machine to eventually lock up because it's trying to do this 3D

08:10.840 --> 08:16.360
composited fade effect. And so I, I dropped by the Ubuntu desktop team channel and said,

08:16.360 --> 08:21.180
Hey, I think I've discovered a bug. Hold down the print screen key. One of the guys, Will

08:21.180 --> 08:26.800
Cook held down the print screen key and that, as far as he concerned, locked up his machine.

08:26.800 --> 08:31.640
And I, and he didn't see the very next line that I typed, which was by the way, this will

08:31.640 --> 08:40.680
lock up your machine fair warning. Yeah, a bit too late. So yeah, I like doing that kind

08:40.680 --> 08:41.680
of thing.

08:41.680 --> 08:44.920
I've learned recently that in software development and even like web development, those kinds

08:44.920 --> 08:49.760
of things, that's actually a surprisingly important part is having someone on the team

08:49.760 --> 08:54.080
or a few people or someone in the public who is intentionally trying to break things, you

08:54.080 --> 08:59.920
know, trying to push the boundaries of what the defined use cases perhaps. Is there a

08:59.920 --> 09:04.780
word for that kind of, I think it's fuzzy, fuzzy testing. Okay. I think you're fuzzing.

09:04.780 --> 09:08.400
Some people call it fuzzing. It's just like doing stuff that's outside the boundaries

09:08.400 --> 09:13.960
of a fixed set of tests. I'm not a QA person. I just, you know, pretend to be one really

09:13.960 --> 09:22.960
well. And it's not uncommon for people to re do a software release and then ping me

09:22.960 --> 09:27.000
and say, Hey, I've made this thing. And then within minutes I'll tell them I found a bug

09:27.000 --> 09:31.680
like very quickly. I'll find a bug because I'll just do stupid things with the software.

09:31.680 --> 09:37.460
Just like resize the window as small as possible or make the window as big as all of my displays

09:37.460 --> 09:43.280
just to see what the dialogue does. And, and that exploratory testing, you can't really

09:43.280 --> 09:48.040
automate. You need human beings to do stupid stuff because unfortunately human beings do

09:48.040 --> 09:49.800
stupid stuff.

09:49.800 --> 09:55.480
We're very good at that. Yeah. One of my pet peeves, and it happened to me two days ago,

09:55.480 --> 10:01.680
I was trying to sign up for a conference and I had to create an account and this happens

10:01.680 --> 10:05.160
all the time. You can probably relate, you've probably run into it, but I use a password

10:05.160 --> 10:09.960
manager, which everyone should, if you're not currently like get out of the nineties,

10:09.960 --> 10:14.120
I guess. Um, and so I use long passwords cause why not? They're all unique and stuff and

10:14.120 --> 10:19.440
I don't have to remember them. So, um, so my pet peeve is that on some registration

10:19.440 --> 10:25.180
pages, when you put in a long password, it auto truncates the password without really

10:25.180 --> 10:30.400
showing you or telling you or giving you any sort of warning. What? Yeah, I've run into

10:30.400 --> 10:35.880
this a few times. That's insane. I know. And so I put in the password and it doesn't complain

10:35.880 --> 10:41.400
and you hit okay. And then it immediately, you know, it should send you like a confirmation

10:41.400 --> 10:45.800
email so that you can, uh, you can say, yep, I actually did that, which you have a story

10:45.800 --> 10:51.800
about that, uh, which we might get into. Um, but upon clicking yes on that registration

10:51.800 --> 10:56.240
email and coming back to log in, the password doesn't work and it's because it gets truncated

10:56.240 --> 11:00.900
to some, I don't know, it, it's not an arbitrary number, but it's some kind of defined number

11:00.900 --> 11:04.880
in their system. And then, uh, and then you can't get in, you have to do, so I had to

11:04.880 --> 11:08.400
do a password reset immediately the first time I tried to log in, which is a pretty

11:08.400 --> 11:13.800
bad user experience. So I, whenever I run into that kind of stuff, I try to give someone

11:13.800 --> 11:18.240
some information, but, uh, yeah, it's surprising that we're still dealing with that kind of

11:18.240 --> 11:19.240
stuff.

11:19.240 --> 11:24.960
Yeah. I, I get frustrated with the web forms that don't let you copy and paste. I know

11:24.960 --> 11:29.520
my email address. I, you know, it's pretty short. I'm not going to mistype it. And if

11:29.520 --> 11:34.360
I just double click it and paste it in the next line, I'm pretty confident everything's

11:34.360 --> 11:39.280
going to be all right. But there are some websites where they use funky JavaScript to

11:39.280 --> 11:46.720
disable paste, um, which is just ridiculous. I mean, I guess, I guess, you know, you have

11:46.720 --> 11:54.160
to protect against the archetypal idiot user who, you know, is able to operate a microwave

11:54.160 --> 11:59.980
oven and nothing more powerful than that. But it doesn't help when there are people

11:59.980 --> 12:05.680
out there who actually can use these computer things quite well. And you just frustrate

12:05.680 --> 12:10.080
those people. It must be difficult balancing act. I'm glad I don't maintain websites for

12:10.080 --> 12:11.080
a living.

12:11.080 --> 12:14.320
That's what I've realized is sometimes by implementing some of those strategies, you're

12:14.320 --> 12:19.920
actually taking away from some strategies for really good security as well. So you're

12:19.920 --> 12:24.120
leaving everybody kind of in the middle. Uh, so you're not allowing bad security, but you're

12:24.120 --> 12:28.140
also not allowing very good security. You're just allowing like, like, like some websites

12:28.140 --> 12:32.400
having a eight character password must. It's like, you can't go over. You can't go under

12:32.400 --> 12:36.600
is like, well, really? Are we still with that? Eight past eight characters?

12:36.600 --> 12:41.480
Yeah, the fact that there is a finite number of eight character passwords just makes this

12:41.480 --> 12:42.480
just ludicrous.

12:42.480 --> 12:49.560
Yeah, I feel like we should be past that by now. Um, you ran in recently into a situation

12:49.560 --> 12:54.040
that we don't necessarily need to mention, uh, the business, but you ran into a situation

12:54.040 --> 12:59.200
where they weren't, uh, doing verification emails either. And, uh, that gave you a bit

12:59.200 --> 13:00.200
of trouble, right?

13:00.200 --> 13:03.840
Yeah, I see a lot of that. There's a lot of companies that will, they're eager for you

13:03.840 --> 13:08.080
to sign up for their service. And so just visiting their website and punching in your

13:08.080 --> 13:15.480
email address basically signs you up. And it's pretty common for me to get signed up

13:15.480 --> 13:21.800
for stuff where people have just put in an email address, maybe slightly wrong. Um, and

13:21.800 --> 13:27.000
I get the email because I own a domain. I get all emails for that domain. And so people

13:27.000 --> 13:33.960
will put in something at the domain.com. Um, and sometimes it's, uh, it can be seen as

13:33.960 --> 13:39.800
malicious and sometimes it's just stupidity, but I get signed up for stuff and then immediately

13:39.800 --> 13:45.840
get signed up for marketing emails or, you know, promotions for their other products.

13:45.840 --> 13:52.560
And those are really hard to get off when it's not Mike, I bought a thing from you.

13:52.560 --> 13:57.400
I am a customer. We have a relationship and I would like to hear about your new products.

13:57.400 --> 14:01.200
Please sign me up for your newsletter. It's not even that it's randomly out of the blue.

14:01.200 --> 14:05.920
I get signed up for a random thing that I've never heard of that I don't care about. I

14:05.920 --> 14:14.760
don't want, I will never use. And Oh, here comes the newsletter as well. It's like, no,

14:14.760 --> 14:21.000
just aggravating the situation. Yeah. I have a tendency to rant at people a little bit

14:21.000 --> 14:27.520
when they do that kind of stuff because it's just, it's just rude. It's just not nice.

14:27.520 --> 14:32.640
You got in contact with someone or at least you signaled to someone that that was happening.

14:32.640 --> 14:39.680
Did you get a good end result with them connecting with you? I felt kind of bad. I always, I,

14:39.680 --> 14:43.600
you know, I should do that count to 10, you know, look out the window, think about what

14:43.600 --> 14:48.840
this is like from their perspective. And then I just think, no, screw it. They should not

14:48.840 --> 14:53.040
have implemented this badly and they did, they should do better. And so I tweeted at

14:53.040 --> 14:59.800
them and got nothing. And then I got a newsletter the next day. I was like, okay, this is enough.

14:59.800 --> 15:04.200
So I tweeted at them again from another account and you know, rather aggressively said they're

15:04.200 --> 15:11.480
doing it wrong. And I got a sincere apology and you know, by the way, we use your products.

15:11.480 --> 15:20.680
I'm like, Oh God, why did you have to say that? I feel doubly guilty now, but you know,

15:20.680 --> 15:25.520
but they shouldn't have done it. You know, pragmatically speaking, they screwed up. It

15:25.520 --> 15:30.080
wasn't my fault that they signed me up for a thing I didn't ask for and then sign me

15:30.080 --> 15:35.320
up for their newsletter that I didn't ask for more things you didn't ask for.

15:35.320 --> 15:39.440
But I would consider that one of those bugs that you're talking about as well. It's like,

15:39.440 --> 15:44.240
it's just another form of bug, right? You know, it's a bug in their strategy, I guess,

15:44.240 --> 15:45.240
to get people on.

15:45.240 --> 15:51.760
Yeah. And I think too many people are keen to get people signed up and it's a numbers

15:51.760 --> 15:57.920
game. You know, once you get a certain number of thousands of people signed up, a percentage

15:57.920 --> 16:04.760
of those will be converted into paying customers. And you know, you've got to aggressively market

16:04.760 --> 16:12.840
at those people who are the 99.9% of non-paying customers to try and convert them and upsell

16:12.840 --> 16:19.960
them some special offer without considering that some of those 99.9% of people don't actually

16:19.960 --> 16:25.080
care and maybe they just signed up because they want to see what your product is.

16:25.080 --> 16:32.520
And you know, over the years I've signed up for products just to see what it is and see

16:32.520 --> 16:37.480
what the product can do. And I can probably figure that out myself from playing with a

16:37.480 --> 16:43.080
demo or reading their material on their website, which may be hidden behind a login screen.

16:43.080 --> 16:48.120
And then five years later I get a marketing email from them. I think, where the hell is

16:48.120 --> 16:52.240
this from? And I search my email and I find I signed up for them five years ago just to

16:52.240 --> 16:58.380
look at the product. I was like, you don't have to do that. You know, I very clearly

16:58.380 --> 17:05.800
am not an engaged participant in your community. I'm very, very obviously not a customer. Don't

17:05.800 --> 17:12.880
try and upsell to me by harvesting your entire email address portfolio of everyone who's

17:12.880 --> 17:18.120
ever mentioned your product or looked at it or breathed near your website. Not every single

17:18.120 --> 17:20.280
one of them can be converted into a customer.

17:20.280 --> 17:30.160
Yeah, exactly. I wanted to bring up, you mentioned a long time ago Wimpy, because I was going

17:30.160 --> 17:37.360
to think that the emojis in your Twitter handle were because of Wimpy's influence. I know

17:37.360 --> 17:42.120
he has a tendency to use them a little bit everywhere. And I thought that was your way

17:42.120 --> 17:48.360
of kind of supporting him in that. But I see now that there may be a different strategy

17:48.360 --> 17:49.360
there.

17:49.360 --> 17:57.000
But the other way around, I think I have unfortunately unleashed the beast on Martin of emoji because

17:57.000 --> 18:03.360
yeah, I've been putting emoji in all over the places since, well, since whoever it was

18:03.360 --> 18:08.560
on the Launchpad team erroneously thought that Launchpad was impervious to these kind

18:08.560 --> 18:13.080
of problems. But I haven't been using them quite so much on social media. So I think

18:13.080 --> 18:21.640
that's both of us. Because both Martin and I have access to a number of work social media

18:21.640 --> 18:28.540
accounts, both on our desktop browser and on our mobile phones. So yeah, we can often

18:28.540 --> 18:35.200
be out and about and have an idea for some social thing that we should do and post it.

18:35.200 --> 18:46.000
And Martin is very clear in basing his social posts on data. So he has data that suggests

18:46.000 --> 18:50.720
that if you put an image in a social post, it's going to perform better than just plain

18:50.720 --> 18:59.340
text. And shorter social posts perform better than longer ones. And ones that have up to

18:59.340 --> 19:04.360
three emojis perform better than the ones that have none. Now, they perform differently

19:04.360 --> 19:12.480
with different demographics, obviously. But that's the basis, I think, for where Martin's

19:12.480 --> 19:19.880
love of emoji comes from. And it's quite infectious. And so I've started using them as well quite

19:19.880 --> 19:25.800
a lot in my social posts. I did one today because as we recall, this is Black Friday.

19:25.800 --> 19:30.680
So I thought I'd do a social post about it being Black Friday and we have an Ubuntu exclusive

19:30.680 --> 19:38.080
special offer to download the desktop for free on Black Friday. And to follow it up

19:38.080 --> 19:41.800
with another tweet that was like note also available for free every other day of the

19:41.800 --> 19:42.800
year.

19:42.800 --> 19:43.800
I thought that was a great deal.

19:43.800 --> 19:53.400
Yeah, totally. It's while stocks last, grab that ISO image. Yeah, it's all pretty stupid.

19:53.400 --> 19:58.040
But it's just a bit of fun and a bit light hearted because sometimes the social media

19:58.040 --> 20:05.160
posts can seem very sterile, corporate, boring. And so we try and lighten the mood a little

20:05.160 --> 20:11.720
bit and make them a bit less dull. And we do that a little bit with emojis with some

20:11.720 --> 20:14.920
animated gifs, maybe a video here and there or something like that.

20:14.920 --> 20:19.160
Yeah, I think, you know, we have to remember that we are talking to other human beings

20:19.160 --> 20:26.600
who have some necessity for comedy in their lives as well, right? Martin explained in

20:26.600 --> 20:31.500
the brunch with Brent that we did together a few weeks ago, how exactly what you said

20:31.500 --> 20:39.000
data was driving that decision, but also his desire to just make the communities feel a

20:39.000 --> 20:43.680
little bit better, like to just bring some light heartedness to these otherwise, you

20:43.680 --> 20:48.240
know, sometimes very technical discussions, like a release post or something like that.

20:48.240 --> 20:50.000
And I thought that was really lovely.

20:50.000 --> 20:55.380
It's funny, we, we did a post a little while ago, which were one of when one of the releases

20:55.380 --> 21:01.920
came out, I think it was when 1904 came out, which is an interim non long term support

21:01.920 --> 21:10.800
release. And I put a poll up that I thought was fun. And it said something like 1904 is

21:10.800 --> 21:18.160
out, are you going to upgrade? And option one was LTS for life. Option two was, you

21:18.160 --> 21:22.960
know, I've already upgraded. I can't remember what option three was. Oh, option three was

21:22.960 --> 21:29.200
something like still running Ubuntu 7.10 or something like that. And the final one was

21:29.200 --> 21:34.920
by the way, I use arch. And whenever you do a poll on the internet, obviously, by the

21:34.920 --> 21:41.480
way, I use arch is the winner, of course, obviously. But we engaged with people replying

21:41.480 --> 21:46.480
and suggesting this was a stupid idea for a poll from Ubuntu to talk about, you know,

21:46.480 --> 21:52.120
a different Linux distro, which is a bit of fun. It's just, you know, it's Friday afternoon.

21:52.120 --> 21:56.880
People need a little bit of amusement in their life. And someone took a screen grab of that

21:56.880 --> 22:02.840
with the poll, posted it on Reddit, and was like, this isn't going well for them. As if

22:02.840 --> 22:08.400
what, like we're gonna change from being Ubuntu to like, right, that's it, I'm gonna quit

22:08.400 --> 22:13.720
and I'm switching to arch. As a result of this stupid poll I did on a Friday afternoon.

22:13.720 --> 22:18.960
It was just a bit of fun. But the replies were great. And they were like, you know,

22:18.960 --> 22:22.400
someone replied they're saying something like whoever's their social media manager is killing

22:22.400 --> 22:32.920
it. And I'm like, well, thanks. It's funny, though, how something that's intended to just

22:32.920 --> 22:38.240
be kind of light hearted can just get taken in so many directions. One of the things that

22:38.240 --> 22:48.520
we've always tried to do in the Ubuntu project is not rain on any other project. You generally

22:48.520 --> 22:56.960
won't find canonical employees and Ubuntu members dissing other projects. Like we won't

22:56.960 --> 23:04.360
talk down another Linux distribution or talk down the people who make another Linux distribution,

23:04.360 --> 23:10.120
because we're already 1% of the market. Like why? Why would we do that? Like my friend

23:10.120 --> 23:17.120
Michael Hall says, if you blow out someone else's candle, it doesn't make your candle

23:17.120 --> 23:22.720
any brighter. And so it doesn't make sense, even if we are competitors, and I use that

23:22.720 --> 23:27.820
in inverted commas, if we're competitors with these other distros, it doesn't do us any

23:27.820 --> 23:36.160
favors to knock them. And so since Ubuntu started, we've always strived to be positive

23:36.160 --> 23:43.280
and always strived with a code of conduct to not knock other distros. Now, that doesn't

23:43.280 --> 23:49.960
always work and sometimes people make mistakes and sometimes people are not completely positive

23:49.960 --> 23:56.120
and I fall into that trap sometimes too. But it's something we strive for and I wish more

23:56.120 --> 24:03.080
people did that. I think the Linux ecosystem would be a better place if we could each share

24:03.080 --> 24:12.080
the good work that each other is doing non-maliciously. So when Fedora puts out a release from the

24:12.080 --> 24:17.080
Ubuntu account, we'll congratulate them. When KDE put out a release, we congratulate them

24:17.080 --> 24:22.800
because we have quite a wide social reach and it's a good thing for us to point people

24:22.800 --> 24:28.760
at these projects because it doesn't do us any harm whatsoever to point at KDE or point

24:28.760 --> 24:36.340
at Fedora or point at Elementary or Manjaro and highlight their success because highlighting

24:36.340 --> 24:38.560
their success doesn't make us any worse.

24:38.560 --> 24:46.160
I can only agree completely. I know Wimpy mentioned the same thing in the conversation

24:46.160 --> 24:51.200
we had with his brunch and Rocco mentioned the same thing in his and I feel like it's

24:51.200 --> 24:59.480
a theme that is just continuing to propagate and I hope it really takes off for all of

24:59.480 --> 25:05.760
the people, you know, in the Reddit subs and all over social media and all of the places

25:05.760 --> 25:11.160
where you tend to find this negativity or at least this kind of, I don't know if it's

25:11.160 --> 25:14.920
a rivalry kind of nature, but it's, I agree with you completely. Like we're all on the

25:14.920 --> 25:16.320
same team.

25:16.320 --> 25:22.340
It's tribalism and validation. I installed this thing. If someone else says their thing

25:22.340 --> 25:29.600
is better, then maybe I was wrong and I can't be wrong. So people feel it's not a lot different

25:29.600 --> 25:36.880
than the rivalry between people who have one particular gaming device and people who have

25:36.880 --> 25:42.320
a different manufacturer's gaming device and that. It's all cooked up by the users.

25:42.320 --> 25:47.680
It's not cooked up by the manufacturers. There'll be a bit of tongue-in-cheek back and forth

25:47.680 --> 25:53.520
between Microsoft and Sony about the Xbox and the PlayStation, but if you get Xbox developers

25:53.520 --> 25:56.960
and PlayStation developers in the same room, they're going to talk to people like human

25:56.960 --> 26:02.640
beings. They're not going to be at each other's throats, just the same as when I went to the

26:02.640 --> 26:06.500
Linux application summit in Barcelona. There are people from Red Hat there. There's people

26:06.500 --> 26:13.440
from Purism, people from Pine. You know, we're all grown adults and we can all have conversations

26:13.440 --> 26:16.480
together. You don't have to turn everything into a cage fight.

26:16.480 --> 26:20.800
And I think the reality is that we are all connected with a bunch of the software that

26:20.800 --> 26:28.120
we're making, right? Lots of it is propagated in all of those distributions and a piece

26:28.120 --> 26:32.440
that someone writes might help someone else and or change someone else's perspective.

26:32.440 --> 26:36.380
So it's all really constructive. The way I've sort of come to see it, or at least challenged

26:36.380 --> 26:41.980
myself to see it recently, is there's a big difference between being right and wrong and

26:41.980 --> 26:48.520
just having preferences. And I think those two often get mixed up. You know, if a user

26:48.520 --> 26:53.840
has a preference of a certain piece of software or a gaming platform or distribution, that's

26:53.840 --> 26:56.560
very different than one being better than the other.

26:56.560 --> 27:01.000
Right. And it's very, it's sometimes very difficult for people to separate those two.

27:01.000 --> 27:09.920
And also in Ubuntu, we've sometimes made decisions where a small set of very vocal people will

27:09.920 --> 27:14.440
say that's wrong. You shouldn't do that. That's wrong. I prefer it like this and everyone

27:14.440 --> 27:20.080
prefers it like this. And it's like, well, you might be right in that you prefer it like

27:20.080 --> 27:27.880
that. But it's very difficult in the Linux community to be able to speak for everyone,

27:27.880 --> 27:32.960
because everyone has different tastes. And, you know, the fact that we moved the window

27:32.960 --> 27:38.400
control buttons from one side to the other side, deeply angered a small amount of people

27:38.400 --> 27:45.160
who were, you know, very vocal online. But it turns out most people are like, meh, they're

27:45.160 --> 27:49.440
over there now. Okay. Don't care. Where's the button? Oh, it's there. And they click

27:49.440 --> 27:54.640
it and they move on with their life because the window controls position on the screen

27:54.640 --> 27:59.120
is not the most important thing in their life. It turns out, opening the web browser and

27:59.120 --> 28:03.840
surfing Facebook or reading their email or placing a bet online or whatever it is.

28:03.840 --> 28:04.840
Getting something done.

28:04.840 --> 28:08.080
Yeah, getting stuff done is way more important than where the window controls are. And it's

28:08.080 --> 28:11.580
difficult having those conversations with very passionate people in the Linux community

28:11.580 --> 28:17.040
who feel like their perspective is the one true perspective.

28:17.040 --> 28:24.640
It makes me wonder, characters like maybe some Apple CEOs that we've seen having such

28:24.640 --> 28:32.160
a strong conviction that their ideas are the best ones. And sometimes that does push the

28:32.160 --> 28:34.600
envelope faster or further.

28:34.600 --> 28:42.840
Yeah. And, you know, I'm not trying to draw a parallel between an Apple CEO and the lead

28:42.840 --> 28:54.440
sponsor of the Ubuntu project and CEO of Canonical, but Mark Shuttleworth does have like, executive

28:54.440 --> 29:00.580
sign off on many things. There are many decisions that happen inside Ubuntu that are taken by

29:00.580 --> 29:07.640
people at all levels. And Mark may not be involved in those conversations at all about

29:07.640 --> 29:13.020
which version of which library is used or how a particular dialogue is designed and

29:13.020 --> 29:21.020
so on. But broad brush, he will have decision making power over things. And so for example,

29:21.020 --> 29:29.040
when we switched from GNOME 2 to Unity, that's largely a project driven by Mark, who was

29:29.040 --> 29:35.520
running the design team at the time. And so he will have received some flack and the company

29:35.520 --> 29:40.320
will have received some flack because of that decision. But he made that bold decision.

29:40.320 --> 29:48.500
And as a result of making that decision, I'm very confident that we sold more machines

29:48.500 --> 29:55.120
running Ubuntu using Unity than we ever did before that. And while some people don't like

29:55.120 --> 30:03.860
it, you need someone to take the hit for that, someone to take the can for making that decision.

30:03.860 --> 30:09.080
Now we may have introduced it too early. It might not have been ready. It might have been

30:09.080 --> 30:15.320
slow performance when it first released. And I've spoken to Mark about this publicly in

30:15.320 --> 30:19.880
interviews on the Ubuntu podcast. And he said, yep, we were too early with that. And there's

30:19.880 --> 30:23.400
some other things we may have been too early with. But sometimes you just have to push

30:23.400 --> 30:32.160
the envelope. And it needs someone like Mark to do that. Because the smaller distros where

30:32.160 --> 30:37.320
everything is done by a common consensus will often not have the push, the drive to try

30:37.320 --> 30:42.880
out those new things that, yeah, they might be controversial. They might annoy some people.

30:42.880 --> 30:46.760
But someone's got to try this. Otherwise, we're all going to be looking at motif windows

30:46.760 --> 30:52.000
and you know, GNOME 2 for the rest of our lives. Someone's got to push that stuff forward.

30:52.000 --> 30:57.000
There's something about being so confident with your own perspective that it becomes

30:57.000 --> 31:02.120
visionary and you can lead other people to sort of go in places that no one's ever been

31:02.120 --> 31:03.120
before.

31:03.120 --> 31:06.400
Doesn't mean we get it right all the time, though. Some people would say Ubuntu Phone

31:06.400 --> 31:11.280
was a complete failure in inverted commas. And I've seen that written online that Ubuntu

31:11.280 --> 31:16.240
Phone was a failure. And it's like, well, there were thousands of devices that shipped

31:16.240 --> 31:22.200
with Ubuntu Phone. That's like a drop in the ocean. That's very few devices in the grand

31:22.200 --> 31:25.880
scheme of things when you think of how many billions of Android devices there are out

31:25.880 --> 31:34.040
there. And we eventually canned the project and handed the open source parts over to the

31:34.040 --> 31:37.980
UBports guys and they've run with it and they've grown the community bigger than it ever was

31:37.980 --> 31:45.640
under Canonical and have supported more devices and have moved the project forward. But someone

31:45.640 --> 31:54.960
needed to actually have a go at doing that. And thankfully, Mark had the bags of money

31:54.960 --> 31:58.120
to throw at it to have a go at it, really.

31:58.120 --> 32:04.360
Well, and maybe it, you know, failure or success necessarily depends on what you're measuring.

32:04.360 --> 32:11.120
And so if you're measuring progress instead of total sales, then that's maybe a totally

32:11.120 --> 32:17.240
different picture. Or impact, you know, if you're trying to measure impact or innovation,

32:17.240 --> 32:21.920
for instance, and those kind of things, then failure or success isn't necessarily obvious.

32:21.920 --> 32:27.720
And it was also very difficult because the way it ended was with cutbacks within the

32:27.720 --> 32:31.960
company. And so that was very painful for the people who worked on it. It's very different

32:31.960 --> 32:36.320
from just drawing a line under it and saying, okay, we're not going to contribute to this

32:36.320 --> 32:42.640
thing anymore. And we'll make it open source. And everyone who wants to work on it can work

32:42.640 --> 32:49.560
on it. It was we're no longer going to work on this thing. And the staff that were working

32:49.560 --> 32:54.920
on it now no longer work for us. And so it was an incredibly painful time for those of

32:54.920 --> 33:01.980
us who worked at Canonical at the time to lose that project effectively, because some

33:01.980 --> 33:03.400
of our friends left the company.

33:03.400 --> 33:07.880
Yeah, that doesn't sound easy at all, right? When you when you put it that way. Maybe in

33:07.880 --> 33:14.640
that sense, it's a shame that you lost some great people as personal relationships, right?

33:14.640 --> 33:22.760
Right. But the flip side is, would the company still exist now? Two years later, if we hadn't

33:22.760 --> 33:23.820
done that?

33:23.820 --> 33:29.240
Those are the really hard decisions that some people in leadership positions have to make.

33:29.240 --> 33:32.560
And us as simple users, we're lucky not to have to make those, right?

33:32.560 --> 33:37.160
Right. And I don't have a time machine. So I can't tell in an alternate universe what

33:37.160 --> 33:40.840
would have happened if we'd carried on working on it and throw more money at it. I don't

33:40.840 --> 33:45.840
know. And I don't think anyone can know that we can guess, but it's hard to know.

33:45.840 --> 33:49.240
Can we talk about the Ubuntu podcast for a little bit?

33:49.240 --> 33:50.240
Sure.

33:50.240 --> 33:58.520
I was fascinated by Wimpy's story about how he got involved there and how you both are

33:58.520 --> 34:05.080
now sort of a tag team duo at conferences and things like that, which he said you would

34:05.080 --> 34:11.680
laugh about. I wondered a little bit how you got started in podcasting, because you had

34:11.680 --> 34:16.160
been doing it quite a bit earlier than Wimpy had, right? Can you walk us maybe through

34:16.160 --> 34:17.160
that a little bit?

34:17.160 --> 34:23.120
Yeah, so we started we're just coming to the end of our 12th season and we do one season

34:23.120 --> 34:30.320
a year. So whatever that is, 2007, sometime around there. So around about 2006, I was

34:30.320 --> 34:41.520
a community contributor to Ubuntu. And on the UK IRC channel, the Ubuntu UK IRC channel,

34:41.520 --> 34:48.040
we'd often have conversations about maybe there should be an Ubuntu podcast, who would

34:48.040 --> 34:57.000
do this. And at the time, I was a keen consumer of a number of podcasts. And I thought, yeah,

34:57.000 --> 35:03.480
I think we could probably do this. I think we can generate enough content to put out

35:03.480 --> 35:11.160
a show every other week or so, interview people, discuss what's going on in the project. And

35:11.160 --> 35:19.080
I contacted a few friends who I'd known through my local Linux user group. And also through

35:19.080 --> 35:27.360
the Ubuntu community in the UK and said, do you fancy doing this podcast thing? And we

35:27.360 --> 35:33.520
each went out and bought some hardware, bought microphones, mic stands, got a mixer. And

35:33.520 --> 35:40.400
everyone came over to my house and we recorded an episode and it took all day to record one

35:40.400 --> 35:41.400
episode.

35:41.400 --> 35:42.400
Oh no, how come?

35:42.400 --> 35:49.680
Well, we just didn't know what the hell we were doing. And we made some mistakes, like

35:49.680 --> 35:53.440
we recorded a segment and then we went and had a cup of tea and a biscuit and had a

35:53.440 --> 35:57.560
think about what the next segment was going to be. And then we go back in the room and

35:57.560 --> 36:03.840
sit there and record that segment. And we edited really heavily. Every um and er was

36:03.840 --> 36:14.680
edited out and it took a long time to post process those early episodes. And also the

36:14.680 --> 36:19.640
the fact that we were driving to each other's houses. So initially there was myself and

36:19.640 --> 36:29.360
Tony and Laura and Davey and we live 50, 60 miles away from each other, which I know by

36:29.360 --> 36:36.840
US scale is not a huge distance, but in the UK, nobody drives 50 miles to see a friend.

36:36.840 --> 36:42.900
Especially not to record a podcast. Like, yeah. So it it was it was a bit difficult,

36:42.900 --> 36:51.520
but we we once we got a few episodes under our belt and a UK VPS provider Bitfolk provided

36:51.520 --> 36:57.760
us with some hosting for free. And we got it all set up. It kind of started working

36:57.760 --> 37:06.260
and we would interview people who worked on Ubuntu and it we we started off very amateurish

37:06.260 --> 37:13.040
and the audio quality was terrible and it took ages to get an episode out the door.

37:13.040 --> 37:20.240
But I think we've after 12 years, we've streamlined it. Plus we we outsourced the editing to your

37:20.240 --> 37:22.960
good selves, which is most welcome.

37:22.960 --> 37:28.480
Yeah, those were kind of early days for podcasting really when you start to look at it. You know,

37:28.480 --> 37:35.000
you mentioned 2007 and there weren't really that many podcasts at that time compared to

37:35.000 --> 37:36.000
now, of course.

37:36.000 --> 37:43.040
Yeah. I mean, I remember there was a bunch of podcasts I used to listen to. There was

37:43.040 --> 37:49.480
the ones that Leo Laporte did, you know, Twit, that kind of stuff and the stuff I mean, the

37:49.480 --> 37:56.080
ones he still does now. And there was Dig Nation. That was Kevin Rose talking about,

37:56.080 --> 38:01.760
you know, whatever's popular on Dig at the time and a few others. And I used to commute

38:01.760 --> 38:06.600
a lot and I used to listen to them on my commute. And after a while I thought, yeah, I can do

38:06.600 --> 38:10.480
this. And there were a couple of Linux ones around at the time and they were pretty awful.

38:10.480 --> 38:16.040
And to the point where I remember falling asleep on the train listening to one.

38:16.040 --> 38:17.640
Oh, that's not a good sign.

38:17.640 --> 38:21.680
No, this is like, I reckon we could do better than this. And I'm not saying we're great

38:21.680 --> 38:29.220
at doing podcasts. I know we are amateurs. We are not particularly good microphone technique.

38:29.220 --> 38:34.880
You know, we um and err and we have, there are things that I would love to improve about

38:34.880 --> 38:42.000
the whole thing. But it's a bit of fun and there are some thousands of people who download

38:42.000 --> 38:47.200
it every week. And if we talk about something controversial, we get a lot of feedback. And

38:47.200 --> 38:50.600
there's a little community that's built up around it. Our little Telegram channel that

38:50.600 --> 38:55.440
we have for the podcast has today hit a thousand people in there.

38:55.440 --> 38:57.280
Whoa, that's not a small thing.

38:57.280 --> 39:05.640
I don't think many of them are bots. I think they're mostly human. But that's, it's really

39:05.640 --> 39:10.480
not, I mean, there's 100 or so people who are active at any time. And it's a nice little

39:10.480 --> 39:15.520
community of people who, you know, give us feedback and let us know when we're doing

39:15.520 --> 39:20.060
something wrong or send us news articles to talk about. And yeah, it's just a bit of fun

39:20.060 --> 39:25.360
on a Tuesday night to sit with Martin and Mark and chat about stuff and then out it

39:25.360 --> 39:30.840
goes on a Thursday. And it's not even part of either of our jobs, but we're not paid

39:30.840 --> 39:35.600
to do it. We're not sponsored. You know, we don't get paid by any sponsors. It's just

39:35.600 --> 39:39.320
a bit of fun and we've been doing it for 12 years, which is kind of surprising really.

39:39.320 --> 39:43.800
I think the human aspect, similar to what you were saying about like tweets and stuff

39:43.800 --> 39:50.400
earlier, the having that human aspect is super important, especially when it comes to sharing,

39:50.400 --> 39:54.320
you know, a little bit of technical information. I think you guys have an amazing balance there.

39:54.320 --> 40:01.040
And I know it's really entertaining as well to listen to and you get some great perspectives

40:01.040 --> 40:06.520
with with your crew. So please keep doing it. I know you're probably gonna have a curry

40:06.520 --> 40:08.200
this this coming up.

40:08.200 --> 40:14.120
We have a break every year. It's it's funny when we when we did the first season, we did

40:14.120 --> 40:19.080
one. The first season was from about March till December, and we all decided we wanted

40:19.080 --> 40:23.720
to take a break over Christmas. And we weren't sure whether we were going to come back the

40:23.720 --> 40:28.840
following year. And now it's become this meme that at the end of the year, we go away and

40:28.840 --> 40:34.080
know will they won't they and obviously there's 100% track record so far that we have come

40:34.080 --> 40:40.800
back, but there's no guarantee that we will. You know, Mark has just had a baby and Martin

40:40.800 --> 40:47.040
now has more responsibility on his plate for work. So we never know if we're going to come

40:47.040 --> 40:50.600
back for another season. We might, we might not. And it's a stupid game we play with the

40:50.600 --> 40:54.880
audience where we say, well, we just don't know. But we don't. And we and we never know

40:54.880 --> 41:01.800
until we do the curry because we stopped recording in December. And we actually don't talk about

41:01.800 --> 41:07.240
the podcast. The three of us don't talk about the podcast at all for at least a month the

41:07.240 --> 41:10.840
whole of January. We never talk about it. And then we talk about going for a curry.

41:10.840 --> 41:15.960
Do you feel like that is almost like a necessary break that's really helpful actually to gain

41:15.960 --> 41:17.760
like new perspectives and ideas?

41:17.760 --> 41:23.480
Yes, it's a way to take a breather, have a think about what worked in the last season,

41:23.480 --> 41:29.760
what didn't work. And whether if we come back, whether we want to do something differently,

41:29.760 --> 41:35.720
we'll differently move the day because when a year passes, you know, when you've got children

41:35.720 --> 41:41.460
like I have, my son has changed which day he practices football on. And if he practiced

41:41.460 --> 41:47.000
on a Tuesday, which is when we record, that would mess up my ability to do the podcast.

41:47.000 --> 41:50.440
And my daughter does dancing and sometimes she has to dance on a Tuesday. So I'm rushing

41:50.440 --> 41:56.120
around in order to fit in the podcast because we always do it at the same time on the same

41:56.120 --> 42:01.860
day. And one thing we learned very early on is if you want to build an audience, you have

42:01.860 --> 42:06.360
to do the episodes regularly. And if you want to get the episode out on time, you have to

42:06.360 --> 42:11.140
record it on time. And we sometimes fail and we sometimes postpone, but more often than

42:11.140 --> 42:20.360
not, if you pinged me online at 8.30 in the evening on a Tuesday, you wouldn't get a reply

42:20.360 --> 42:24.600
from me for a couple of hours because that's the time that we always do the recording.

42:24.600 --> 42:28.320
Yeah, there's something about consistency of schedule, especially when you have a bunch

42:28.320 --> 42:33.800
of people involved, right? That's so necessary. I'm starting to learn that. I'm working with

42:33.800 --> 42:38.480
the JB team. I've been a sort of freelance photographer being able to do whatever I want

42:38.480 --> 42:46.440
to all the time. But some of that consistency actually is super powerful. So you did mention,

42:46.440 --> 42:52.320
you wanted to mention something before our chat. You were talking about, well, I think

42:52.320 --> 42:58.200
this ties into a bunch of stuff. So lots of people know you for the Ubuntu podcast. Also,

42:58.200 --> 43:03.200
I suppose user error. You guys do some really hilarious stuff there. So I would encourage

43:03.200 --> 43:10.080
everyone to check it out if they haven't yet. And you mentioned earlier in our chat, some

43:10.080 --> 43:13.860
ThinkPad stuff that you might be starting to get famous with that.

43:13.860 --> 43:21.600
So this internet famous thing, you know, where you're known by a tiny subset of people on

43:21.600 --> 43:27.620
the internet for something, you're notable for something. And I have been recognized

43:27.620 --> 43:33.880
in public for being on the podcast. Now I'm not, you know, any of our comments famous.

43:33.880 --> 43:38.240
I'm no Kim Kardashian, obviously, but it's quite nice.

43:38.240 --> 43:39.760
You're like niche famous, right?

43:39.760 --> 43:46.840
Well, yeah, like Zed list internet celebrity famous. And it's quite nice, but it's also

43:46.840 --> 43:52.240
quite weird when people recognize you. And I've kind of got used to it, but I haven't.

43:52.240 --> 43:56.660
It still weirds me out a little bit because it's an audio podcast. Nobody knows what I

43:56.660 --> 44:01.720
look like unless they happen to be following me on Twitter and see my avatar or something.

44:01.720 --> 44:08.120
But I had it years ago. I think 2001 was the first time I ever experienced it. I was working

44:08.120 --> 44:17.440
for a drugs company in the UK and I had a really rubbish website, my blog, popy.com.

44:17.440 --> 44:23.600
If you look at the internet archive for popy.com, don't do this, but I'm sure you will. Go back

44:23.600 --> 44:31.320
and look around about 2001. It was, it was proper 2001 era web log, right? With stupid

44:31.320 --> 44:35.880
icons and stuff all over it. It was awful. Actually it's a bit of the precursor to emoji.

44:35.880 --> 44:40.000
I had little icons in between the texts to indicate stuff. And these were icons I ripped

44:40.000 --> 44:44.500
out of the SAP system that I was working on at the time. So yeah, that's the precursor

44:44.500 --> 44:45.500
to emoji, I think.

44:45.500 --> 44:46.500
It sounds visionary.

44:46.500 --> 44:53.040
Yes, totally. But they were, the place I was working were interviewing someone to join

44:53.040 --> 44:58.840
the team. And I wasn't part of the interview process because I was just a contractor. And

44:58.840 --> 45:04.000
they came back from the interview and we were asking, you know, how's this new person that

45:04.000 --> 45:12.240
you're interviewing? What are they like? And one of them apparently asked how big the team

45:12.240 --> 45:17.440
is. And the boss said, well, we've got like five or six people. We've got this person,

45:17.440 --> 45:20.680
that person, we've got Alan Pope. And apparently the person they were interviewing said, you've

45:20.680 --> 45:30.680
got Alan Pope. And she went, yeah. And the guy went, the Alan Pope. And she went, yeah.

45:30.680 --> 45:35.760
And from that point onwards, I was known inside that company as the Alan Pope. Everyone just

45:35.760 --> 45:43.480
calls me the Alan Pope from that point. Just some nerd online who happens to have a website.

45:43.480 --> 45:49.640
But I met them later when they did get hired and they came and introduced themselves. And

45:49.640 --> 45:53.760
I said, oh, I'm Alan. And I shook their hand and they went, Alan, have you got pictures

45:53.760 --> 45:58.720
of cats on your website? And I said, yes, yes, I have. And that was like, brilliant.

45:58.720 --> 46:04.080
I'm recognized for, you know, the Alan Pope and having pictures of cats on my website.

46:04.080 --> 46:09.760
So I've kind of got used to that being recognized, but I've always been recognized for stupid

46:09.760 --> 46:10.760
reasons.

46:10.760 --> 46:14.040
Your website has been updated since then, which is kind of nice. And I just want to

46:14.040 --> 46:21.960
point it out. I think it's it's such a wonderfully simple and yet really cheeky website. So I'll

46:21.960 --> 46:24.080
encourage everybody to go check it out. Popeye.com.

46:24.080 --> 46:27.080
Popeye.com. Yeah, there's not a lot there.

46:27.080 --> 46:33.100
No, I know. But that's the brilliance of it. And what is there is hilarious. And yet also

46:33.100 --> 46:42.440
quite astute. So I like it. I like it a lot. Aside from Popeye.com. I wanted to ask you,

46:42.440 --> 46:47.180
are there any non computer projects that you tend to get excited about? I know a lot of

46:47.180 --> 46:50.980
people know you for your ThinkPad tinkering and all of that stuff. But is there anything

46:50.980 --> 46:55.240
these days that's like really grabbing you that's not necessarily tech related?

46:55.240 --> 47:00.800
I will often make a note somewhere of a thing that should exist I wish existed but doesn't.

47:00.800 --> 47:06.920
And some of those will be games. And I've had a ton of ideas for games. And I have a

47:06.920 --> 47:12.320
friend who I bounce ideas off of. I'll put him on Telegram and say, Hey, I've had this

47:12.320 --> 47:22.900
idea. And I will describe the game or describe the application and and we'll both agree that

47:22.900 --> 47:29.060
that should exist. And sometimes it's a bit of a con and I try and get them to help me

47:29.060 --> 47:36.440
make it or get them to make it. Just get them to make and sometimes that works and they'll

47:36.440 --> 47:40.560
say yeah, I could probably not cut up in Python in no time at all. And they'll just send me

47:40.560 --> 47:45.080
a link to a Git repo a few hours later. And I'm like, Oh, brilliant. That's great. Thank

47:45.080 --> 47:51.480
you very much. And I feel super bad about this because I feel like I should be creating

47:51.480 --> 47:57.800
those things myself. But I get these mental blocks when I try and create stuff and I get

47:57.800 --> 48:04.360
very frustrated. I've often said I don't consider myself a developer. I'm not a programmer.

48:04.360 --> 48:11.740
And I can create a shell script and I've done coding on computers for 30 years. I've written

48:11.740 --> 48:22.060
Z80 assembler 6502, I've even written 8086 assembler and I've written in Pascal and various

48:22.060 --> 48:28.360
other languages. But I find it really difficult to get past that block. And I don't know how

48:28.360 --> 48:34.480
to fix that. So my problem is in answer to your question, yes, I have a ton of projects

48:34.480 --> 48:38.400
outside the stuff that I do on a daily basis, but none of them are finished. And I get so

48:38.400 --> 48:45.400
frustrated because I don't know how to move them forward. And I because I get frustrated

48:45.400 --> 48:49.080
that I can't move them forward. I get more frustrated that they don't move forward and

48:49.080 --> 48:50.080
then I give up on them.

48:50.080 --> 48:58.320
Oh, it's Yeah, recursive. Could I send a challenge your way? Oh, my gosh. Go on then. Could you

48:58.320 --> 49:02.120
take a few of those ideas and just put them out into the world? For instance, like send

49:02.120 --> 49:07.920
them out on Twitter and in a hope that someone else picks them up? Because some of the ideas

49:07.920 --> 49:13.120
sound not necessarily like huge or, or massive business opportunities or anything like that,

49:13.120 --> 49:16.540
but just something you wish existed. So I wonder what might happen if you just kind

49:16.540 --> 49:19.480
of send it out into the world and see what happens.

49:19.480 --> 49:24.160
I know I have inspired a couple of things in the past, I have said to people in the

49:24.160 --> 49:29.480
past, you know, what should exist, this thing should exist. And then suddenly it exists.

49:29.480 --> 49:34.160
And that's great. I feel guilty because I didn't make the thing. I just had the idea

49:34.160 --> 49:40.840
for the thing. And I kind of would like to put those ideas out there. But I worry a bit

49:40.840 --> 49:48.240
that I'm just the ideas man. And the biggest one is Ubuntu Matei, right? That is now many,

49:48.240 --> 49:52.680
many thousands of people who run Ubuntu Matei. And that came about because of a stupid idea

49:52.680 --> 49:57.840
that I had that there should be a Matei spin of Ubuntu. Martin comes around my house picks

49:57.840 --> 50:03.700
it up walks away with it. And now I basically don't contribute to Ubuntu Matei at all since

50:03.700 --> 50:11.480
day one. He's done it all. And I just had the idea. I mean, that's a good example, because

50:11.480 --> 50:14.200
somebody else picked it all up and every so often he'll ping me and say, what do you think

50:14.200 --> 50:19.360
about this idea from Ubuntu Matei? And I go, yeah, great idea. And somebody else somewhere

50:19.360 --> 50:23.700
on the planet does the work. And all I did was just, you know, agree that that sounds

50:23.700 --> 50:27.740
like a good idea. And maybe there'll be more of those.

50:27.740 --> 50:32.380
Perhaps your real gift and contribution is just creating the seeds and then you hand

50:32.380 --> 50:38.040
off those seeds to others who are more interested in maintaining the seeds. You know, that has

50:38.040 --> 50:39.840
huge value for sure.

50:39.840 --> 50:45.560
Well, it doesn't, it doesn't. Because, like, whenever you open a bug tracker, for an open

50:45.560 --> 50:49.280
source application, you'll get a load of people giving you ideas on how you could improve

50:49.280 --> 50:56.440
your thing. And I worry that I become yet another one of those. Like, I'm just throwing

50:56.440 --> 51:02.880
my ideas out into the big pool of ideas on the planet. And, yeah, some of them might

51:02.880 --> 51:09.040
turn out to be, I don't know. I'm also very resistant to people telling me they're terrible

51:09.040 --> 51:16.240
ideas. Which is why I run them past my friend Stuart on Telegram before I even think about

51:16.240 --> 51:17.240
them any further.

51:17.240 --> 51:23.480
But yeah, okay. I think over Christmas, I will try and turn these into documents which

51:23.480 --> 51:27.400
could be shared more widely than just between me and my friend Stuart.

51:27.400 --> 51:30.920
That sounds lovely. And it doesn't have to be all of them, it could just be a few. That

51:30.920 --> 51:34.400
sounds like a fun little project. See what happens, you never know.

51:34.400 --> 51:40.920
I wanted to ask you if there's anything that you would like the community to try? Like,

51:40.920 --> 51:44.640
sort of an ask? Something you'd like them to try or go check out or think about?

51:44.640 --> 51:51.240
So a thing that I've been, we touched on earlier, is the whole testing thing. I wish more people

51:51.240 --> 51:59.040
could push the boundaries of testing stuff out. And not specifically Ubuntu, like any

51:59.040 --> 52:04.640
Linux distribution. Go and find one you've not tried before and test it out. Find out

52:04.640 --> 52:13.440
what their process is for filing bugs and issues and follow that process. And give them

52:13.440 --> 52:19.980
feedback about what works and what doesn't work. Because I know often developers will

52:19.980 --> 52:27.280
create things and, you know, it works for them, but they don't appreciate that people

52:27.280 --> 52:32.600
out there have different size screens or different accessibility requirements. You know, maybe

52:32.600 --> 52:37.780
people with impaired vision or impaired motor skills aren't able to use that software because

52:37.780 --> 52:45.400
of the way it's constructed. And I think it would be great if we did more of that testing

52:45.400 --> 52:53.060
in the community because it's such a low impact thing for normal non-developer people to do.

52:53.060 --> 52:58.240
And I've shown this in videos I've done on my YouTube channel. You know, chucking an

52:58.240 --> 53:02.240
ISO image onto a USB key, booting it on a machine, and then just noodling around for

53:02.240 --> 53:09.520
an hour and trying it out as if you were using it on a daily basis is a really easy thing

53:09.520 --> 53:16.500
to do. Just dedicating an hour or so to noodle around with it and then dedicate another half

53:16.500 --> 53:25.340
hour to an hour to filing any bugs you find and continuing to converse with the developer.

53:25.340 --> 53:29.280
Continuing that conversation and making sure they understand what's broken or what's not

53:29.280 --> 53:33.300
working or what's glitchy. I think that's the thing I would really love to see more

53:33.300 --> 53:41.960
is people contributing meaningfully to Linux distributions rather than seeing Linux distributions

53:41.960 --> 53:49.960
as a one-way street because the Linux distributions rely totally on volunteer contributors to

53:49.960 --> 53:54.280
help them out. So that would be my call to action is go and test a distro and I don't

53:54.280 --> 53:55.840
care which distro it is.

53:55.840 --> 54:01.240
That's lovely. I would imagine too as a user having that bi-directional communication would

54:01.240 --> 54:05.560
actually be a real treat. You know you get some insights on where the project is headed

54:05.560 --> 54:10.160
or can you know I imagine once you do that for a while you can request some features

54:10.160 --> 54:18.080
or maybe share some ideas that would really make you have a sense of ownership for this

54:18.080 --> 54:21.640
product that you really love or are learning to love.

54:21.640 --> 54:29.960
I think that's a key thing is feeling a sense of ownership, feeling a member of their community.

54:29.960 --> 54:37.840
It's very easy to do drive-by bug reports, boot an ISO in a VM, throw a bug report over

54:37.840 --> 54:42.840
the wall at a developer and then walk away and never look at that distro ever again.

54:42.840 --> 54:49.520
I think it's more useful for people to find a home, find a distro they like, get involved

54:49.520 --> 54:55.380
with the community, actually jump on their IRC channel or their Slack or their Mattermost

54:55.380 --> 55:01.080
or wherever it is they chat and ask you know what can I do and they will almost certainly

55:01.080 --> 55:05.860
ask you well what can you do? What are your skills? And if you say oh I can I can test

55:05.860 --> 55:12.840
your distro they'll almost certainly be happy to point you to well we've just landed this

55:12.840 --> 55:15.720
new thing do you want to test it?

55:15.720 --> 55:23.560
I even saw a distro whose Slack I'm sat in a couple of days ago posted secret ISO images

55:23.560 --> 55:27.840
and said hey can people test this stuff out and so I did but I'm not even part of that

55:27.840 --> 55:32.440
distro I'm not even part of their community I just happen to be lurking in their Slack

55:32.440 --> 55:37.000
and I thought yeah I'll help them out I'll try out their ISO if it crashes in a thousand

55:37.000 --> 55:42.240
colors or formats my hard drive without me asking then I'll tell them but if it all works

55:42.240 --> 55:49.160
I'll let them know it worked well and it's an hour of my life that is not hard to contribute

55:49.160 --> 55:56.080
to so like I say I work for Ubuntu but I appreciate that everyone has their own personal taste

55:56.080 --> 56:00.860
and everyone wants to contribute in different ways to different distros so go and find a

56:00.860 --> 56:02.840
distro and contribute.

56:02.840 --> 56:07.600
As little as an hour is helpful and if you can give more than that even more helpful.

56:07.600 --> 56:08.880
Yeah totally.

56:08.880 --> 56:14.000
And so for someone like me who's not necessarily a developer do you feel like that process

56:14.000 --> 56:15.000
is quite approachable?

56:15.000 --> 56:21.240
It depends on the distro I mean largely all you're doing is downloading an ISO image and

56:21.240 --> 56:24.840
chucking it on a USB key and booting it and seeing what happens.

56:24.840 --> 56:27.240
Almost any of us could do that right so that's great.

56:27.240 --> 56:31.400
Yeah and that's this I mean if you've if you're a Linux user you probably have done that at

56:31.400 --> 56:33.240
least once in your life.

56:33.240 --> 56:35.440
If not it's a great opportunity to learn.

56:35.440 --> 56:42.320
Right yeah why not and also it's nice to test other distros like I've tested out quite a

56:42.320 --> 56:48.000
lot of distros over the last year partly because I need to make sure that some of our technology

56:48.000 --> 56:52.840
works on other distros but partly just out of interest and I've tried out some that I've

56:52.840 --> 57:00.700
got really wild user interfaces that I would not be happy using on a daily basis but other

57:00.700 --> 57:06.920
people love like it's their you know number one child and so I can have a perspective

57:06.920 --> 57:12.000
of an outsider just looking in and saying okay this is a bit weird but it doesn't crash

57:12.000 --> 57:16.480
it works and so that's feedback I can give them you know I don't I don't have to tell

57:16.480 --> 57:21.080
them I don't like it and I think that's a key thing is doesn't matter if you don't like

57:21.080 --> 57:26.560
it you've go and find one you do like use that one and contribute to that one and yeah

57:26.560 --> 57:32.440
it's it's really pretty straightforward it's it's it's really just a case of installing

57:32.440 --> 57:40.200
an operating system and trying to use it like a normal person and you very quickly can find

57:40.200 --> 57:46.140
the edges of what's possible and find you know whether it's easy or difficult to install

57:46.140 --> 57:50.560
the software that you want and whether it's easy or difficult to customize the interface

57:50.560 --> 57:56.440
to be the way you want it maybe that's by design maybe that's just you don't know how

57:56.440 --> 58:01.800
to do it or maybe it's just not well documented and all of those are opportunities and trying

58:01.800 --> 58:06.480
to put emojis in places where you might not think they should go oh yes yes definitely

58:06.480 --> 58:13.400
try try and put your username being one character and try and you know weird characters in your

58:13.400 --> 58:18.640
password and all kinds of stuff probably if people want to get connected with you where

58:18.640 --> 58:22.600
where do you think you would send them I'm pretty much poppy everywhere except a few

58:22.600 --> 58:30.220
places where some random people have got poppy so I had to go with poppy DC as the alternative

58:30.220 --> 58:35.040
so if you ever see poppy DC that's probably me as well so people always ask what the DC

58:35.040 --> 58:42.120
means the DC just means dot com as in poppy dot com I was not very inventive when I came

58:42.120 --> 58:45.520
up with that one because at the time I was really frustrated that I couldn't have poppy

58:45.520 --> 58:51.600
so I was like oh poppy DC will do so yeah twitter.com poppy is a good place to start

58:51.600 --> 58:55.680
great yeah well poppy thank you so much for chatting with me this has been a real pleasure

58:55.680 --> 59:11.680
and thanks for your time too appreciate it yeah it's been lovely thanks thanks so much
