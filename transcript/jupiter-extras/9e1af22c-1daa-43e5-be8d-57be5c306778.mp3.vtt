00:00.000 --> 00:14.680
Well, hi, everyone. Welcome to Brunch with Brent. I'm so pleased to be joined today by

00:14.680 --> 00:17.280
Nuritzi Sanchez. Nuritzi, how you doing?

00:17.280 --> 00:24.320
Hello. I am doing really well because I am in sunny California and it is a beautiful

00:24.320 --> 00:25.880
day here today.

00:25.880 --> 00:33.040
Nice. I will admit that I'm in Northern Ontario and we're supposed to get a lot of snow. So

00:33.040 --> 00:37.200
a little bit of maybe the opposite, but I'll be thinking of you.

00:37.200 --> 00:38.200
That sounds nice too.

00:38.200 --> 00:43.520
Well, that's the thing though, right? Is I think it's all about attitude and I've kind

00:43.520 --> 00:51.160
of taken that approach to weather in the last several years and it changes everything. So

00:51.160 --> 00:58.560
glad to hear you mention that. Nuritzi, you are now kind of a new thing for you, but a

00:58.560 --> 01:02.160
senior open source program manager at GitLab. Is that right?

01:02.160 --> 01:08.000
Yeah. I just joined at the beginning of this month and I'm really excited to be part of

01:08.000 --> 01:16.600
this team helping to really get more open source projects to join GitLab by helping

01:16.600 --> 01:23.000
them solve any issues that they have, helping them with the migration process, all of that.

01:23.000 --> 01:28.400
So I love GitLab and I love open source and so it's the perfect thing for me.

01:28.400 --> 01:34.800
What a nice match when you can combine a lot of things that you love and we will get into

01:34.800 --> 01:42.060
that when we dive a little bit into your history. But I would imagine being a month into GitLab,

01:42.060 --> 01:45.480
you're still kind of learning the ropes and getting to meet people and all of that stuff.

01:45.480 --> 01:49.280
Has that been sort of nice getting to meet the people behind it?

01:49.280 --> 01:55.000
Yeah. It's the first time that I've been part also of an all remote company and I think

01:55.000 --> 02:01.780
that I was a little hesitant about it at first because I love meeting people and having those

02:01.780 --> 02:09.960
hallway conversations, coffee breaks out. But GitLab has an amazing all remote culture

02:09.960 --> 02:14.000
and so I've just been scheduling lots and lots of coffee chats with people, getting

02:14.000 --> 02:20.160
to know as many as possible and yeah, it has been great so far.

02:20.160 --> 02:27.360
Good for you. I actually love that term of remote culture. I admit that I haven't heard

02:27.360 --> 02:34.080
it before and that seems kind of silly considering I have my own remote culture considering I'm

02:34.080 --> 02:39.000
self-employed and all that stuff. But it seems to me like maybe that's what makes remote

02:39.000 --> 02:45.200
work successful or not, is having the tools and having the people. But also, you mentioned

02:45.200 --> 02:51.600
just scheduling coffee chats and that sounds like, even though maybe on the outside it

02:51.600 --> 02:58.480
seems not relevant to getting work done, I would imagine it's actually extremely important.

02:58.480 --> 03:04.760
Yeah, it is. One of the things that GitLab does that's very different from other companies

03:04.760 --> 03:12.720
that I've been a part of is that mindset of being handbook first and so they have very

03:12.720 --> 03:19.100
detailed documentation of everything, which is really good for that asynchronous sharing

03:19.100 --> 03:25.240
of knowledge. But it's one thing to look at a page and another thing to really meet the

03:25.240 --> 03:32.120
people behind it and so as you said, it's really important to have those relationships

03:32.120 --> 03:39.260
with the people behind it and really knowing who to go to and learning all of the little

03:39.260 --> 03:47.200
tips and tricks that you just can't find on a sheet of paper. So yeah, big fan of coffee

03:47.200 --> 03:50.180
chats. Yeah.

03:50.180 --> 03:53.440
You mentioned documentation in there and I just want to quickly say that it's actually

03:53.440 --> 03:59.040
been a theme that has happened throughout the conversations I've had here on brunch

03:59.040 --> 04:05.040
and I didn't expect that at first. Like for instance, the conversation I had recently

04:05.040 --> 04:12.360
with Heather Elsworth, she's a huge fan of documentation and how useful that is but you're

04:12.360 --> 04:17.800
describing it sort of useful internally as well, which I love, but you're absolutely

04:17.800 --> 04:22.880
right like maybe that's the first step but having that human connection is almost the

04:22.880 --> 04:30.680
necessary second step and the deeper dive into understanding anything. So I really,

04:30.680 --> 04:36.840
I love that idea of those scheduled coffee chats. I mean, I know you're kind of new with

04:36.840 --> 04:42.160
the one month thing but could you give us a little bit more of an understanding of what

04:42.160 --> 04:48.000
a senior open source program manager does on a daily basis? Have you figured that out

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
yet?

04:49.000 --> 04:57.280
Right. I'm in the process. But the first thing is that the program was set up because GitLab

04:57.280 --> 05:05.760
is an open core organization and a big part of just the culture there is to give back

05:05.760 --> 05:11.200
to the open source community. And so they've tried to foster this in different ways and

05:11.200 --> 05:21.080
one way was by providing open source projects with access to their premium levels for free.

05:21.080 --> 05:26.720
And then also that's the enterprise edition. And then they have a community edition that

05:26.720 --> 05:33.120
is fully free software. The enterprise edition you can do either like GitLab.com or your

05:33.120 --> 05:42.600
self-hosted instance and it has some proprietary software there too. But the community edition

05:42.600 --> 05:48.120
is completely open source so it's great for projects that are very concerned about the

05:48.120 --> 05:58.040
free software side of things or just follow further along that spectrum. And so what I

05:58.040 --> 06:05.520
am supposed to be doing is helping to really grow that program because so far it's been

06:05.520 --> 06:12.280
very reactive and we have our internal processes set up to handle these requests and to start

06:12.280 --> 06:19.040
to assist large organizations like GNOME and KDE and Debian has also been one. There's

06:19.040 --> 06:25.700
still a lot of room for improvement and it's my job to really go in and analyze the current

06:25.700 --> 06:33.000
program and start to fix little bits and pieces that could be fixed and really to start doing

06:33.000 --> 06:40.100
more of that outreach and letting people know that the program even exists. And that is

06:40.100 --> 06:46.960
my bread and butter. I love doing that stuff. I love going in and finding challenges that

06:46.960 --> 06:51.720
need to be solved and then talking to lots of different people to figure out who I need

06:51.720 --> 06:59.040
to go to. Also, the other thing that was really interesting about this is that everybody at

06:59.040 --> 07:05.560
GitLab seems to be new because they've just experienced so much growth in the last two

07:05.560 --> 07:12.640
years. A few people have said they were there about a year and a half ago when it was about

07:12.640 --> 07:20.680
250 people and it's now 1,200. And so there's this joke that you're there in the room or

07:20.680 --> 07:27.480
like, you know, the video chat room with people that are new to GitLab, newer to GitLab and

07:27.480 --> 07:35.760
newest to GitLab. So it is fun. It's awesome. But yeah, I never feel like out of place is

07:35.760 --> 07:38.280
the new person because everybody is like that.

07:38.280 --> 07:45.760
Well, that's actually really nice. I would imagine too that there's quite a bit of like

07:45.760 --> 07:51.840
great energy considering that people are new. I know oftentimes that newness is actually

07:51.840 --> 07:53.520
a really great feature.

07:53.520 --> 08:01.840
Yes, exactly. It's really, really awesome to be at a company with people from all sorts

08:01.840 --> 08:06.320
of different backgrounds. Some people haven't really been part of the open source world

08:06.320 --> 08:11.120
or haven't been part of the dev ops tools world. And, you know, they bring in their

08:11.120 --> 08:21.080
own expertise. I love thinking about diversity in all its forms and you do see lots of different

08:21.080 --> 08:27.760
types of thought diversity. And again, it's my first one there and I've already heard

08:27.760 --> 08:34.920
that there are ways that GitLab are trying to continue to constantly like build out other

08:34.920 --> 08:40.160
types of diversity or just in general like be a more diverse organization. But my experience

08:40.160 --> 08:45.200
so far has been really awesome with that. And it comes from, as you say, like a bunch

08:45.200 --> 08:52.080
of new people coming in from different areas and, you know, working on this common product.

08:52.080 --> 08:57.480
That sounds really amazing as an environment to try to do some of your best work. I heard

08:57.480 --> 09:01.840
you there earlier get a little bit excited about the people aspect of things when you

09:01.840 --> 09:05.440
were describing it. I would imagine that's actually a lot of fun too because it sounds

09:05.440 --> 09:10.280
like you're kind of reaching into a whole bunch of different communities. How's that

09:10.280 --> 09:11.280
been?

09:11.280 --> 09:16.760
I haven't done as much community work at GitLab yet because I'm first focusing on kind of

09:16.760 --> 09:22.320
like the infrastructure part. So right now, when I was talking about, you know, talking

09:22.320 --> 09:28.640
to lots of different people, it was all internally. And this comes along with trying to streamline

09:28.640 --> 09:34.280
the processes better. I have to, you know, better understand the different teams that

09:34.280 --> 09:40.520
will touch my project or that would be interested in my project and find ways for us to better

09:40.520 --> 09:47.180
collaborate. And an example, like a tangible example of this is that the way like we really

09:47.180 --> 09:53.200
dog food our project. And so all of my organization for my program, which is I love dog fooding

09:53.200 --> 09:59.840
things. I do it. It's great to like, I actually don't know. I don't know what that means.

09:59.840 --> 10:07.200
But dog fooding is basically other people also refer to it as like we drink our own

10:07.200 --> 10:16.520
wine. So it's basically eating your own. I can't explain it. Okay. I know the term.

10:16.520 --> 10:22.880
It means you use your own products, but why is it dog fooding? Maybe a follow-up question

10:22.880 --> 10:24.980
for me the next time.

10:24.980 --> 10:27.560
We can go with it. I still really like it.

10:27.560 --> 10:34.280
Yeah. So anyway, the point is that I use GitLab for my daily work and this is great because

10:34.280 --> 10:41.920
I'm not an engineer. And so it's a tool that can really be used by lots of different people.

10:41.920 --> 10:46.140
And that was actually part of the reason why I was so excited about it in the first place

10:46.140 --> 10:50.600
is that I've tried all sorts of different tools and this is the one where I could see

10:50.600 --> 11:00.320
lots of different teams actually using. And so back to my tangible example, I have a label

11:00.320 --> 11:07.560
called open source that I work with, but it was only part of the community relations project.

11:07.560 --> 11:12.240
And so I'm now promoting it to like the top level so that everybody can use it within

11:12.240 --> 11:20.080
the organization. And this is my way to start to really be able to promote the work that

11:20.080 --> 11:26.160
I'm doing internally so that people know to come to me when they need help or just in

11:26.160 --> 11:30.160
general to get more awareness about the program that I'm building.

11:30.160 --> 11:38.200
Keep the dog food flowing. Now, when you describe that you have a chance to use GitLab for yourself,

11:38.200 --> 11:43.000
what for you are sort of the features that really stand out in your current workflow?

11:43.000 --> 11:47.640
Because I would imagine, you know, some of us listening don't necessarily have experience

11:47.640 --> 11:53.600
with GitLab yet, especially in a non sort of developer capacity. So what is it about

11:53.600 --> 11:56.560
you that really grabs you about it using it on a daily basis?

11:56.560 --> 12:02.000
I think that in the roles that I've been, I have had to work with engineers, sometimes

12:02.000 --> 12:08.360
very heavily, sometimes not as heavily at Endless, which I'm sure I'll talk about later.

12:08.360 --> 12:10.080
Yes, please.

12:10.080 --> 12:18.920
A lot of it was working with engineers to develop like applications or to create like

12:18.920 --> 12:25.600
a beta testing program or, you know, various initiatives that required a lot of direct

12:25.600 --> 12:31.640
work with engineers. And I worked very cross functionally. So at Endless, we decided to

12:31.640 --> 12:38.280
actually go with Fabricator, which is another project management tool. And we tried to show

12:38.280 --> 12:46.020
it to the design team. They like ran away crying. And that's not to say that Fabricator

12:46.020 --> 12:53.640
isn't a lovely tool. It's just that the interface of it is not as easy to use, or it's not as

12:53.640 --> 13:01.420
intuitive and it's not as beautiful as some of the other tools that we were evaluating.

13:01.420 --> 13:09.040
And so when we went with Fabricator for like utility at Endless, our design team was just,

13:09.040 --> 13:16.360
you know, not super pleased. You know, eventually they were able to adopt it and everything.

13:16.360 --> 13:24.120
But I think that at GitLab, Gnome was one of the first like big projects to migrate

13:24.120 --> 13:30.840
over to using GitLab. And that was partly just to consolidate their tools and use a

13:30.840 --> 13:36.140
single platform as part of the newcomer story so that people didn't have to start signing

13:36.140 --> 13:41.600
up for all sorts of different tools. And again, part of it was like that ease of use and being

13:41.600 --> 13:47.280
able to attract a lot of newcomers. And I just, I fell in love with the product because

13:47.280 --> 13:53.940
it was usable and it had all the same functionality. When you asked about like specific features,

13:53.940 --> 14:01.280
the Kanban boards and labels, milestones, or like being able to set dates and assign

14:01.280 --> 14:10.200
tasks to people, all of the same things that I had liked about things like Trello or Basecamp

14:10.200 --> 14:17.640
or Asana. In my mind, those are some of the more like user-friendly project management

14:17.640 --> 14:24.840
ones that aren't as commonly used for engineering teams. And so I just really saw GitLab as

14:24.840 --> 14:31.720
something that provided a little bit of something for everybody. At Gnome, my focus was on that

14:31.720 --> 14:38.620
engagement team and helping to grow the community and to also evangelize for other skill sets

14:38.620 --> 14:43.040
and you know, like just in general diversity. I kind of mentioned that as a theme that I'm

14:43.040 --> 14:48.480
really interested in. And I saw it as, you know, a tool that people could start using

14:48.480 --> 14:55.720
even if they weren't very familiar with engineering tools and practices. And even if somebody

14:55.720 --> 15:01.160
joined the engagement team just to do marketing type work, they could start to get familiar

15:01.160 --> 15:07.440
with the tool and then build that confidence so that if they then wanted to start dabbling

15:07.440 --> 15:15.400
in some of the more like, you know, either documentation or some more like code contribution

15:15.400 --> 15:20.400
type work, then they were at least familiar with the tool and could, you know, transition

15:20.400 --> 15:28.120
more easily to that. So those are, I guess, the reasons why I get excited about it.

15:28.120 --> 15:34.560
A great many good reasons. Thank you for sharing that. It sounds super powerful. I admit I

15:34.560 --> 15:41.760
don't have experience with it, but now I'm itching to get some. So that's a good side.

15:41.760 --> 15:48.760
Yeah, it's really pretty. You mentioned in there some of your experience working with

15:48.760 --> 15:56.320
the Gnome team. And I know you've been quite involved there. Can you walk us through that?

15:56.320 --> 16:03.840
Sure. So I first got involved through my work at Endless. And just kind of quick background

16:03.840 --> 16:09.960
on that Endless is a company that was started back in 2012. I was one of the people who

16:09.960 --> 16:18.000
helped start it. And we at Endless, we were building a Linux based desktop. We first launched

16:18.000 --> 16:26.320
on our own hardware. But Endless was designed to reach people who didn't have great internet

16:26.320 --> 16:32.080
connection, perhaps no internet connection, or were new to computers. And so we're really

16:32.080 --> 16:41.400
all about simplifying the Linux desktop experience to make it easy for your grandmother to use,

16:41.400 --> 16:50.760
you know, or anybody like your two year old daughter, anybody. And so we started to, you

16:50.760 --> 16:56.480
know, really contribute upstream. We were a Gnome based desktop. And so we were contributing

16:56.480 --> 17:05.440
very heavily upstream to Gnome. And I was invited to one of the initial, one of the

17:05.440 --> 17:11.320
annual conferences. It was in Sweden. I was super excited to go to Sweden.

17:11.320 --> 17:12.320
Lucky you.

17:12.320 --> 17:22.880
Yes. And I got to speak about, you know, some of the ways that we had changed the designer

17:22.880 --> 17:30.560
when designing for our audience considerations that you had to have. And so, you know, I

17:30.560 --> 17:37.400
first of all loved the atmosphere of the community. They were all very welcoming, very, you know,

17:37.400 --> 17:39.720
I didn't feel like an outsider.

17:39.720 --> 17:45.140
That is so important too, right? Because if you're trying to make any change or recommendations

17:45.140 --> 17:51.340
or trying to collaborate with anyone, that is a necessity to be sort of welcomed with

17:51.340 --> 17:56.680
open arms and to be, yeah, collaborative. So that is very good to hear.

17:56.680 --> 18:01.880
Yeah. I think especially, I had never been to an open source conference before. As I

18:01.880 --> 18:09.120
said, I'm not an engineer. And so I had a lot of, not hesitation, but I just wasn't

18:09.120 --> 18:15.520
sure how I would be received as a non-engineer at this conference. Most of my colleagues

18:15.520 --> 18:20.560
going were all engineers and had been part of the open source world. So here I was like,

18:20.560 --> 18:27.400
I'm a non-engineer, new to open source, let's do this. And it was great. Like people were

18:27.400 --> 18:32.120
so nice and they were, you know, willing to explain things to me. And I just, I got really

18:32.120 --> 18:37.160
excited about it. And you know, the whole thing is that when I first started learning

18:37.160 --> 18:42.360
about open source software and really helping to figure out which applications to pre-install

18:42.360 --> 18:49.400
on EndlessOS, I was one amazed by how many awesome applications there were available.

18:49.400 --> 18:55.240
I had no idea coming from like a Windows and Mac background that the Linux application

18:55.240 --> 19:00.200
ecosystem even existed. So I was like, wow, I don't have to pay for Photoshop. This is

19:00.200 --> 19:03.480
great. Like let's do GIMP and Inkscape.

19:03.480 --> 19:10.320
It's an enabler, isn't it? Right. And for Endless, that's the whole idea is to enable

19:10.320 --> 19:13.880
creativity and access and all of that stuff. So what a beautiful thing.

19:13.880 --> 19:20.520
Exactly. And while I was so excited about like the practicality of all these applications,

19:20.520 --> 19:26.920
I was a little less excited about how they looked and they felt. And you've already kind

19:26.920 --> 19:31.560
of heard me get excited about how pretty GitLab is. Like this is a reoccurring theme in my

19:31.560 --> 19:38.400
life is that I like beautiful things. And I, you know, I'm all about experiences too.

19:38.400 --> 19:44.080
Like when I really value experiences. And so it's like, at Endless, I think they said

19:44.080 --> 19:48.880
like pixels don't cost anything. So like, let's make this really luxurious and let's

19:48.880 --> 19:56.040
make it feel super high quality so that our users, even if they can't afford, you know,

19:56.040 --> 20:02.560
luxury items, you know, they feel like this is a luxury item. And that's really what I

20:02.560 --> 20:08.600
wanted. You know, like I care a lot about the usability and the experience. And I felt

20:08.600 --> 20:18.080
so hopeful for how the Linux application ecosystem could keep evolving to have that in mind.

20:18.080 --> 20:21.840
And for that, that's why I got really excited about the diversity, diversity of thought,

20:21.840 --> 20:28.280
diversity of like lots of different aspects. So that, you know, you could really create

20:28.280 --> 20:35.360
software that was not only functional, but a delight to use. And so that's how I sort

20:35.360 --> 20:41.520
of got plugged into the GNOME community. At the time, the engagement team was just a few

20:41.520 --> 20:49.380
people. And so really was excited about joining that and helping to grow the team and start

20:49.380 --> 20:56.920
advocating for like hearing more about our brand and marketing and outreach and building

20:56.920 --> 21:06.400
a community, all of that stuff. And I guess they found it valuable. I was asked to run

21:06.400 --> 21:08.000
for the board of directors.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
Wow.

21:09.000 --> 21:16.200
Yeah. And I ended up serving three terms. And during that time, when I first joined,

21:16.200 --> 21:21.040
we didn't have an executive director. So I helped with that hiring process. And a lot

21:21.040 --> 21:25.800
of my strength is in project management and really driving things forward. So I was able

21:25.800 --> 21:31.560
to bring that in. And then, you know, we went through the whole restructuring of our organization,

21:31.560 --> 21:36.040
because as we started to care more about the newcomers experience and about, you know,

21:36.040 --> 21:40.900
like really caring about our community. And actually for us, the move to GitLab was a

21:40.900 --> 21:46.120
huge part of that because it was, you know, completely changing our tools to be more modern

21:46.120 --> 21:52.560
and, you know, easy for newcomers to join. That's when we started getting more donations

21:52.560 --> 21:57.720
and more, like, publicity. And there were a lot of, like, little things and big things

21:57.720 --> 22:07.680
that happened. Ubuntu changed to, came back to us as having GNOME as the default. And

22:07.680 --> 22:16.120
we ended up having, you know, more newcomers join. And it was just a very, like, momentous

22:16.120 --> 22:22.560
period for us. And during all that time, we had to change a lot of the way that the foundation

22:22.560 --> 22:28.240
was running, because we went from having one employee to having seven employees. And for

22:28.240 --> 22:34.160
us, that was a historical record. We'd never hired anyone outside of our director of operations

22:34.160 --> 22:42.360
and executive director full time. And so now we're able to, you know, help not only keep

22:42.360 --> 22:46.840
the GNOME community healthy, but start dreaming even bigger than we ever have before. And

22:46.840 --> 22:49.440
yeah, it's been an exciting time.

22:49.440 --> 22:55.960
It sounds exciting. You must feel, you know, I'm going back to your describing sort of

22:55.960 --> 23:01.280
that, that feeling of showing up at that very first conference and not really knowing if

23:01.280 --> 23:07.480
you're going to sort of fit in. And then, you know, fast forward to that moment you

23:07.480 --> 23:15.640
just described as as being, you know, helping to form what is really an exciting time for

23:15.640 --> 23:23.160
the GNOME community and the foundation. And it sounds like those have really been catalysts

23:23.160 --> 23:29.880
to a lot of positive change in many communities around. So that must be must feel really good

23:29.880 --> 23:31.520
for you to be a part of that.

23:31.520 --> 23:38.120
Yeah, definitely. And I'm always amazed at, you know, again, going back to kind of experience

23:38.120 --> 23:45.640
it at events. I see events as like the lifeblood of a lot of open source communities because

23:45.640 --> 23:51.640
it's the time when, you know, you get your core members together to work on things or

23:51.640 --> 23:58.960
it's a place to draw in newcomers and to really have that in person touch point that will

23:58.960 --> 24:08.160
carry on throughout the year when you're all remote. And, and yeah, I just think that it's

24:08.160 --> 24:16.120
something that sometimes people don't value as much, but there's so much value in creating

24:16.120 --> 24:21.840
awesome events and experiences for people. And it's something that, you know, in addition

24:21.840 --> 24:25.800
to all my other interests, I feel really excited about.

24:25.800 --> 24:29.600
You're a multifaceted human being. That's a good thing.

24:29.600 --> 24:33.000
Yeah. I get pulled into lots of projects.

24:33.000 --> 24:41.120
Well, you probably allow yourself to, it sounds like you, you, you jump in full swing. And

24:41.120 --> 24:49.820
so maybe that's a really nice segue then into your efforts with the Libre application summit.

24:49.820 --> 24:55.040
It sounds like that brings together a lot of your efforts all into one place. And I'm

24:55.040 --> 25:00.680
actually admit to not being that familiar with what happens on the ground at the Libre

25:00.680 --> 25:05.960
application summit. So what's it like there? How are you involved? What are the people

25:05.960 --> 25:08.520
like? I'm sure they're amazing, but give us a sense of it.

25:08.520 --> 25:14.960
We started the, we used to call it loss gnome. And that was when it was Libre application

25:14.960 --> 25:26.280
summit as a way to really move forward the experience behind Linux applications. And

25:26.280 --> 25:32.640
we had a couple of iterations of that, and then KDE expressed an interest in also participating

25:32.640 --> 25:38.240
in the organization of it. And, you know, it was something that to me was made a lot

25:38.240 --> 25:43.960
of sense where, you know, we're only going to be able to move the dial on this if we're

25:43.960 --> 25:53.520
working together strategically and, you know, able to provide big organizations with sort

25:53.520 --> 25:59.800
of a united front where we say like, these are the options. And we were really seen as

25:59.800 --> 26:05.040
a collaborative community as opposed to, you know, like each doing their own thing and

26:05.040 --> 26:06.320
having a lot of segmentation.

26:06.320 --> 26:12.520
Yeah, it sounds like breaking down some of those perceived sort of rivalries is really

26:12.520 --> 26:18.480
beneficial, even if, you know, that's not the reality. But there's been a lot of sense

26:18.480 --> 26:23.880
that, oh, these two camps can't collaborate. But that, I think, has been, at least from

26:23.880 --> 26:29.840
my perspective, one of the greatest gifts that has come out of Libre application summit.

26:29.840 --> 26:32.240
And you've described that as really meaningful, too.

26:32.240 --> 26:38.560
Yes, exactly. I, you know, before really getting involved in the Libre application summit,

26:38.560 --> 26:44.400
I, well, now, what I was going to say is that we rebranded to, instead of last GNOME, Libre

26:44.400 --> 26:51.480
application summit hosted by GNOME, we rebranded to Linux app summit. And that's the more like

26:51.480 --> 26:58.040
neutral version so that, you know, we can have both GNOME and KDE be the hosts and also,

26:58.040 --> 27:03.080
you know, continue to evolve it. We're still not sure how far the evolution will go if

27:03.080 --> 27:07.560
it'll become its own organization at some point or if it will continue to be co-hosted

27:07.560 --> 27:15.000
by KDE and GNOME. There's still, you know, lots of room for growth and discussion. But

27:15.000 --> 27:21.560
yeah, before my involvement with that, I didn't really know many KDE people. I think I knew

27:21.560 --> 27:27.760
one from a conference, two from a conference in Brazil. And they were great, but they expressed

27:27.760 --> 27:33.620
too that they were really interested in doing more with GNOME. And that sort of planted

27:33.620 --> 27:38.360
the seed in my mind of, you know, I have to get to know more KDE people. I'd really like

27:38.360 --> 27:45.760
to understand areas where we can collaborate. And this just naturally made sense. They were

27:45.760 --> 27:53.040
incredible to work with. I worked very closely with Alish Pol, the current president, and

27:53.040 --> 27:58.720
they were just so supportive and collaborative. And yeah, I think that because of them, we

27:58.720 --> 28:07.400
were able to double attendance and to have much more of an outreach than we had in previous

28:07.400 --> 28:09.400
years. So lots of great things.

28:09.400 --> 28:14.600
That must feel amazing to be part of all of that. I'm sitting here just like jaw dropped

28:14.600 --> 28:22.200
at how important that stuff is and bringing people together and just seeing what comes

28:22.200 --> 28:26.520
out the other end when you combine some, you know, really some people doing some great

28:26.520 --> 28:33.920
work all in the same room. What a gift. Can I ask you how it is that you ever came to

28:33.920 --> 28:38.080
the tech world in the first place? Because it sounds to me like you have a big heart

28:38.080 --> 28:46.020
for the sort of human aspect of it and organizing people and organizing projects. But how did

28:46.020 --> 28:48.880
you come to tech in the beginning?

28:48.880 --> 28:55.560
Yeah, that's a great question. Let's see, when I was younger, I thought I'd be a doctor,

28:55.560 --> 28:56.560
obviously.

28:56.560 --> 28:57.560
It's a good choice.

28:57.560 --> 29:03.440
Yeah. Well, that was the thing is it was through a lot of exploration. Actually, in high school,

29:03.440 --> 29:09.400
I interned at a hospital. Don't ask me why they let me in as a high schooler, but they

29:09.400 --> 29:15.560
did. And it was at a children's hospital, at the Stanford Children's Hospital. And

29:15.560 --> 29:19.520
my heart broke because I didn't like seeing children when they were sick. I wanted to

29:19.520 --> 29:25.000
do something to prevent that. And that was sort of the reoccurring theme also within

29:25.000 --> 29:32.800
the different internships or programs that I tried out where I also thought that I might

29:32.800 --> 29:41.640
become a lawyer. And I interned at an immigration law clinic, and I just had so many stories

29:41.640 --> 29:49.800
of heartbreaking stories of people battling through immigration stories. And it was something

29:49.800 --> 29:54.520
where I didn't want to fight at that level. I wanted to fight at the higher level of like,

29:54.520 --> 30:02.320
how can I prevent this from happening? Or how can I do a deeper level? I just felt kind

30:02.320 --> 30:05.200
of helpless in that situation.

30:05.200 --> 30:11.280
So anyway, I graduated with an international relations major and a minor in psychology.

30:11.280 --> 30:18.600
And that still goes along with my interest in people all around the world. And growing

30:18.600 --> 30:24.760
up in Silicon Valley, you're just surrounded by tech. And what I really love about it is

30:24.760 --> 30:30.120
how it's almost like a superpower, where just a few people can create something that

30:30.120 --> 30:37.700
can enormously impact other people's lives. And this is kind of an extreme and not the

30:37.700 --> 30:44.160
best example, but the person who created Flappy Birds was used by so many people. And it's

30:44.160 --> 30:52.040
just still like the core concept is that a person can create something that can touch

30:52.040 --> 30:58.040
so many lives. And so that was really where I saw, okay, well, if I want to make a huge

30:58.040 --> 31:04.480
impact on this world, I really do see tech as that tool of reaching people.

31:04.480 --> 31:08.980
And I know there are social ramifications of technology. That was something that I was

31:08.980 --> 31:14.680
really aware of also. But that was even more reason to join because I care about these

31:14.680 --> 31:19.320
things. I care about cultural sensitivity and about making sure that you're not forcing

31:19.320 --> 31:26.020
technology to people who are saying that it's better than their way of life. And so those

31:26.020 --> 31:33.280
are the human aspects that I think should be infused in technology. Because after all,

31:33.280 --> 31:39.480
technology is just a tool to help you improve your life. So I really see it in that lens.

31:39.480 --> 31:42.000
It's a means for us to express ourselves, right?

31:42.000 --> 31:43.000
Yeah.

31:43.000 --> 31:44.000
Yeah.

31:44.000 --> 31:49.700
That is actually, you know, the reason that I came to open source in the first place was

31:49.700 --> 31:57.240
hitting pause on sort of my interest in the technical aspects, because that's easy for

31:57.240 --> 32:03.920
me to get into the way my mind works. But then hitting pause and using my heart to say,

32:03.920 --> 32:10.480
well, how does this change people's lives? And it sounds like you spent a lot of time

32:10.480 --> 32:16.060
and effort and energy thinking about that throughout your years as well. And what amazing

32:16.060 --> 32:23.560
things we can do when we use that as a guiding light, especially in the world of technology.

32:23.560 --> 32:30.040
Yes. And what you say, how it draws you towards open source, I think that's been the biggest

32:30.040 --> 32:38.080
kind of twist in my journey. I didn't know what open source was. And then now I find

32:38.080 --> 32:44.160
myself really interested in it and having it be something that is really guiding my

32:44.160 --> 32:48.880
path forward. And it has to do with what you said of really, you know, like the people

32:48.880 --> 32:53.880
aspect of things. And something I didn't share about my background earlier is that

32:53.880 --> 32:58.280
both of my parents are from Mexico. And I had grown up, you know, really like going

32:58.280 --> 33:05.800
back and just seeing so many things that I wanted to fix there or help, you know, challenges

33:05.800 --> 33:11.680
that I wanted to help solve. And it was as simple back then as my dad wanted to go visit

33:11.680 --> 33:16.800
his mom and, you know, wanted to find the cheapest way to get there. And we knew that

33:16.800 --> 33:21.520
there were buses, but there was no information online about bus schedules or train schedules

33:21.520 --> 33:27.120
or anything. And so, you know, like having a simple website would have helped my dad,

33:27.120 --> 33:34.360
but also probably lots of other people. And, you know, the cost of setting up a website

33:34.360 --> 33:41.320
could be difficult or, you know, prohibitive for some people. And so now there are tools

33:41.320 --> 33:48.160
to allow that. And there's obviously a difference between free software, free of cost software,

33:48.160 --> 33:55.320
and free software in the philosophical sense of free to reuse, modify, do whatever you'd

33:55.320 --> 34:00.960
like with it. You know, I think that the being able to do whatever you want with it is so

34:00.960 --> 34:05.760
powerful because it really allows somebody to not have to do something from scratch,

34:05.760 --> 34:13.280
but really build upon somebody else's work and to continue to focus on the problem as

34:13.280 --> 34:20.300
opposed to have to deal with some of the more logistical effort in solving that challenge.

34:20.300 --> 34:28.960
So anyway, I really have been drawn to the open source movement as a result of my family

34:28.960 --> 34:34.880
background even, and just kind of the hopes and dreams that I have for making a difference

34:34.880 --> 34:35.880
in the world.

34:35.880 --> 34:40.240
Yeah, it sounds like it necessarily touches a deep place in you. And yet that's also the

34:40.240 --> 34:46.280
place where you get a lot of your courage and a lot of your motivation to make those

34:46.280 --> 34:56.040
differences. Do you feel like with your experience working in Endless and helping create what

34:56.040 --> 35:01.840
Endless has become, do you feel like you've achieved that in some ways? Or do you feel

35:01.840 --> 35:07.120
like you got to see that firsthand in some instances?

35:07.120 --> 35:14.160
Yeah, you know, I was really involved in all steps of that. And so, you know, one of the

35:14.160 --> 35:20.240
coolest things was going out into the field. We had this policy where they wanted everybody

35:20.240 --> 35:26.680
in the company to go to our target markets and meet our users and really hear from them.

35:26.680 --> 35:31.920
And that was so rewarding because you could see how people who normally shied away from

35:31.920 --> 35:39.320
technology or didn't see how it could really benefit them, really see how it could be a

35:39.320 --> 35:47.640
huge enabler. And, you know, for example, there was in Guatemala, one of the things

35:47.640 --> 35:55.720
that is difficult is that children are being required to do homework and research things

35:55.720 --> 36:05.320
on the internet. And because a lot of children in rural areas don't have internet connections

36:05.320 --> 36:13.160
at home, they have to go to a computer lab or internet cafe and pay for that. But because

36:13.160 --> 36:20.400
their parents aren't able to support the cost of sending five children to do reports at

36:20.400 --> 36:25.320
internet cafes, sometimes they're unable to complete their homework. And then, you know,

36:25.320 --> 36:31.560
they end up having to drop out of school. And so, having a computer that has a lot of

36:31.560 --> 36:38.720
preloaded information and just had like the 80% of the most searched for articles for

36:38.720 --> 36:44.960
that particular country preloaded and it had a lot of other resources, again, completely

36:44.960 --> 36:50.680
available offline. And something as simple as that could really be a game changer and

36:50.680 --> 36:59.880
help people, you know, be able to continue to go to school. So, I saw lots of these different

36:59.880 --> 37:08.120
stories and, you know, ways that our technology was really impacting people's lives. And when

37:08.120 --> 37:14.120
you ask me, you know, did we accomplish everything? I think I always in all that I do, I really

37:14.120 --> 37:23.600
try to have both a micro and macro level of impact where I really try to do things immediately

37:23.600 --> 37:28.060
for my family, for my friends. But then I also like to dream big and think about the

37:28.060 --> 37:33.760
billions of people, how can I serve there? And, you know, so for those instances, like

37:33.760 --> 37:40.840
I saw some real impact even there. However, we really hit some challenges when we were

37:40.840 --> 37:47.920
trying to expand. I think that our business model didn't completely work and we had to

37:47.920 --> 37:56.440
shift to try to, you know, find ways to gain traction in different countries. And we just

37:56.440 --> 38:01.880
were hit again and again with how, you know, especially Microsoft is really good at business

38:01.880 --> 38:07.200
development. And we often found that if we had started up, you know, to talk to a government

38:07.200 --> 38:12.080
or something like that, then, oh, actually our project got canceled and oh, something

38:12.080 --> 38:18.320
with Microsoft happened. And not to say that, you know, there was any shady business or

38:18.320 --> 38:22.680
anything, but it just shows that they are a huge player and they're doing something

38:22.680 --> 38:30.120
right where they're really going out and spending, like they have the network there to really

38:30.120 --> 38:36.760
continue to grow. And for a small company that was, you know, trying to also get more

38:36.760 --> 38:42.320
people to see the value in LibreOffice as opposed to Microsoft Office, it was tough.

38:42.320 --> 38:50.280
And it just, unfortunately, we weren't able to do as much globally as we wanted to. So

38:50.280 --> 39:00.400
the company shifted to focus on the hack computer, which is to, it's still endless OS, but it's

39:00.400 --> 39:06.640
now more designed to help children learn more about open source software and to start programming.

39:06.640 --> 39:14.200
It's like a really cool game where they can start to, it's a game, but it ends up helping

39:14.200 --> 39:20.240
them modify applications within their own computer. And it's just, it's really cool.

39:20.240 --> 39:28.140
And so, you know, shifted strategy to really help the next generation see the benefits

39:28.140 --> 39:33.400
of open source software, which I think is still a really awesome thing to do. But yeah,

39:33.400 --> 39:38.640
so when you ask again about, like, did I reach the goals that I wanted to with Endless, I

39:38.640 --> 39:46.520
would say my goal in touching people's lives, definitely. And I would have, you know, I

39:46.520 --> 39:51.600
wish that it had been wildly successful in the global outreach part. So.

39:51.600 --> 40:00.760
Well, and that's the thing, like that is a massive hope to reach, you know, very large

40:00.760 --> 40:07.040
groups of people and make a difference in the world. Just that word, you know, that's

40:07.040 --> 40:14.120
trying to reach more than just your neighbors, right? And so to have that sort of as your

40:14.120 --> 40:21.440
horizon allows you to accomplish some really amazing things while you're doing the work.

40:21.440 --> 40:27.020
But so I don't think you should necessarily be too hard on yourself because it sounds

40:27.020 --> 40:33.040
like you made some really profound impacts on even a few individuals that you had experience

40:33.040 --> 40:38.640
with. But it seems to me like, you know, I heard years ago about Endless OS. And so even

40:38.640 --> 40:44.720
someone like me who was reading about it because I cared about some of these same topics, just

40:44.720 --> 40:52.120
knowing that Endless was out there doing some of that important work feels like a real success

40:52.120 --> 40:54.320
overall.

40:54.320 --> 40:59.320
And I think that the lasting impact, too, is our contributions upstream to GNOME and

40:59.320 --> 41:06.480
just in the various technologies that we touched, really advocating for making it really user-friendly

41:06.480 --> 41:13.600
for reaching an audience beyond just, you know, engineers or technical users and really

41:13.600 --> 41:22.640
pushing that upstream in a, you know, community that I think had predominantly technical users

41:22.640 --> 41:26.440
or basically faced that type of an audience.

41:26.440 --> 41:36.760
So I'm really happy to see some of those changes. I think one big thing was Flatpak and FlatHub

41:36.760 --> 41:42.000
really having like a store, a place where people could go to find applications in one

41:42.000 --> 41:48.720
single area. We were, of course, not the only ones that contributed to that. In fact, it

41:48.720 --> 41:54.480
was led by others, but we contributed heavily towards that and shared our knowledge of,

41:54.480 --> 41:58.960
you know, usability testing and all that kind of stuff to help improve it and make it really

41:58.960 --> 42:06.240
usable. So, yeah, lasting contributions.

42:06.240 --> 42:11.240
They sound quite lasting. And those are the kind of things that just kind of inform the

42:11.240 --> 42:17.680
future. I know you're using Endless OS for some of your daily work as well. Is that right?

42:17.680 --> 42:25.640
Yeah, I still use it as my personal computer. I just I love how simple it is to use. It's

42:25.640 --> 42:29.280
something that I can, you know, show any of my friends and family and have them instantly

42:29.280 --> 42:33.400
be like, oh, cool, like that makes sense. So, yeah.

42:33.400 --> 42:40.280
And so would you say, you know, for those listening, is it approachable by anyone, even

42:40.280 --> 42:45.480
if it was designed maybe for a specific purpose? But it sounds like the design energy that

42:45.480 --> 42:50.440
went into it was to try to just make it friendly for humans, period. Do you feel like that's

42:50.440 --> 42:51.440
true?

42:51.440 --> 42:58.440
Yes, definitely. And I think that one of the big things is that it uses OSTree, which basically

42:58.440 --> 43:05.000
makes the updating process really easy. Again, I can't delve into the technical details behind

43:05.000 --> 43:11.560
all of this. But one of the things that initially kind of scared me from Linux in general was

43:11.560 --> 43:17.880
having to deal with command line to do anything.

43:17.880 --> 43:22.120
Yeah, that's a fairly common fear, right?

43:22.120 --> 43:32.620
Yes. So, you know, even just that was a huge one for us. And it's something that, you know,

43:32.620 --> 43:39.900
in certain cases, like we've seen a lot of people who want to bring open source software

43:39.900 --> 43:48.440
to schools or to communities that would benefit from the technology. And it's just something

43:48.440 --> 43:54.220
that they can leave there and not worry about people like breaking or, you know, like not

43:54.220 --> 44:00.580
being able to update. And it's just super easy. And this makes me think about like the

44:00.580 --> 44:09.200
adoption process. And we're often compared to one laptop per child. And one of the things

44:09.200 --> 44:15.640
that we learned from that project is that if you bring technology to a new area and

44:15.640 --> 44:25.240
you don't teach the teachers to use it, oftentimes the technology will fail because the teachers

44:25.240 --> 44:29.200
don't know how to use it. And so they don't necessarily encourage the students to use

44:29.200 --> 44:33.880
them or, you know, they might even not use the technology because it's embarrassing or

44:33.880 --> 44:41.560
any other reason. And so one of the things that we tried to do when we were trying to

44:41.560 --> 44:47.640
get more people to use it was to also invest in the training programs. But we found that

44:47.640 --> 44:53.520
it was already really easy for people to use, but it was more so about like helping people

44:53.520 --> 44:59.640
understand the utility of using a computer because sometimes they didn't even like think

44:59.640 --> 45:05.280
that it was relevant to them. So that was really fascinating for me.

45:05.280 --> 45:11.260
Nouritze, is there a question that you would put to our audience? Or it doesn't even need

45:11.260 --> 45:15.360
to be a question. It could be something you'd like them to go see or something you want

45:15.360 --> 45:19.320
them to experience or think about even.

45:19.320 --> 45:24.360
I would just say that, you know, there's so much buzz around diversity and inclusion.

45:24.360 --> 45:28.760
And I know that people have different thoughts and feelings about this. Overall, people seem

45:28.760 --> 45:40.040
to agree that diversity is important. However, you know, there are people who are not as

45:40.040 --> 45:47.800
enthusiastic about the methods to reach this. What I would like to stress is that it's about

45:47.800 --> 45:53.480
experiences and how you make people feel and about really trying to connect with others

45:53.480 --> 45:59.240
and understand other people's perspectives. And I think that if we keep that in mind,

45:59.240 --> 46:04.240
that's really what's going to help us create better products. And that will sort of naturally

46:04.240 --> 46:10.920
lead to diversity and inclusion. That's not to say that we shouldn't put an effort into

46:10.920 --> 46:16.360
programs that will help foster that. But just as we're creating these programs to really

46:16.360 --> 46:23.680
think about that experience that people are having. And so, you know, we all care about

46:23.680 --> 46:29.240
technology. And I think that if we keep in mind that human-centered focus, that that's

46:29.240 --> 46:33.000
really where we're going to create magic.

46:33.000 --> 46:34.000
I like magic.

46:34.000 --> 46:37.520
I do, too. I'm a huge fan.

46:37.520 --> 46:40.640
If people wanted to connect with you, then where would they reach you?

46:40.640 --> 46:46.340
I have lots of different ways to be contacted. But my personal email is probably the best

46:46.340 --> 46:53.120
way to go because the Magnum one's having a little bit of problems these days. I can't

46:53.120 --> 47:01.760
send mail from it. So, yeah, it's nuritsi s at gmail.com. My name is really difficult.

47:01.760 --> 47:13.080
So N as in Nancy, U, R, I, T as in Tom, Z as in Zebra, I, S as in Sam at gmail.com.

47:13.080 --> 47:17.760
And I'm also on Telegram as Nuritsi, my first name.

47:17.760 --> 47:23.920
That's great. I'm sure that'll be plenty for ways for people to connect. So thank you.

47:23.920 --> 47:29.260
Yeah, I want to also say thanks for connecting with me. We've had a lot of fun during this

47:29.260 --> 47:33.760
chat. And I hope we can get connected in the future, too.

47:33.760 --> 47:38.480
Thank you so much for having me. It's always a pleasure speaking with you, Brent. So thank

47:38.480 --> 47:39.480
you.

47:39.480 --> 47:45.120
Thank you for your time and for giggling with me and all of those great things. So we'll

47:45.120 --> 47:46.120
chat again soon.

47:46.120 --> 48:09.720
Sounds great.
