00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,280
Hi, everyone, it's Joe here. And today I'm going to talk to you about what I've learned

2
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:17,120
over the last seven years of being a podcaster. And the last kind of 18 months of being professional

3
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:23,160
full time with it. Let me get this caveat out of the way. First of all, these are just

4
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:29,660
my opinions. And you may have differing opinions. If you do, I'd love to hear from you. I'm

5
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:34,040
always interested in a conversation about these things. There's as much art as there

6
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,640
is science in this. And everyone has their own way of doing things. This is just what

7
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:43,000
I think. So if you want to get in touch with me, then at Joe Rissington on Twitter, or

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,120
extras dot show slash contact. So with that out of the way, the first part of this is

9
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:54,320
the recording space, where you're going to actually be when you record. Now, most people

10
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:00,120
will be looking to do this in their home office, let's say. Now, the ideal office has got no

11
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:07,680
clutter in it, a lovely hardwood floor, minimalist decor, lots of hard surfaces everywhere. Well,

12
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,640
unsurprisingly, that is a terrible studio. It's a terrible studio, because all those

13
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:18,280
hard surfaces create echo. And that is what you don't want on your recordings. What you

14
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:24,840
ideally want is to have as dead a sound as possible. And by that, I mean, no echo, no

15
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,680
reverb, no anything else apart from your voice. And so there are a few ways of getting rid

16
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:37,760
of that echo. The first one is just with basic physics. If you surround yourself with soft,

17
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:46,600
fluffy things, then they will absorb the reverberations, the echo, and make it sound better. So just

18
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:52,880
generally lots of stuff and clutter is a good start. So not being tidy, not having perfect

19
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:59,800
hard surfaces everywhere, that can help. Having a carpet or a rug rather than a wooden floor,

20
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:05,240
that's a great start. Even getting things like cushions and pillows or duvets, comforters,

21
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:09,360
blankets, whatever, and just trying to cover up the surfaces and just trying to get as

22
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:16,080
much of that bulk into the room with you and towels and bedsheets, just anything soft.

23
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,840
Now if you want to spend some money on this, the first thing that you can do is get some

24
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:25,360
acoustic foam panels. They're usually around about a foot by a foot or 30 centimeters by

25
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:31,160
30 centimeters. And they come in various colors. Black is the most common. But you can either

26
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:36,160
get kind of a bobbly pattern on them or sometimes they have like a row of teeth like in a triangle

27
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,660
pattern. It doesn't really matter what you go for. It's just that same basic physics

28
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:48,560
principle that they are soft and foamy and will absorb sound and reverberations. So you

29
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,960
can stick them all over your walls. Obviously that doesn't look great. You can do it quite

30
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:58,280
artistically if you're not like me and then it can look okay but it's generally not going

31
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:03,880
to get spousal approval. What you can do if you're a little bit handy and practical is

32
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:08,440
build yourself some sort of room divider. That's something that Drew did and there's

33
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:14,960
a blog post that we can link to telling you how he did it. And that is basically the same

34
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:19,560
principle as sticking these foam panels on your wall but it's just on something that

35
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:24,400
can be folded away and looks a bit neater when you're not recording. Of course if you

36
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:31,560
want to get really serious then setting yourself up in a dedicated space for recording is the

37
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:36,900
best. Now if you're in America you might have a big enough closet to do that and thankfully

38
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:43,720
closets tend to be full of clothes which are soft and absorb sound and so that is a great

39
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:47,960
place to start. Now I hope Elle doesn't mind me saying this but that's where she records

40
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:54,580
in her closet and I think it sounds great on her recordings. Or you could build yourself

41
00:03:54,580 --> 00:04:02,760
a little room like I have. My room isn't ideal because it's quite small and I've got bedsheets

42
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:07,840
hanging on the walls of it. I'm not very happy with it to be honest. I have ordered some

43
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,040
acoustic panels. I've got some up. They helped a little bit but I need to put some more up

44
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:16,040
so I need to get some more of them and I'm hoping that I'll be happier with the sound

45
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:21,480
after that. But it's kind of good enough for me and most importantly being in London it's

46
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:26,880
very loud around here. There's a lot of planes and just general noise and being in a dedicated

47
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:34,600
room kind of helps with that. Now the second topic is types of microphone. There are essentially

48
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:39,960
two main types of microphone that you can buy. One of them is a condenser and the other

49
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:45,400
is a dynamic. The main difference between a condenser microphone and a dynamic microphone

50
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:51,680
is that the condenser requires power and is more sensitive and in ideal situations and

51
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:59,080
a stress ideal it sounds better or can sound better than a dynamic mic. A dynamic mic doesn't

52
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:07,840
require power and it is less sensitive and in an ideal studio setting might not necessarily

53
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:15,480
sound as good as a good condenser. Some typical examples are the Blue Yeti and the Blue Snowball.

54
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:21,920
They are condenser mics and they are incredibly popular and they are a terrible microphone

55
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:26,880
for most people getting into podcasting. I have got the Rode NT1 which I'm talking to

56
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:33,280
you on now. Again I'm not massively happy with it but it's doing the job and I'm happy

57
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:40,420
enough. The most common dynamic mic is a Shure SM58. That is what you'll see stand-up comedians

58
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:46,680
and singers generally in a live situation using. They are great microphones and you

59
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:51,540
could do worse than that. I know some guys who do professional podcasting with them.

60
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:57,120
It's not necessarily my first choice but they are okay. The Rode Podcaster which is used

61
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:05,360
on BSD now, Benedict and Alan have both got one, that's an okay mic. That's USB and dynamic.

62
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:12,080
Most of the Jupiter broadcasting crew have got an Electro Voice RE320. That is basically

63
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:17,400
everyone apart from Chris. He has an RE20 which is basically a better version of that

64
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:22,280
because he's the boss. He has to have the best obviously. Some of the pros and cons

65
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:27,840
of these microphones. The condenser, the pros are that it sounds better in a perfect setup

66
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:33,380
in my opinion. Some people may disagree with that but I think it does. It's also more forgiving

67
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:39,360
of poor mic technique. By poor mic technique, if you drift away a little bit like this or

68
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:46,440
you're talking around the side of it, it doesn't sound great but it's not as bad as it can

69
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:51,720
be with a dynamic mic where you have to have really good mic technique because if you drift

70
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:57,440
away from it, even a little bit like this, I'm a few inches away, the drop-off in volume

71
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:03,360
is a lot more than with a condenser so it's more forgiving if you don't have a good technique.

72
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:09,320
The cons of a condenser mic are that it picks up everything in the room and beyond the room

73
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:15,000
and I mean everything. If I shuffle my feet around, that's just rubbing on the carpet,

74
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,680
you can hear that quite clearly. With a dynamic mic, you'll hear a lot less of that. Also

75
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:25,200
the echo factor, if you haven't got a perfect room then it's going to pick up a lot more

76
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:31,240
of that echo versus your voice which you want it to pick up. I tend to fiddle with things

77
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:35,400
while I'm recording as well. I've kind of got a bit better at that but if there's anything

78
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:42,920
like sweet wrappers, it picks up that really loudly or clicking pens or anything and anything

79
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:47,560
outside as well. I live fairly near Heathrow and so sometimes there's planes going over

80
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:52,280
that are really loud and my condenser mic picks that up quite loudly and I have to kind

81
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:58,760
of pause and edit it out which is very annoying and noisy neighbours and sirens and dogs and

82
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:04,600
just anything you can imagine that's outside, it will pick that up potentially. Whereas

83
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:09,840
with a dynamic mic, it picks up more of your voice compared with that other noise that

84
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:17,080
you don't want including echo from your room. One of the main disadvantages is that it requires

85
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:22,200
good mic technique. You have to stay in the sweet spot so I haven't got a dynamic mic

86
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:26,760
here to demonstrate that but if you drift away from it then it can give quite a different

87
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:31,520
sound and it just sounds a bit weird so you need to kind of be much better at working

88
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:37,080
the mic. Now whether you go for a condenser mic or a dynamic, you have two choices at

89
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:43,880
that point. Either you go for a USB microphone or you go for a microphone with an XLR connection

90
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:48,200
which you then need to plug into an interface which then plugs into the computer. Whereas

91
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:55,180
with a USB mic, it's much simpler. Just a mic, a USB cable and a computer. However,

92
00:08:55,180 --> 00:09:01,720
if you buy a USB only microphone like the standard Yeti, you are limited in that it

93
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:06,760
has to be USB connection. You can't use it in any other situation. You can't upgrade

94
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:13,640
the mic and keep your interface. It's cheaper to buy a USB mic than a mic and an interface

95
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:19,820
but I think it's kind of like buy cheap, buy twice situation. If you buy an interface that's

96
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:26,760
good enough and even a fairly cheap one, less than $100, I think the one that a lot of the

97
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:33,400
crew uses is the Zoom U22. I think you can pick that up for 50 pounds sometimes on Amazon.

98
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:39,040
That will allow you to try out different microphones and upgrade microphones over time whereas

99
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:45,380
with a USB mic, you're just stuck with it. Another big disadvantage of using a USB mic

100
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:50,440
is that they tend to be quite noisy because if you're going to cram all of the electronics

101
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:57,240
that make it an audio interface into a microphone, then the electronics are kind of too close

102
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:05,000
to the capsule, the thing that picks up the sound. So often with Yetis, I get recordings

103
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:11,320
from people who have used Yeti and it's full of kind of ground noise, just buzz and hiss

104
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:17,120
and it's just not ideal really whereas you are less likely to suffer from that kind of

105
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:22,160
thing with a proper USB interface and XLR microphone.

106
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,720
One thing that's quite important regardless of what kind of microphone you use is a pop

107
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:30,180
shield or pop filter as they're sometimes called. That is to remove what we call plosives

108
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:35,680
or the puh-puh sound. Now if I come around and get out of the way of my pop shield and

109
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:40,640
I say Peter Piper, you'll hear how terrible that sounds whereas if in front of my pop

110
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:46,240
shield I say Peter Piper, you can hardly hear that plosive sound.

111
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:51,400
The two main types of those are the foam type which is kind of a round foam thing that you

112
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:57,360
push over the microphone and they are somewhat effective. They're definitely better than

113
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,960
nothing and they look better if you're doing video because they obscure your face less

114
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:06,640
than the other type which is kind of the arm type as I call it that clamps to the mic stand

115
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:12,880
and then it's a circle with a kind of thin layer of foam usually that you can move around

116
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:17,520
and put in front of the microphone. Now they're better if you're only doing audio but maybe

117
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:23,640
the foam round type that fits over the mic is better if you're doing video.

118
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:28,340
So once you've got your gear sorted you want to record your actual podcast. Now I'm assuming

119
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:32,240
that most people will be doing this remote. It's kind of a little bit different if you're

120
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:37,960
doing it in person but it's more likely that you're going to find compatible people online

121
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:42,000
and that's kind of how most Linux podcasts are done these days so let's assume you're

122
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,680
doing that. I'm not going to talk about any software specifically. I'm going to try and

123
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:51,520
talk about principles here because it doesn't matter whether you're using something like

124
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:58,680
Audacity or Ardour or Reaper or GarageBand or whatever it is you're using. The principles

125
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:04,440
are roughly the same. Now what we always do when we record a podcast is make sure that

126
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:09,040
we're all recording and then we record some absolute silence. If you've ever caught Linux

127
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:13,880
Unplugged live you will have listened to this. Now the reason that you record absolute silence

128
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:20,760
is it's not actually silent. When you stop talking you stop moving you stop breathing

129
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:28,640
what you record is hiss, hum, buzz, all the stuff that you want rid of. Now if you record

130
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:35,460
a bit of absolute silence for say five or ten seconds then you can use noise removal

131
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:41,360
software to get rid of all that hiss that you don't want. I use Audacity for this but

132
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,600
there are tons of other ways of doing it but the principle is always the same. You need

133
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,800
to train the algorithm on the silence the stuff that you want rid of and then apply

134
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:56,080
that to the whole recording. I cannot stress enough how important it is for this silence

135
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:01,920
to be absolute silence. If you're training an algorithm on what you want to remove and

136
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:09,620
you leave in scratching of neck beards or shuffling feet or breathing then it's going

137
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:15,440
to detract from the sound quality of what is left after you've removed that noise. That's

138
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:20,960
why whenever I come to do my noise removal I listen to the absolute silence and make

139
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:25,640
sure that it is just the hiss and buzz and everything we want rid of and that there is

140
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:31,280
no breathing or whatever. I do that by turning the volume up to the absolute max that I can

141
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:36,240
get it and then I listen out for just even little sounds and try and select a bit of

142
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:42,240
that audio that is just the silence that you want rid of. That's why it's very important

143
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:48,440
to capture that silence properly in the first place. Assuming that your recording all went

144
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:52,480
well and everyone has sent you their flack or wave file or whatever and you line them

145
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,840
up in Audacity or whatever software you're using one of the first things that you'll

146
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:04,880
probably want to do is EQ equalization. There are various different types of EQ plugin but

147
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:10,160
the type that I like the best is parametric EQ because that is a good visual representation

148
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:15,000
of all of the audio frequencies. Generally speaking on the left that's going to be the

149
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:22,080
lower frequencies and then on the right it's going to be the higher frequencies. So usually

150
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:28,280
they go way lower than humans can even hear to real sub bass on the left and then to really

151
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:34,300
high pitched frequencies which if you're a little bit older like me you can't hear anymore.

152
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:41,160
Now the basic EQ that I use is just cutting the low end the real low end boom as I call

153
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:48,080
it and we're talking about the real bassiness here of a person's voice. The reason that

154
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:54,760
I do that is because people who listen in a car to podcasts which is quite common their

155
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:58,560
car stereos tend to have a lot of bass in them and if there's too much rumbling bass

156
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,780
in someone's voice then it makes it very difficult to hear what they're actually saying because

157
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:07,800
it's just boom and rumble rather than the bits that you want to hear of their voice.

158
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:16,060
Once I've done that then it's a case of either boosting or cutting various frequencies depending

159
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:23,240
on the quality of the recording how that compares to other people's voices and I tend to be

160
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:29,960
quite sparing with EQ because it's quite easy to mess it up and make it sound terrible.

161
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:36,360
Drew tends to use more EQ than I do and this is something that is a real art rather than

162
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:41,680
science this is what you want it to sound like and the only real way to know what you

163
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,600
want it to sound like is to experiment and maybe there might be a particular frequency

164
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,760
that you want rid of or maybe someone's kind of muffled and you want to boost the high

165
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:55,680
end it's too individual for me to tell you exactly how to do it unfortunately.

166
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:01,600
The next thing is compression now we're not talking about compression like zip compression

167
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:07,040
or mp3 compression we're talking about dynamic compression that means that the parts where

168
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,560
it's really loud will become quieter and the parts where it's really quiet will become

169
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:17,440
louder and it makes everything roughly the same volume now much like with EQ the right

170
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:24,120
level of compression is very much subjective if you listen to the radio they tend to use

171
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:29,960
a lot of compression and I mean a lot to the point where someone yelling at the top of

172
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:35,120
their voice would be the same volume as if they're whispering into the microphone there's

173
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:41,360
real divided opinion on this I tend to use quite a lot of compression as I said because

174
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:46,280
I think about people driving in their cars again if there are too many dynamics in the

175
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:52,640
volume of the podcast then it makes it difficult to listen to because you're constantly having

176
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:56,600
to turn it up and then the next person speaks really loud and you have to turn that down

177
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:02,520
again or someone might have inconsistency in the level that they are talking and compression

178
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:09,080
is a quick and dirty fix for that but it does have a sound in of itself so again it's something

179
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:14,560
you have to experiment with the more you compress it the more it's going to sound like radio

180
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:20,840
some people like their mixes to breathe they like it to have a lot of dynamic in it but

181
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:25,920
personally I would rather use a little bit too much compression than not enough and so

182
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:30,800
the final thing is editing now some people record live to tape line it all up export

183
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:38,120
it job done that's not what I tend to do I tend to go through and edit it properly this

184
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:42,880
could be a whole episode in of itself how to actually do editing but I'll give you a

185
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:51,040
few tips that I always give people the first is leave a beat and by that I mean if you

186
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:58,200
get to the end of a sentence there's usually a cap between that sentence and the next sentence

187
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:03,080
if you listen to me now I'm leaving pauses there because that's how humans talk a very

188
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:08,720
common mistake that people make is doing the cut at the end of a sentence and then they

189
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,840
cut from the beginning of the next sentence and then they mash them together so there

190
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:18,080
is no gap between them I'll give you a very quick example of that now I'll now speak the

191
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:22,520
next sentence and then I'll speak the next sentence and then I'll speak the next sentence

192
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:27,440
as I recorded that I left a standard pause like you'd expect in any human conversation

193
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:32,560
but you hear how that sounded a bit weird well that is a mistake that a lot of people

194
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:37,340
make it's almost become a style on YouTube now there are huge YouTubers whose style is

195
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:42,840
like that and I cannot watch their videos because it's just too annoying it's too frantic

196
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:49,560
every time they edit they don't leave the beat in there and it's it's kind of younger

197
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:54,600
people maybe get off my lawn whatever I don't know maybe people like to listen to audio

198
00:18:54,600 --> 00:19:00,720
that is edited like that I certainly don't another tip is don't cut off breaths I suppose

199
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,620
I will give you an example of that now if you cut off the breath there you hear that

200
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:10,740
sounds a bit weird the best way if you are doing a cut that involves a breath is to use

201
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:17,040
fades fading in and fading out but again that takes a bit of practice the final tip when

202
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:23,380
it comes to editing is listen back in full because things can go wrong you may get through

203
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:27,800
your edit and you think you've done everything perfectly and you export it and then you publish

204
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:31,360
it and then you go to bed and then you wake up to a bunch of comments saying well what

205
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:37,100
was that weird bit in there or how come there was no audio on the left channel for 20 minutes

206
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:43,160
or whatever I think that it is a disrespect to the audience to not listen back how do

207
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:47,540
you expect them to listen to your whole show if you can't even be bothered to do it yourself

208
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:52,680
yes it adds the length of the show to the process so if you're doing a two-hour show

209
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:57,220
then that's two hours of listen back but I think you've got to do it and I think that's

210
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:04,040
what sets apart people who care from people who don't and my final tip here is don't mess

211
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:09,720
with your recording machine we in the Linux world like to distro hop a lot and try out

212
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:15,440
different desktop environments and try new software all the time I do not recommend that

213
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:21,000
I recommend if at all possible whether it's a partition or a physical machine get it so

214
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,540
it's working and leave it that way get another laptop pick up a cheap think pad or something

215
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:30,920
if you want to mess around with different distros set yourself up with a machine that

216
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:36,820
works and just leave it that way because there is nothing more upsetting to the creative

217
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:42,140
process than technical difficulties you sit down to record something like I decided to

218
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:47,600
sit down and record this today if I had had technical issues it would have been very frustrating

219
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:52,400
and would have probably led to me not recording this whereas I have a setup that I know works

220
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:59,960
I plug in my various equipment start recording simple so don't mess with your recording machine

221
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:04,760
so well done if you made it this far with me rambling about all this stuff like I said

222
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:09,860
at the beginning these are just my opinions and there may be stuff that you can teach

223
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:14,480
me and if you can great get in touch let's start a conversation about this because I'm

224
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:19,360
always willing to learn and also let me know if you want more detail or specifics on any

225
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:48,280
of the topics that are covered here at Joe Rissington on Twitter or extras.show.com
