WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:15.360
Well, hi, Jill, hello, Brent. I'm so excited.

00:15.360 --> 00:22.700
So this is another Brent with Brent and you have been wonderfully excited to be on. And

00:22.700 --> 00:28.800
so I should introduce you a little bit more. So I'm joined here today by Jill Bryant Reinecker

00:28.800 --> 00:34.880
and Jill, I would love for you to just give us a little taste of what you do.

00:34.880 --> 00:42.320
So I am a co-host on Linux Weekly Daily Wednesday with Linux Game Cast on the Linux Game Cast

00:42.320 --> 00:49.700
network. And I do game streams with them. And I'm also the community organizer, otherwise

00:49.700 --> 00:58.000
known as the morale czar. That's what they named me. And I'm so I do lots of podcasts

00:58.000 --> 01:03.400
and I love joining in with Linux Unplugged and yeah, regular guests there. That's how

01:03.400 --> 01:08.720
we got to kind of meet for the first time. Yeah, that was awesome. And the Friday stream,

01:08.720 --> 01:16.360
which I do miss. Many of us do. Yeah, for sure. And then I'm also in part of the Big

01:16.360 --> 01:23.800
Danny Linux community as well. And just was interviewed by Rocco, too. I should also mention

01:23.800 --> 01:31.000
there's Linux Checks LA in there as well. Oh, yes, yes. Very, very important. Yes. I

01:31.000 --> 01:37.700
just want to point out that I gave a listen to your Linux spotlight with with Rocco, which

01:37.700 --> 01:44.040
came out very recently. And, and it was an amazing conversation. So I would encourage

01:44.040 --> 01:48.760
everyone to go give that a listen. It was I was laughing throughout, I was smiling,

01:48.760 --> 01:54.760
I learned a lot about you. So I'm going to try not to sort of repeat that because I think

01:54.760 --> 01:59.680
it's it was a really great conversation everybody can enjoy. So I'm here, I think with you and

01:59.680 --> 02:05.960
I were just going to dive into a whole bunch of other stuff informed by that. So one thing

02:05.960 --> 02:14.000
I want to start with actually is how come you have such a bright and wonderful personality

02:14.000 --> 02:19.440
that's so contagious. That's one of the things that just like, was immediately apparent to

02:19.440 --> 02:25.460
me. And it seems like you're always smiling. You know, for for those of the podcasts that

02:25.460 --> 02:30.180
have a little bit of video and do you get that a lot? Like people are just like attracted

02:30.180 --> 02:36.160
to you for that energy. It seems like a really great gift. Yeah. Oh, thank you. Yeah, I get

02:36.160 --> 02:44.000
that a lot. And I've just always my glass has always been half full. Yeah, that's such

02:44.000 --> 02:50.500
a nice way to look at the world. Right? Yeah. Yeah. Tell me a little bit about podcasting.

02:50.500 --> 02:56.380
So I know you've been doing it for a long time now. And so give me a little taste of

02:56.380 --> 03:01.260
how you first got into it and where you think it's going. And I know you wanted to mention

03:01.260 --> 03:07.220
Chris in there. Yeah. So Chris Fisher, you're the one who inspired me to get into Linux

03:07.220 --> 03:15.620
podcasting. I had been wanting to do this for so long. I've had years of broadcasting

03:15.620 --> 03:25.140
experience. In fact, I did produce and DJ my own show for almost 16 years in my 20s.

03:25.140 --> 03:31.660
Tell me more about that. That sounds really fascinating. So I did it. It was a what we

03:31.660 --> 03:38.700
call synth music or crowd rock music, electronic music show. And because it's it's not the

03:38.700 --> 03:43.980
genre music that is typically heard here in the United States, but it's a very part of

03:43.980 --> 03:48.220
the European art scene and an experimental scene. And how did you first get connected

03:48.220 --> 03:54.700
to that music then? Well, I had been a listener for years on another radio show. And this

03:54.700 --> 04:03.700
is this is, you know, years ago in the 80s. And I started co-hosting on a radio show here

04:03.700 --> 04:09.100
in Los Angeles at Loyola Marymount University on a show called Alien Air Music. I love that

04:09.100 --> 04:15.940
title. Yeah, that's great. Pat Murphy was the first to play this genre in music. And

04:15.940 --> 04:21.260
then I decided to do my own show where I played, you know, different music than he did some

04:21.260 --> 04:27.940
of the same overlap, but different. And, you know, there were also no ladies into this

04:27.940 --> 04:35.380
genre in music. And that was that would be that was really interesting because a lot

04:35.380 --> 04:40.340
of the the musicians and artists who would contact me and send me music to play on my

04:40.340 --> 04:47.460
show thought I was a guy. Interesting. Yeah. Because Jill is Gil in, you know, a lot of

04:47.460 --> 04:53.020
the European countries and Russian. That's fascinating. Yeah. So they just assumed they

04:53.020 --> 05:00.660
were talking to a guy. Oh, that's hilarious. That's like maybe a strange advantage, actually,

05:00.660 --> 05:07.600
like a pen name. So that's really funny. Yeah, it was. In fact, I taught one of the

05:07.600 --> 05:13.820
artists from Russia. His name is Edward Artemiev. He's done quite a few soundtracks. And I got

05:13.820 --> 05:23.180
to talk to him in on the phone and he was asking, you know, is is is Gil Bryant at the

05:23.180 --> 05:29.620
residence? And I think my dad answered the phone and, oh, she's here. And I started talking

05:29.620 --> 05:35.900
and he's like, oh, my gosh, this is like a lady. This is a girl. I've been communicating

05:35.900 --> 05:45.580
with a girl. It's like Linux and my all my other hobbies and that I'm into. It's it's

05:45.580 --> 05:50.660
male dominant. And I'm just used to that. Well, and I want to ask you a little bit more

05:50.660 --> 05:57.360
about that, actually, because, you know, women in tech is certainly a totally great thing.

05:57.360 --> 06:01.480
And I'm a huge, massive supporter of it. For those who have listened to the episode with

06:01.480 --> 06:06.340
Elle, there's a whole bunch on that topic. Oh, yes, there, which was really great. But

06:06.340 --> 06:11.980
you know, does that has that felt discouraging at any point? Like it sounds like in the music

06:11.980 --> 06:15.740
in this music scene and also in the Linux scene, you're you're surrounded by a bunch

06:15.740 --> 06:21.660
of men, which, of course, can be totally fine. But has there been some challenges there,

06:21.660 --> 06:26.740
too? There has. But, you know, it was in the beginning, like in the early years of Linux,

06:26.740 --> 06:32.740
I'd gone to I'd gone to a lug and didn't feel welcome. Really? And I was just not even

06:32.740 --> 06:38.580
I they didn't even acknowledge me. Oh, that's so sad. Yeah. I was going up to introduce

06:38.580 --> 06:47.100
myself and say who I who I am. And and I didn't get acknowledged. And that was, yeah, really,

06:47.100 --> 06:51.140
you know, that really depressed me. And then I found out it turned out that my brother

06:51.140 --> 07:00.700
had worked with the person who ran that particular lug and said, oh, he's a bad seed. Oh, wow.

07:00.700 --> 07:05.260
It sounds like it wasn't about you is more about him. No, it just I guess he's just like

07:05.260 --> 07:10.540
that to everyone. But all the people that were part of that community were really nice.

07:10.540 --> 07:15.740
I wore one of my first Linux shirts, which was user been girl from ThinkGeek, you know,

07:15.740 --> 07:20.380
years ago. And I wore that and I got a lot of comments from the community there. But

07:20.380 --> 07:28.700
I just it was really I felt like, you know, it was very standoffish. That's too bad. And

07:28.700 --> 07:32.660
my brother said, Yeah, he was really hard to work with. So that was your one of your

07:32.660 --> 07:37.140
first experiences with that. But as far as I understand now, for instance, with like

07:37.140 --> 07:41.220
Linux checks and things like that, there's there's a whole positive spin to it, right?

07:41.220 --> 07:46.100
Yeah. And then after that, you know, I went a couple years without, you know, I was, you

07:46.100 --> 07:53.140
know, I've always been a huge Linux user and had been using it. And, but, and, you know,

07:53.140 --> 07:59.500
I started using it and literally 93. So, and I wanted to get involved more in the community.

07:59.500 --> 08:06.020
And that was, that was really sad. But things changed. Yeah. So this user is group. Did

08:06.020 --> 08:11.760
you go that one time and then feel kind of turned off and not go again? I did go again.

08:11.760 --> 08:15.540
And I still felt, you know, I figured, well, let me give it another chance. Good for you.

08:15.540 --> 08:21.780
Yeah. And I still felt not comfortable. So not your place, then not your kind of people.

08:21.780 --> 08:30.140
Yeah. And but then a few years later, I wanted to attend scale, the Southern California Linux

08:30.140 --> 08:36.460
Expo and purposely sought out the Linux chicks of Los Angeles, because I know, you know,

08:36.460 --> 08:44.500
they were like minded ladies in the field. And I had seen their meetings posted on the

08:44.500 --> 08:50.740
internet and the articles about the different conventions and the Linux chicks that were

08:50.740 --> 09:00.340
in the Linux journal, our favorite Linux journal is gone now. But I, I knew I wanted to connect

09:00.340 --> 09:08.180
with them. And that was one of my main reasons for going to scale. And that was scale 5x.

09:08.180 --> 09:13.660
And the first place I went after I registered is the, the gentlemen, the workers there were

09:13.660 --> 09:22.060
nice. Then it was Gareth Greenaway, and Ilan Rabinovich. And Gareth actually directed me

09:22.060 --> 09:28.180
straight. He, he, he took me straight to the Linux chicks LA booth. And I would have gone

09:28.180 --> 09:33.320
to scale the previous couple of years. But I was a little nervous. I thought, well, maybe

09:33.320 --> 09:38.400
I just I'm not as good enough in Linux, you know, did you feel like you might have had

09:38.400 --> 09:42.980
that same initial experience then? Yes. And there was a little bit of that too. I was

09:42.980 --> 09:49.140
a little a little nervous about that. But it was exact opposite. I went to the booth

09:49.140 --> 09:54.980
and they had they had a questionnaire on what apps you use on Linux. And I named, named

09:54.980 --> 10:06.340
all my favorites, of course, the GIMP and, and Inkscape then and Blender, and Xterm,

10:06.340 --> 10:07.340
you know, everything.

10:07.340 --> 10:10.140
So it sounds like you're well versed for sure.

10:10.140 --> 10:17.460
Yeah, I wrote down like little like 50 apps I use. And then then my favorite window managers,

10:17.460 --> 10:18.580
you know,

10:18.580 --> 10:20.340
you put an S on that, which I love

10:20.340 --> 10:27.780
window maker, you know, flexbox, openbox, TWM, the whole nine yards. And they were just

10:27.780 --> 10:33.780
kind of blown away. They're like, Oh, my gosh, you you you know, all the stuff you've been

10:33.780 --> 10:36.780
using Linux for so many years.

10:36.780 --> 10:42.540
Well, that's what I love is is like, there's many of us who are just kind of like, before

10:42.540 --> 10:45.860
we get introduced to the community, the greater community, there's a lot of us doing some

10:45.860 --> 10:50.820
cool stuff kind of just in the shadows a little bit, right. And I think for you and I now

10:50.820 --> 10:55.440
it's our job to kind of invite them out and say, Hey, come on out here. Like, it's pretty

10:55.440 --> 11:00.380
friendly out here. So but please continue the Linux chicks story. That's great.

11:00.380 --> 11:05.580
Yeah. So what was what was so amazing, it was one of the best days honestly, of my life

11:05.580 --> 11:12.300
going to that first dance scale. Wow, that is huge. And then then going to Linux chicks

11:12.300 --> 11:17.580
booth and within literally 20 minutes, they're like, they're like, they just give me gave

11:17.580 --> 11:24.200
me hugs. And it was exact opposite of what I experienced before in the whole scale community,

11:24.200 --> 11:30.780
you know, it was just a big if you're a Linux user, you got a hug. And they're inviting

11:30.780 --> 11:34.620
me and I'm like, Oh, come come behind the booth, Jill. And then I started helping them

11:34.620 --> 11:40.500
with their booth. And we were best friends forever. From that point. Wow, that sounds

11:40.500 --> 11:45.820
like a really powerful experience for you. It was and that was, you know, early 2000s.

11:45.820 --> 11:53.440
So and so you were a big Linux fan before going there. But I imagine having this experience,

11:53.440 --> 11:58.020
you were just a fan for life after that, all of a sudden, I was part of the community.

11:58.020 --> 12:02.540
And that just, that's, that's what did it was my, my scale family and my Linux chicks

12:02.540 --> 12:08.100
delay family. That's awesome. And that family continues up to today. Like you're still quite

12:08.100 --> 12:14.620
a bit involved. Tell us a little bit about that. Oh, yes. So. So it didn't take just

12:14.620 --> 12:19.180
literally that day. And they made me you know, they're Sharon's like, she was the president

12:19.180 --> 12:23.620
at the time. And within a few days, she's like, Jill, you're now a co organizer of the

12:23.620 --> 12:33.720
Linux chicks. Wow, that's awesome. So there's three of us that are co organizers. So it's

12:33.720 --> 12:41.600
an amazing organization, you know, basically to, to, you know, help get not only ladies

12:41.600 --> 12:50.980
in into Linux, and diversity in Linux, but men also, you know, we were not gender exclusive.

12:50.980 --> 12:57.040
So we have just as many men in our group as woman, which is great. I, I really applaud

12:57.040 --> 13:05.740
that sentiment of trying to be inclusive to everyone. And not necessarily leaving anybody

13:05.740 --> 13:10.420
out, right? I think that's super important, even if you come at it from from sort of a

13:10.420 --> 13:14.580
different angle. So yeah, kudos to you guys. That's really important work. I think that's

13:14.580 --> 13:20.020
great. In fact, at our meetups, we do hands on workshops teaching how to install Linux

13:20.020 --> 13:26.140
on raspberry pies and on computers. And we encourage, you know, new users, you know,

13:26.140 --> 13:32.180
of anyone to come. And usually we have more men than than than woman. But that's kind

13:32.180 --> 13:39.400
of normal. So there's just more, more, you know, men getting into it than women. So

13:39.400 --> 13:45.820
and how do you think, for yourself, how do you like, what, what led you to being just

13:45.820 --> 13:50.060
hooked on computers? Because I know, from what I've learned recently, that you have

13:50.060 --> 13:55.100
a number of them behind you and all of that stuff. But I know you had a brother who was

13:55.100 --> 13:59.500
interested in it. And what was this an older brother? Yes, yes. He's four years older.

13:59.500 --> 14:04.620
His name is Jack. So it's Jack and Jill. Yes. Oh, interesting. I have an older brother named

14:04.620 --> 14:09.580
Chris, who's four years older, who got me into computers. So it's really similar, actually.

14:09.580 --> 14:15.740
Oh, that's awesome. Brett, we have something in common. We have tons in common. Yeah. Oh,

14:15.740 --> 14:21.340
yes. Yes, we have everything so much in tech. And so I imagine Jack had a huge influence

14:21.340 --> 14:28.500
on you. Yes, definitely. He was one of the the first people to get into it in the 80s,

14:28.500 --> 14:32.740
you know, and that was before most people even had computers at home. So and we had

14:32.740 --> 14:39.820
just about everything at home. And he had an ad elite BBS. It was truly lead. In fact,

14:39.820 --> 14:45.660
he ended up getting jobs working directly with Bill Gates and Steve Jobs because of

14:45.660 --> 14:53.420
that BBS. Yeah. Wow. That that sounds amazing. And and your grandparents, too, had some kind

14:53.420 --> 14:59.860
of connection there as well, right? Yes. Apollo. Yeah, they were because here I live in the

14:59.860 --> 15:05.060
middle. That's that's why I grew up here is because of aerospace. You know, we have JPL

15:05.060 --> 15:12.860
and SpaceX and and Northrop Grumman and which was TRW and International Rectifier and all

15:12.860 --> 15:18.860
the big this is the think tank area where where a lot of the products are made that

15:18.860 --> 15:25.300
go into space. That sounds so fascinating. I want to know so much more. My grandparents

15:25.300 --> 15:31.540
were both top top secret with Apollo. So I just I grew up with that and my grandfather

15:31.540 --> 15:36.540
worked. Grandmother both worked, built tubes for the very first computers. So it's just

15:36.540 --> 15:40.860
been part of my family. Right. So how could you not be influenced by that? Yeah, it sounds

15:40.860 --> 15:45.900
like there's a real there's a real trade of that being handed down throughout your family.

15:45.900 --> 15:51.100
So that's a kind of an amazing history, actually. Yeah, I'm very, very proud of it. My give

15:51.100 --> 15:57.060
you a little bit. My grandmother was the one who built the engine that brought Apollo 13

15:57.060 --> 16:03.940
home. Oh, man. That was her engine. It wasn't intended. It was intended for the the the

16:03.940 --> 16:09.100
lamb not to bring them home, but it had enough power and was built so well that it could

16:09.100 --> 16:15.380
bring them back to Earth. That's unbelievable. She got a medal from the president and everything

16:15.380 --> 16:24.180
for that. So that's so cool. Wow. Yeah. I just got a pause for a moment. There's there's

16:24.180 --> 16:27.780
it sounds to me. So you started at a very young age being interested in computers then

16:27.780 --> 16:33.900
and and so that has brought you all the way to today where you that hasn't given up in

16:33.900 --> 16:39.420
any way. It seems like right. You're still you seem like a tinkerer at heart and just

16:39.420 --> 16:44.580
a voracious learner for sure. Yeah. And you know, my brother always says, Well, it wasn't

16:44.580 --> 16:49.660
just that we had it had it around in the house and you had access. You wanted to do it. You

16:49.660 --> 16:55.220
had the drive to learn how to build computers. You know, I took our Apple two apart, which

16:55.220 --> 17:00.680
much to my parents chagrin as long as you put it back together. I put it back together

17:00.680 --> 17:07.820
and got it working. And then the first computer I really built was my 286. So and I did animation

17:07.820 --> 17:16.100
on it and led to my becoming an animator later in life. So I want to dive into that a little

17:16.100 --> 17:23.220
bit because I think as you know, I'm a photographer and I do all my stuff on Linux. And cheese

17:23.220 --> 17:30.860
does some design work, some of it on Linux. And so I want to jump in a little bit about

17:30.860 --> 17:35.700
sort of how you feel about the creative community using Linux because as far as I understand

17:35.700 --> 17:40.860
this, that's a relatively new thing. Of course, you're maybe a bit of an exception to that.

17:40.860 --> 17:46.180
But give me a give me a little bit of your perspective on that. Well, you know, originally

17:46.180 --> 17:51.100
in the eighties, you know, I was using a PC at home to do animation because I couldn't

17:51.100 --> 17:57.580
afford the, you know, fifty thousand dollar Unix. Of course. Yeah, right. You know, and

17:57.580 --> 18:04.380
the, you know, software that they were using for animation at the time. So the industry

18:04.380 --> 18:10.480
honestly is particularly with film, not so much broadcast TV, which is still predominantly,

18:10.480 --> 18:16.260
you know, Mac and Windows, but still Linux on the back end for rendering. But the film

18:16.260 --> 18:26.340
industry really they just moved to directly from Unix to Linux. And one of the the pieces

18:26.340 --> 18:31.440
of software that brought about that change was Maya. Originally, it was alias Wavefront

18:31.440 --> 18:39.740
for Unix, and then it moved over to Linux. And as soon as that started happening, all

18:39.740 --> 18:45.980
the software's proprietary proprietary and open source started moving to Linux, not just

18:45.980 --> 18:50.900
for rendering, but for creative content. Do you have any idea what was the original impetus

18:50.900 --> 18:57.060
for them to make that switch price cost? Because in the film, see in TV, they actually have

18:57.060 --> 19:03.620
more money to spend on their productions in film. You know, they have like a two year

19:03.620 --> 19:09.140
span and they can only spend a certain amount. And that's what it was. It was it was the

19:09.140 --> 19:15.060
ability to have not just free software, but maybe even more important to that to be able

19:15.060 --> 19:21.060
to develop the software that they wanted, you know, with an open operating system. So

19:21.060 --> 19:26.900
they can add like, for instance, Pixar and Disney, they have software they developed

19:26.900 --> 19:33.660
under Linux just for doing like underwater scenes and finding Dory and finding Nemo.

19:33.660 --> 19:41.120
And all that development was done on Linux. They use, you know, they use Maya and Blender

19:41.120 --> 19:47.420
and a lot of different software packages together as well as proprietary. But Disney is in the

19:47.420 --> 19:52.720
process. They've been open sourcing a lot of their animation software. And what was

19:52.720 --> 19:58.820
really cool is recently, actually, two years ago at Seagraph, the big international computer

19:58.820 --> 20:06.060
animation convention, someone in the audience had asked one of the developers of the software

20:06.060 --> 20:10.900
they were using for finding Nemo if it was going to come to Windows. And they said, we

20:10.900 --> 20:19.340
don't need to bother. We're using Linux. And I was just like, yeah, that's so awesome.

20:19.340 --> 20:25.540
And they even had system 76 laptops on stage. It was awesome. That makes me smile because

20:25.540 --> 20:29.860
that's exactly how I feel about it. Right. It's like, why would we translate the software

20:29.860 --> 20:34.900
to Windows when that feels like a downgrade? Right. Yeah. And and that Linux is available

20:34.900 --> 20:35.900
to everyone.

20:35.900 --> 20:40.900
And then another thing is with recently, it's just over a year old. The Academy Software

20:40.900 --> 20:47.740
Foundation has been incredible because it's it's helping all these companies and businesses

20:47.740 --> 20:53.580
who want to start using open source software, not with just usability, but the licenses

20:53.580 --> 20:57.900
and everything they need. And it's specifically made for Hollywood. And, you know, Blender

20:57.900 --> 21:01.720
was the forefront of that movement back in the early two thousands. I've been using it

21:01.720 --> 21:07.660
since then. And so do you have any personal experience with that foundation then? No,

21:07.660 --> 21:12.400
but I am thinking of becoming a little bit more involved. And I did get to talk to the

21:12.400 --> 21:20.940
executive producer at the Open Source Summit recently in San Diego. There was a long, long

21:20.940 --> 21:27.340
line of people to talk to him after he did a talk talking about, you know, doing an introduction

21:27.340 --> 21:31.740
about the Academy Software Foundation and and what it's doing in the industry. It was

21:31.740 --> 21:36.660
a, you know, a learning tutorial for new people who didn't know. And so most of the people

21:36.660 --> 21:43.380
that were in line were young students who want to get in the animation industry. So

21:43.380 --> 21:47.780
I came up to him. I was at one of the I was the last person to talk to him and I said,

21:47.780 --> 21:53.820
oh, no, I'm a podcaster and I've been talking about the Academy Software Foundation since

21:53.820 --> 21:59.180
the beginning. I do, you know, Linux pod news podcast. And I said, I've been working in

21:59.180 --> 22:05.620
the industry for years. The companies I work for, we've had, you know, multiple awards,

22:05.620 --> 22:12.940
everything from from Webby's and Telly's to Emmy's. And I've been in it for many years.

22:12.940 --> 22:16.900
And he was just like, oh, Jill, I want to talk to you. He was really he was so excited

22:16.900 --> 22:22.700
to talk to someone that was in the field, you know, at the Linux convention instead

22:22.700 --> 22:27.820
of just students. And so did you guys go for coffee or something or did you keep chatting?

22:27.820 --> 22:33.180
No, he had to he had to take a plane home. Time constraints. That's always the challenge.

22:33.180 --> 22:38.900
Yeah. But he talked with me a good half hour. We had had a nice chat. That must have been

22:38.900 --> 22:44.060
great. Yeah. So that was really nice. And I got to tell him, you know, my experience

22:44.060 --> 22:50.580
and and how it's it's changed. It's, you know, not just Linux on the back end anymore. It's

22:50.580 --> 22:56.740
it's in the development and creative now. So on the front end, yeah, on the front end,

22:56.740 --> 23:03.140
which is so nice to hear, like, from my perspective, with photography, you know, we're using similar

23:03.140 --> 23:09.820
tools but a little bit different. And so I've watched even in the last Oh, gosh, I guess

23:09.820 --> 23:14.180
it's almost eight, nine, 10 years, something like that. I've watched the software grow

23:14.180 --> 23:19.260
quite a bit and enable many of us to do it full time with the tools that are available

23:19.260 --> 23:24.340
in open source, as opposed to the commercial stuff. And so it sounds like the transition

23:24.340 --> 23:31.380
that animation and film made many years ago, seems to be just happening now.

23:31.380 --> 23:35.620
It's so true, you know, now the graphics are arts just in photography, it's really starting

23:35.620 --> 23:41.500
to, to come of age now. So that's, yeah, I've been really awesome.

23:41.500 --> 23:47.780
Of course, I'm biased, but that's very exciting. And I hope it can reach as wide an audience

23:47.780 --> 23:51.180
as it as it has in in your world, really.

23:51.180 --> 23:55.720
Yeah, I think I definitely know it will. I mean, you've got, you know, programs like

23:55.720 --> 23:59.620
dark table that are really, you know, taken off and then you have, you know, critter and

23:59.620 --> 24:05.980
GIMP and photopea and all the open source software that you can use now in Inkscape

24:05.980 --> 24:10.820
under Linux, that's really, you know, taking over. And now we also have the proprietary

24:10.820 --> 24:16.300
have DaVinci resolve, which has taken over the Adobe suite in the industry, because it's,

24:16.300 --> 24:20.580
you know, it's its premiere and after effects all in one.

24:20.580 --> 24:24.220
You mentioned something that I want to go back to a slight for a slight moment. You

24:24.220 --> 24:28.460
mentioned during your experience in film, you worked with a whole bunch of businesses

24:28.460 --> 24:33.020
that that got a whole bunch of awards. Can you tell me a little bit more about that time

24:33.020 --> 24:34.020
in your life?

24:34.020 --> 24:41.580
Yeah, no problem. So it was after I graduated. I was the very first computer animation graduate

24:41.580 --> 24:46.420
from the Cal State system. I was what was called a special major, I created my own,

24:46.420 --> 24:51.100
I combined communications, fine arts and computer science.

24:51.100 --> 24:53.700
Oh, cool. That's such a great combination.

24:53.700 --> 24:58.460
Yeah. And, you know, it took a year to get it approved, but they were all so impressed.

24:58.460 --> 25:02.980
Like this is the future. This is, you know, back then we called it the information super

25:02.980 --> 25:07.300
highway, you know, the future of the creativity.

25:07.300 --> 25:15.020
So that was in fact, I had to do a talk in front of the director of the Cal State system.

25:15.020 --> 25:20.780
And that was the big term was the information super highway was going to bring creativity

25:20.780 --> 25:24.860
to a new level.

25:24.860 --> 25:25.860
And has it?

25:25.860 --> 25:30.780
Yes. Oh, yes. We don't call it the information super highway anymore.

25:30.780 --> 25:31.780
Right. Things have changed.

25:31.780 --> 25:39.620
Things have changed. But yeah, so I had created my own major. So what had happened is after

25:39.620 --> 25:43.900
I graduated, you know, I was real a nervous student, you know, wanted to get into the

25:43.900 --> 25:50.220
field, but I'd already had worked most of my life doing animation all back, you know,

25:50.220 --> 25:56.300
through the apple too, when I was a little kid and work really, really hard.

25:56.300 --> 26:03.460
And then I got connected with a freelance animator and who had a studio and did quite

26:03.460 --> 26:10.500
a bit of work for him starting in the, in the mid nineties and on. And we, he had contracts

26:10.500 --> 26:17.740
actually, you know, cause we worked together for a long, quite a few years and we had contracts

26:17.740 --> 26:29.540
with, with Fox and Warner Brothers, Disney, ESPN, Electronic Arts.

26:29.540 --> 26:37.620
And yeah, so one of the first pieces I worked on, my very first animation was of all things

26:37.620 --> 26:44.740
a commercial for the Russian hockey team that was going to be viewed on ESPN. So whenever

26:44.740 --> 26:48.700
they traveled and they were, you know, one of the top teams at the time. So wherever

26:48.700 --> 26:55.620
they traveled, the commercial ran and I saw it for like five years after I had done it.

26:55.620 --> 26:58.220
That's funny.

26:58.220 --> 27:00.060
That got nominated for an Emmy.

27:00.060 --> 27:02.820
Wow. That must feel pretty good.

27:02.820 --> 27:12.140
Oh God. My very first piece I had ever done for the industry gets nominated for an Emmy.

27:12.140 --> 27:17.140
And Kevin, my other animator, we worked together. He's like, Jill, he goes, your career is set.

27:17.140 --> 27:25.660
You have Emmy on your resume. It's like Emmy, just even being nominated. Cause at the time

27:25.660 --> 27:32.140
it was the, it was 1998 and that was the first year that a commercial that was all computer

27:32.140 --> 27:42.100
graphics was, was one of the topics for nomination. So the first CG commercial. And so that was

27:42.100 --> 27:48.020
a big deal. And there were, you know, like over 500 submissions and uh, yeah, that was

27:48.020 --> 27:49.020
a big deal.

27:49.020 --> 27:52.060
Does that feel a bit surreal at this point? Like revisiting that?

27:52.060 --> 27:56.500
Yes. Yeah. I watch it and I said, Oh gosh, it looks so amateur. But at the time it was

27:56.500 --> 28:06.380
high tech, you know? And that actually the other significant thing about that piece is

28:06.380 --> 28:14.420
one of the reasons that the studios give freelancers their work is, um, is that they don't have

28:14.420 --> 28:19.380
time to do it in house. And so you have a major deadline, you know, we're staying up

28:19.380 --> 28:25.620
for four days without sleep to get, get, get it rendered and which can take time. So after

28:25.620 --> 28:31.300
you create it, then you have to have time to render it. Well, we didn't have enough

28:31.300 --> 28:37.100
power to, to make that final render, to get it to them in two days. So I actually stayed

28:37.100 --> 28:42.740
up all night that first night as you know, I created the, my animation I need to and

28:42.740 --> 28:48.420
my model modeling and I stayed up all that night and built another computer, which was

28:48.420 --> 28:57.180
a 46 at the time to, so I could render. So I'd have three computers I could render with

28:57.180 --> 29:02.180
that home. And then that started my render farm, which later grew into a Pentium, you

29:02.180 --> 29:07.980
know, dual processor, Penny and pro to, to, uh, quad processors, eons and deck alphas

29:07.980 --> 29:14.300
and, and, and the whole nine yards. But yeah, I, and what was really neat is he told the

29:14.300 --> 29:19.300
company he goes, he goes, my animator built an extra computer just so that we can get

29:19.300 --> 29:26.100
this job done. Wow. That's dedication, isn't it? Yeah. There's something about having a

29:26.100 --> 29:32.700
need that just drives you. Yeah. So, yeah. So I did that piece and then, you know, we,

29:32.700 --> 29:39.100
there got like 20 tellies and Webby's and then, um, and Emmy in the future, but that

29:39.100 --> 29:46.100
was kind of what launched that. And I could, I could tell you one other project I'm really

29:46.100 --> 29:53.860
proud, proud of. Sure. Please do put it out into the world. It sounds great. Oh my God,

29:53.860 --> 30:01.020
I'm telling the world. You don't have to know, but this is, I, I, I'm it's, it's time. Cause

30:01.020 --> 30:08.780
this was very special. Um, yeah. So we actually ended up doing the editing on the trailer

30:08.780 --> 30:14.780
for the perfect storm, right? Which, which many of us probably have seen. Yes. And most

30:14.780 --> 30:21.500
people have seen it. So a lot of people have seen my work, but the really cool thing is

30:21.500 --> 30:27.060
we worked really hard, not just on the editing, but we created our own effects for that final

30:27.060 --> 30:32.220
wave scene. Cause we didn't, we didn't like what the studio gave us and we didn't think

30:32.220 --> 30:40.340
it looked kind of real enough. So then at the time the studios, um, water is what we

30:40.340 --> 30:47.180
call caustics has always been hard to render. And we didn't know, there was no one piece

30:47.180 --> 30:52.820
of software that did water really, really well. Um, it would do the mass like an ocean

30:52.820 --> 31:00.060
mass or mask, a mass or a lake, but it was not good at doing splashes and waves where

31:00.060 --> 31:04.900
there's a lot of different details and reflections and all that movement. Yeah, exactly. And

31:04.900 --> 31:08.860
studios were able to do a lot of that, but they achieved that with, you know, really

31:08.860 --> 31:12.900
like hundreds of people, you know, trying to get this right. And it was just me and

31:12.900 --> 31:20.780
one other animator. So, um, not as many resources, not as many resources and darn it. And one

31:20.780 --> 31:24.560
reason I wanted to bring this project up is because darn it, I wish we had open source

31:24.560 --> 31:30.700
software then. So this is, you know, 2000 and we just didn't have that. So we had to

31:30.700 --> 31:39.860
combine, I combined, um, uh, some effects from 3d studio, um, release R4 for dos. This

31:39.860 --> 31:45.780
is before, you know, I did that on windows and a light wave. Um, we had some Maya in

31:45.780 --> 31:52.740
there and, um, I had to write a script that would go from one program to another to get

31:52.740 --> 31:57.020
the effects that we needed because one program would have the part of the effect and the

31:57.020 --> 32:04.260
other program would have the other. So, so to make this, the splash look real, you know,

32:04.260 --> 32:07.900
we had to use several different programs of different particle systems from different

32:07.900 --> 32:15.020
programs. And then I would script it and we added chaos to it. And, um, that ended up

32:15.020 --> 32:22.580
on the final splash of the wave. And the big deal there was that the studio was so blown

32:22.580 --> 32:29.820
away with what we had done that that's what was part of the original film. Oh, wow. That's

32:29.820 --> 32:34.980
cool. Yeah. So it became, uh, so that was one of the first films that we had worked

32:34.980 --> 32:40.640
on. That's unbelievable. Instead of just a commercial, for instance. Yeah, exactly. Wow.

32:40.640 --> 32:45.460
You must feel super proud about putting that work in and then having it be recognized.

32:45.460 --> 32:51.940
Yeah. And it was just, it was a lot of, it was so much just thinking about it. I remember,

32:51.940 --> 32:57.060
you know, going to Kevin's house and we were just, you know, pounding our heads like, how

32:57.060 --> 33:00.820
are we going to achieve this? You know, it was just cause we didn't, you know, the tools

33:00.820 --> 33:05.420
weren't available and we didn't have access to those at home, you know, at our own, in

33:05.420 --> 33:12.860
our own studios like Warner Brothers did and Pixar, you know, so, but then we were able

33:12.860 --> 33:18.140
to do something that they were having a hard time achieving. So that was a proud. So two

33:18.140 --> 33:24.560
people beat a hundred people. Yeah. That's so cool. Good for you. And thank you for sharing

33:24.560 --> 33:29.140
that story. That's amazing. That's a really amazing. Yeah. Oh my gosh. I'm sharing it

33:29.140 --> 33:35.840
on the internet. Cool. No, it's out there. It's so funny cause that's what's unique also

33:35.840 --> 33:40.940
about podcasting. I've been behind the scenes most of my life, you know, except for, you

33:40.940 --> 33:46.500
know, doing my, my teaching and teaching computer animation and motion graphics with my students.

33:46.500 --> 33:51.920
And they've seen, you know, we, you know, instructors show the students our work after

33:51.920 --> 33:55.780
they've been taking the class a while so they can see what you can do and it helps them

33:55.780 --> 34:01.060
get them inspired. But I've never put this out really on the, on the internet too much

34:01.060 --> 34:08.260
except talking with Ven and Pedro on LWW and the pre-show and after show with our, our,

34:08.260 --> 34:15.580
our patrons and chat. So I've shared some with them, but not in an interview or chat.

34:15.580 --> 34:20.020
Well, thank you for sharing it. I feel like a lot of people would love to, are going to

34:20.020 --> 34:25.740
love that story. So that sounds amazing. How do you think that open source would have changed

34:25.740 --> 34:30.860
that story a little bit? Oh boy. Well, I would have had, I could have had tools more like

34:30.860 --> 34:37.220
blender at that time. You know, we could have hired a software developer to, you know, help

34:37.220 --> 34:41.420
us do these special particle systems, you know? So you feel like it would have made

34:41.420 --> 34:44.860
it easier than trying to daisy chain and pull like little pieces from all these different

34:44.860 --> 34:49.500
tools and have them create the effect that you needed, right? And now, you know, a lot

34:49.500 --> 34:54.500
of the freelancers that are left do have a lot of developers cause in the animation industry,

34:54.500 --> 34:59.900
half of it is, you know, we need coders and developers to create, create the software

34:59.900 --> 35:05.800
needed. Well, I love the juxtaposition between technical creativity, which would be the developers

35:05.800 --> 35:11.740
who are trying to achieve a vision and the actual, like the visual creativity as well.

35:11.740 --> 35:19.580
And how those two now these days, um, are, are such a cool place that, that technical

35:19.580 --> 35:23.440
people who traditionally haven't been seen as creative can really show their creativity

35:23.440 --> 35:29.380
in many ways. Yes, definitely. And yeah, as you know, it's just as much technical as it

35:29.380 --> 35:35.940
is, um, creative and artistic. And especially in the freelance world where you kind of,

35:35.940 --> 35:41.860
you've got to know everything. You gotta be a Jack of all trades or a Jill of all trades.

35:41.860 --> 35:47.860
Yeah. And I encourage that in my students because a lot of times, you know, they want

35:47.860 --> 35:55.760
to be character animators or do textures or do sound or do lighting. And I try and give

35:55.760 --> 36:00.320
them as broad experience. I, you know, want them to create their own movies with all these

36:00.320 --> 36:06.740
elements together so they get to learn a little bit of everything so they can see what emphasis

36:06.740 --> 36:12.260
they would like to, what area they'd like to focus on, but also set so that they're

36:12.260 --> 36:18.460
well rounded for the industry. Cause I want my students, you know, I want them to not

36:18.460 --> 36:23.100
just learn character animation. Um, a lot of the other schools, that's what they, they

36:23.100 --> 36:28.660
just churn out students learning, you know, character or materials, but they don't focus

36:28.660 --> 36:36.120
on the whole person and the whole, you know, area of knowledge. And I even, um, not only

36:36.120 --> 36:41.860
of course teach them Linux, but also, um, I always do a session on how to build a computer

36:41.860 --> 36:46.740
because that has helped me. And it's good for them to, to know how it all works.

36:46.740 --> 36:50.140
And do you feel like the students are responsive to that these days?

36:50.140 --> 36:54.540
Oh yes. They're coming to me knowing that this is the field they want to get into. Most

36:54.540 --> 36:58.500
like half my students want to get into the field. So they're willing to learn and they

36:58.500 --> 37:04.260
understand that they need to need to know a lot of this for, to be relevant in the,

37:04.260 --> 37:10.480
in the industry. And, uh, so they not only coming in with that art background with,

37:10.480 --> 37:16.820
with life drawing and years of drawing and painting and sculpting and color theory and,

37:16.820 --> 37:24.060
um, uh, computer graphics with, with, um, Photoshop or GIMP or Inkscape and you know,

37:24.060 --> 37:28.620
all those skills, but they also need to know the technical, very important.

37:28.620 --> 37:34.740
Well, and I totally associate with your giving them like a rounded view of the industry and

37:34.740 --> 37:40.660
then allowing them to jump into a niche. Um, because I feel like, um, the same is true

37:40.660 --> 37:44.780
with podcasting, right? Is that if you, if you, if you know all of the pieces that go

37:44.780 --> 37:51.220
into sort of the whole pipeline, um, then you have this perspective, uh, that even if

37:51.220 --> 37:55.500
you're only working on a little piece of it, um, you have this perspective that makes your,

37:55.500 --> 37:59.580
your work sort of fit in, in a different way or, or allows you to solve different puzzles,

37:59.580 --> 38:01.220
right? With that creativity,

38:01.220 --> 38:06.940
Exactly. Solve different problems. You realize, okay, well I'm doing, I'm working like if

38:06.940 --> 38:11.540
they're doing materials, I'm working on this material. Well, how can I help help the people

38:11.540 --> 38:14.240
that are animating these materials?

38:14.240 --> 38:19.000
Also thinking of the impact later on in the process. Oh, that's really fascinating.

38:19.000 --> 38:24.220
That's always been a goal is to make sure they're really well rounded and, um, you know,

38:24.220 --> 38:28.180
that, that also that they have learned to have a really good work ethic cause the hours

38:28.180 --> 38:35.580
are grueling. So can be grueling in anything you love it. It is. Yeah, for sure. Yeah.

38:35.580 --> 38:39.940
And anything you love, you know, whatever you're doing.

38:39.940 --> 38:43.260
The cool thing I've noticed is when you're working on something so passionately, you

38:43.260 --> 38:48.540
kind of forget about time and you forget about, um, you know, that staying up all night is

38:48.540 --> 38:50.100
kind of crazy, right?

38:50.100 --> 38:56.340
Yes. It's happening to me right now with podcasting. Oh really? In what way? Well, just doing all

38:56.340 --> 39:01.620
the research for it. I try and get to bed at a halfway decent time, but ended up staying

39:01.620 --> 39:08.460
up sometimes till two and three in the morning, reading Linux news stories for my show and

39:08.460 --> 39:12.380
listening to all the podcasts cause I love all the Linux podcasts and I listened to them

39:12.380 --> 39:13.840
all.

39:13.840 --> 39:17.080
Pretty soon you're going to have, there's going to be too much content for you to possibly

39:17.080 --> 39:18.660
take in, right?

39:18.660 --> 39:23.260
Yeah. And it's already kind of coming to that cause there's, there's new shows coming out

39:23.260 --> 39:28.900
and I'm just like, I can't keep it up, but I try to.

39:28.900 --> 39:35.620
You can just play it while you're sleeping. I've heard it gets in your brain anyways.

39:35.620 --> 39:41.060
And I just love it. I'm just living it. In fact, I'm not doing much watch, watching other

39:41.060 --> 39:46.520
content than YouTubers and Twitch streamers and, and podcasts. It's been pretty much my

39:46.520 --> 39:51.840
life cause I've just loved it and just going, you know, putting myself all into it and I

39:51.840 --> 39:54.780
love it. I love all the communities.

39:54.780 --> 39:59.780
Does that feel like a big treat for you now? How when you were first starting, maybe it,

39:59.780 --> 40:07.460
the community or Linux wasn't spoken as publicly and that now it's sort of everywhere.

40:07.460 --> 40:16.540
Yes, we have a bloomed, the flower has spread forth. Yeah, it's about time. And this is

40:16.540 --> 40:22.220
what we've needed. For me, it's a continuation of the community we have at scale and the

40:22.220 --> 40:27.220
Linux conventions and the lugs. You know, this is a continuation of that. The podcasting

40:27.220 --> 40:32.180
is, you know, online lugs like Linux Unplugged, one of my favorite shows.

40:32.180 --> 40:38.660
Well, thanks. Yeah. The Linux Unplugged, I think as I've mentioned before, is the reason

40:38.660 --> 40:42.860
I'm even here. And it sounds like that was a huge impact for you as well.

40:42.860 --> 40:47.700
I started watching Jupiter Broadcasting in the beginning since it was the computer action

40:47.700 --> 40:53.640
show and not the Linux before it was the Linux action show. And I was listening to Jupiter

40:53.640 --> 41:01.380
at night and stoked and I'd always wanted to become involved in the Jupiter Broadcasting

41:01.380 --> 41:06.180
community. But at the time I was really busy with my, you know, my animation career and

41:06.180 --> 41:08.700
had, I already had so many hobbies.

41:08.700 --> 41:12.340
I've heard you have a few.

41:12.340 --> 41:20.620
I've been collecting vintage computers. I have several hundred. So when I started podcasting

41:20.620 --> 41:25.720
with Linux Gamecast and I knew that was the community I wanted to start with because that's

41:25.720 --> 41:32.580
the one I became friends with everyone and because it had a graphics end to it. It was

41:32.580 --> 41:39.940
Linux Gamecast. It was gaming on Linux. And I had done some work in the field. I'd worked,

41:39.940 --> 41:45.700
as I mentioned earlier, a little bit for, actually a lot for Electronic Arts, doing

41:45.700 --> 41:52.700
game development and 3D models and artwork. So in Linux Gamecast, Linux gaming was my

41:52.700 --> 41:59.280
passion and this is, you know, the days before Steam, before we had Proton and all that.

41:59.280 --> 42:04.100
You know, after I started with Linux Gamecast, I've been full time with them now a year

42:04.100 --> 42:10.540
and a half and I knew it was time to start giving back to the Jupyter broadcasting community

42:10.540 --> 42:16.420
because of all the wonderful Linux content that Chris has worked so hard and all of you

42:16.420 --> 42:28.180
work so hard and who he has given us so much in the Linux community and over the years

42:28.180 --> 42:34.840
and I just wanted to give back and that's one of the reasons I wanted to get involved

42:34.840 --> 42:41.280
in Jupyter broadcasting. So I wanted to help give back to the community that Chris worked

42:41.280 --> 42:46.860
so hard to create and just it's my thank you to him.

42:46.860 --> 42:52.580
Wow. Well, I'm sure he'll listen to this and I'm sure that means a heck of a lot to him

42:52.580 --> 42:58.500
for sure and it does to me as well as purely a member of the Jupyter broadcasting community.

42:58.500 --> 43:05.100
I feel like, you know, if we all have gained so much from it and continue to gain so much

43:05.100 --> 43:11.380
from it and it's that giving back somehow, whether it's just coming to say hi at a conference

43:11.380 --> 43:16.820
or something like that, all of those little gestures make a huge difference, right? And

43:16.820 --> 43:22.740
of course you've showed up quite a bit in the mumble room when we're doing Linux Unplugged

43:22.740 --> 43:30.480
on a weekly basis live, which anybody can join and it's been so nice to have someone

43:30.480 --> 43:36.060
like you there because it just adds to the diversity of all the people that are included

43:36.060 --> 43:41.940
in that group, right? And I know you and I sometimes after the show we just end up just

43:41.940 --> 43:45.620
chatting for no reason and just having a really good time.

43:45.620 --> 43:52.420
Oh, I love all you guys, you Brent and Cheese Bacon and Wes and Joe, you all, you know,

43:52.420 --> 43:57.220
everyone in the Jupyter broadcasting community and Elle, I love Elle. I was so happy to

43:57.220 --> 44:03.980
see another, see another lady in Linux podcasting after I started, you know, I'm like, oh, good,

44:03.980 --> 44:05.780
Chris has Elle now. Yay.

44:05.780 --> 44:10.340
Yeah, for sure. And Angela, I think she's been behind the scenes, which is kind of a

44:10.340 --> 44:13.140
thing you mentioned, right? Like there's a lot of people behind the scenes that don't

44:13.140 --> 44:14.140
always get seen.

44:14.140 --> 44:20.100
Yeah. And I loved her, her a woman in tech, a podcast she was doing and the Faux show

44:20.100 --> 44:25.980
and Angela has been amazing driving force in a Jupyter broadcasting. So I've always

44:25.980 --> 44:28.960
looked up to her too, a lot.

44:28.960 --> 44:35.480
That's great. And, um, you mentioned some of the earlier shows, it sounds like, um,

44:35.480 --> 44:38.860
you know more about the history of Jupyter broadcasting than I do in many ways. Cause

44:38.860 --> 44:40.820
I came to it a little bit later.

44:40.820 --> 44:47.460
I was just a ravenous listener, you know, I was so quiet other than, you know, I donated

44:47.460 --> 44:51.660
and you know, I've been a patron of Jupyter broadcasting since the very beginning, but

44:51.660 --> 44:55.300
I've been, you know, I was buying the t-shirts and I have the challenge coin and

44:55.300 --> 45:01.340
Wow. You're outdoing a lot of us, I think.

45:01.340 --> 45:07.340
Yeah. And so I wanted to give back and also because of Ed Stone, the producer of Linux

45:07.340 --> 45:10.900
game cast got his start because of Jupyter broadcasting.

45:10.900 --> 45:18.420
Oh, cool. I'm learning all of these things is really cool. Yeah. I like the idea that,

45:18.420 --> 45:22.700
you know, there are a lot of communities now and you're part of a lot of them and that

45:22.700 --> 45:26.780
we all have our, you know, concentrated time. It's like, okay, Tuesdays at, at whatever

45:26.780 --> 45:30.000
time it is in your local time, there's Linux unplugged and then you can bounce to another

45:30.000 --> 45:34.500
one somewhere else that has a bit of a different crew and some overlapping, um, community members

45:34.500 --> 45:41.140
to and go be a part of that community as well. Right. I just love that. I think you're totally

45:41.140 --> 45:47.900
going to agree with me. Um, in that it's really special how it's okay to be a part of all

45:47.900 --> 45:51.340
of them and that there are all these connections that have been between all of them, like a

45:51.340 --> 45:57.140
web of, of really neat interconnections, right. And that, that we all grow because of it.

45:57.140 --> 46:01.900
Yeah. We all grown, we all, all learn, you know, in different points of view. Like for

46:01.900 --> 46:09.180
instance, I'm doing, you know, LWDW is a Linux news show. Well, of course, Jupiter broadcasting

46:09.180 --> 46:16.340
has lots of Linux news shows, including, uh, Linux unplugged and Linux action news and

46:16.340 --> 46:21.180
all the other shows, but we all cover different things. We have our uniquenesses and, and

46:21.180 --> 46:29.460
the way as in, uh, not in just, uh, the stories, but, and how we, we, uh, produce them and

46:29.460 --> 46:35.420
how we talk about them. So, you know, we all, all learn from each other. We all share, you

46:35.420 --> 46:40.620
know, knowledge, we're sharing knowledge. Yeah. Which is, is that's open source, right?

46:40.620 --> 46:46.260
Is, is sharing all of it. Exactly. I appreciate in the podcast that there's different perspectives

46:46.260 --> 46:52.980
and different ways of presenting the information. Like, as you know, as a teacher, not everybody

46:52.980 --> 46:56.060
learns the same and not everybody connects with information in the same way, right? So

46:56.060 --> 47:01.100
to have it be presented in all these different ways is a huge asset and, and, and kudos to

47:01.100 --> 47:07.300
open source for, um, keeping that spirit of, of sharing and, and the collaboration, right?

47:07.300 --> 47:12.420
That's what's just so amazing. I love it. We've spread that to the internet, the Linux

47:12.420 --> 47:17.380
community and all their, you know, we used to be, you know, these quiet lugs and commit

47:17.380 --> 47:24.640
conferences are now spreading that love online. It's spreading everywhere. That's awesome.

47:24.640 --> 47:28.180
Tell me a little bit more about, um, some of the other conferences cause you mentioned

47:28.180 --> 47:33.020
scale, but it sounds like you bounce around a little bit more too. Yeah. So, oh gosh,

47:33.020 --> 47:37.460
I want to go to Linux Fest Northwest cause it's the next big one that I haven't been

47:37.460 --> 47:42.180
to yet that I've been wanting to go. It's amazing. I'm totally biased because that was

47:42.180 --> 47:46.060
my first experience with conferences, but it would be great to see you there. Oh, I'd

47:46.060 --> 47:51.880
love to go. So I'm going to work on that. But I do, we've been having, uh, here in Los

47:51.880 --> 47:57.460
Angeles, uh, quite a few, um, open source summit, uh, conferences as well, which are

47:57.460 --> 48:01.740
fun. They're not quite as community based, but they're, they're growing a little bit

48:01.740 --> 48:06.580
more in that way, but it's, it's, it's more, you know, big business, but I, you know, I

48:06.580 --> 48:13.700
go for, um, the hallway track, you know, so it's the best place to be. It's the best part

48:13.700 --> 48:20.260
of a convention anyways, really the talks are wonderful expo halls, incredible, but

48:20.260 --> 48:25.700
it's those connections that you make in the hallway track that I love. That's what's really

48:25.700 --> 48:35.580
memorable. I find. Yeah. Tell me, I, I'm interested a little bit more in, um, some of your teaching.

48:35.580 --> 48:40.180
Oh, um, because you mentioned it sort of in some of your stories, it was the, it was some

48:40.180 --> 48:45.260
key aspects in some of your stories, but, um, what inspired you to move from kind of

48:45.260 --> 48:49.940
being the professional doing stuff behind the scenes to sharing that knowledge? You

48:49.940 --> 48:57.660
know what? I always was, I actually started out, um, in the nineties as a, uh, a tutor

48:57.660 --> 49:03.100
in the animation department. And then I went to TA and then ended up being on the board

49:03.100 --> 49:11.180
of directors for the department. And, and so I had always been doing that, um, uh, through

49:11.180 --> 49:16.820
my college years. And, um, that helped me get a lot of connections actually, you know,

49:16.820 --> 49:22.580
because I was doing that and had that experience, um, that helped me with my work experience,

49:22.580 --> 49:28.860
uh, getting into freelance work. So yeah, I ended up doing the teaching first. Yeah.

49:28.860 --> 49:31.860
And then both things I just said at the same time, and I feel like that's the real gift

49:31.860 --> 49:37.300
of, of, of, of a teacher. Sometimes you see, um, and maybe now I'm starting to speak about

49:37.300 --> 49:41.300
my personal experience, but you're sometimes you see teachers who were in the industry

49:41.300 --> 49:45.740
and, um, either have retired or decided to get out for some reason and they teach and

49:45.740 --> 49:49.940
they don't, they don't always have the same perspective as someone who's working in it,

49:49.940 --> 49:54.100
uh, alongside the teaching. Right. And so I really appreciate how you were kind of doing

49:54.100 --> 49:58.240
both. And that's the best benefit for the students, right? Is that you're, you're teaching

49:58.240 --> 50:00.740
them exactly what's happening in the industry today.

50:00.740 --> 50:04.660
And I get that actually from my students cause they, you know, know a lot of their other

50:04.660 --> 50:10.060
instructors, you know, used to, to do their profession, you know, and they're, they're

50:10.060 --> 50:16.380
now just teaching. And so I get my students are always amazed and you're still doing this.

50:16.380 --> 50:22.140
And they're, they're thrilled that I'm doing podcasting too. And they like that. I'm, I'm

50:22.140 --> 50:29.980
what we call it, Twitch tubing, Twitch tuber. And they're like, cool. My teacher is a Twitch

50:29.980 --> 50:40.700
streamer. But yeah, just, just, uh, you know, being able to, to share that enthusiasm with

50:40.700 --> 50:47.180
them and all the areas that I love. And then I'm still continuing to do work and, um, just

50:47.180 --> 50:48.180
love that.

50:48.180 --> 50:52.640
You're giving back to the community in so many different ways, you know, from teaching

50:52.640 --> 50:58.180
to, um, some of the podcasts stuff that you're doing and even just showing up at conferences

50:58.180 --> 51:03.700
and Linux checks. And so, uh, thank you, I will say from the community for your, your

51:03.700 --> 51:07.900
big, big heart and your giving back. It's, it's really meaningful.

51:07.900 --> 51:12.900
Oh, it's been an honor to do it. It really has. This community is amazing.

51:12.900 --> 51:17.820
Yeah. And it's, it's growing and it's continuing to be even more amazing, which is, which is

51:17.820 --> 51:18.820
such a treat.

51:18.820 --> 51:23.420
And what's really been just really exciting for me is a lot of my students who end up

51:23.420 --> 51:28.420
getting work in the industry and becoming, you know, producers and animators and whatnot

51:28.420 --> 51:31.260
are part of the Linux community now and part of the Linux checks.

51:31.260 --> 51:34.420
You're seeing them evolve in your footsteps almost, right?

51:34.420 --> 51:39.860
Yeah. They, in fact, they call, they call themselves Jill Siples.

51:39.860 --> 51:44.420
That's awesome. You have a following.

51:44.420 --> 51:52.060
Yeah. So it's so funny cause at scale when I was introducing all the Linux game casts,

51:52.060 --> 51:56.540
all our hosts who, um, a lot of people at scale, they're like, Oh, is another student,

51:56.540 --> 52:02.540
another student, another former student, you know, yay, bringing them in.

52:02.540 --> 52:07.660
Well that must mean you're doing some good work. That's good feedback. I want to say

52:07.660 --> 52:12.500
thank you so, so much for chatting. I know you and I will continue to have these kinds

52:12.500 --> 52:17.120
of conversations and maybe we can share some of them in the future as well. Um, but thank

52:17.120 --> 52:20.940
you so much for your time. And this was really, really fun.

52:20.940 --> 52:27.180
Thank you so much for having me, Brent. This is an honor. And I can actually say, you know,

52:27.180 --> 52:31.420
it's kind of a dream come true. I've always wanted to get involved in Jupiter broadcasting.

52:31.420 --> 52:37.680
So here you are. Thank you so much for, for, for being involved in many ways. Um, is there

52:37.680 --> 52:42.500
anywhere that you'd like to send people if they want to get connected with you or just

52:42.500 --> 52:51.180
hear you giggle or those kinds of things? Uh, so, um, I get several places. One is,

52:51.180 --> 52:59.500
um, at Twitter at Jill underscore Linux girl and at Mastodon at Jill underscore Linux girl

52:59.500 --> 53:10.140
at mast.linuxgamecast.com and on email it's Jill at linuxgamecast.com.

53:10.140 --> 53:15.540
I wondered if you had an ask of the community, um, either like, uh, something you'd like

53:15.540 --> 53:18.500
them to do or explore or try.

53:18.500 --> 53:25.940
Yeah. So I actually have two things. Okay, great. Bring it on. One is a current news

53:25.940 --> 53:32.060
story that's been happening. Please help support the gnome foundation and fighting the shot

53:32.060 --> 53:36.580
will image app patent troll and help send a message to patent trolls everywhere that

53:36.580 --> 53:43.060
they should never target free software. This, this is scary. This can be very scary, especially

53:43.060 --> 53:47.860
it's Ross child that's behind it and it's not good.

53:47.860 --> 53:51.380
The implications are huge, right? And so if we, if we can kind of get together and make

53:51.380 --> 53:54.180
a difference, I think, uh, that speaks volumes.

53:54.180 --> 53:58.820
Yeah. And you know, I had donated the first day I found out about it immediately. And,

53:58.820 --> 54:04.180
um, and if you can't donate monetarily, just spread the word on social media and on the

54:04.180 --> 54:11.060
internet, you know, all it takes is one person to spread the word and a hundred people will,

54:11.060 --> 54:16.420
will hear it and see it and they may contribute. So we're going to help them.

54:16.420 --> 54:19.820
Yeah. So let's get, get everyone's eyes on it for sure.

54:19.820 --> 54:27.780
Yeah. And the other thing is there are so many wonderful Linux podcasts and video casts

54:27.780 --> 54:33.780
out there, whether it be an RSS feed on YouTube, on Twitch or all three, like we've talked,

54:33.780 --> 54:39.780
been talking about, um, I encourage everyone to go find and watch them. You never know

54:39.780 --> 54:44.260
what amazing communities you will discover and learn from, and you just might become

54:44.260 --> 54:47.420
one of the contributing members yourself.

54:47.420 --> 54:50.100
Which has happened to both you and I, right?

54:50.100 --> 54:51.100
Yeah, exactly.

54:51.100 --> 54:54.820
Um, members of the community. And then you get a little closer and a little closer and

54:54.820 --> 54:59.220
all of a sudden one day you find yourself in the chair. So, um, I agree completely.

54:59.220 --> 55:05.540
Yay, Britt. If you can show up, you know, if it's at a conference, if it's at scale,

55:05.540 --> 55:09.300
if it's at Linux Fest Northwest or any other conference that catches your attention.

55:09.300 --> 55:11.020
Yeah. Get involved.

55:11.020 --> 55:14.940
For sure. Um, even, even in the online communities, you know, there's, there's all these telegram

55:14.940 --> 55:21.440
groups and live podcasts that get recorded every week. So, um, just show up. You never,

55:21.440 --> 55:26.340
you never know what's going to happen. Well, thanks Jill. I hope to connect with you really

55:26.340 --> 55:30.580
soon and, uh, thank you so much for your time and for connecting. This was really fun.

55:30.580 --> 55:34.720
Thank you, Brent, so much. You're one of my favorite people in the community and I can't

55:34.720 --> 55:37.660
wait to give you a hug when I see you in real life.

55:37.660 --> 55:43.740
Oh, thank you. Yeah, we did just figure out that, um, we're both going to be at this coming

55:43.740 --> 55:44.740
scale.

55:44.740 --> 55:46.740
Yeah. Yay.

55:46.740 --> 55:51.340
Um, can you remind, uh, some of us when that is coming up?

55:51.340 --> 55:59.100
Yeah. So it'll be, uh, March 5th through 8th of 2020, uh, scale 18x. Amazing.

55:59.100 --> 56:05.740
That sounds great. Uh, I am, I think in for a treat. It's going to be my first scale experience.

56:05.740 --> 56:06.740
So.

56:06.740 --> 56:07.740
Oh, I'm so excited.

56:07.740 --> 56:12.140
And I really look forward to meeting you there in person too. That's going to be great.

56:12.140 --> 56:13.140
Yay.

56:13.140 --> 56:14.140
Thanks Jill.

56:14.140 --> 56:18.660
Thank you so much, Brent. Love you community. Love everyone.

56:18.660 --> 56:21.860
Yes. Lots of love to the community. Thanks everyone.
