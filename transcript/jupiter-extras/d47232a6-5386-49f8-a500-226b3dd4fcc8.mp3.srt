1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,440
Well, hello. Today, I'm joined by Jacob Rucker. Some may know you, he's been a long time JB

2
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,920
community member and listener for a long time. Jacob, how are you?

3
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,280
I'm doing great. Thanks for having me.

4
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:29,380
Thank you so much for reaching out to me. You've got a little bit of a pretty deep connection

5
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:35,120
to the JB community. So I am really looking forward to learning about that story and diving

6
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,380
into it. Tell me a little bit about where you are now.

7
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:47,280
So currently in Boise, Idaho, which is like, the people here are like Canada nice is a

8
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,280
good way to describe it.

9
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,280
I know what that's like.

10
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,680
Yep. And my wife's Canadian. So I think I can say that. Yes, yes.

11
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,040
The connections. We already have connections. We're like 10 seconds in.

12
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:01,800
Well, it works out pretty well. But she's from the other part of Canada. She's over

13
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,400
in Alberta. And I think you're in the East Coast area or East side of Canada.

14
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:11,440
I am north of Toronto. So I'm in Ontario. I'm north of Toronto in a place called Sudbury,

15
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:19,720
but I'm in Eastern time zone. So you reached out to me and which I really appreciated and

16
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:24,000
said, Hey, I've been listening to some of the conversations you've been having with

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
people on on Brunch with Brent. And I think I might have a little bit of a story to tell

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,840
that the community might appreciate. And we chatted a little bit about what that story

19
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,480
was. And I kind of stopped you and said, No, no, no, don't tell me anymore. I want to,

20
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:42,720
I want to have this be a really nice chat. That story, at least the parts that I heard

21
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,160
sort of really hit me as really meaningful for you. And I just wondered if you wanted

22
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,740
to start telling that story.

23
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:54,760
So I started listening to JB, it must have been 2008. I think I was still living in Utah

24
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:59,840
at the time. And found it because a friend of mine posted, I think, Linux action show

25
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,560
on Facebook or something like that. And it got me interested in it. And previous to that,

26
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:10,200
my experience with Linux was actually, so I was in the army for 20 years and I went

27
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:15,880
to Iraq twice and then Afghanistan once. And the second time we went to Iraq, one of the

28
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:19,880
things we were doing is there was, you know, your troop size changes. And so the footprint

29
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:25,220
for support changes. So we were taking some old servers out of system and I was repurposing

30
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:29,400
them to build a kind of a computer lab to train folks on, you know, how that technology

31
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:36,260
worked. And I couldn't get a Windows Server 2003 installation disk because they were very

32
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:40,920
controlled by our IT department, you know, licensing and whatnot. And Ubuntu had come

33
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,960
out at the time, right? And so it was like, okay, well, let's try this thing. And so I

34
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,880
ended up diving in and the internet was so slow.

35
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,080
How slow is slow?

36
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,800
Our backbone was no more than 768 K.

37
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,280
Oh man. Okay. That puts it into context.

38
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:06,280
Right. I mean, it was 2005, right? We downloaded Ubuntu at that bandwidth speed and then I

39
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:10,760
even downloaded SUSE at the time as well and started playing with, you know, what can I

40
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:15,320
do with these? How can I repurpose them to teach, you know, my soldiers some basic skills

41
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,560
on this stuff?

42
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,840
How had you heard about Linux in the first place?

43
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:24,520
There was a national guard unit that was there and one of the guys had said, hey, try this.

44
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,520
Okay.

45
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:29,880
You know, most of us have come to it that way. It's like someone else just like had

46
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,840
a quick conversation with us and said, you got to really like, this is going to work

47
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,440
for you. It's so thankful that those moments happen, right?

48
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:41,200
Right. And it was, it was cool. And then later on in college and this is how I started getting

49
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:46,200
back into Linux, I was really excited to get a new computer for myself for all my work

50
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:52,000
at college. And it was, you know, I love technology. Been online since like 93, 94 with prodigies

51
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,080
network originally and stuff. And so I love what technology empowers people to do.

52
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,160
And so at college I was really excited because I was going to get this machine that was built

53
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:09,400
for windows Vista and it was built for windows Vista and it didn't work. It was so frustrating.

54
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,120
I think many of us have been there, right?

55
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,520
So what I learned from that is I learned that you can't just accept somebody else's all

56
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:21,600
in one experience. You've got to kind of figure things out. So I knew Linux was a solution

57
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,820
back when I was in the army trying to repurpose servers and it's like, all right, let's throw

58
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:30,320
it on this. You know, it was a Lenovo R series thing. So I threw it on there and did a bunch

59
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:37,220
of my college work there and then we ran Linux for years, cut the cord, you know, in 2008

60
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:41,840
and just once I started listening to all the JB shows, it wasn't just listening to Chris

61
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,120
and the team as far as the shows they were producing. It was kind of that extra content

62
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:51,080
that they do on the side that this show or this channel, extras.show is really embodying

63
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:55,260
because Jupiter at night was a lot of fun and then kind of, you know, some of the outtakes

64
00:04:55,260 --> 00:05:01,800
and things like that. And then, you know, I grew up kind of isolated in Connecticut

65
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,920
when I was in high school. And so there were like three nerds in the whole high school

66
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:10,720
that you could talk computers with, right? Yeah. And so being able to be in a space where

67
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:16,440
I could listen to and start hearing that conversation to learn more about it. And then thanks to

68
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:23,880
Chris, I've rewatched the entire back catalog of the computer Chronicles. Really? That's

69
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:27,240
great. I don't know if they still show that on the live stream, but they used to when

70
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,640
they didn't have a whole lot of self-generated content. So I've watched a lot of that stuff.

71
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:36,280
That's awesome. So I'm going to, I'm going to rewind you there for a second. So you were

72
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:41,480
telling the story of trying Ubuntu on those servers, but you mentioned something that

73
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:46,360
I want to ask you a little bit more about your, you mentioned that you wanted to teach

74
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,160
some of the soldiers, some basics and computer. Can you talk a little bit more about that?

75
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,120
Yeah. So when the army trains you, they train you or they trained us on what we call POTS

76
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:59,360
telephone systems now. So plain, plain old telephone, telephone systems. And they were

77
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,960
modernizing when we were in Iraq in 2005, 2006, they were going to a fiber backbone

78
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:08,200
in the country. They were going all data, everything was going to be over TCP IP and

79
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:13,920
they didn't teach us any of that. And so and they weren't going to either. And we were

80
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:17,200
going to be there for a year and have to implement this stuff without knowing what the heck it

81
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:23,880
was or how the technology worked. And so they put me on the night shift and, and left me

82
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:29,480
alone, which was good. And so what I would do is I would spend, you know, my 12 hour

83
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:34,200
shift at night researching as much as I could and building a training module. And then the

84
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:38,840
next morning, stay awake for another two or three hours and train my guys on, Hey, here's

85
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:43,720
how TCP IP works. Here's how you can test it. Here's some Cisco routers that we had,

86
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:48,160
you know, in switches that we had them program and learning VLANs and other things like that.

87
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:56,760
So it was really helpful. And when I was finished and I left Iraq early to go to college, finish

88
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:01,400
out my degree, which was really nice. But when I was finished doing that, one of the

89
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:05,120
things that they did is they awarded me with a bronze star medal because all those folks

90
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,440
that I trained by the time they got out and to different locations where they had to function

91
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,000
as smaller teams, they were a lot more effective. And so I was really proud of having earned

92
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
that award.

93
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:22,680
Yeah. And it's kind of, um, like self-motivated for sharing knowledge, right? Uh, it sounds

94
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:27,240
like you just sort of were inspired to, to share this knowledge and, and the effort that

95
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,800
you put into it is really impressive.

96
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,800
I I'm always been the sort of leader where I want to help other people be successful.

97
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,640
And so I w I could see where things were going and I wanted to help the team be successful

98
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:42,320
and I'd read enough or learned enough, um, that I could, I could start closing my knowledge

99
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:47,720
gap and then build it into some sort of training. Um, it wasn't perfect and I didn't know what

100
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,680
all, you know, what, what should be in the, the whole box, right? But I knew parts of

101
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,280
the box and I could at least train that.

102
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,680
Well, it sounds like in this case, even, even any parts is helpful, right? And they can

103
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,440
start to build those, those pieces together as they need.

104
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,520
Yeah. Um, and it was, it was cool. I mean, the equipment we had, I learned all kinds

105
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,600
of stuff about radio frequencies and, um, that national guard unit I mentioned, they

106
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,840
actually had a piece of equipment I have to nerd out with you about. It's called a tropospheric

107
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:18,920
antenna. So it shoots a, it's, it's pretty close to microwave frequency up at the troposphere.

108
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:22,400
The signal bounces off of different parts of the troposphere and then back down. So

109
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,160
you can actually do line of, it's kind of like line of sight, but it's, it does 300

110
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,160
miles.

111
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,160
But reflective.

112
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,160
Yeah.

113
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,160
Yeah. Wow. That's awesome.

114
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,560
Being a long time JB listener, when I, when I heard Noah and you hear him talk about nerding

115
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,000
out about ham radio and amateur radio, it's like, Oh, I get it. I know that stuff. You

116
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,600
know, it's like, it's a lot of fun.

117
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:45,200
Well, and a lot of those like technologies, um, the same style of interest or the same,

118
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:50,240
um, type of mindset that is required to have interest in it, like overlaps in those different

119
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,480
areas, right? So a lot of us have interest in that kind of stuff. That's great. You mentioned

120
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:59,680
that you got to leave Iraq a little bit early to go to college.

121
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,260
Fun story there. I'm the only person that ever graduated from Utah state university

122
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:05,720
without applying for their major.

123
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,720
That's awesome.

124
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,400
I was literally applying from Iraq and um, you know, my tour was supposed to leave, it

125
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:15,000
was supposed to be a 12 month tour and they had a program for a green to gold activity.

126
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,200
So they were going to make me an officer, but, and they were going to pay me while I

127
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:23,440
went to school. So I applied for this program, um, and very grateful that it existed. Uh,

128
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,360
and in doing so, and with the time zone difference, cause I was in Iraq while I was applying,

129
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,280
I didn't actually get to fill out all the paperwork the school required for picking

130
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:35,240
your major. And I wanted it to be something with, with computers and communicating. And

131
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:43,280
so they put me in the college of humanities with a degree in communication studies.

132
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,840
Not quite what you were looking for, right?

133
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:49,240
No, but I was so grateful to go and I learned so much. And, and when I became an officer,

134
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:53,120
the skills that I'd learned from that were great. And so, you know how you can always

135
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,680
ask a programmer, you know, uh, what do they use at work, right? What's their language

136
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:01,040
at work and what's their language at home, right? So, so work at soft skills, right?

137
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,600
And then at home, it's jumping behind a computer, building something with a network, making

138
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:09,160
cat five cable, which is one of the most relaxing things I do. It's like, it's, I'm just going

139
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,780
to build cat five cable for, for half a day, you know, type of thing.

140
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:17,480
It's what I need right now. Orange, white, orange, green, white, blue, blue, right, green,

141
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:22,640
brown, right, brown clips away. Yeah. Like I just, yeah, it's been there.

142
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,800
It's kind of meditative, right? Cause you got to focus just enough that you can't think

143
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,320
of anything else. And I don't try to be fast. I am not the fast

144
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:32,080
guy in the room. I'm just the guy that can get it done.

145
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:35,160
Slow is smooth, right? In the army, we say slow is smooth and smooth

146
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:39,540
is fast. So that was one of our things. Yeah. I was thinking about you and that the

147
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:43,200
other day when I was trying to rush to get somewhere and I was like packing my laptop

148
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,360
in my bag and things were flying all over the place. And I was like, okay, I know I'm

149
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,360
trying to go fast, but this has just taken way longer than how I usually systematically

150
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,720
like take my time to do it. Then I thought, I thought of you and I thought of that and

151
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,320
I was like, okay, I'm just going to slow down. And then everything just went really great.

152
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,480
So listening to JB from 2008, again, Jupiter at Night, some of those other shows that aren't

153
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,440
there anymore. SciByte was great. See, these were before my time or at least

154
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:11,000
before I got connected to them. So, uh, so I love hearing these little snippets about

155
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,340
them from, from long time listeners. So, and I've always wanted to contribute.

156
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:18,360
So for one episode of SciByte, um, I worked with my daughter's like third grade class

157
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,840
or something like that, or second grade class to submit a question to the show. And we did

158
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:26,800
that with video and it was fun. Chris is, Chris is so great. He takes out audience feedback

159
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,400
and content and to really tries to work it in. And that was, that was good.

160
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,920
That must be like a special connection to when you're a listener and you can, you can

161
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,900
actually like provide some content.

162
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:39,840
It feels really good cause you want to contribute back to this community. Cause as, as we'll

163
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:44,860
talk about this community has meant an awful lot over the years, um, for what they've,

164
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:48,540
what they've done for me. I don't, I don't think they've taken the time to realize it.

165
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:52,560
The army sent us to Georgia and then Germany. Georgia and Germany are two very different

166
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,560
places.

167
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:58,320
Right. So the next time I contributed to the show was in Germany. Um, and over there it

168
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,920
was hard to get Netflix, uh, working and the cell phone companies over there are a little

169
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:08,400
different than they have in the U S and so I ended up building a Linux server in my car,

170
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:17,400
which made it into an episode of last cause I sent in the video of how I did that. Um,

171
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:21,960
and it was totally not efficient, but it was, it was functional. It's like, all right, kids,

172
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,800
we're throwing you in the minivan and we're going to Prague, right? Like it was, you know,

173
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,520
they could, they were able to watch their shows off of that, you know, movie server

174
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:35,080
in the car thing. So when Chris is at his like peak stress level for content for a Linux

175
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,120
action show and they had a week where they just couldn't produce anything, they grabbed

176
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:43,680
that clip and they threw it as the episode of last and I was like, so, so essentially

177
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:49,160
I was a, I got to be a guest on last, which was fun. Nice. That's amazing. Yes. So that

178
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:53,600
was, that felt really good. I don't have that. And so, um, there's another gold star for

179
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,840
you. I'm trying to make my way around the shows every three to five years. You know,

180
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:04,980
that's basically what I'm doing here. Succeeding. Um, well, yeah. Uh, but this, this is a different

181
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:09,440
story than those other contributions and I don't think, uh, there's parts of this that

182
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,560
are going to be hard to talk about. So, so three deployments, three times being away

183
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:19,040
from family. Um, there's some challenges that come with that. So when I left, uh, so Iraq

184
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,800
the first time was interesting cause it was during the invasion and you end up with a

185
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,540
few cool war stories out of that. So war stories that nobody minds sharing or ones where nobody

186
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:32,640
gets hurt. And I've got a couple of those. Um, one of them was, uh, when we got there,

187
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:38,080
we had to take all of the ammunition like artillery rounds. So these things are 155

188
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:43,120
millimeters wide. Um, and they weigh about 90 pounds and it's explosives and, and whatnot.

189
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,320
And we'd had it and the rockets and the other things that Stomm had been stockpiling up

190
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,400
for years and they would put those in what we call an ammo holding area. And then we

191
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,680
had to destroy them. Right. So it wasn't me destroying them. I was the communications

192
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:58,160
team, you know, across the street from these guys, but that team would go over and they'd

193
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,760
grab a small stockpile and then put some more explosives on it and blow it up and it would

194
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,240
happen noon every day. Right. So you knew what time midday was because there'd be an

195
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:10,960
explosion. It's, it's kind of like a neat clock. And if you've ever been around an explosion,

196
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:14,140
the guys on the show or the guys who are listening will know what I'm talking about. You feel

197
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:21,280
your chest compress from the shockwave before you hear it. Um, which is cool. Wow. I haven't

198
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:27,000
experienced that. It really gets your, your blood going. It's kind of cool. Um, so, so

199
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,020
they were blowing this stuff up across the street from us. Uh, and then, um, something

200
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:37,400
happened that wasn't supposed to, instead of it just blowing up the small pile, it started

201
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:43,160
blowing up the entire ammo holding area. Oh no. The first thought I get is, is those videos

202
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:48,200
you see of like firework production facilities when they have fires and it's just kind of

203
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:53,240
like all over the place. Yeah. Okay. So you, you, you've got an image for this, right?

204
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:58,640
Right. This is, this is, this is good for us. We had, you know, kind of a sand barrier

205
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:02,080
or a berm, you know, between us and them. So we couldn't really see, um, but we could

206
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:05,960
start hearing like, Hey, that's a lot of explosions. They must really be aggressive. And then it

207
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:10,080
gets just kept going. And we were like, Oh, this is not good. So they tell us to just

208
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:14,940
leave our site, right? Leave the equipment on and just go. And I had two guys on guard

209
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:19,840
duty inside of our little area. So we've got this small Humvee that's only designed a seat

210
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:23,480
for, and we pulled up to the guard area and I jumped down into the bunker that these guys

211
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:27,840
were in and I grabbed them and I said, get out of here, jump in the car right now. So

212
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:31,440
I gave him one of my seats in the car and I'm in the back of this. Um, it would be like

213
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,760
the equivalent of a pickup with one of the covers on the back, right? And I'm looking

214
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:40,920
out the back as one of my dudes is just driving and he's flooring it. And I'm watching rockets

215
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:45,280
come to our left and our right. And they ended up not landing anywhere near the truck, but

216
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,800
there's, there's a real feeling where you can see a rocket that looks like it's headed

217
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:53,120
right your direction for, for a few seconds before it spins off and going somewhere else,

218
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:59,280
which is pretty cool. When we got to a safe location, um, I use some of my, uh, orienteering

219
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:04,320
land navigation skills and calculated out the base of the smoke, um, column that was

220
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,760
there. And it was over a kilometer wide. So that's how much stuff was exploding. And it

221
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:15,520
lasted until about one, two in the morning. So it's like 12 hours. It was, it was great.

222
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:19,840
Oh wow. Okay. That's a pretty good story. Nobody got hurt. So that's a fun story to

223
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:26,040
tell. Um, but it's surreal. And then, so, uh, the second deployment to Iraq was, again,

224
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:29,680
that was the 05, 06 one. And I got to leave a little early and go to college, but it was

225
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:34,080
so abrupt. Like I left, I left, you know, being in an environment where people wanted

226
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:40,520
to kill you, um, you know, and, and then being on a college campus. And so I always kept

227
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:44,860
my weapon on my, I'd strap it over my shoulder, right? And when I got to college, I would

228
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:48,840
always make sure that I had a backpack, you know, just kind of strapped over my, my shoulders

229
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:54,840
to kind of give me that it's, it's like my sense of security, right? Yeah, yeah, it is

230
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:59,600
that helped out. Um, and then Afghanistan was interesting, right? So Afghanistan was

231
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,840
a, a really hard deployment. Um, I bought the internet when I was down there, it costs

232
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:10,800
something like a hundred dollars a month and it was 15 kilobits a second. And, uh, I would,

233
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:15,760
I would still download the JB shows that were video cause there was a lot of torrenting

234
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,320
on those, uh, on those shows when they were released. And so I just set it up to download

235
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:24,840
and I'd loved using transmission, had a little, you know, uh, system 76 mirror cat. That was

236
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:29,360
my, you know, kind of download machine, um, and just prep those files. And I set up a

237
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:34,340
movie server for, uh, the team down there because again, there's no Netflix at 15 kilobits

238
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:38,840
a second, right? So you were the Netflix, right? So between JB shows and other shows

239
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:45,760
I'd keep us. So we all had someplace to escape to. Um, but the job there was really stressful.

240
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:51,280
We had to interface directly with the Afghan army a lot and try to help and train them.

241
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:57,120
And it was also at a time where we were leaving the country. And so from a system standpoint,

242
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:03,640
that's a really dangerous time period. And, and, uh, because if we're leaving the country,

243
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:07,480
um, then things are going to revert back to normal. And if these guys are seen as helping

244
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:10,680
the Americans, then it doesn't look good for them and their family, you know, puts their

245
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:16,080
family in jeopardy. And so we had, um, I think we had four interpreters when we started two

246
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:21,000
of them, uh, were caught trying to kill us, um, or sell information that would allow people

247
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,880
to kill us. Um, and so we had to fire them and things like that, but it was a very high

248
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,680
stress environment. It was very frustrating because it didn't feel like we were going

249
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:33,400
to win. You know, there was no victory defined by Congress and other things. And so it was

250
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:38,720
very hard. And, uh, immediately after that deployment, I had to, I came home and then

251
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,320
had to turn around and go back to, uh, some, some technical training. And so with, with

252
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:46,640
all of these deployment and except for the first one, I've never been able to kind of

253
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:52,640
just park my butt and reset and be around people that knew me before and after, uh,

254
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:58,880
these things happen. And, um, because of that change in transition, um, I've ended up with,

255
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:04,360
with PTSD and, uh, and there's a couple of different ways to get this. One of them is,

256
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:08,800
you know, the, the common classic you see it in the movies, people are faced with traumatic

257
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:14,240
events. Um, the other way to get it is to be in a traumatic stress environments, high

258
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,720
stress environments for a long duration of time with no opportunity to reset or escape.

259
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:23,200
So the high stress becomes your normal, I guess, right? It does. It very much does.

260
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,760
It's kind of like building a highway in your brain is the way I describe it. That hurts

261
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:32,440
already. Just even imagining what that might feel like. Right? I bring this up because

262
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:37,040
one of the stories I want to tell for, for the team that has been doing Jupiter broadcasting,

263
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:42,440
you know, and the alumni from Jupiter broadcasting is, you know, I've, I've had to, I've had

264
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:48,320
to reset a lot, um, and reframe a lot. And it's taken a lot of work. By the time I got

265
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,160
to Boise, I was so broken. This is only a couple of years ago. I was so broken that

266
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,920
I'd get in the lane that I could on ramp and off ramp, but I'd never change. And it didn't

267
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:01,040
matter if I was stuck. I couldn't change. I didn't feel confident changing lanes, you

268
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:05,260
know, driving on the freeway, I guess, cause there's a, an inherent risk that you might

269
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:10,000
miss your stop or that you gotta, yeah, there's a risk and that would throw off an expectation

270
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:16,240
and that would make life hard. Um, and, and so that's, that's how bad I, I was, but I

271
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:21,480
was very grateful that when I was dealing with that stress, I could escape and, you

272
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:27,040
know, enjoy the content from the JB shows. Like they were just, they were, it was nothing

273
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:33,220
to do with what I was dealing with. It was something cool and exciting and building something

274
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:36,960
that was going to be productive. And here I was trapped in an environment where even

275
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,800
if I were to help that army unit be as productive as possible, the system that they were surrounded

276
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:47,680
by was going to undo everything I was doing as soon as I left. And it, it just that hopelessly

277
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:55,640
frustrating situation. Um, and so, so part of this is, man, just, just thank you guys.

278
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:58,400
Like thank you for giving me that escape.

279
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:03,080
That thank you is so huge, right? Like I feel like for those of them who've been behind

280
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:08,720
the microphone and the camera, obviously for some of the video shows, um, you never really

281
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:14,000
know the audience you're reaching. Uh, you produce the material in studio, you know,

282
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,040
you imagine surely some people will listen to it and definitely a lot of people do. Um,

283
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:25,400
but you never really know on an individual level who you're reaching and what that impact

284
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:30,440
is delivering, right? And so to hear these stories come back, even like years later,

285
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:36,000
I would imagine for the team who was involved in that stuff, it's like a huge, massive boost

286
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:42,760
in the, the personal energy that you put into creating this content a because you're super

287
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:47,360
dedicated to it, but also because that dedication from the listeners is the connection that

288
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:52,920
we make between each other. Right. And that's really powerful stuff. I feel like that is

289
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:58,920
the reason that we are a huge community is like we all have some stuff in common and

290
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,160
help each other in ways that we don't even realize.

291
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:08,280
So I run a very unpopular blog right now. Right. Okay. And I've run a very unpopular

292
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:15,360
blog for like two years ish now. Right. There's 7 billion people on the planet. 15 of them

293
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:24,000
accidentally click one of my links a day. Right. Oh, that kind of unpopular. And so

294
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I've had to reset how I look at that. And this, this applies to this as well as somebody

295
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,680
in India clicked on my blog, right? Like how cool is that? When I was growing up connecting

296
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:39,440
with somebody in India or China or any of these places would have been unheard of. Right.

297
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,620
But some computer in India or China. Okay. Yeah. You guys were technical and you're probably

298
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:46,780
going to tell me it's just some scam bot. I got that. Right. But, but it clicked on

299
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:53,240
my blog. Like that's, that's still cool that we're that connected. And, and to think of

300
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:58,440
what that means, I'm sure the guys who worked on warty warthog or whatever it was in 2005

301
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:03,260
never realized that we would, we would wait three days for that sucker to download so

302
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:07,380
we could throw it on a server just to see, you know, what's, what would stick. Right.

303
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:12,080
That obviously means that it's really valuable if you're willing to wait that long. Right.

304
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:16,280
So, so it feels like the code that people are writing in the same way that the JP shows

305
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:21,840
is like it's, it's affecting people in major ways. Exactly. Right. You can't discount the

306
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:26,300
one, you know, we look at the numbers in aggregate, right? And the numbers in aggregate don't

307
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:32,200
help us connect with the, the individuals or the individual use cases that are oftentimes

308
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:38,220
really powerful and, and what they do. I ended up inheriting an old system in Iraq or no

309
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:42,580
in Afghanistan and ended up giving it to one of the Afghan guys. Right. And guess which

310
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:52,780
operating system I threw on there? Let me see. Not Vista. No, not windows. No. And it

311
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:56,400
was, it was this old Lenovo somebody had given me with a cracked screen, but for those people

312
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:01,180
in that environment, it was a valuable tool that they could learn from. And so I threw

313
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:07,060
on 10 oh four, which to me was just the pinnacle of classic Ubuntu. 10 oh four was just, oh,

314
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:12,540
everything about it made sense and it was so good. And now my kids run a Ubuntu mate.

315
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:16,520
It gives them the versatility and it gives them that same sort of feel. But you know,

316
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:20,940
you kind of want to tell Martin Winpress, Martin, my kids are learning computers using

317
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:25,100
the code that you're, you know, working with your team to create. Like how cool is that?

318
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:29,020
Like that's their experience. Right. And, and why Ubuntu mate? Well, because I know

319
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:33,580
if I throw them in there, they can customize it 10 ways from Sunday without really breaking

320
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:38,820
it. And then when they get behind whatever system they end up using in the future, they're

321
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:43,580
kind of agnostic to the workflow, right? They can figure out any workflow on any system

322
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:49,500
that's out there. Um, because of that experience of, of working with, you know, Linux and Ubuntu

323
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:52,420
and those sorts of things and the way that the user interface is designed.

324
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:58,780
Yeah. That versatility is like priceless and reminds me of the gift that you gave to, to

325
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:03,780
some of your, um, partners. Uh, was it in Iraq when you were teaching them some of the

326
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:07,420
communications stuff with computers too? It's like you're doing the same thing with your

327
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:12,380
kids. That's powerful stuff. You're giving them tools for the future. And, and you know,

328
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:15,420
those are future Linux users, I would imagine.

329
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:19,060
So one thing working on my undergrad and that communications that wasn't really technical,

330
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:22,940
right, is, uh, I did have one teacher who was technically minded and she was actually

331
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:29,420
doing a study on how, um, the computer actually trains you, right? It is, is an interactive

332
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:34,820
part. People, um, interact with their operating systems the same way they do with people and

333
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:39,620
the brain, it has trouble noticing the difference. That's why we have to manage screen time these

334
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:43,560
days, right? Cause their brain has trouble noticing the difference between, am I interacting

335
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:49,500
with a person or am I interacting with, you know, a software or, you know, type of experience.

336
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:54,300
And, and so again, we measure screen time and I go back to Microsoft Bob because Microsoft

337
00:25:54,300 --> 00:26:02,680
has, has misread the study that they commissioned on, on users. Um, because, because a user

338
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:07,820
treats the operating system like a person or like their regular environment, Microsoft

339
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:09,060
misread that.

340
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:13,020
And so they created their environment to look like what a person had in real life, hence

341
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:17,180
the bookshelves and the other things like that. And so it, it's one of those things

342
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:22,260
that, you know, when I, when I look lovingly back at Microsoft Bob and I smile because

343
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:28,500
what that shows is, is it's, it's so classic and showing us how powerful the tools we are,

344
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:34,500
um, as far as our interaction with them and, and what that means. Okay. I've been listening

345
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:39,220
to the JB shows, but I've been consuming and using operating systems and different parts

346
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:44,220
of Linux and different tools and, you know, Chris's, uh, you know, recommendations on,

347
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:49,020
on software for years. And, and, and I've chosen to, even after I knew this was going

348
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:54,340
to happen, I've chosen to let that be a part of, you know, how I'm wiring my brain to think

349
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:59,540
through problems and work through things. And this team does it, you know, on a bootstrap,

350
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:03,460
you know, budget and all those other stuff. It's like, it's what we have is amazing.

351
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:09,300
Well, and I feel like Linux in a way, uh, this is true for me is it allows you to take

352
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:16,340
older hardware or piecemeal hardware and make it useful up to today's standards, which is

353
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:21,380
an amazing gift. You know, a lot of that hardware with the software that came with it, generally

354
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:28,140
windows, um, is mostly useless. Uh, and so like for instance, you and I are talking on

355
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:33,020
my X two 20, which came out like eons ago, if you compare it to modern hardware, but

356
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:37,660
it still produces a whole bunch of magic and it's, I've got extremely modern software on

357
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:41,980
this and it's running amazingly, right? So it would otherwise end up in the landfill

358
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:49,420
and my plex server at home is running on an old Mac pro from 2008. Yeah, exactly. Right.

359
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:54,580
That's awesome. Because it has the four bays of, you know, for hard drive space that I

360
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:58,640
wanted. And it was, you know, it, it just works and it works like a champ, the transcoding

361
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:03,300
on that thing. And I've got friends and family for days on that, you know, banging at it.

362
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:08,460
And it's, it's holding up because it's running Linux and it's, it's able to add value to

363
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:14,880
all of their lives. Um, so that's, that's really cool. I'm also the sort of person that

364
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:20,620
doesn't, uh, I don't tend to sit still very well in, in what sense, like, like that you

365
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:24,580
always need to be solving a problem or that you always need to be doing something or I

366
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:29,020
have trouble sitting still physically and sitting still mentally. Um, so I've ended

367
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:34,100
up writing like three books at this point, um, which is fun just cause I had something

368
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:38,420
I wanted to share. Um, and I've done a lot of projects on the side and when I do something,

369
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:42,780
I do a lot of it. So it's like all or nothing. Right. So in college compared to what I was

370
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:47,860
dealing with my long days in Iraq, right. I, uh, I turned around, so this is for my

371
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:53,980
bachelors. So I decided to figure out how many credits I could do in one semester without

372
00:28:53,980 --> 00:29:01,060
having to get the Dean's approval. Um, turns out at Utah state university, you can do 24

373
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:06,540
semester hours without having to get the Dean's approval. And I did all 24 and ran a 5k that

374
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:11,900
raised money for charity and had our third kid. So that was, that was pretty good. And

375
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:16,820
then the next semester it was, it was, Hey, this academia thing likes publishing. Um,

376
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:20,540
I'm going to write a paper that gets published. And I did that as an undergrad, which was

377
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:26,420
a lot of fun. Um, so, so that was cool. And then, uh, you know, coming back from Afghanistan,

378
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:30,220
I started working on my master's preparation for leaving military and that sort of stuff.

379
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:35,620
And, uh, sort of really, really, um, had a job in Germany that required a lot of my attention.

380
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:42,980
I was in command of 138 soldiers. We had, uh, we had a 34% turnover every year because

381
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:48,580
of rotations that they're just naturally scheduled and the Russians invaded the Ukraine. So I

382
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:53,060
was constantly sending communications teams out to Latvia, Lithuania, Spain, you know,

383
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:58,060
and all England, um, or some of the other places they went. They went to Israel, uh,

384
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:02,980
one time, uh, lots of things in Germany, lots of things in Poland. Um, and so I was sending

385
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:08,980
teams out all over the place and working on my master's on the side and my master's program

386
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:13,980
did not include, so it was distance education and did not include lectures. And it was,

387
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:17,940
I wanted to be an it project manager. So they had the program for that. Cool. Great. There's

388
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:21,180
some few it classes. There's a bunch of project management classes, put them all together

389
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:26,660
and Bob's your uncle. And without any lectures, understanding the context of the content,

390
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:30,100
cause I'm, I'm a self learner, but a lot of times when you Google something, you only

391
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:35,500
get the answer you need, right? For that specific problem, not the greater picture. Right. So

392
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:39,380
if we take something basic, like, you know, how does, how does TCP IP work, right? You

393
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:44,300
might find, uh, the instructions to configure it on windows, but that doesn't really explain,

394
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:48,420
you know, all of the parts of how it works and was designed and, and those sorts of,

395
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:55,700
you know, things. And so you miss that context. And it was about this time that, um, I, I

396
00:30:55,700 --> 00:31:01,100
was struggling in my classes that I just started paying a little more attention to the tech

397
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:06,340
snap show. Um, back when Chris and Alan were doing that and Chris always, I think you have

398
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:11,060
the introduction memorize, you know, he would get on like his baseball announcer voice,

399
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:14,740
right? And he'd be like, and, and joining me or is Alan Jude, you know, the tech, the

400
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:18,880
admin and the teacher, you know, and Alan would break down, has just a snack to break

401
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:24,460
down complex concepts into ways that the audience can understand, right? You're not insulting

402
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:28,460
the technical folks in the audience and you're really allowing the folks who aren't quite

403
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:34,440
there yet to bring them in. And so Alan and Chris were essentially my teaching duo for,

404
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:38,820
they were the lectures I needed to get through my coursework for those it classes.

405
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:43,580
Wow. Oh, that's huge. And it sounds like a perfect timing too, right?

406
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:47,180
It was, Oh, and my goodness, the show notes, they do such a good, they did such a good

407
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:50,580
job on those show notes that what I would do is I would go through and be like, okay,

408
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:53,940
I can write that into a paper. I'm gonna, I'm gonna, you know, like I'm gonna write

409
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:57,980
that new paper, write that new paper. So I'd be on my little commute right now. Okay. All

410
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:00,940
right. So I'm listening to tech snap. This is what's going on. And then other stuff from

411
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:04,860
last would tie off with it. And you know, I'd, I'd pull all these things together. And

412
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:08,740
so by the time I'd sit down on the weekend, cause that was the only time I had time, I

413
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:14,200
was working 14 hour days on the job and come home on the weekend. And I don't think my

414
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:18,620
family really saw me much in Germany. And I'd sit there and lock myself in a room for

415
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:22,500
all of Saturday and most of Sunday and just start cranking out papers. But thanks to the

416
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:26,620
show notes, right? The research was basically done. I didn't have to go Google where to

417
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:31,300
find the sources. I had the list of the sources. I could go back and read the articles. I could

418
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:35,620
pull out the relevant material. I could put that together and submit it for my professors

419
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:41,500
and academia, at least for this university was not as cutting edge on tech, you know,

420
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:45,620
as, as I would have liked them to be. And I was, the teachers were writing me back and

421
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:50,780
really impressed with my sources and you know, kind of, kind of appreciative that I was helping

422
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:55,660
keep them current as opposed to just referencing something published in an academic journal,

423
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:59,420
you know, and I'd mix it up, right? I'd use academic journals as well, but you know, that

424
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:04,740
it totally reduced my research load to have all of that JB content and be able to, to

425
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:09,060
get my masters that way, which was just, just awesome to hear that one of the shows helped

426
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:16,860
you get through your masters. It's unbelievable. And like so valuable, like unbelievably valuable.

427
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:21,860
That's amazing. Well, let's put this into perspective. 15 people visited my blog in

428
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:26,660
the last 24 hours. One of them was from India, right? So Chris has been producing content

429
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:30,620
for over 10 years now, it feels like. So some, at some point it's going to stick with one

430
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:34,900
or more audience members and Hey, I'll be the one for today. And maybe there's another

431
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:41,380
one out there and two or three people and you can sleep well at night, right? There's

432
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:44,740
7 billion people in the world. It's about time you made a difference for one of them.

433
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:48,100
No, I'm totally kidding. It's it's, I really am appreciative of it. And I know there's

434
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:51,500
a bigger network than that. I just, I'd never get to see him cause I've never made it to

435
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:56,420
Linux Fest North to see that crew or any of the other conferences.

436
00:33:56,420 --> 00:34:03,900
Did you ever get a chance to meet any of them? I did get a chance to meet Chris. So I'm working

437
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:09,620
on my masters. I'm working on my PTSD issues. I'm leaving the army and I have no job, right?

438
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:14,180
There's nobody that's jumping out. I've only lived in Boise at that point for like a year.

439
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:18,180
So I don't have a professional network of people that want to hire Jacob. I'm trying

440
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:22,900
to build that network and I'm working on my masters. And so I applied for a job just,

441
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:26,820
so I could get an interview, right? I was just throwing my resume out there just so

442
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:30,420
I could get an interview. And this guy ended up picking me up and wanting me to be an intern

443
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:36,020
at his entrepreneurial software development shop. You know, so, so I say, Hey, cool. Let

444
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:39,060
me do my army job in the morning. I'm done with that. I'll come over and work with you

445
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:42,680
guys. And Oh, by the way, I'm working on my masters. So, you know, I was taking two master's

446
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:50,240
classes at the same time and now working two jobs. It's great. It was just, it was awesome.

447
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:53,540
What I did is I was, I was working on that and he wanted to bring me on full time when

448
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:58,580
I left the service. And so dealing with the anxiety PTSD issues I had, Oh boy, that felt

449
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:03,060
really good to know that at least I had something to land on after I left the service instead

450
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:08,700
of just avoid, I suppose. Right. And so the show that helped me the most through that

451
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:14,620
process happened to not be on Netflix and it wasn't on ABC or NBC. It was also on Jupiter

452
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:19,300
broadcasting, right? And it was Coder radio because literally this entrepreneurial shop

453
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:24,380
was doing the exact same things that the Coder radio team was doing, you know, in their entrepreneurial

454
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:30,660
shop just on the other side of the country. So I'm sitting there and, and you can understand

455
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:35,620
cause I was a hardware implementation guy and then I was a leadership guy, right? So

456
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:38,820
you're going to develop software and I have no idea how to write a line of code, but I

457
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:43,860
had to at least not fake it, but understand the language and Coder radio really helped

458
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:48,660
close the gap on that. So I'm in this position where I'm leaving the service. So I've got

459
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:52,580
to turn in all my army gear at the end of this, right? And so they told me to turn in

460
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:56,860
my army gear in Fort Lewis, Washington, which is in Tacoma area, right? So it's a little

461
00:35:56,860 --> 00:36:01,780
south of where Chris is at. And so I travel out there and on my way out there, I think

462
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:05,140
I messaged Chris like a month out like, Hey, I'm going to be in the area. I'd really love

463
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:10,840
to take you out to dinner or breakfast, something like that. And, and so we landed on breakfast

464
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:15,860
and, and Hideo helped coordinate that cause Chris was dealing with a lot and oh boy, she's

465
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:20,220
just so nice. And Angela, Angela in the background of all the shows. Oh, Angela is one of my

466
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:24,140
favorite people in the world. And I wish she had her own show again, cause there's something

467
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:29,980
about the way she sees tech that it's just, Oh, you made it approachable for me. So, so

468
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:36,300
Hideo was so nice and helping to set that up and, and Chris and had the kids that weekend.

469
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:40,460
And so I bought them all. I think we met at I hopper at Denny's. And so I bought breakfast

470
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:44,640
for him, brought coloring books for the kids. And, and I think Chris was uncaffeinated or

471
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:49,740
didn't have a good night's sleep. And I was extraordinarily nervous because here I'm meeting

472
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:55,180
a hero of mine, you know, and I remember one of the kids was like, dad, you're famous.

473
00:36:55,180 --> 00:37:02,700
And Chris looks at him and he says, I'm internet famous, son. It's a little different. And

474
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:07,100
so it was not this like, Oh, we got to come to this moment where I got to give him a hug

475
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:10,700
and just tell him thank you and what it meant. I did get to tell him the story of, Hey, I've

476
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:15,620
got this job offer. I can land, but you know, with the kids there and everything else with

477
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:19,420
that, we kept the conversation pretty light. And I never got to tell that whole backstory

478
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:24,260
of, man, I've been, I've been, I've had issues building up with me for years. And those highways

479
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:28,580
in my head that I've got to try to, you know, disconnect and, and, and short, short circuit,

480
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:34,140
right. So I can be, be functional and how just having that offer available, you know,

481
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:40,460
meant so much to me and how his team has helped to produce that over the years. I mean, you're

482
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:46,660
making differences in people's lives and it's just awesome. Um, and I think he got it, right?

483
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:52,140
I'll have to find out later on, you know, right. We'll see what he says after this guys,

484
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:57,540
guys communicate differently, right? Um, sometimes you don't have to say things. And, and for

485
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:00,700
those of you guys that may know somebody, for those in the audience that may know somebody

486
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:04,820
who is dealing with PTSD or other issues, one of the best things you can do is just

487
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:11,500
sit next to them. It sounds really weird, but just sitting next to somebody when they're,

488
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:16,740
when they're having a moment where they're disconnected or they zone out, don't say anything

489
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:22,420
till you're asked, but just sitting there makes all the difference. It is so, so comfortable

490
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:23,420
to have that.

491
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:24,980
The power of presence, right?

492
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:32,460
Yeah. Uh, now as cool as that story is, I didn't end up taking that job.

493
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:40,140
This is a twist. I did not expect the shop was about to go through a really hard period

494
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:44,500
in order to make the transition in the shop that I would need to, to be functional. Um,

495
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:48,340
I didn't have the experience to be able to stand up to, I mean, it's a small 10 person,

496
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:53,540
15 person shop, right? Um, and I didn't have the experience to be able to, to confidently

497
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:59,020
say no to the boss when I needed to. And I knew that and I didn't want to be in that

498
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:02,860
position where he did hire me for three months and then have to let me go cause we had a

499
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:08,180
professional disagreement and I couldn't back up what I was saying. Um, but where I've landed

500
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:15,620
is absolutely great. Um, uh, so Idaho is known for I'm quizzing you. Idaho is known for what

501
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:16,620
Brent, do you know?

502
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:19,580
Well, the first thing that comes to my mind is potatoes.

503
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:25,660
That is absolutely correct. So in Pocatello, I believe, um, yeah, that's one of the areas.

504
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:30,100
There's quite a few actually. I get to work for the Jr Simplot company is one of their

505
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:36,540
project managers. Um, and I'm on a great team. Um, and, uh, the Jr Simplot company is known

506
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:42,020
for being the largest supplier of McDonald's French fries in the world. No way. And now

507
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:47,620
we do way more than that, right? We have way more going on than just McDonald's, but, um,

508
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:52,260
that's best what we're known for. Um, and so the team I get to work with is great. And

509
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:57,940
what's neat here is I've got that mentor gap is closed, right? I had a, I had a mentor

510
00:39:57,940 --> 00:40:01,740
gap in a lot of my other experiences, whether it means learning it or me in that entrepreneurial

511
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:05,860
shop, you know, and I know by the way, I have such great memories of all of that, right?

512
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:11,500
That, that shop was so, so good at what they did. We helped reorganize their hiring process,

513
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:15,980
right? And they ended up making the ink 500 because they were able to hire people so quickly

514
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:22,140
and get the right talent in. It was like 69% improvement in a four week period or something

515
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:26,500
like that. When I sat down and looked at how we were, how the processes, once you, once

516
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:30,900
you do, once you do a process map on it, you know, you can, you can build things out from

517
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:35,820
there. Um, and one of the things I do at work here and one of the ways I got the job here,

518
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:40,140
so I came on as a contractor and then they picked me up full time at a moment where they

519
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:44,100
were getting rid of all their contractors and they didn't have a whole lot of open positions.

520
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:48,420
So I'm really lucky. But one of the reasons they picked me up here is because I'm the

521
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:54,140
sort of guy that, uh, I'm, I'm, I just want to help get the workflow done. And I know

522
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:59,780
a lot of tools to do it. And so I'm able to, to jump in and help people like get through

523
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:03,540
things. And again, that goes back to the shows and the content from, and the experience with

524
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:07,580
running Linux is you have to figure it out, right? You've learned, we've all learned,

525
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:12,380
if you're listening to the show, you have a gift that you may not realize you have learned

526
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:17,620
how to build your workflow and stuff where there may not be good documentation, right?

527
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:21,660
Where the software may be buggy and where nobody's going to spell it out for you. And

528
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:25,620
oh, by the way, if you find a YouTube video, it's probably going to be somebody's hobby

529
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:30,380
project with 300 views. It's so true. You and I have both done photography, right? If

530
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:35,860
I want to know how to create a mask in Photoshop, I have 600 videos to choose from, right? Yeah.

531
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:40,100
In all versions of Photoshop, whatever. Yeah, exactly. You get a dark table. We just don't

532
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:44,720
have the community there. So you had to learn it on your own. And that has made me a powerful

533
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:51,660
force for good at work with helping people be productive and get their content out there.

534
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:57,620
And then changing the culture is a part of it too. I'm at the point now where I'm influencing

535
00:41:57,620 --> 00:42:04,060
culture. Our project team is about 200 right now, and it's going to be about 500 in the

536
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:09,180
next six months. And so the project culture is going to impact the broader culture of

537
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:15,140
this company that is globally known for producing really good food products, including good

538
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:21,780
french fries. That's amazing. So it must feel to you like you're making a massive difference

539
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:26,580
still in the work that you're doing and that I would imagine feels really good, especially

540
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:30,820
coming from some of the previous experiences you've had. Yeah. So you remember that frustration

541
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:34,740
I had about Afghanistan where it didn't feel like my effort was going to make a difference

542
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:40,300
at all. I can make a difference individually. And we did. One of our interpreters is now

543
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:44,740
living in the United States. He was able to come and move his family. And so he's safe.

544
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:50,600
His family's safe. And he's down in Texas and really doing well. And I've kept in touch

545
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:56,220
with him a couple of times a year. But now on the other side of it is I'm a part of the

546
00:42:56,220 --> 00:43:00,940
company's mission statement is we help feed the world. And they've got a challenge statement

547
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:07,140
downstairs that says, can you think big enough to feed a billion people? Yes. Okay. That's

548
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:13,500
a challenge. Right. And, and so, and so that's, that's where we're going as a company and

549
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:18,380
what I feel like I'm contributing to. And then Carl Sagan once said that the advances

550
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:24,980
in science and agriculture have done more for creating world peace and lifting people

551
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:31,100
up out of poverty than any war has ever done or ever will do. And I'm totally paraphrasing.

552
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:37,620
Yeah. Fair enough. It's still had the impact. Wow. So now I'm on the other side of that

553
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:41,540
coin, right? I'm on the other side of the coin where it's like, Hey, I don't always

554
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:45,660
directly get to see who I impact, you know, at the, at the end of where people consume

555
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:50,220
our products, but I do get to see the impact of the people who are helping to do that.

556
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:57,540
And I, they like working with me and I like being around them and, and it's getting me

557
00:43:57,540 --> 00:44:02,700
to the point where I can be human functional has been a, been an interesting road and getting

558
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:06,340
me to the point where I can be technical functional and all these things have kind of merged recently.

559
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:11,900
And then one of those arms is the JB audience. So I get to share that with you guys today.

560
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:17,720
Yeah, that's pretty amazing. The JB community, you know, I've been in it in a deep way only

561
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:24,060
for a few years now and it feels like just a massive family, right? Where some people

562
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:28,660
you're closer to and as time shifts, you get closer to other people for you. The shows

563
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:33,220
were that family for a long time and they were the, like the person sitting beside you

564
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:39,380
silently, you know, in your ear while you're doing those commutes in, in various situations

565
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:40,380
and places, right?

566
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:44,500
Chris has spent a lot of time on the quality over the years and, and part of it is to create

567
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:50,780
that intimacy between the audience and, and the hosts. And so literally like, look, I,

568
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:55,520
I can't tell any of these people apart, you know, you know, if I ever meet them, but it's

569
00:44:55,520 --> 00:45:02,060
the, it's the it feels like there's a connection there and they, they spent the time to make

570
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:06,380
sure that things were good enough that that could exist. And then the difference that

571
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:09,620
it makes because it exists.

572
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:13,940
Somebody has got to say thank you around here because, you know, this is only the first

573
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:19,460
10 years of JB, you know, what is, what is the next 10 years, you know, look like, right?

574
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:20,460
Like

575
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:21,940
That's the challenge statement right there.

576
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:25,500
Can you think big enough to feed a billion people right on my end, right? And you guys

577
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:30,140
have this challenge statement of, you know, reaching more people and making more of a

578
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:31,140
difference.

579
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:37,860
That's massive. I feel in many ways, completely honored to help craft that challenge from

580
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:40,180
hearing your story. That's really unbelievable.

581
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:46,340
But the way you do these interviews and, and the way L talks and, and the cast now, you

582
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:52,420
guys and Wes and, and Chris has just always been solid on this is you guys are not in,

583
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:56,900
you're making the content approachable for people who are not technical. And that makes

584
00:45:56,900 --> 00:46:02,180
such a big difference because not a whole lot of people have that gift. And the fact

585
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:08,780
that there's this many people that have that gift working at JB is just really cool. I

586
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:13,380
mean, Litix Academy, like snatching you guys up is just gotta be so happy and thrilled

587
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:18,860
because that's part of what they do too is helping to make content, you know, approachable,

588
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:20,540
you know, at different levels of knowledge.

589
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:25,740
Yeah, there are certainly these great synergies happening there for sure. And I think as listeners

590
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:32,180
here, you're seeing some of that benefit for sure. And for you, it feels like, you know,

591
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:36,020
what, what is JB going to be for you in the next few years? You know, what are you hoping

592
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:37,020
to get out of it?

593
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:42,700
Oh, yeah. If I get to choose my own adventure because it's been part of your life for the,

594
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:50,660
for the last little while there. So what do you need next? We'll give it an, I think extras

595
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:56,020
dot show. Um, if, if I had my, if I had all the time in the world, right, I would, I would

596
00:46:56,020 --> 00:47:03,980
create a, um, content for extras, uh, for the, the extras feed on fonts. Oh man, that

597
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:10,980
is a rabbit hole, isn't it? Right. Um, but we so often overlook the systems in our lives

598
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:15,560
that make a difference, right? We don't notice. Um, there was a story of a guy who said thank

599
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:19,860
you when he picked up his coffee one morning and then his kids like, well, or the, the,

600
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:22,980
the barista was like, well, don't thank me. Thanks. So, and so who delivers the beans,

601
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:26,260
right? And he ended up having like a year, he wrote a book on this, right? About spending

602
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:30,360
like a year saying thank you to everybody that involved him getting his coffee and how

603
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:35,580
connected we are. Right. And, and, and so fonts are part of that system where we just don't

604
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:41,100
notice, right? Like it's, it's, I mean, you probably do cause you do photography and you're

605
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:45,100
graphically minded, right? But, but most of the people, when I walk around and I'll, I'll

606
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:48,700
gripe about, you know, Helvetica or Ariel or something like that, they'll be like, what

607
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:54,900
does it matter, Jacob? You know? And it's like, no, it matters. You know, uh, my Halloween

608
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:58,820
shirt was the word Helvetica written in Comic Sans, which is the only time Comic Sans should

609
00:47:58,820 --> 00:48:06,140
ever touch my body. Yep. You get it. I think cheese is going to love hearing this. And

610
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:09,460
all my goodness, I haven't mentioned it. Those graphics that he's designed. Wow. Like way

611
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:13,700
to get the theming down. So it totally works in my podcast app guys. Like it makes it so

612
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:18,900
much more approachable. Oh, that usability stuff is like, just like what you mentioned.

613
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:22,220
If you don't like, obviously you're noticing it now, but there are some professions that

614
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:28,660
are, um, that have the challenge that if they're done well, nobody notices. Yes. Yes. And,

615
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:33,620
but, uh, and it, it just takes asking questions. Like, how did this happen? You know, why do

616
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:39,100
people care so passionately about X? Right. And then understanding the Y and, and you

617
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:43,140
can disagree with their solution or their, their, the end result of their thought process.

618
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:48,860
Right. But understanding the Y just makes it so it makes so much sense. Um, I was listening

619
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:52,820
to the Ubuntu podcast and they were talking about a flat earthers. I didn't even know

620
00:48:52,820 --> 00:49:00,980
that was a topic, man. I didn't notice topic. So, so, and I'm like, I'm like, okay, well,

621
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:04,780
how did they get to this point? Like how, how did they get to, and I started listening

622
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:09,420
to, you know, some of the commentary, both sides and, and realizing that, Oh, Oh, okay.

623
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:12,940
They just reject any evidence that they can't see or touch. And then that leads them to

624
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:16,300
this conclusion. Oh, it totally makes sense. I can, I can get along with flat earthers

625
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:18,780
now. You know, like, like I don't agree with them.

626
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:23,740
Well, and you know what? I think that is the right approach to most problems is like, okay,

627
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:29,620
if I don't understand it, I shouldn't, um, resist it or, or be aggressive towards it.

628
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:33,220
I should ask questions to try to understand their perspective. I think you totally nailed

629
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:36,680
it. Uh, and that's hugely valuable.

630
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:41,860
So when you, you see the differences in how, like, I would really love to know why when

631
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:47,740
Ubuntu went back to gnome, right. Versus KDE. Cause KDE was in my mind from a user experience

632
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:51,040
was much more sure my mouse worked, right? Like, you know, you have those odd issues

633
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:55,860
on Linux. I've never had a conversation with Mark Shutterworth, but as his benevolent dictator

634
00:49:55,860 --> 00:50:00,660
for life, you know, like, Hey man, can you walk me back a few steps and say how you got

635
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:04,740
there? Cause I see the results. And now though, like, Oh my goodness, they've done such a

636
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:10,380
good job in that space. You know, um, that it's really awesome. And one of the things

637
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:14,980
I wanted to share in this is there's a difference in how we compute like this audience, there's

638
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:19,500
a difference in how they compute. Most of the people I work with see their machines

639
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:25,260
as allowing them to be productive. And the Linux community sees a computer as allowing

640
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:27,260
them to be expressive.

641
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:29,920
Well said. That's such a big difference, right?

642
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:34,900
And so, so then we get to choose, right? Once you realize that you want to be expressive,

643
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:39,660
then you get to choose, how do I want to be expressive? And that's where all the options

644
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:45,100
come in. And so that, that, that some of that infighting that was a lot more prominent back

645
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:48,340
in the day where this is better than that, right? It's like, no, no, no, no, no, it's

646
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:54,140
not better. This is how I choose to be expressive, you know, and we need to recognize that. And

647
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:59,420
right now my choice is I'm guys, I hate to admit it to you. I'm running a Mac book pro.

648
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:03,380
Um, and I love it because I love final cut and a few of the other things. And that doesn't

649
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:07,440
discredit any of the work in the Linux community. You're still powering at least five systems

650
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:13,060
in my house or three systems in my house in various ways, you know, but it's how I choose

651
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:19,660
to be expressive with the tool. Um, and, and where, where's that road going to lead me?

652
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:25,180
You know, I don't know what that next phase of this looks like, but I feel like I can,

653
00:51:25,180 --> 00:51:30,620
I can be more expressive in every aspect or every challenge I come up with in life because

654
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:33,740
of these experiences and learning how to use these tools and learning how to help people

655
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:34,740
through things.

656
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:41,940
Yeah, I feel like looking at our tools as means of expression is, is huge. Um, and you

657
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:48,340
helped me clarify for myself what I felt, but not been able to explain. And because

658
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:54,280
like many of us, I imagine the people surrounding me have far less interest in, in computers

659
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:59,820
and Linux than I do. Like most of them, when I mentioned Linux, they're like, huh, what

660
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:06,020
is that? Um, but the, the real gift is that this is a tool I've discovered for myself

661
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:10,580
that allows me to be expressive, especially that I tend to do creative work on it. Right.

662
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:15,660
Um, but even, even tinkering with software problems or hardware problems, like that's

663
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:21,060
a means of expression and building my own systems. And I don't mean computer system,

664
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:25,180
but I mean like systems that surround me and make me a more productive person or a better

665
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:32,540
person is an amazing way to be expressive. And the JB community for me, and I would assume

666
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:37,540
exactly for you as well, is a way of connecting with people who also get that. And so the

667
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:41,460
way you worded it, it was like, Oh, I know I'm sitting beside someone who totally gets

668
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:43,020
me for sure.

669
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:47,980
Yeah. And, but we may disagree, right? Like, like I, you and I both like dark table, but

670
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:53,540
after that I'm, I'm not jumping in to get man. Like I just, Nope, I'm good. I'll just,

671
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:57,140
whatever dark table can do, cause I'm not a professional photographer. I'll do in dark

672
00:52:57,140 --> 00:53:02,780
table and then I'll walk away. And you know, for the purposes of capturing my family memories,

673
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:08,060
I'm good enough. And that works right. Whereas you're probably more comfortable in there,

674
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:14,300
um, than, than I am. So yeah, it's just, it's, it's different, but it's complimentary and

675
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:19,720
it's so cool when you see people that get it and can talk that way. You guys have Linux

676
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:24,380
Fest Northwest and it's a big hoo-ha and I think that's great. One of these days I'll

677
00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:29,500
get there. It's like my pilgrimage to Mecca, but not quite as important as that. What we

678
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:34,340
have here is, uh, around, it's usually like the Friday after the 4th of July, we have

679
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:42,540
a free fry day where we give away French fries. And, and if you've never been to Boise, especially

680
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:47,280
downtown Boise, you've got to give it a shot. Right? So right across like the next building

681
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:55,900
to us has a six story slide. Okay. Got it. So, so you got to let that sink in for a second,

682
00:53:55,900 --> 00:54:00,620
right? Like, like, remember the slide as a kid, right? Like it was cool and it felt really

683
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:06,140
tall when you were small. So it's like somebody around here decided let's do that on steroids.

684
00:54:06,140 --> 00:54:10,600
Let's do that for adults, right? We have a six story slide. We give away free French

685
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:15,620
fries. How can you not have fun in that environment? Right? Exactly. Right. And then there's usually

686
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:20,660
a giant octopus that like starts eating the building next door as well, which is also

687
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:24,660
cool. You know, I don't think they've settled on the date for free Friday next year, but

688
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:29,540
if you Google it around June, July or around, uh, uh, we usually post that about May, June

689
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:33,880
timeframe, you will be able to find out when free Friday is in Boise and, and the team's

690
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:38,140
welcome to come. Sure. Yeah. I think you just hit on something too that I've been really

691
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:42,660
impressed with the more and more I learn about the Jupiter broadcasting community, which

692
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:49,460
is that, um, we're scattered a little bit everywhere, literally around the world. And

693
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:54,580
I'm, I'm planning a trip to go see Alex, uh, from self-hosted, uh, we've been meaning to

694
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:59,300
get connected and he and I have a similar trajectory into JP. So we were really, really

695
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:03,460
close friends now. And, uh, and so I'm planning the strip and I was thinking like, Oh geez,

696
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:07,260
well I'm, you know, I'm close to New York. I know there's some JP listeners there and

697
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:12,860
Oh yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm going to be in Raleigh and I'm close to like, maybe I might end up

698
00:55:12,860 --> 00:55:16,700
in Savannah. I know some people there might go see Drew. And so it was like all of a sudden

699
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:24,700
my like daily life for at least these special trips that I do, which is almost daily, um,

700
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:29,980
end up being connected all the dots being connected by, uh, Jupiter broadcasting community

701
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:36,580
members. And that feels like, okay, I've got a family anywhere I go now, which is so powerful.

702
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:40,740
And I feel like you as a JB community member, you chose to go anywhere you can, you can

703
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:46,900
find someone. Right. And, uh, and that invitation you just gave gets given all the time. And

704
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:50,860
it's just like such a beautiful thing. So thank you for, for putting that out there.

705
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:51,860
It's massive.

706
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:56,660
Well, and, and we got to thank the folks who make the swag happen because one of the towns

707
00:55:56,660 --> 00:56:00,940
in this Valley is Nampa, Idaho. And it's like what, 80,000 people, not a whole lot, but

708
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:04,660
it has a Costco and I'm walking in Costco one day with my wife and there's somebody

709
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:08,300
wearing a last t-shirt. And so it's like, Hey man, can I take a photo with you real

710
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:13,060
quick? And so we exchanged phone numbers afterwards and like, you know, every once in a while

711
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:15,860
we'll text back and forth. I'm like, Hey, how's it going? It's going fine. You know,

712
00:56:15,860 --> 00:56:20,100
but there's, there's like, you know, three people I know of that are, that are huge fans

713
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:24,540
of the program in the Valley. And that'll, there's more. I just haven't met them or connected

714
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:29,980
with them. Um, cause for kids, I mean, we're running around with all kinds of activities.

715
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:35,740
So I could only imagine for sure. It's a lot of fun. And it's so cool when I see that my

716
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:39,920
kids don't struggle with technology because we've, they've had the experiences where something

717
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:44,740
didn't work and then it became a learning opportunity. Um, and that's why when L describes

718
00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:50,020
learning, that's been resonating with me recently so much because it's like, Oh, this is really

719
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:55,860
uncomfortable for me right now. Oh, I must be having a learning experience. The reward

720
00:56:55,860 --> 00:57:03,740
is at the end of this. This must be a positive thing. Yeah, exactly. For sure. Um, is there

721
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:08,100
a specific, um, place where L mentioned that kind of stuff that really hit you? Like one

722
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:12,680
of her talks or, or on one of the shows or something? I think it was something she tweeted

723
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:16,940
or retweeted where it was like, you know, typical programmer life where it's like, you

724
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:20,620
know, this sucks. I hate programming. This sucks. I hate programming. This sucks. I hate

725
00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:24,340
programming. This sucks. It worked. I love programming. You know, like, like seven lines

726
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:30,540
down. I could totally relate to that. And you know, whoever wrote that, like had to

727
00:57:30,540 --> 00:57:34,780
calculate out the 240 characters going backwards to figure out how many lines they could do

728
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:40,980
to make it, make it meaningful. And it's like, I really, if I could double heart that tweet,

729
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:45,880
that tweet, I totally would have because it's like, I understand the thought behind this.

730
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:50,260
You mentioned when we were chatting a few days ago, um, you mentioned something called

731
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:56,260
the theory of constraints and you got my ears up and I'm very curious about that and I know

732
00:57:56,260 --> 00:58:00,180
nothing about it. So I was wondering, can you give us like a theory, theory of the constraints

733
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:01,180
one Oh one.

734
00:58:01,180 --> 00:58:05,780
Yes. So the, Oh, I love this theory. It's so awesome. Um, so one of the things that's

735
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:09,580
great here is it labels itself as a theory. So if it doesn't work in your world, then

736
00:58:09,580 --> 00:58:14,740
Hey, it was just a theory, right? Right. Um, but the theory of constraints says that for

737
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:20,300
any process that has several steps, right? One of those steps will be the constraint.

738
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:24,020
Okay. And this came out of manufacturing, right? So if you have five different work

739
00:58:24,020 --> 00:58:27,440
centers, right? And the first work center can do five widgets an hour. The second one

740
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:31,740
can do four, the third one can do three, right? And then the last two can each do five, right?

741
00:58:31,740 --> 00:58:36,260
Your constraint is the one that can do three. So you really don't need to worry about the

742
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:40,100
other ones because the only constraint in the system is the one that can do three. But

743
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:46,720
if you have local, um, measurements on each of those, um, work resources, right? You're

744
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:49,420
going to encourage the guys that can do five to do five. You're going to encourage the

745
00:58:49,420 --> 00:58:53,620
guy that can do four to do four. And, and then the guy that does three is sitting there

746
00:58:53,620 --> 00:58:57,980
and they've got a whole bunch of back, you know, back stock, right? Or backlog sitting

747
00:58:57,980 --> 00:59:03,780
in front of them and they can't do anything about it. Um, because that's, that's their

748
00:59:03,780 --> 00:59:08,540
capacity. So the theory of constraints is kind of like five steps on how to identify

749
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:13,300
that. Um, and then what you can do to protect the constraint and then what you can do to

750
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:17,460
improve the constraint and then how you can continue to repeat that system and go through

751
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:25,500
it. Um, and it was written by, uh, uh, a physicist, right? So, so, you know, take solutions from

752
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:29,620
one discipline and bring them into another, right? So physicists like to look for a common

753
00:59:29,620 --> 00:59:34,420
denominator among things. And so when he was called to do some manufacturing consultant,

754
00:59:34,420 --> 00:59:38,500
he tried to say, well, what's the common denominator in manufacturing? And this is what he came

755
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:44,660
up with. His name was Eliahu Goldrat. Um, and, uh, he's written several books after

756
00:59:44,660 --> 00:59:49,300
that, and it's just been really great. And, and from the project management side, when

757
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:53,980
you can, when your brain's wired to see something as a system, right? When you can identify

758
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:58,060
the constraint and support the constraint and then be able to protect the constraint

759
00:59:58,060 --> 01:00:04,180
and allows that system to be more productive, um, and is really, um, a very, very helpful

760
01:00:04,180 --> 01:00:11,420
tool to use. I also wondered for you how that got applied in your personal life, even cause,

761
01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:16,380
cause you know, you and I both have minds that are wired to see our lives as systems.

762
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:20,020
And so I imagine it carried over for you. So what happened by accident the first time

763
01:00:20,020 --> 01:00:24,260
those 24 semester hours in college was B and I didn't know about the theory of constraints

764
01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:29,380
in my, in my undergrad work, but, uh, it came about because I realized that I was spending

765
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:34,860
most of my time doing research. And so it was like, okay, well how can I, how can I

766
01:00:34,860 --> 01:00:39,660
make my research, uh, I can, I can keep it the constraint, but I can maximize the output

767
01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:43,880
of that constraint. And so what I did is I figured out that you can hack college by taking

768
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:50,220
complimentary classes. So you can do a full semester where you're doing, um, you know,

769
01:00:50,220 --> 01:00:54,100
international business, uh, and learning the communication styles. You need to be successful

770
01:00:54,100 --> 01:00:58,460
there and combine that with your English class. So you can take your English 201 or whatever

771
01:00:58,460 --> 01:01:02,220
the case may be, and you can combine that with a public speaking class and you can combine

772
01:01:02,220 --> 01:01:05,600
that with a rhetoric class, right? And then you can throw your math class in there for

773
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:08,660
good measure. So that way you're not, you know, falling behind on what you should be

774
01:01:08,660 --> 01:01:13,100
working on. But, but when you, when you combined all of that stuff and then there were a few

775
01:01:13,100 --> 01:01:16,140
other classes I took on the, on the side as well. But when you combine all that stuff,

776
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:20,380
what's beautiful about that is you can take the research from one discipline and one class

777
01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:24,500
and bring that as a source into another one. So you're still writing five, six, seven different

778
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:25,500
papers, right?

779
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:28,420
But there's clearly an overlap between them, right?

780
01:01:28,420 --> 01:01:29,420
Yes.

781
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:33,260
And it, it allows you to leverage that going forward. And so when we take a look at our

782
01:01:33,260 --> 01:01:39,540
lives and we say, okay, well where's my constraint, right? So I don't like not being able to learn.

783
01:01:39,540 --> 01:01:45,020
I'm a lifelong learner, right? My commute's a half hour. And so I listen to podcasts and

784
01:01:45,020 --> 01:01:49,860
I listen to audio books because now that half hour is not constraining me from learning.

785
01:01:49,860 --> 01:01:54,020
I'm learning, I've been learning so much recently I've had to turn it off and just have quiet

786
01:01:54,020 --> 01:01:58,260
on the way home for about 10 minutes. Um, and it wasn't because of stress, it was because

787
01:01:58,260 --> 01:02:02,620
I need to absorb and, and get that into my head. So there's different ways of doing that.

788
01:02:02,620 --> 01:02:06,540
When you're, look at your system and your photography workflow and figure out, Hey,

789
01:02:06,540 --> 01:02:12,420
where's my constraint and, and what does that look like? And you don't want to remove it.

790
01:02:12,420 --> 01:02:16,500
You want to hack it. You want to make it more powerful. If it's really bad, yes, you can

791
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:20,020
absolutely re you know, like adjust it so it's no longer the constraint, but then you

792
01:02:20,020 --> 01:02:24,180
have to go looking for it again. So sometimes it's valuable just to, Hey, let's leave this

793
01:02:24,180 --> 01:02:28,540
be the constraint, but both the workflow around it and figure out how to, how to make things

794
01:02:28,540 --> 01:02:29,540
better.

795
01:02:29,540 --> 01:02:36,060
Yeah. I like how one of the aspects you mentioned in that process is to protect the constraint.

796
01:02:36,060 --> 01:02:40,140
And that feels like, Oh wait, we always want to like break down the things that aren't

797
01:02:40,140 --> 01:02:45,860
working or like get rid of them like you were saying, but, but that protection piece feels

798
01:02:45,860 --> 01:02:48,820
really meaningful. So I'm going to have to dive into that.

799
01:02:48,820 --> 01:02:52,420
Well in a lot of the audience will be familiar with Kanban boards and what you need to recognize

800
01:02:52,420 --> 01:02:56,940
when you're using a Kanban board is you are protecting the constraint because you're letting

801
01:02:56,940 --> 01:03:02,860
the constraint not be distracted by having to give a status update, right? And so because

802
01:03:02,860 --> 01:03:06,140
somebody can walk up to the board, right? Whether it's digital or physical, it doesn't

803
01:03:06,140 --> 01:03:10,300
matter. They can walk up to the board and they can see what is currently going on and

804
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:13,860
what the status is. So as long as your users are disciplined, as long as your resources

805
01:03:13,860 --> 01:03:18,420
are disciplined to update the board, you know, and that becomes accurate, then you're protecting

806
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:23,500
the constraint. And, and one of the ways that you can use to explain that to them, cause

807
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:27,540
they'll grok it pretty quickly is if, cause some people are like, I just get worked on,

808
01:03:27,540 --> 01:03:31,380
just leave me alone. I just get worked on. No, no, no. I need you to not only get the

809
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:35,860
work done, I need you to just do this little thing, little admin thing every, you know,

810
01:03:35,860 --> 01:03:39,800
sometimes hourly, right? But more often, you know, once or twice a day to let people know

811
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:44,500
where things are at and reset yourself. And I do that with my boss right now. It's like

812
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:48,180
I showed up and I had a different tool set in mind than he did. And I said, look, dude,

813
01:03:48,180 --> 01:03:51,140
I said, I'm going to put my tool set over here and you're going to have visibility to

814
01:03:51,140 --> 01:03:54,180
it all the time. You're not going to have to wonder what I'm doing. It's going to be

815
01:03:54,180 --> 01:03:58,200
right here. And, and he's been learning how to use the tool and be able to see what's

816
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:01,320
on my plate and be able to say, Hey, this has been sitting there for a while. You know,

817
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:04,460
we can have that dialogue now. So it's been helpful.

818
01:04:04,460 --> 01:04:11,780
Wow. That's an amazing tool. I am very jazzed to integrate it into my own pieces. So thank

819
01:04:11,780 --> 01:04:17,860
you for sharing that. It's awesome. Uh, I wondered, uh, Jacob, if you, if there's anything

820
01:04:17,860 --> 01:04:24,100
that you wanted to share with the community, uh, kind of an ask something you maybe want

821
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:28,920
them to try or think about there's, there's two things here. One's selfless and one is

822
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:34,140
selfish or self-interested. Oh, I like this. Okay. So, so the first one is to, to tie off

823
01:04:34,140 --> 01:04:39,180
with your interview with wimpy about poo pooing out other people and their projects. And,

824
01:04:39,180 --> 01:04:43,900
and mine's, mine's just a little different twist is whether you're a user or a consumer

825
01:04:43,900 --> 01:04:51,140
or producer in that space, uh, take the time to be grateful for what it is. Um, you know,

826
01:04:51,140 --> 01:04:56,700
and maybe that means disconnecting first to really think through what that is. We're using

827
01:04:56,700 --> 01:05:03,860
code, right? That's 20, 50, 30 years old, right? Have we ever bothered to say thank

828
01:05:03,860 --> 01:05:08,980
you, right? The, the guy who invented bash, I heard an interview he did. I, what a totally

829
01:05:08,980 --> 01:05:15,380
realistic story. He invented globbing before he invented quotes. And I'm, I don't know

830
01:05:15,380 --> 01:05:19,300
if too many people under there's a part of the audience that gets that right off me saying

831
01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:26,380
that, but, but what that means is that he sat there and he, as he was welding out bash,

832
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:30,700
he figured out how to do that. You know, asterisk, you know, delete asterisk, everything, right?

833
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:35,940
You know, type of thing, right? So he was, he was working. And so on, on making sure

834
01:05:35,940 --> 01:05:39,860
you can use the asterisk and it would delete all the things. And as he was doing that,

835
01:05:39,860 --> 01:05:45,420
he, he decided to delete all the working files that he had in a particular directory. So

836
01:05:45,420 --> 01:05:49,980
we put that particular directory or a particular thing in quotes and ended up deleting everything

837
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:55,820
on the system and had to start over and rewrite bash. That's one way to learn. And I think,

838
01:05:55,820 --> 01:05:59,980
I think bash is better because of it. But when you realize that there's a human story

839
01:05:59,980 --> 01:06:03,220
behind it, oh my goodness, doesn't it make it easier to just say thank you for sticking

840
01:06:03,220 --> 01:06:08,140
it out and finishing that, you know, thank you guys for sticking it out and finishing

841
01:06:08,140 --> 01:06:11,820
that. Even if I may not be using it right now, cause it may not be how I want to express

842
01:06:11,820 --> 01:06:17,020
myself. Pause, take a moment and say thank you to somebody, handwritten card, a post

843
01:06:17,020 --> 01:06:22,260
on Twitter. So pick your favorite host, pick your favorite, you know, tool and, and find

844
01:06:22,260 --> 01:06:28,020
a way to tell the person thank you in a way that, that just lets them know you, you cared.

845
01:06:28,020 --> 01:06:34,020
And so that's the selfless task that's out there. And the other one is, is, you know,

846
01:06:34,020 --> 01:06:38,260
I guess that my blog is really unpopular. I wonder what it would be like if it were

847
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:45,020
popular. So tell us a little bit what it's about, what you put down there, how you're

848
01:06:45,020 --> 01:06:49,020
dedicated to it and what you'd like people to get out of it. So I've never been able

849
01:06:49,020 --> 01:06:52,820
to run an agile project. The military runs waterfall. The projects have been on a worker

850
01:06:52,820 --> 01:06:58,660
waterfall oriented and I wanted to try something that was completely agile. And so listening

851
01:06:58,660 --> 01:07:03,120
again, the Ubuntu podcast was influential in this where I think it was a Popey was saying

852
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:07,500
that he would just do a Twitter kind of audio feed and then send that out or not Twitter.

853
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:12,060
It was over a telegram. He's just telegram feed. And I was like, wow, that's like podcast

854
01:07:12,060 --> 01:07:16,780
MVP. Like I've got an iPhone. I'm just going to go ahead and start recording something

855
01:07:16,780 --> 01:07:21,020
to call the podcast. And, and so I've been adding every week or every two weeks, I will

856
01:07:21,020 --> 01:07:24,660
change the workflow cause I'll look at my constraint and I'll change the workflow one

857
01:07:24,660 --> 01:07:28,900
or two steps. And I'm getting close now where it's like, okay, once I've got episode numbers,

858
01:07:28,900 --> 01:07:33,540
this thing's legit and it's happening. And I think I'm about a week away. And that's

859
01:07:33,540 --> 01:07:36,340
been another thing too, is like as first is just, I'm just going to talk, we'll figure

860
01:07:36,340 --> 01:07:41,220
out what the topic is later. And where I've landed over the last couple of weeks is taking

861
01:07:41,220 --> 01:07:46,140
curiosity and gratitude and taking a look at the people and systems in our lives that,

862
01:07:46,140 --> 01:07:50,740
that make a difference. There are about five minutes and it sometimes gets real nerdy and

863
01:07:50,740 --> 01:07:56,580
weird. Like, like there's, Oh my goodness. What was it yesterday? This might not make

864
01:07:56,580 --> 01:08:03,180
it a family show. We'll find out. But, um, synonymous words don't equate to the same

865
01:08:03,180 --> 01:08:10,700
thing. Okay. Okay. Um, and if you understand English as a system, right, then this becomes

866
01:08:10,700 --> 01:08:16,340
really cool. So English is a system and I like exploring English. So, but dial, right?

867
01:08:16,340 --> 01:08:21,220
Okay. It means that your phone made a call now, but, and booty are synonymous, right?

868
01:08:21,220 --> 01:08:28,180
Your button, your booty are the same thing. I see where this is. All right. Continue.

869
01:08:28,180 --> 01:08:34,860
And dial and call, right? Are synonymous words as well. But dial is not booty call. Right?

870
01:08:34,860 --> 01:08:43,100
Right. One may lead to the other. Well, yeah. Yeah. I didn't take it that way in the episode

871
01:08:43,100 --> 01:08:48,740
when I recorded it, but you're not wrong. Um, one of the things that does for us though,

872
01:08:48,740 --> 01:08:52,220
and I like to point this out in the show is it means that even though you may be using

873
01:08:52,220 --> 01:08:57,420
synonymous language, right? You may not be conveying the same message. And so let's stop

874
01:08:57,420 --> 01:09:00,620
and take a look at what is the language we're using? When are we understood and when are

875
01:09:00,620 --> 01:09:03,620
we not understood? So that way we can be more productive. And that's kind of the way I take

876
01:09:03,620 --> 01:09:07,980
it is, you know, find something that I enjoy a little bit curious about and obscure and

877
01:09:07,980 --> 01:09:12,540
then, and then pull that together and, and, uh, having fun. So, so I did my challenge

878
01:09:12,540 --> 01:09:17,060
on this. I challenged the user error guys. What is the most useless job that you would

879
01:09:17,060 --> 01:09:21,900
be willing to do? Oh, interesting. Right? So most useless job that you'd be willing

880
01:09:21,900 --> 01:09:25,780
to do. And mine is absolutely really fun. So I'll tell you mine while you think of yours,

881
01:09:25,780 --> 01:09:31,840
Brent. So most useless job that you'd be willing to do. And mine is, uh, you know, from having

882
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:35,380
worked for the government, I know they're pretty ineffective and ineffectual. And so

883
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:41,100
they, they create a lot of jobs that I consider useless or not value add. And, um, so you

884
01:09:41,100 --> 01:09:45,860
have to find a position where one of those jobs that are created by requirement, you

885
01:09:45,860 --> 01:09:48,340
know, there's not actually the requirement on the ground. And so what I came up with

886
01:09:48,340 --> 01:09:55,280
was I would love to be a lifeguard at the Olympics, totally useless. And then as I was

887
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:58,520
talking on the show and recording and I was like, oh my goodness, this is the greatest

888
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:03,860
reality TV show ever. If the Olympics goes to Los Angeles and I think it might be scheduled

889
01:10:03,860 --> 01:10:07,500
to, if the Olympics is going to Los Angeles, somebody should create a reality TV show where

890
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:12,500
they get people to compete for being lifeguards. Right. And then at the end of it, help them

891
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:16,020
realize that it's the most useless job ever. Right. Cause you'd be this great competition,

892
01:10:16,020 --> 01:10:19,060
like these really buff, you know, strong guys. And then at the end of it, you'd be like,

893
01:10:19,060 --> 01:10:21,540
Hey, by the way, you're just going to sit there for eight hours a day while you're watching

894
01:10:21,540 --> 01:10:29,740
Michael Phelps. It could be worse. Oh yeah. That wasn't the question, right? The question

895
01:10:29,740 --> 01:10:33,780
is the most useless job you'd be willing to do. So right. Do you have, do you have

896
01:10:33,780 --> 01:10:38,500
a most useless job that you'd be willing to do in the same kind of vein as yours? I would

897
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:44,000
be willing to do something where I get to observe people. Uh, I think connecting with

898
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:51,900
people, uh, is super powerful. So maybe it would be like, I don't know, something like

899
01:10:51,900 --> 01:10:56,440
greeting the greeters at Walmart or something like that, you know, uh, where I can just

900
01:10:56,440 --> 01:11:03,260
like watch people and their behaviors and just kind of enjoy life and people's lives

901
01:11:03,260 --> 01:11:06,180
for what they are. I think something like that would be pretty interesting.

902
01:11:06,180 --> 01:11:11,060
So yours is actually trying to add value. You're so wired that way, Brent. That's, that,

903
01:11:11,060 --> 01:11:17,700
that is awesome. No, it tells you something about your personality. You are wired to connect

904
01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:23,180
with people and, and you really do a good job. And that is one of the reasons, um, for

905
01:11:23,180 --> 01:11:28,260
those who, who aren't quite aware, this is the first time at this large of an audience

906
01:11:28,260 --> 01:11:31,740
that I've ever really talked about some of the things I've dealt with in my past. And

907
01:11:31,740 --> 01:11:35,020
one of the reasons for that is because of the way that the, the, the way that you, as

908
01:11:35,020 --> 01:11:39,980
a host connect with the audience and connect with your, your guests. Um, and it's, this

909
01:11:39,980 --> 01:11:42,500
has felt really comfortable and I really appreciate it.

910
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:48,780
Awesome. Well, I feel so completely honored to help you tell that story. Uh, I feel like

911
01:11:48,780 --> 01:11:55,580
it has been obviously a super important story for you, uh, with massive growth in it and

912
01:11:55,580 --> 01:12:02,380
vulnerability, of course. Uh, and to see where you are now, uh, you're still taking those

913
01:12:02,380 --> 01:12:07,100
experiences you've had and giving gifts to the people around you, which is really powerful.

914
01:12:07,100 --> 01:12:13,740
And so if I could have some way of helping you spread that message, I feel like, uh,

915
01:12:13,740 --> 01:12:18,700
I feel like that's a total honor. So thank you for reaching out to me with it. That's,

916
01:12:18,700 --> 01:12:24,060
that's huge. If people want to get connected with you to say thanks, since you put that,

917
01:12:24,060 --> 01:12:26,700
that challenge out there, where, where do you think you would send them?

918
01:12:26,700 --> 01:12:31,660
Well, the blog podcast YouTube channel thing is all parking thought.com, right? So the

919
01:12:31,660 --> 01:12:35,360
idea is I take my drive out or I take my thoughts out for a bit of a drive and then I share

920
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:40,140
them with you when I park. Um, it's a one take sort of deal. It's going to stay a one

921
01:12:40,140 --> 01:12:44,540
take sort of deal. Um, and it's honestly my morning coffee. Well, I don't drink coffee,

922
01:12:44,540 --> 01:12:48,900
but it's kind of like my morning coffee because it gets me starting to practice communicating

923
01:12:48,900 --> 01:12:53,540
before I go into work a lot of times. And so that, that helps me prepare for the day

924
01:12:53,540 --> 01:12:58,820
and gives me a frame to think through. So, yeah, so you're welcome to find me there.

925
01:12:58,820 --> 01:13:00,860
Twitter is on there as well.

926
01:13:00,860 --> 01:13:06,140
Right. We'll find all the goods there. That's amazing. Uh, Jacob, thank you so much for

927
01:13:06,140 --> 01:13:11,820
this chat. It's been a huge pleasure. Uh, thank you for your time connecting. And, uh,

928
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:16,180
I definitely hope that we get to connect in person at some point, uh, maybe for some fries

929
01:13:16,180 --> 01:13:28,900
or something like that.
