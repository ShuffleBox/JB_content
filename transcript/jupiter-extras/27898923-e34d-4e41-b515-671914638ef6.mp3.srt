00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,360
Hi, everyone. Welcome to Brunch with Brent. It's my pleasure to be joined today by Brennan

2
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,360
Bruce. Brennan, how you doing?

3
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,600
I'm doing all right. Today's going pretty well.

4
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:28,640
Yeah, well, that's good to hear. We got connected by a few friends of ours in the Jupiter broadcasting

5
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,360
network, because you're the director of customer support at Linux Academy.

6
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,080
Correct.

7
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:42,000
And I would imagine that holds quite a bit of responsibilities. At least the title sounds like

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,720
it does.

9
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:53,440
Yeah. Right now the team is seven people. I have two in Australia, one in Tennessee,

10
00:00:53,440 --> 00:01:01,120
and then the rest are all in Texas with me. And we manage all the day-to-day operations

11
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,800
for the support team for Linux Academy.

12
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:09,680
Nice. I would imagine every single day is a little bit different for your team. That's

13
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,200
kind of the nature of support, isn't it?

14
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:17,840
Oh, it's a very reactive, so grab bag is probably the best description of the problems we see.

15
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:24,400
I would imagine there's some repetition, but yeah, you just like all sorts of stuff. And

16
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,040
so are you dealing with customers directly or is it internal support? Is it a little

17
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,080
bit of both?

18
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:37,520
So up until roughly two weeks ago, we handled both internal and external support. The internal

19
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:44,880
support just got moved over to an IT operations team. So we are getting used to having nothing

20
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,080
but external now.

21
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:51,280
Right. So a little bit of relief there, but at least it allows you to concentrate your

22
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:57,040
time a little bit because you've got a little bit of two worlds. You've got a crew of people

23
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,400
face-to-face with you where you're located, it sounds like, and also some remote staff.

24
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:07,040
Is it kind of a completely different dynamic working with those or is it working out pretty

25
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,400
well? How does that work?

26
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:14,240
So everyone technically works remote. We have an office here in San Antonio that we go into

27
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:19,920
twice a week, just to kind of see each other and have some face time. But for the most

28
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:26,000
part, we all work remote. So I've gotten used to nothing but Slack calls and Zoom calls

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,840
in order to talk to people.

30
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:36,080
And how is that for you? Is that a nice rhythm or would you prefer a little bit more time?

31
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,560
Because I know many of us in the industry, we're doing a lot of remote time now, but

32
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,560
there are some challenges that come with that too.

33
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,920
It's weird. I've had this discussion with other people and I've found that remote work

34
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:53,120
for people in a transactional business like support, where I get a ticket, I work the

35
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,880
ticket, I go to the next one. Remote is perfect for them, assuming everybody has a work ethic.

36
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:04,080
That's got to be announced up front. But for people in that transactional setting, they

37
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:11,680
tend to manage themselves very closely because they're afraid, subconsciously, consciously,

38
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:17,120
that they're going to lose that privilege of working from home if they slack off. So

39
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,000
they're always hustling. Whereas when you have people who are project based and you

40
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,200
say, all right, you've got three months to finish this. Well, they may slack off for

41
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,520
two months because, hey, as long as I get it done by the third month, we're all good.

42
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:38,160
So these like micro projects seem to lend well to that remote stuff. And it sounds

43
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:43,840
to me like being part of a team is likely a really big part of that because you want to

44
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,560
make sure that you're doing well for your team as well, that you're not letting anybody

45
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,240
down or forcing some work on someone else. If you've got the right team around you, that

46
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:56,720
sounds like a pretty powerful environment. Yeah, I kind of describe it as an oligarchy.

47
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:02,080
You know, I make all the final calls, but realistically, it's very democratic because

48
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,640
if they don't like it, they're not going to do it. So I've got to make sure that it's

49
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:13,760
balanced and that they understand any of the choices I make for the team. They understand

50
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:18,400
the benefit, the cost and the benefit for it. So you may not like it, but hey, this

51
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:23,600
is the payoff if you stick with it. Has anyone joined your team who has never done remote

52
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,800
before? Like, is there some mentorship that happens there or some kind of adjustments

53
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:36,560
for someone like that? Three of my employees came from another large hosting provider here

54
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:44,480
in San Antonio. And for the most part, they worked in a major office. So for them, they

55
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:48,800
were ready to be at home. They were ready to have some of that freedom back because

56
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,320
they already knew they could do the work. They just hated having to deal with some of

57
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,320
the people that they dealt with on a day to day. And it's not to say they were asocial

58
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:01,760
or didn't want to be around people. They're actually great people people. But you have

59
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:07,680
those that that office feeling where you wonder, is somebody standing right next to me? Are

60
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,960
they gonna come bother me? Do they want to talk to me? Because I've got work to do.

61
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:16,960
You know, I can totally relate to that because I'm a photographer primarily. And so I'm

62
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,360
working from home all the time. Well, I say from home, but I'm always traveling. And so

63
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:27,840
the home ends up being wherever I am. But but a home base, right? That's away from a

64
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:34,720
standard sort of large office. And the reason I I'm asking those questions is it's such a

65
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:40,640
curious thing to me, like, I've lived in that world quite a lot and have had to learn how

66
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:47,680
to do it myself. And, you know, I've tripped along the way. And, and yet, I've heard repeatedly

67
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,440
from, you know, employees who are used to the sort of corporate environment like that,

68
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:56,880
how, once you figure out how to be, you know, consistently productive, on your own, that

69
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:02,640
freedom can just increase productivity and happiness and that sense of flexibility to

70
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:09,040
is sounds really essential. Yeah, I mean, my background was actually as a cook and chef

71
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:17,760
for almost two decades before I ever got into tech. Nice. And management, aside from managing

72
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:26,640
kitchens, which is another animal all unto itself, I'd never been in a full on corporate

73
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:34,720
style management role. So I had to teach myself analytics. I'd never done it. I've done like

74
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:41,520
cost benefit stuff for like inventory control, but never gone, okay, I need to find metrics

75
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,400
that show that my employees are doing a good job. What metrics are important? How do we

76
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:52,480
know what is good? What is bad? What's good data, bad data? Those were questions I never

77
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:59,120
had to ask before. And if I were in a corporate setting, and all the floundering I went through

78
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:05,360
trying to figure it out, I would have looked like an idiot. But being able to hide in my,

79
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,240
you know, living room, and figure this out in the middle of the night, because that's

80
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:15,600
when I decided I was going to work on it. It was it was easy. It was more of a comfortable

81
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:22,960
experience. Do you feel like sometimes working when you're your most optimal, or at least

82
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:28,720
when, you know, an idea really grabs you, and you can just dive into it? Do you feel

83
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:35,600
like that's an advantage as well? Oh, absolutely. It actually helps a lot with having a worldwide

84
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:41,040
team. You know, like I said, I have two guys in Australia who work for me. And that's because

85
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:46,480
for them, what is a daytime shift is overnight for us. So I end up getting close to like

86
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:52,560
a 24 seven coverage without having to have, you know, somebody up in the middle of the

87
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,960
night. Oh, that's nice. But having to get used to the fact that I was going to have

88
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:04,320
to meet with them at a time that was comparable for both of both parties took some getting

89
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:08,160
used to. But I was like, hey, this is great, though, because I can say, all right, today's

90
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:13,920
gonna be the day where I can go out and go shopping at noon, because I'm going to be

91
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:19,840
working until midnight. So I'll just shift my hours around. And having that flexibility

92
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:25,440
is tremendous when you need to be able to think on your feet, and the world doesn't

93
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:33,040
revolve around the nine to five schedule. Yeah, I could see how from the business perspective,

94
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:39,840
that sort of flexibility in support is like, totally essential that that 24 hour cycle

95
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:45,360
I hadn't even thought of because we sort of think in these, you know, eight hour or more

96
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,320
max 12 hour cycles. But yeah, I could see how having someone sort of on hand at any

97
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,440
time, especially with a, you know, how Linux Academy is is such a sort of web based business

98
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,080
wherever anybody can join from anywhere at any time, I could see how that would really

99
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,920
be quite essential. It's fascinating. I just, you know, we're talking about analytics, I

100
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:10,640
just got into using like Google Analytics to track our it's basically our FAQ page.

101
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:16,160
It's, we use Zendesk. So it's called a knowledge base. But I wanted to track which ones were

102
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:21,760
most popular to see, you know, where, where we could do better and where we are doing

103
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:27,680
the best. And got into messing with Google Analytics, having never messed with it before.

104
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:35,360
And I was shocked at how much information was in there. And found that while our student

105
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:44,960
base is primarily North American, so, excluding Mexico, so Canada and the United States are

106
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:54,720
combined, I think 67 68% of our student base. And the rest tends to be centered around

107
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:04,400
around India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia. So the Middle Eastern countries have

108
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:08,960
another good like 27%. I thought, okay, so that's what I should see when I look at the

109
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:15,520
analytics. But looking at our FAQ pages, I found that it was almost inverted. The people

110
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:21,200
in North America aren't going to the FAQ pages at all. But those in the Middle East are pouring

111
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:27,600
over pages. Like I was able to track one guy who went through and read almost 60 articles

112
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,520
that we'd written. Nothing that had anything to do with each other, just reading articles.

113
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,160
That's fascinating.

114
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,480
Yeah, I was like, wow, I would have thought it would be, you know, where we have the most

115
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:44,480
people. That's where the most people are going to our FAQ. No, it's the inverse. The other

116
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,160
group really wants to know a lot. And they'll just sit there and read.

117
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:56,720
Wow. Do you feel like that speaks a little bit to like, learning culture in different

118
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:04,560
places in the world? Because I, you know, what you've just described is also the opposite of

119
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,880
what I would have thought. Like, it almost tells a story that you could have never imagined unless

120
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:15,360
you had that data, which I suppose, shows the strength of data. But you think it's a cultural,

121
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:22,240
like a learning culture difference? Or maybe, I don't know. What do you think? Any theories?

122
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:29,200
So I haven't got enough data to prove my hypothesis. But the best one I've come up with

123
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:34,240
is that if you know English as a second language or a third or fourth language,

124
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:41,440
it is easier for you to go and read it and be able to look up the words that you don't know

125
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:48,400
in English. Then it is for you to try and play with it and figure it out in a system that's

126
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:54,640
written in English. If you go on and try and mess with a new program and all the buttons are in

127
00:11:54,640 --> 00:12:02,480
English, or in this case for us, let's say they're in Flemish and you don't speak Flemish. So you're

128
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,280
looking at going, okay, I don't know what that is. I might be able to figure that that means stop

129
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:16,000
because it's red. But this company has written articles about their program. And if you go sit

130
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,880
there and learn Flemish and try and translate as you go, you can learn it. That's the only thing

131
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:28,480
I've come up with so far, that and possibly that it's just a different culture that they are

132
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:35,200
accustomed to going and reading in order to understand. Whereas in the more Western cultures,

133
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:42,080
we have a quicker need to get the information. If I don't get it in a couple of clicks, I'm not

134
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:47,280
messing with it. I think you're onto something though with that theory because when you put it

135
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:51,680
in the perspective of flipping the coin and playing with a tool that's in a completely

136
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:59,120
different language, it sounds to me almost like learning what I'll call offline. So not in a live

137
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:06,160
environment so that you can sort of spend the time slowly understanding all of the concepts before

138
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:12,720
you dive into the actual, you know, nitty gritty of doing it. That would make a lot of sense to me

139
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:19,520
from the perspective of confidence, especially if it's a different language, right? You can wrap

140
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:24,640
your head around a whole lot of concepts and the whole thing before you sort of dive in and poke

141
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:29,440
around. So I think you're onto something there. One of the other big things we found out with

142
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:37,920
this was we started mapping what pages people are going to the most. And we found that on a monthly

143
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:45,760
basis, the most popular was one on how to connect to our hands-on labs. And I thought, well, why is

144
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:50,880
that? I mean, there are directions at every lab that tell you how to do it. Why do they need to

145
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:56,240
come read this? And I mean, and we're talking like a magnitude of difference. Like in December,

146
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:03,360
9,000 unique people and unique IP addresses went and read the article that we had written

147
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:10,880
in support on how to connect to hands-on labs. And the next closest thing was, it was like a

148
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:16,960
description, a comparison between what a cloud playground is and what cloud servers are. And

149
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:23,760
it went from 9,000 for connecting to like 3,000. So three times less.

150
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:24,800
Wow.

151
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:32,240
And I was like, that's huge. Why is that? And I go and look at how the interface was written.

152
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:38,880
So if you go to a lab, how the directions are written there are, if you are unfamiliar with

153
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:47,200
how to use things like say SSH or PuTTY, they're confusing. But you go to our article in the support

154
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:52,080
FAQ, and we've got like diagrams and pictures and a step-by-step walkthrough. And I was like,

155
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:56,400
well, that explains it. If you're brand new and you don't understand, and somebody is already

156
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:01,360
making a leap of logic for you saying, oh, you should know this before you start. Yeah, you're

157
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,680
going to go read another article on it. It's almost like the data is telling you a whole

158
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:14,560
bunch of stories. How could that not be helpful for you and your team to create better experiences

159
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:21,680
for the end user? It sounds like it allows you almost to empathize with the person on the other

160
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,000
end. Does that feel accurate?

161
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:31,440
I am a very numbers-driven, data-driven person, even though I didn't understand it until I had

162
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:38,240
the tools. And I started seeing parts of my personality really come out as I dug deeper

163
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,640
into stuff. And I was like, this is what I need to know. I have always wanted to understand,

164
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:50,320
but I didn't have the knowledge on how to collect data. And now I can sit here and go, okay,

165
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:57,680
I feel that it should be this way. Let me see if the logic backs it up. It makes a world of

166
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:02,480
difference, especially when you're talking about solving people's day-to-day problems,

167
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:08,560
if you can understand where they're coming from first and why they have the problem in the first

168
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:19,120
place. Because it is a flaw of working in support that eventually you get to, I wouldn't say a jaded

169
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:26,480
place, but more of a callous place. You've built up a reaction to seeing a similar question over

170
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,480
and over. So you just get to a point where like, okay, these people just don't know what they're

171
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:36,720
doing. Is it that they don't know what they're doing or did you not teach them? Where is the

172
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:44,080
real failing? Yeah. Interesting. I feel like the data that you're diving into is telling you a

173
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:53,520
story that's actually sort of leading you to some hints at human nature almost. So it's curious to

174
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:57,200
me those two worlds because the data-driven world, you know, usually is super technical and stuff

175
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:01,680
like that. But that's actually allowing you to see sort of the human element of it all,

176
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:09,520
which is fascinating. And like the example you just gave in those sort of calloused perspectives,

177
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:17,120
if you've spent that much time and support, I could see how seeing it from the other side and

178
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:22,240
just asking different questions with that data behind you would allow for quite a powerful

179
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,880
transformation in the approach that you take there. So that's really fascinating to me.

180
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:32,000
Okay. So you said you do photography. I would compare it to trying to explain shutter speed.

181
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:37,360
For you, I'm sure the idea of like, hey, if you leave the aperture open longer, yeah,

182
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:43,600
you're going to overexpose the film. That just seems logical to you. But to somebody who's never

183
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:48,000
messed with a camera and only knows if I click this button, it should do something, the idea

184
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:55,360
of aperture is a huge thing. I had no idea that the film stayed exposed and the lens stayed open

185
00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:00,640
longer. And if you grew up with only digital cameras, that idea is completely lost.

186
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:06,560
It's a good example because, you know, often as professionals or people who've spent, you know,

187
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:13,200
countless hours on a certain technology or in this example on learning cameras and stuff, like

188
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:20,240
for me, I don't even consciously think about using my camera anymore. It just sort of happens

189
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:26,800
subconsciously. And the same is true of technology, right? Like for those of us who have spent years

190
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:32,800
doing deep dives and learning this and are curious about it, some of those simpler concepts can often

191
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:39,840
get lost because, you know, we're not beginners anymore. So in your position and your team's

192
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:45,520
position, having that, trying to maintain some sort of empathy for that beginner or someone

193
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:51,040
who's new to a platform, that sounds pretty essential almost. It's funny, the more we talk

194
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:58,240
about this, I think back to how I got started really diving into customer issues and the way

195
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:05,360
that they see problems. And I actually wrote a talk on it to try and put in words what I was

196
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:11,520
thinking. It was a bit tongue-in-cheek. It was called How to Train Your Customer. This is the

197
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:17,680
talk you gave at B-Sides in San Antonio, right? Yes. Were you there? I didn't, but I did get to

198
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:22,960
see it. So I got to appreciate that sort of tongue-in-cheek approach that you take. Oh,

199
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,280
yeah. No, I'm glad because now I don't have to like fully explain everything. You get some of

200
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:34,560
the reference points, but you do. You see, regardless of what problem they're bringing to you,

201
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:41,440
you'll see these marked approaches on how the problem is presented. You have people who will

202
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:49,600
just go, your site is slow. How do you know it's slow? What are you comparing it to? What does slow

203
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:56,080
mean? Yeah. All these questions that come up as a support person, they don't occur to the person

204
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:02,320
on the other side. They're just frustrated and they go, site is slow. I am mad. So you have to

205
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:07,600
train them in the way in which you respond. Now, if you do what every single support person has

206
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:13,840
done for years now and gone, you need to clear your cache and cookies, try resetting your router.

207
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:21,440
It's got to be your Wi-Fi. Those cookie cutter responses, people become numb to them. So they'll

208
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:27,520
start responding back. And that's what I noticed is that people will pay attention to troubleshooting

209
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:34,080
methods you use so that they can have validation that the problem is you. Well, what if you could

210
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:42,400
turn that around? What if, hey, by the way, I was troubleshooting your problem and here are the

211
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:51,920
tests I ran. I ran an S-trace on my own machine to see how fast things are. Here are my ping tests,

212
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:57,280
you know, whatever it was. And you show them those steps, would they start giving you that

213
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:04,160
data back? And we did a small test within our support team and found that on about 20% of the

214
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:10,160
time, they did. These repeat people that we found would start using these tests as if they were

215
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:15,040
trying to show us off, you know, show us up and go, ah, it's still you. Look, I did it this time.

216
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:21,200
I did these tests. I'm like, cool. So this does work. We can start training people to give us

217
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:29,120
better data. What I gather from that story is almost that support, or at least good support,

218
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:35,920
is sort of a team effort between you and the person, you know, with the complaint or the

219
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:42,080
support issue. And though they may not see it that way, you have to try to convince them somehow,

220
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:47,120
maybe with a few different types of approaches that that's actually the case because everyone

221
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:53,280
wants a positive outcome, right? But it sounds like there's, depending on the person and the

222
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,440
issue, there's a whole bunch of different ways to achieve that. Yeah. I mean, you're always going to

223
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:04,880
have people who just want something for free. Those people exist. That's a real thing. Okay.

224
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,520
But the way people view support as being cookie cutter in their responses,

225
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,840
support has become cookie cutter in the way they view the people coming in. They assume

226
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:18,720
everybody's out for something free. Well, they're not. But they don't know how else to get your

227
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:24,400
attention if they don't go for the grandiose because we've become numb. We've become this

228
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:30,080
self-insulating group who are like, we've got to protect ourselves because you don't know how hard

229
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:34,640
it is to do this day in and day out. You're right. But you kind of did it to yourself too.

230
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:39,600
And the only way to fix it is to change your behavior so they learn how to behave differently.

231
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,280
And then we can all start getting along. A weird hippy thought.

232
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:50,400
I like it. I like it. How do you think that support fits into sort of the greater

233
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:56,240
tech realm? Because you've got engineers, you've got coders, you've got all that,

234
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:03,360
so many different types of professions in there. But for you, how do you feel like support fits in?

235
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:10,080
I see support in a unique way. I tell everyone on my team, if I see you on my team

236
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:16,640
after three years, you better be taking my job because this should totally be just the stepping

237
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:24,640
stone. This should not be where you end. And that I think is what has really hurt support in the

238
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:31,360
long run. There are some people who are genuinely good at it and they love doing it. But for the

239
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:36,080
most part, it should be the stepping stone into something larger in tech. It should be that entry

240
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:43,280
level job. Nobody wants to be the front desk guy forever. And if they do, you know it by the way

241
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:47,680
that they come to work and they just glow and they're happy because they found the job for them.

242
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,600
But how many support people do you see that look like they're dead on the inside?

243
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:58,000
And it's because there is a lifespan, a shelf life for support, and it's about two to five years.

244
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,360
So I tell them after three years, if you're not gunning for my job, you need to go. You don't

245
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:10,000
belong here anymore. You should have grown and I failed you somewhere. I want everyone on my

246
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:19,600
support team to feel like they have a path somewhere. If it's in development or, hey,

247
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:24,560
you know what? I just really liked the company, but I didn't have the skills to work in marketing yet.

248
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:30,160
So I took what I could get. Cool. Let's get you working on how marketing works. I don't know

249
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:35,360
anything about it, but let's go find out together. I really like that approach. I would imagine as

250
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:41,280
well for anyone who's sort of aiming a little higher into marketing, for instance, to continue

251
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:48,320
that example, I would imagine being in support gives you a connection to the end user and an

252
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:54,960
understanding of the end user and of the product that maybe you don't necessarily get elsewhere.

253
00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:02,720
And I could see how that might be valuable in the long, long run. Yeah, I see support should always

254
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:11,760
be the megaphone for the company so that they speak for the customer or the student or, you know,

255
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:18,080
the client. Their job is really to go, hey, we have a problem here. What team do I have to reach

256
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:23,440
out to? Okay, I need engineering. Engineering, please understand this part of the site is broken,

257
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:28,960
and we have this many people who are upset about it. Or, hey, marketing, you sent out this email

258
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:35,040
and there were five misspellings in it, and we've got a bunch of tickets where people are upset

259
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:38,320
because you can't spell the company name right or whatever it is.

260
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:43,120
I really like all of those perspectives. So it sounds like you're the right person for being

261
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:50,480
where you are right now. That sounds pretty good. One thing that I wanted to mention quickly on that

262
00:25:50,480 --> 00:26:00,320
topic is, I read recently how Toby Lutke, who is the Shopify CEO, I think a few times a week,

263
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:06,080
just like sits down and takes a few support tickets, which I found fascinating. And I think

264
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:13,040
it's, which I found fascinating because it gives you, you know, of course, he built that business

265
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:18,320
from the ground up. So he's gotten that connection with users previously, but he's continued that

266
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:26,080
throughout. It sounds like having an understanding of sort of the entire scope of an organization,

267
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,920
at least just a little bit, sounds like it's really informative for everybody.

268
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:36,640
We have a small lapse in time from my overnight guys to my morning guys. It's about four hours. So

269
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,000
when I get in in the morning, the first thing I do is I go through the tickets that have not been

270
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,040
sorted yet. And it gives me kind of an idea of what were they seeing last night and what can I

271
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:52,560
expect to see this morning and keep a pulse of what is going on with the day-to-day business.

272
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:56,800
Inevitably gives you some perspective on how everything's going, I would imagine.

273
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:04,560
There have been a lot of, not issues, but like events that we were able to see ahead of time

274
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:09,600
because I was like, all right, you know, I'm sorting this and I've seen the same issue six

275
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:15,600
times. And since I'm not working the issues, I'm not getting the lapse between, I'm just going,

276
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:22,000
okay, this belongs here, that belongs there. You know, I get more of a digest effect. I can go,

277
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:28,560
okay, hey, we've got, you know, in a four hour block of time, eight tickets about this one thing,

278
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,280
what's going on there. And I can start diverting my energy there to start the day.

279
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:38,800
You mentioned a kitchen experience for almost 20 years. I wanted to ask you a little bit about that.

280
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:47,120
I have often been fascinated about sort of the internal workings of kitchens and have read about

281
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:53,440
it a bunch, but haven't actually had that experience. But I'm curious how for you,

282
00:27:54,320 --> 00:28:01,600
are there some skills from that kitchen experience that translated to this new fast paced environment

283
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:12,880
you're in now? Yes. There are a couple of things. One, I don't get the nervousness, the fear

284
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:18,480
that people have in dealing with other people. Oh my, these people might be upset with me. No,

285
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:23,680
I'm sorry. Once somebody's like held knives to you and there's fire around you and hot oil and I

286
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:30,560
could die, the dude from accounting is not going to bother me. But the other thing, the biggest part

287
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:36,160
of it was I got, when I got to Linux Academy, pretty much got to build the support team from

288
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:42,000
the ground up and we got to put it together the way we wanted to see it. And I decided I was going

289
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:48,640
to go with the kitchen brigade style. And in that, everybody who comes in starts at the bottom.

290
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:55,440
No matter what, you start as a dishwasher or a fry cook and you work your way through the kitchen

291
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:00,640
until you get to a higher level. Nobody gets hired and you know, I'm not going to go pick up

292
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:06,640
a saute cook. I'm going to move my grill guy over and I'm going to move my fry guy to grill

293
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,000
and I'm going to move my dishwasher over to fry and I'm going to hire a new dishwasher.

294
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:17,680
That way, at any point in time, if one member of that chain falls out from below, like say the

295
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:23,840
dishwasher calls in sick, every single person on that team has washed dishes and they know what it

296
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:29,120
takes and they can pitch in and do it. There won't be that ego of, oh, that's beneath me. I got hired

297
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:34,640
to do saute. No, you didn't. You got hired to do dish. You just got lucky enough to work your way

298
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:42,320
up to saute. Wow. I can certainly see the advantage to that. Now it's an investment, right? That takes

299
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:47,520
time to move people through all those stations. It does take time. And when you very, at the very

300
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:54,960
beginning, it is the hardest because what happens is most cooks, most chefs will bring an already

301
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:59,920
built team. So they've been going through this time and time again. So they'll bring a team with

302
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:06,000
them from the last place they worked and go, okay, I know you went through the same thing I did. You

303
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,200
understand this. I don't have to reteach you. But everybody new has to go through that.

304
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:19,920
It sounds as well like a part of it is accepting that the team is in constant flux. Like everyone

305
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:24,480
is constantly growing and everything is constantly changing and the people in the positions are

306
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:30,480
constantly sort of rotating. So I could see how that would be helpful as well because we tend to

307
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:36,480
want to think in sort of binaries or black and whites and simplify things like, okay, this person

308
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:42,320
in HR is always going to be the person in HR, but that's just not the reality of life. And I would

309
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:49,600
imagine that kitchen experience or at least that system to work on that really pays back in many,

310
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:56,480
many ways. Yeah, it makes everything very dynamic, but it also, I firmly believe that if you really

311
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:02,800
understand something, you can teach it. So it ensures that, hey, you want to move up, you're

312
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:07,360
going to have to train the guy beneath you so he can take your spot. So you have to be able to teach

313
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:12,880
them what it is you do daily. And the guy above you, the place you want to go, he's going to teach

314
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:17,680
you that. And everybody's wanting to do that because that's how they get out of the spot

315
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:26,080
they're in. That's so awesome. I had never really gained that insight into how kitchens work. Like

316
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:33,840
I kind of gathered that there's a progression, but it seemed to me almost like your standard

317
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:38,240
corporate progression where it's just like, oh, I'm going to get the next thing. But it sounds

318
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:46,240
like the whole team supporting each other in this kind of pass it on approach. That sounds

319
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:56,320
super powerful. It's funny. Kitchens can be the most vulgar, most offensive, ugly thing on the

320
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:03,200
face of it. But deep down, everybody in there, the reason why they get like that is everybody in

321
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:09,040
there knows it's going to be high stress. There isn't going to be a point in time where, all right,

322
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:14,080
dude, we're all going to just hang out and watch YouTube together. No, we are all going to be

323
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:21,440
working. We're going to be sweating. The conditions are crap. They just suck. It's hot. There's not a

324
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:28,560
day that goes by where it's going to be cool in the kitchen. It's going to be 110. And the guy

325
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:36,400
next to you on either side of you has weaponry that he brings with him daily that he sharpens.

326
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:42,480
And you need to make sure everybody agrees, everybody gets along. We may not like each other

327
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:48,480
outside of work. But when we're at work, we're here to work and we all love each other. It's a

328
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,000
weird dichotomy that exists.

329
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,760
And you're all pointed in the same direction, right? You have no choice. So this well oiled

330
00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:03,680
machine that is a kitchen needs to be that way. I would imagine that the stress is almost required

331
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:10,880
to have it be at its most efficient. And everybody sort of plays an essential role from the bottom

332
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,680
right to the top.

333
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:17,600
Yeah, the hardest part for me, really, when I got into a corporate environment was I've become so

334
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:25,200
accustomed to conflict resolution, starting and ending in about 30 seconds. I just turn to the

335
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:31,440
guy next to me and tell him, you suck, and you either need to go home or pick up the pace. His

336
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:36,560
feelings aren't hurt. He just knows he has two options right now. He can work and get paid or he

337
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:42,800
can go home. But I can't turn to the guy next to me or in the cubicle next to me and go, dude, you

338
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:48,480
suck. Can you do your job or not? Because then he starts crying or he runs off to HR and I'm in

339
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:56,640
trouble. But that conflict resolution in the kitchen is necessary because if we have to stop

340
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:01,440
and talk about our feelings, everything in the kitchen comes to a standstill. And now what was

341
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:09,040
a well-oiled machine that was cranking out 200 plates a night is now pushing nothing out of the

342
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,200
kitchen. It's all stopped.

343
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:14,880
It's from 100 to zero. There's not really much in between, is there?

344
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:24,480
No. It's why it appears like a very coarse and pirate brigade is what I hear a lot. It looks

345
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:29,440
like a bunch of pirates on a ship. But it's because they don't have a choice. They don't have

346
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:38,720
time to consider feelings. Now, that was the kitchen experience I grew up with. I've heard

347
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:48,240
that lately it's changed and there has been a surge of a more calm and almost zen-like approach

348
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:52,320
to kitchen running. I don't know how that would look because I can't imagine it. It just never

349
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:57,360
was a thing for me. I would be more comfortable with Gordon Ramsay yelling and throwing my plates

350
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:02,720
on the floor than I would be if some guy looked at me and goes, this one just isn't right. I would

351
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:08,560
like you to try again. I'd be frightened by that guy. That guy would scare me because I'm waiting

352
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,840
for him to explode.

353
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:16,000
Or because maybe you can't trust what he's saying. Like, is that really what he's feeling? And where's

354
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:22,800
the sense of urgency or severity at the mistake? Mistakes in that sort of high-stress environment

355
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:28,720
are almost completely unacceptable because it changes the entire dynamic, doesn't it?

356
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:34,560
But yeah, it definitely led me to, when I got here, when I got into tech, everybody's like,

357
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:39,200
wow, how do you handle all the stress and all this? I'm like, nobody's yelling at me today.

358
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,400
This is a cakewalk.

359
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:47,840
This is a cakewalk. I don't know what to tell you. This is calm. I actually started developing an

360
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:54,240
issue where I got so accustomed to background noise, I would have to turn things on so that

361
00:35:54,240 --> 00:36:00,000
there'd just be random noise. Not in that sense like people have a show going. I want construction

362
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,880
equipment somewhere, banging pots and stuff.

363
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:07,280
Is there such a thing as a white noise from a kitchen that you can turn on and tune out the

364
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,640
world? Maybe it's a market opportunity.

365
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,320
I would say just as a slight aside for anybody who's interested in reading up on that

366
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:21,200
kind of kitchen experience, I have two recommendations. And maybe you can add to

367
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:27,360
these if you've done that kind of reading. But I just came across randomly a book called Heat

368
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:35,040
by Bill Buford. And he, so you know it, he describes his experience sort of learning

369
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:40,720
the kitchen from the likes of Mario Batali and going to Italy and doing a bunch of crazy stuff.

370
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:46,880
So that book is very entertaining. I would imagine for someone in the kitchen, as well as someone

371
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:52,240
outside of a professional kitchen, you know, I've never really had tiny experiences, but that book

372
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:59,280
was fascinating to me, and totally agrees with everything you just said. And I guess anything,

373
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:03,360
you know, Anthony Bourdain is pretty well known for his kitchen confidentials and stuff. So

374
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,040
those are two fascinating reads.

375
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:13,120
Everybody I know when that came out was like, all right, who is this guy? Because this is spot on,

376
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:20,480
you know, it was almost like he was explaining our lives to us. And if you haven't read it,

377
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,040
Medium Raw is also really good by him.

378
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,360
Oh, what's that like?

379
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:31,200
It's more of what happens when you become a hack, when you become me now, you know, hey, you used

380
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:36,560
to work in a kitchen, and all you do is talk about it. You're not really a cook anymore. You're not

381
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:41,920
one of us. Very odd feeling. You know, I'll go out with my girlfriend, we'll go to restaurants,

382
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:47,920
and I try and identify with the waitstaff and the bartenders and the cooks, and they can tell I know

383
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:53,120
what I'm talking about, but they also know I'm not one of them anymore. And it's, do you do,

384
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:58,240
it's like, you start to feel like a fraud in what used to be your own home.

385
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:01,120
I suppose it's a change of identity in some ways.

386
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:08,160
Oh, my fingers used to be like black with soot underneath them and burnt and calluses. And now

387
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,040
I'm like, I don't know when I last got a manicure.

388
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,920
The things we put ourselves through.

389
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:21,040
I have been beaten. I've been bloodied. I've been burnt. And now I'm like, oh, I really should

390
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:25,520
change clothes or something. You know, the weird things that crossed my mind now when at the time

391
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:30,320
it was like, okay, I need to put cornstarch underneath my arm so I can stop the sweating.

392
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:36,880
Do you feel like, you know, you're still getting beat and burnt and all of that, but just in more

393
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:42,000
of a sort of a mental capacity instead of that physical stuff? Like, has it just transformed,

394
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,600
or is it gone completely?

395
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:50,640
It has transformed, but it's taken me a while to get used to it. The thing about being in the

396
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:57,920
restaurant is a lot of the beatings were upfront in your face. You knew what was coming. There was

397
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:06,240
no power play. There was no backstabbing, because if somebody was a backstabber, everybody called

398
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:16,000
them out. Everybody knew. While there are politics in the kitchen, it's more like watching, I can't

399
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:22,720
remember what they're called, in the UK, basically their version of senators and congressmen, where

400
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:29,280
they're all out there just making fun of each other open. Whereas I get into a corporate setting

401
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:33,760
here, and it reminds me of US politics, where everybody says nice things about each other,

402
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:38,080
even though they hate each other. I'm like, uh-uh, you don't like me, you don't like me,

403
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:40,560
you can tell me that. You're not going to hurt my feelings.

404
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:45,600
Interesting. It's like clear direct communication versus sort of hiding the stuff between the

405
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,320
lines.

406
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:52,480
Yeah. It's like everybody's afraid to have an emotion because that makes them weak. I'm like,

407
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:57,760
no, no, no, no, no. You've got to get beyond letting the emotion control you, and you just

408
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:03,040
control your emotions. You go, hey, look, I'm angry at you because you did this, this, and this.

409
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:09,120
Then when you've gotten that off your chest, you get to stop being angry. It's like people

410
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,360
don't know how to shut that off, I guess.

411
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,600
Maybe it results problems a little faster, too.

412
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:19,440
How did you ever switch from the kitchen into what you're doing now? Those seem, on the

413
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:25,200
surface, like very different things, despite the similarities and how one is really a gift

414
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,160
to the other, but how did that transition ever happen for you?

415
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:36,480
Taking a step back. I got to a point where my knees hurt, my back hurt. I was doing 18-hour

416
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:41,600
days, and I was exhausted. I started looking around. I was like, I'm not going to be Anthony

417
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:47,040
Bourdain. I'm not going to be Jamie Oliver. I'm not going on Food Network, and it doesn't

418
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:55,200
look like I'm going to get my own restaurant anytime soon. So, am I ready to do this for

419
00:40:55,200 --> 00:41:01,520
another 20, 30 years, working on the line, possibly running a kitchen, but never running

420
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:08,320
the restaurant? And I decided I didn't want to do it. It just became that simple of like,

421
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:13,120
I don't want to do this. I didn't have a college degree. I have a high school diploma, and

422
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:18,880
that's it. So, I was talking with a friend, and he said, well, you ought to take a shot

423
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:24,240
at Linux. Why? I don't know. I know how to use a computer. He's like, yeah, you know

424
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:29,280
more than most people. You can turn it on. It's a really low bar to set. He's like, and

425
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:35,840
you can read. So, here, and he gave me this like tome of a book. It was a thousand-page

426
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:38,400
book called the Linux Bible.

427
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,400
It sounds appropriate as a first one.

428
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:46,080
Yeah, that's what he gave me. He's like, here, take this. Go and learn it. Where do I start?

429
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:52,320
He's like, start on page one and read through the book. Okay. So, I start out with that,

430
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:58,480
and then there was a group here in San Antonio called the Open Cloud Academy who were doing,

431
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:05,680
it was like a 10-week bootcamp where you go through, you learn the basic LAMP stack, Linux,

432
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:14,080
Apache, MySQL, or MySQL, depending on your preference, and PHP. At the end of it, really,

433
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:17,680
when I look back, I'm like, wow, of all the things I've learned, that should have taken

434
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:24,560
me like three days, not 10 weeks. But knowing very little, it was great because I got to

435
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:31,680
meet people and interact. And at the end of it, we were told everybody who goes through

436
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:35,920
the program and you had to pay for it. That's the other big thing. It did cost money. So, it wasn't

437
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:41,120
free. So, you really wanted to apply yourself. But at the end of it, everybody would be offered the

438
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:44,640
opportunity to interview with a major hosting company.

439
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,720
That's worth the money alone sometimes.

440
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:52,080
Yeah. And this is when my competitive brain kicks in because I'm like, okay, there's a class of 20.

441
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:59,120
The class who did this before us, there were 20 there. Five got hired. All right. So, I have a

442
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:06,560
one in four shot. I've got to figure out who are the 15 people I can beat. And it just became that.

443
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:11,360
I was like, all right, I'm going to push through. How do you outrun a lion? All you got to do is

444
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:18,080
be faster than the slowest guy. That was all I was going for. I don't want to be number 15.

445
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:26,080
I will take number 16. I'll be that high. That's fine. I'll be the dumbest one of the smart group,

446
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:31,680
but I'm getting hired. We get our RHCSA certification. So, the system admin.

447
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:38,560
And I go through the interview process and I find out it's probably two years later. So,

448
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:43,680
two years after getting hired, I run into some of the people who had interviewed me and they're like,

449
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:50,000
yeah, you weren't hired for your skill. You were hired because you were just weird enough

450
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,480
that we thought you'd be interesting to keep around. All right. I'll take it.

451
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:57,440
That's sort of a backhanded compliment, right?

452
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:04,000
And so from that, I was like, all right, you know, I did sysad work, sysadmin work for

453
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:11,520
two years. And then I went on to work in OpenStack deployments. So, converting

454
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:18,000
major companies data centers, their existing hardware into cloud servers. And I did that

455
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:24,800
for two years. And then just on a lark, I was like, you know, why not shoot for the big leagues?

456
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:31,840
Linux Academy is hiring. Let's see if they'd give me a job running their newly designed support

457
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:38,000
team. Oddly enough, I got picked up for about the same reason. We thought you were crazy enough to

458
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:43,520
build this. You can never really predict that kind of stuff. Like you had a friend who had enough

459
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:51,120
clarity and was generous enough to sort of hand you some pretty critical pieces of information

460
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:55,200
and some support at a time when, you know, it sounds like that really turned your life around

461
00:44:55,200 --> 00:45:02,000
in a or at least switched directions. That took you to where you are here. How could you have ever

462
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:07,680
predicted that? But it's those people that come into our lives for small moments and give us,

463
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:11,520
you know, the Linux hint. And then we just get hooked from there.

464
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:19,200
And I wanted to ask you if you have an ask of our community, if you want them to go see something,

465
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:23,600
find something, learn about something and go try something. Is there anything you'd like to throw

466
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:28,320
out there? In general, if you have an issue, if you have a concern, if you have a problem,

467
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:35,760
don't sit on it. Talk, get it out there. The only way for people to help you solve the problem

468
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:40,640
is if they know you have one. That sounds pretty important. You got to raise your voice

469
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:47,840
before anybody even knows that you need some help. I would assume that fits both in the support realm

470
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:51,760
and the bug tracking realm, but also just in life in general.

471
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:56,560
Yeah. I mean, if you hear that somebody has a problem and they've raised a concern,

472
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:05,200
don't shut them out. You know, at least give it the time and energy to look at it and establish

473
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:11,040
where the actual problem exists. Because sometimes you might hear, oh, you know, the lights aren't

474
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:16,000
working. Was it the lights aren't working or there's no power or is there no power because

475
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,880
you didn't pay the bill? You know, run it down a bit, figure out where the real problem is. Don't

476
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:25,440
just start treating symptoms. So doing some investigation is, sounds like it's pretty

477
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:32,880
essential. Yes. Well, if you wanted to send people where they can say hi or that kind of thing,

478
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:41,040
where would you send people? You can find me on Twitter. I am at netchromancer, N E T,

479
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:47,920
chromancer, as in I revive dead connections. That sounds like a perfect place to send people.

480
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:56,880
Well, thank you so much for your time. It's been a real pleasure and I've loved all these topics. So

481
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:03,040
thanks for chatting and hopefully we get to meet in person. I know you've been at Linux Fest in

482
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:09,200
the past, so hope maybe you might be there this year. I don't know. Or otherwise we'll see each

483
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:14,320
other somewhere. Yeah, I'm all over the place. I'll in fact be, if anybody's out there, going to

484
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:20,560
B-Sides Bryan College Station coming up in a couple of weeks and I'll be out at Scale in March

485
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:25,840
as well. Nice. So people can find you there. That's great. Well, thank you so much again and

486
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:27,840
thanks for your time.
