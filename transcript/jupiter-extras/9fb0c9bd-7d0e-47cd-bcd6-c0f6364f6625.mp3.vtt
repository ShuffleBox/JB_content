00:00.000 --> 00:17.840
Well, hello, everyone. I am joined here today by Katherine Kretschmer. You might have an

00:17.840 --> 00:23.400
association with her with Alex from Self Hosted. They've been kind enough to have me in their

00:23.400 --> 00:30.920
home this week, which has been super fun. We've got to know each other a heck of a lot. And

00:30.920 --> 00:32.840
Katherine, how are you doing?

00:32.840 --> 00:34.880
I'm good. Thank you.

00:34.880 --> 00:40.520
Yeah. How is it feeling being in a podcast seat? Because this might be one of your first

00:40.520 --> 00:41.520
experiences.

00:41.520 --> 00:43.480
This is definitely my first ever experience.

00:43.480 --> 00:44.480
Wow.

00:44.480 --> 00:50.520
And it feels more than a little weird to have a microphone pointed straight at my face.

00:50.520 --> 00:54.560
You get used to it, it kind of fades into the foreground.

00:54.560 --> 00:55.560
I hope so.

00:55.560 --> 00:58.560
Try not to look at it.

00:58.560 --> 01:02.040
At the moment, it's staring right at me.

01:02.040 --> 01:03.600
It becomes your friend eventually.

01:03.600 --> 01:04.600
Maybe.

01:04.600 --> 01:10.960
Thanks for joining me and doing this. I know we're kind of squeezing it in last minute.

01:10.960 --> 01:17.880
I'm leaving tomorrow. But this is a real treat that we're able to do this. So thanks. I wanted

01:17.880 --> 01:25.840
to ask you a question about being here in this home specifically. I've gotten to get

01:25.840 --> 01:32.520
a taste of Alex's sort of environment, of course, was self hosted and everything that

01:32.520 --> 01:39.560
he does in his curiosities around automation, home automation, and his day job at Red Hat

01:39.560 --> 01:44.160
and things like that. Of course, the home has a feel of that kind of stuff, right? Some

01:44.160 --> 01:47.200
experimenting and tinkering happening a little bit all the time.

01:47.200 --> 01:48.560
Yeah, just a little.

01:48.560 --> 01:56.480
How is that for you as someone's spouse who has to kind of live in that space and deal

01:56.480 --> 01:58.520
with the technology on a daily basis?

01:58.520 --> 02:07.000
Well, I mean, obviously, I'm married to him. So I'm quite fond of his of him being him.

02:07.000 --> 02:13.920
And all of them. I don't think I can underestimate how much how many little projects he has on

02:13.920 --> 02:21.640
the go at any one time, whether it's 3D printing something, or physically woodworking and making

02:21.640 --> 02:31.560
things, or all of the self hosted server building, home automation things. So because of that,

02:31.560 --> 02:38.160
I think what most people don't realize is that it's constantly changing. And that you're

02:38.160 --> 02:45.440
asking me at the moment for a snapshot in time of November 2019. And probably if you

02:45.440 --> 02:50.760
were to ask me again, in a month's time, especially since Alex will have had some time off for

02:50.760 --> 02:57.280
Thanksgiving and Christmas, everything will have changed. Because he loves playing with

02:57.280 --> 03:02.680
it and upgrading it. And that's, I think, the fun for him. It's not having a finished

03:02.680 --> 03:04.720
system.

03:04.720 --> 03:09.400
And all of these things are constantly evolving, which is kind of the beauty of them. It's

03:09.400 --> 03:12.900
like, there's always something more to learn something more to upgrade.

03:12.900 --> 03:20.560
And it's always improving. Right. And occasionally, things break along the way. And I try not

03:20.560 --> 03:26.440
to compare it with a standard home. Oh, it's finished. It's not it's not it's a the whole

03:26.440 --> 03:27.440
house is a project.

03:27.440 --> 03:35.600
And I suppose you kind of have to just sort of accept that if you're gonna and he's very

03:35.600 --> 03:40.480
aware of things that are essential and things that are not, if it's something to do with

03:40.480 --> 03:45.680
say, the heating of the air conditioning, he is very careful not to leave it in a half

03:45.680 --> 03:52.280
finished state, because we don't want to be overheating on a hundred degree day. Yeah,

03:52.280 --> 03:57.480
or under heating, but things like lights where there's actually a switch somewhere. They're

03:57.480 --> 04:04.920
currently in upgrade mode. That's fine, because I can just go and use the switch like a peasant.

04:04.920 --> 04:12.320
A lowly not Alex, maybe. I found myself the other morning I woke up a little bit earlier

04:12.320 --> 04:15.760
than both of you. I think you might have been out of the house actually at that point. And

04:15.760 --> 04:23.960
I found myself trying to figure out how to turn the TV on. Because because I've only

04:23.960 --> 04:28.680
been here a few days, that's never anything I had to do before. And and Alex was sleeping

04:28.680 --> 04:32.320
and I didn't want to wake him. So I was like, Hmm, okay, I think I can figure this out.

04:32.320 --> 04:35.720
So I tried, you know, the obvious remotes and things like that. And nothing was working.

04:35.720 --> 04:40.320
I was like, Okay, I imagine this is probably plugged into something that is automated,

04:40.320 --> 04:47.640
right? And sure enough, I had to like, reach to the back and hit the the switch on whatever

04:47.640 --> 04:53.920
he's got back there. And it all worked, which is fine. But that sort of backup, yeah, is

04:53.920 --> 05:00.000
certainly appreciated, right? Yeah, definitely. And I imagine that leads to the success, the

05:00.000 --> 05:04.720
eventual success of these integrations for you into your lifestyle, because it's like,

05:04.720 --> 05:10.320
if it doesn't work during the like experimented mentation phase, okay, well, maybe it's a

05:10.320 --> 05:14.400
bit more of a pain, but it eventually gets there, right? Yeah, it's not the end of the

05:14.400 --> 05:19.600
world. Yeah. There are some things that have not changed in a while, because some things

05:19.600 --> 05:24.920
have been actually I'd say the TVs are pretty safe bet. Okay, just say turn on TV. And that

05:24.920 --> 05:30.520
one has worked for a good few years now. And it's not changed. But the TV used to be one

05:30.520 --> 05:37.760
of those ones that maybe five years ago, maybe more than that. Maybe more like eight years

05:37.760 --> 05:43.560
ago, used to frustrate me, I have to say, because sometimes I'd get to the point where

05:43.560 --> 05:49.480
I just can't make this thing work. And he would be out of work or something. And I'd

05:49.480 --> 05:55.480
end up with propping the iPad up. Oh, like you're on an airplane or something. Yeah,

05:55.480 --> 05:58.960
just sat on the table with his iPad propped up just like I've given up.

05:58.960 --> 06:03.440
Well, especially during those moments when you would just want to relax typically around

06:03.440 --> 06:06.500
the television, right? Yeah, sometimes that's actually led me to

06:06.500 --> 06:11.680
being more productive, like a couple of occasions, I can't get this thing to turn on, right,

06:11.680 --> 06:18.080
I'll have to go and do something else. But I don't think that's happened for at least

06:18.080 --> 06:25.000
five years since the TV is. I mean, back in the old days, there was no home assistant,

06:25.000 --> 06:36.160
Xbox was doing all of this with various different apps. And I see little weird bits of electronic

06:36.160 --> 06:45.680
circuit boards. I don't know. I don't know. I just see in soldering things and nod a smile.

06:45.680 --> 06:50.960
So it sounds like it was a bit piecemeal before. Yeah, I think so. I mean, you tried to integrate

06:50.960 --> 06:57.320
like an Xbox, they had some sort of home automation thing back in the day. He tried to use that,

06:57.320 --> 07:03.120
but it wasn't very good. And the whole voice recognition back then wasn't very good.

07:03.120 --> 07:05.920
It's come a long way. Yeah. And then he went through a period where

07:05.920 --> 07:12.000
he had one of those Harmony remote that had about a million buttons on and he programmed

07:12.000 --> 07:17.960
all of them to do different things with lights. So you had to use the one remote to rule them

07:17.960 --> 07:24.480
all to do everything. And that was pretty good, but it could get itself turned in not

07:24.480 --> 07:28.880
sometimes as a device. How does it feel for you now that some of

07:28.880 --> 07:35.320
those things are more stable? Like has it brought a quality of life to you specifically

07:35.320 --> 07:38.560
that you appreciate? Yeah, actually, I don't think I realize it

07:38.560 --> 07:45.160
until I go maybe stay in other people's homes. And then I realize, I think one of the big

07:45.160 --> 07:51.840
ones that I love is that I can lie in bed and say lights out and I don't have to get

07:51.840 --> 07:55.840
up and I don't have to remember to turn the main light off before I get into bed. I don't

07:55.840 --> 08:02.340
have to reach over when I'm really comfy and settled and turn the light off on the nightstand.

08:02.340 --> 08:08.440
And then we go and stay in a hotel and I'm irritated by the fact I have to move to turn

08:08.440 --> 08:12.120
the lights out. It sounds like a little thing to anyone who

08:12.120 --> 08:18.440
hasn't experienced it, but it's a real quality of life upgrade to not have to do that.

08:18.440 --> 08:23.640
Absolutely. And I've experienced that here as well. We've kind of got into a groove

08:23.640 --> 08:29.440
and Alex will typically say, you know, lights out, bedtime routine, right. And then 20 minutes

08:29.440 --> 08:37.040
later, like the lights just slowly dimmed down in the entire house. So it's lovely that

08:37.040 --> 08:44.240
actually was in order to try and manipulate us because we had this tendency that we would

08:44.240 --> 08:50.160
go to bed and then we would both sit there. I would sit there reading a book and I would

08:50.160 --> 08:57.200
read until far too late. And he would be reading Reddit or articles online and thinking of

08:57.200 --> 09:03.200
things which sometimes led to him jumping back out of bed and go, oh, I've got an idea.

09:03.200 --> 09:08.880
So it was kind of our way of being stricter with ourselves to make ourselves have a better

09:08.880 --> 09:15.580
sleep work balance and not lie in bed for two hours reading a book when I need to be

09:15.580 --> 09:23.120
up in the morning. So we say bedtime routine and we get a reply, bedtime routine initiated.

09:23.120 --> 09:28.960
And that gives us enough time to let the dog out, come back in and the lights are out in

09:28.960 --> 09:30.960
20 minutes and we go to sleep.

09:30.960 --> 09:33.360
And you're also out in 20 minutes.

09:33.360 --> 09:38.440
Yeah. And it's good. It's got to the point where the dog now hears that and he jumps

09:38.440 --> 09:45.320
up and walks to the back door because he knows bedtime routine means that he has to go out

09:45.320 --> 09:48.680
first and he goes out and then he just trots to the bedroom.

09:48.680 --> 09:53.600
That's fascinating. Because I, you know, when you look at some home automation stuff when

09:53.600 --> 10:01.240
you're uneducated perhaps it feels like, or uninitiated maybe is the better word, it feels

10:01.240 --> 10:10.040
like it's a bit maybe gimmicky or like just some superfluous technology. But to hear that

10:10.040 --> 10:15.320
it's actually affecting your quality of sleep, therefore your quality of life in the morning

10:15.320 --> 10:21.480
and those kinds of things, and also, you know, Archie, your dog's routines as well, then

10:21.480 --> 10:26.240
it kind of points to the power that some of this can have, even if it's simply turning

10:26.240 --> 10:29.680
lights off, right? But it can really change things for you.

10:29.680 --> 10:37.360
Yeah. We also have one that gets to 1115 and just gently dims the lights in the main house

10:37.360 --> 10:45.840
to kind of give us a hint and to make us start feeling more sleepy because if you're in a

10:45.840 --> 10:50.760
bright environment you're less likely to be feeling ready to go to bed, especially if

10:50.760 --> 10:54.880
you're looking at a TV and seeing all that blue light.

10:54.880 --> 10:59.840
So if you dim them and make them more like an orangey color, because most of our lights

10:59.840 --> 11:06.000
are LEDs so we can control the color as well as the brightness. So we change it to make

11:06.000 --> 11:11.720
it warmer and that actually makes you feel more ready to go to bed as well.

11:11.720 --> 11:18.360
You know, it feels like having our environment, you know, our artificial environment, our

11:18.360 --> 11:23.560
homes and things like that, start to mimic the natural environment in ways that works

11:23.560 --> 11:25.840
for our evolved body, right?

11:25.840 --> 11:26.840
Yeah.

11:26.840 --> 11:29.200
It's trying to make it feel more like sunset.

11:29.200 --> 11:35.000
Yeah, exactly. It feels like finally we're figuring that out, right?

11:35.000 --> 11:42.520
We're not fighting it. We're embracing the technology to help us live more naturally

11:42.520 --> 11:43.920
in our homes.

11:43.920 --> 11:49.480
Which is the whole objective of technology, I think, right? Is to up our quality of life.

11:49.480 --> 11:55.360
And so if it can help our circadian rhythms and those kind of things, then bring it on.

11:55.360 --> 11:56.600
Yeah, definitely.

11:56.600 --> 12:02.000
I wanted to ask you a little bit about some educational stuff you're jumping into recently.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
Yeah.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.120
Can you give us a tour of that?

12:05.120 --> 12:12.120
So I'm sure lots of people have heard of these like online things, like to learn coding,

12:12.120 --> 12:18.880
coding boot camps. Mine's not an online one that I'm doing. I'm doing an in-person, it's

12:18.880 --> 12:25.720
a course. There's about 20 people in the class. It's a six-month course run by the university

12:25.720 --> 12:33.720
here, University of North Carolina. And I think it's something that I've thought of

12:33.720 --> 12:42.560
in the back of my head for quite a few years now. And I have learned some HTML and CSS

12:42.560 --> 12:48.400
by myself before now and could make a sort of basic webpage and things. And it does,

12:48.400 --> 12:55.440
I think, come from living with Alex. And he went through doing his master's in computer

12:55.440 --> 13:01.920
science and I would sort of proofread his code and debug it a bit for him. And he was

13:01.920 --> 13:03.600
like, you're really good at this.

13:03.600 --> 13:09.960
You have the right brain that just fixes and just sees how it works. And I think you may

13:09.960 --> 13:15.360
be in a different life if I hadn't gone down the music route. I might have been, well,

13:15.360 --> 13:19.040
I probably would have done like maths and science. That was the other things I was doing

13:19.040 --> 13:23.600
at A-level. I was doing like maths, further maths and music and things.

13:23.600 --> 13:24.600
Because they're related, right?

13:24.600 --> 13:25.600
They are related.

13:25.600 --> 13:26.600
Yeah, in many ways.

13:26.600 --> 13:34.240
They're very similar. I was also doing chemistry as well. But I went the music way. But it's

13:34.240 --> 13:40.280
sort of been sitting there in my head since that time when he was doing his master's and

13:40.280 --> 13:45.640
when he was a junior developer. And he was, if he had ever had stuff he brought home,

13:45.640 --> 13:49.640
like it wouldn't work. And I was, no, that means that because logically that's like that.

13:49.640 --> 13:56.760
And he's like, Catherine, you'd be really good at this. And I really enjoy that sort

13:56.760 --> 14:02.880
of puzzle solving. You've probably seen me when I watch TV. I don't actually watch TV.

14:02.880 --> 14:11.920
I sit there and do like, yeah, I do like logic puzzles and things. Beyond Sudoku, that's

14:11.920 --> 14:19.840
a great book. Has all sorts of really slight, all different logic puzzles that are all unusual.

14:19.840 --> 14:21.880
Great book.

14:21.880 --> 14:25.640
It sounds like solving puzzles is something you can't get away from.

14:25.640 --> 14:31.840
Yeah. And so, and with these things, he's like, why don't you just? And so I've tried

14:31.840 --> 14:40.800
to, I've tried to learn some by myself. As I said, a basic understanding of HTML, CSS

14:40.800 --> 14:47.560
and stuff. I could do a basic website. And I tried to learn some Java, but without kind

14:47.560 --> 14:54.680
of some structure or an end goal or just projects to do that I don't have to think of myself.

14:54.680 --> 15:04.360
I've kind of run up against a wall. So I thought let's try more formal things. So I applied

15:04.360 --> 15:13.460
to this coding course and so far it will like week four. So I haven't, I'm not a long way

15:13.460 --> 15:22.000
through the six months, but having deadlines, having three classes a week to go to. So it's

15:22.000 --> 15:30.600
about 10 hours a week of classes and homework you have to do every week and submit on a

15:30.600 --> 15:31.600
Saturday.

15:31.600 --> 15:32.600
Consequences, right?

15:32.600 --> 15:38.080
Yeah. Has actually been very rewarding. But at the beginning of the week, I thought, I

15:38.080 --> 15:42.720
can't, how am I going to make one of them? I can't make it. The last one was making a

15:42.720 --> 15:48.000
password generator. So you had to make a website that if you click on a button to generate,

15:48.000 --> 15:54.680
it generates a password. However many length characters the person wants, if they want

15:54.680 --> 15:59.880
uppercase, lowercase, special, whatever, whatever mixture. And it generates it, it puts it on

15:59.880 --> 16:04.400
the website and you can copy it to the clipboard and onto your phone or your computer or something.

16:04.400 --> 16:09.840
And I, when they first told me that, I was, I can't do that. I mean, I can make a pretty

16:09.840 --> 16:15.960
looking thing that looks like it would do a password generator, but four days later

16:15.960 --> 16:21.200
I did manage to do it. So that must feel pretty cool. Yeah. A little stressful at times that

16:21.200 --> 16:26.960
particular one, but well pushing just outside of your comfort zone is stressful, but in

16:26.960 --> 16:28.960
all of the best ways, right?

16:28.960 --> 16:35.440
And a sense of achievement on Saturday when I finished it at 5pm and I had until midnight.

16:35.440 --> 16:41.600
So I had hours in the bag. A few anyway.

16:41.600 --> 16:45.560
How does that feel for you for your end goal? Like you were mentioning that having something

16:45.560 --> 16:52.300
formal and an end goal like that was a helpful thing. Does it feel like you're going to learn

16:52.300 --> 16:55.680
a heck of a lot in the next six months, minus four weeks?

16:55.680 --> 17:02.200
Yeah, I think I am. So I'm in the first two weeks we've, we did a very brief overview

17:02.200 --> 17:08.560
of HTML and CSS, which I had a bit of experience with as well. And honestly, most of the people

17:08.560 --> 17:15.040
on the course also knew a reasonable amount of. I was quite surprised to find that most

17:15.040 --> 17:19.720
people on the course are not complete. It's not just random people that have never coded

17:19.720 --> 17:28.320
before. So there's at least five people that actually work in the tech industry for their

17:28.320 --> 17:33.560
day jobs and have been sent on it by their companies and things. Someone that works for

17:33.560 --> 17:34.560
GitHub.

17:34.560 --> 17:37.200
Cool. You're in good company, it sounds like.

17:37.200 --> 17:43.280
Yeah, there's somebody that works for a local radio station as a web designer, and she just

17:43.280 --> 17:48.920
did does front end, but they want her to become a full stack stack right developer. So they've

17:48.920 --> 17:55.840
sent her on the course to upgrade her skills. So we'll, by the end, we'll have learned JavaScript,

17:55.840 --> 18:05.480
jQuery, Angular, Bootstrap, SQL. Can't think of anything else. Loads of other stuff. That's

18:05.480 --> 18:07.440
probably the next two months.

18:07.440 --> 18:13.880
Yeah, it sounds like it'll give you like an overview in a kind of a shallow toolbox of

18:13.880 --> 18:17.640
all these different pieces. And then you can kind of dive in from there on the ones that

18:17.640 --> 18:19.920
interest you or, or the ones that are necessary.

18:19.920 --> 18:25.160
I don't think they're ever saying that you're going to be an expert or any of those technologies,

18:25.160 --> 18:28.560
but you'll know enough to know what to Google.

18:28.560 --> 18:32.400
That's so important too, right? Cause it gives you an avenue to, to self-learn.

18:32.400 --> 18:37.840
Yeah. Or know enough to know which, what areas interest you and where you want to go and

18:37.840 --> 18:40.280
where you want to dive in and learn more.

18:40.280 --> 18:44.800
Of course. Well, I can't wait to hear where you're going to dive into in six months.

18:44.800 --> 18:48.960
Yeah. Well, I don't know yet, no ideas, no temptations.

18:48.960 --> 18:58.480
I was surprised to find that this is going to sound very odd for me. I actually really

18:58.480 --> 19:03.520
liked doing some of the front end things and making it look pretty and change for different

19:03.520 --> 19:10.520
size screens and that sort of stuff. Um, and I had more of an eye for that than I thought

19:10.520 --> 19:16.760
I did. I never thought of myself as a particularly creative sort of person, honestly.

19:16.760 --> 19:23.280
I would argue that, but I've, I found that actually really quite pleasant sitting, trying

19:23.280 --> 19:29.720
to work out which sizes and designing, um, and putting it together and styling so far

19:29.720 --> 19:36.640
I've only done, you know, front end stuff. So I don't know yet, but, um, I think I find

19:36.640 --> 19:43.000
the JavaScript not too hard and the logic behind it seems like a simple version of Java,

19:43.000 --> 19:44.760
which I have done a bit of.

19:44.760 --> 19:50.160
When I was impressed by something I picked up on, you showed me your little password

19:50.160 --> 19:55.460
manager, which I've never created one of those. So kudos to you. Um, was that, yeah, it worked

19:55.460 --> 20:00.080
really well and it was beautiful and all of those things, but there's something that you

20:00.080 --> 20:05.620
said that I picked up on, which is you described how maybe it wasn't the best password manager

20:05.620 --> 20:11.160
in terms of security. So I noticed that you're picking up on like the back end of things

20:11.160 --> 20:12.160
that,

20:12.160 --> 20:18.960
yeah, I did. Um, I think it could be eminently hackable cause one way I managed to push my

20:18.960 --> 20:26.840
salt, my password back to the HTML was I put dot inner HTML and that could be very easily

20:26.840 --> 20:33.520
hacked by a very simple script because almost any website could have that particular true.

20:33.520 --> 20:37.960
It wasn't very specific, but it worked well. That's the first step, right? And then you

20:37.960 --> 20:42.880
can harden it from there. But I think the real value there is you're seeing, okay, here's

20:42.880 --> 20:48.520
the next way I can improve this. Um, and that's a huge indicator that you're just going to

20:48.520 --> 20:54.140
keep diving in. I think the way that Alex has that insatiable curiosity is also in you.

20:54.140 --> 21:00.740
It sounds like, right? Yeah. Not, not to the quite the same extent. Um, I don't manage

21:00.740 --> 21:07.560
to have the blinkers on life that he can have sometimes, but the, the great thing I've noticed

21:07.560 --> 21:13.480
is that you're both different and yet you overlap enough that they're really complimentary,

21:13.480 --> 21:19.120
which is really sweet. Yeah. I find this kind of weird because when we first met, we were

21:19.120 --> 21:28.260
both studying music and now we're at a place where we are not really doing music. I mean,

21:28.260 --> 21:34.920
music is still my day job. I teach music six days a week. So, but I don't do music at any

21:34.920 --> 21:42.060
high level anymore. I do very much the basics with small, small child after small child

21:42.060 --> 21:47.160
after small child and the occasional adult and the occasional adult. Yeah. Brent had

21:47.160 --> 21:52.560
a piano lesson with me. My first ever, which is really brilliant. He was really very good.

21:52.560 --> 22:00.920
Thank you. And he should be a musician. Who knows what my six months will bring. Uh, cause

22:00.920 --> 22:06.520
he's definitely got an ear for it. Thank you. Yeah. You can hear when things were wrong.

22:06.520 --> 22:12.840
A lot of people just blindly just keep going. See, and I don't know that. So I was just

22:12.840 --> 22:18.000
being me. Right. Yeah. But you were listening to what you were playing and realized when

22:18.000 --> 22:21.520
the melody didn't sound like you expected it to sound. Or I think at one point just

22:21.520 --> 22:26.520
your chord didn't fit with my baseline. You picked up on that instantly and went, Oh,

22:26.520 --> 22:34.280
I changed. But some people, most people have to learn to listen as they play and are too

22:34.280 --> 22:43.520
focused on just the mechanics of it. I think. Right. Yeah. Hmm. I'm blushing. I don't know.

22:43.520 --> 22:48.680
What's really curious to me in that is that connection between a lot of these different

22:48.680 --> 22:54.120
topics we've been talking about, like you mentioned music, you've been, you know, you

22:54.120 --> 22:59.760
have quite a bit of education in music. Can you walk us through that? I've been playing

22:59.760 --> 23:06.160
since I was very small, about six. I went to a junior conservatoire as a teenager in

23:06.160 --> 23:12.200
London and traveled down to London every Saturday. I went to junior Guildhall, um, followed by

23:12.200 --> 23:20.000
a scholarship to RNCM, Royal Northern College of Music, where I did an undergraduate degree

23:20.000 --> 23:25.680
and I did a master's in solo performance. Um, graduated in the middle of a recession

23:25.680 --> 23:33.240
as a freelance musician. Yeah, right. Not the easiest thing. Yeah. Yes. I'm a solo bassoonist.

23:33.240 --> 23:42.680
Ready for hire. I spent a year working in Sainsbury's and doing the odd freelance gig

23:42.680 --> 23:49.000
that didn't pay enough to live off. That's how it goes with freelancing at first. Yeah.

23:49.000 --> 23:54.680
Um, the economy just seemed to be getting worse. This was like 2008. Oh gosh. And made

23:54.680 --> 23:59.820
the decision because the UK government at the time were giving very generous bursaries

23:59.820 --> 24:10.600
to train to be a teacher. So I did a teaching PGCE and since then I've mostly just been

24:10.600 --> 24:16.760
doing classroom music teaching. Um, we moved to London, uh, I was doing some of that, the

24:16.760 --> 24:23.960
occasional freelance gigs still make a little bit of money and some teaching at the evenings

24:23.960 --> 24:30.680
and weekends. Um, but yeah, it wasn't, it wasn't where I intended to become, but I think

24:30.680 --> 24:36.240
that's what most people, I think I'm sure most people say that, um, about what they

24:36.240 --> 24:40.420
hope to achieve and what they do actually achieve. I think what's probably important

24:40.420 --> 24:48.020
there is being flexible and open to other options, right? Yeah. I really quite enjoy,

24:48.020 --> 24:55.800
can enjoy teaching, sometimes enjoy the teaching. Okay. Um, what I was going to wrap that in

24:55.800 --> 25:03.020
with was how it's curious to me how both you and Alex have a musical background. Um, and

25:03.020 --> 25:08.400
you both seem to enjoy this problem solving of puzzles and that kind of thing, or at least

25:08.400 --> 25:14.240
exploring them. Um, and it's related now a little bit to the tech world as well. Do you

25:14.240 --> 25:20.240
think like there's something about a musical mind that ties all of that together? I don't

25:20.240 --> 25:26.760
know if it's a musical mind, but maybe they're just kind of similar, like brain patterns.

25:26.760 --> 25:33.160
Yeah. Okay. Um, like pattern recognition or something. Yeah, I think so. I actually think,

25:33.160 --> 25:40.860
um, at least some of the coding I've been doing is more creative than music, but I did

25:40.860 --> 25:47.340
very much classical music. I've never really dabbled in jazz or I've never learned to play

25:47.340 --> 25:53.800
the guitar or anything like that. So I was very much hardcore classical orchestra sort

25:53.800 --> 26:00.720
of music, which is very strict and full of rules. And you'll realize that you've been

26:00.720 --> 26:04.800
in an orchestra rehearsal for three hours and haven't said a single word because you're

26:04.800 --> 26:11.080
not allowed to talk. Right. You mentioned that it ha it feels like it has more creativity.

26:11.080 --> 26:15.640
Um, where are the areas where you felt like you've been able to be creative? Cause usually

26:15.640 --> 26:21.560
in education, uh, you know, you have very specific problems to solve. Um, but you feel

26:21.560 --> 26:26.400
like you've had some wiggle room in there. I think that the problems are specific, but

26:26.400 --> 26:34.120
there's been several different solutions. And I've gone down one route and realized

26:34.120 --> 26:40.960
or seen that there could be several routes to achieve the same outcome. Um, sometimes

26:40.960 --> 26:45.600
I haven't seen all of them and I'm like, oh, oh wow, they've done it a completely different

26:45.600 --> 26:51.760
way to me. That's interesting. Um, so part of the thing in the course is they quite often

26:51.760 --> 26:59.160
give you like a 20 minute, very short exercise, um, fix this or make this, or they give you

26:59.160 --> 27:02.580
a webpage and they say, okay, make the buttons actually do what the buttons are supposed

27:02.580 --> 27:09.160
to do or something. Um, and the way I've done it has been one way and the way the teacher

27:09.160 --> 27:12.960
has done it is he sort of codes it out at the same time and then he lets you see it

27:12.960 --> 27:17.840
after the 20 minutes. So he stands there typing away, doing the same exercise as you are.

27:17.840 --> 27:20.960
And the way he's done it is completely different. And the way the person next to me has done

27:20.960 --> 27:25.920
it is completely different. And yet the end goal is achieved. Yeah. At one time I even

27:25.920 --> 27:31.200
managed to, I think more elegant one than the teacher. And I put some mine in like three

27:31.200 --> 27:35.720
lines of code in a nice little loop and he wrote all his out. Admittedly, I think he

27:35.720 --> 27:45.040
was distracted by eating Chick-fil-A at the time. But I think there's like, I find that

27:45.040 --> 27:53.240
to be, uh, it's something I really appreciate in coding. I did a little bit myself and um,

27:53.240 --> 27:59.960
that it can be so creative. Like most people who haven't had a taste of it yet don't see

27:59.960 --> 28:03.320
it as very creative. It's like, you know, you sit in front of a chair and type into

28:03.320 --> 28:08.040
a screen all day. But the reality is if you can wrap your mind around that problem and

28:08.040 --> 28:13.600
just dive right in, that creativity is like such an amazing outlet, right? To express

28:13.600 --> 28:19.080
yourself in many ways. Um, even though it may not seem like that to someone who hasn't

28:19.080 --> 28:24.560
had that opportunity. Yeah. I don't think I've got that until I'd dived in a little,

28:24.560 --> 28:31.840
a little deeper. Well, and I imagine the more complex your problems are, the more interesting

28:31.840 --> 28:37.160
your solution could be. And the more creative it maybe it needs to be. Yeah. Like sometimes

28:37.160 --> 28:42.600
the creative solutions are the most elegant looking ones. And sometimes they just look

28:42.600 --> 28:49.320
a bit janky. You hope to aim for the first one. Yeah, of course. Sometimes you have to

28:49.320 --> 28:56.520
get to the second one before you can loop back around. Yeah. That's great. I wanted

28:56.520 --> 29:04.160
to mention, uh, also that you and Alex had a bit of a, an anniversary yesterday, an unusual

29:04.160 --> 29:10.800
anniversary. Um, you had, you were, we were discussing that hard drive failure. Oh, yeah.

29:10.800 --> 29:16.920
That happened. And so Alex was telling me that, uh, and if you listen to the brunch

29:16.920 --> 29:22.360
that I did with Alex, he mentions this specific hard drive failure that happened to him on

29:22.360 --> 29:27.320
a Seagate drive. Was it eight years ago? Yes. Um, I don't think we're allowed to say the

29:27.320 --> 29:35.600
word Seagate in this house. And, uh, and that changed everything. Yeah. So how did that

29:35.600 --> 29:44.000
change everything? Um, so before that he was quite happy having, I don't think it occurred

29:44.000 --> 29:50.680
to him or us not to just have stuff, store it on a hard drive. It was as simple as that

29:50.680 --> 30:01.260
until this hard drive started going click. Yes. You know the sound too. And we lost everything

30:01.260 --> 30:05.480
that was on it. Oh. And it was one of a batch. They bought all the same hard drives and then

30:05.480 --> 30:10.200
the others started making click noises. And Alex was thinking, Oh no, I'm going to lose

30:10.200 --> 30:15.000
everything. Because the first one, all we lost was some ripped CDs or something. Oh,

30:15.000 --> 30:19.680
that's lucky. But they knew that on the other ones he had photographs on and he had things

30:19.680 --> 30:28.280
that were completely irreplaceable. So the hunt began for a better solution and he bought

30:28.280 --> 30:36.200
like a Synology NAS and, um, that then led to him thinking, no, this is, this isn't the

30:36.200 --> 30:42.920
best solution either. And this was back in, I don't know, about 2008. No, this would be

30:42.920 --> 30:50.500
2009, I think. Um, when I was doing teacher training. Of course. So I was pretty much

30:50.500 --> 30:55.720
out of the house and working all the time because if anyone else has done a PGCE in

30:55.720 --> 31:04.440
the UK, it's pretty full on. Okay. Um, so he was left with time and empty thought space

31:04.440 --> 31:13.840
to come up with a better solution. And he met online, met some, a chap called Steven

31:13.840 --> 31:25.000
from Georgia. And I always call him the dog cause he had an avatar of the dog. So in our

31:25.000 --> 31:32.800
house, if you ever hear conversation about the dog, it's not actually our dog. No. Um,

31:32.800 --> 31:41.560
so they started talking online and Alex just went into this headlong, deep dive into virtualization

31:41.560 --> 31:51.780
and having, um, virtual machines on his computer as his way of, um, solving problems and having

31:51.780 --> 31:59.320
multiple systems running and having, um, hard drives and backup hard drives. And, um, I

31:59.320 --> 32:04.880
can't remember the name of that system that he uses. It probably is constantly evolving.

32:04.880 --> 32:10.400
It has changed a few times and I've had it explained and I've been drawn diagrams and

32:10.400 --> 32:16.480
I just can't remember the name of it. And so that he was working as a genius at the

32:16.480 --> 32:24.120
Apple store at the time, just fixing computers, which he still likes to do. He was loving

32:24.120 --> 32:30.800
repairing my X250 that I got recently. He was having so much fun. Um, he's, he's now

32:30.800 --> 32:38.880
decided that he's going to buy broken computers and put them in our bonus room closet and

32:38.880 --> 32:46.000
just fix them when he feels bored or in need of some therapy or doing something physical

32:46.000 --> 32:54.680
with his hands. Um, so, and he did, he did all the virtualization and storage stuff and

32:54.680 --> 33:01.160
nazes with different dividers and I don't know, you can see how much I know about this

33:01.160 --> 33:08.520
stuff, um, in his own time. And he did all this virtualization stuff and he got really,

33:08.520 --> 33:14.200
really, really into it. And to the point where he was like, I need to know everything there

33:14.200 --> 33:18.600
could possibly be to know about this back in the day before Docker, before containers,

33:18.600 --> 33:23.440
before most of these things were done. And so then he had to play with hardware because

33:23.440 --> 33:29.040
a lot of the hardware you could buy at that point, you couldn't do virtualization on it.

33:29.040 --> 33:34.520
Oh, okay. Um, not like today when most golden ages are in, right? Yeah. Um, but back then

33:34.520 --> 33:38.440
he had, he had to swap out his motherboard for a different one for one that, and then

33:38.440 --> 33:42.400
they had to work out what was compatible with it. And so we went through a whole computer

33:42.400 --> 33:47.400
building era where we had to find the best components that we could actually do the virtualization

33:47.400 --> 33:53.400
that he wanted to do. And this conversation with this guy and all this learning led to

33:53.400 --> 34:00.880
him saying, yeah, I'm a genius. It's fun. I like fixing computers, but this isn't what

34:00.880 --> 34:08.680
I want to do. Um, his grandmother had passed away not that long in that period, not long

34:08.680 --> 34:15.840
before that. And she had left him some money, like 5,000 pounds. And it was actually his

34:15.840 --> 34:21.680
mom's idea. And she said, why don't you go back to university? And by the way, did you

34:21.680 --> 34:28.600
know that the course at the university of East Anglia is 5,000 pounds? That seems lucky

34:28.600 --> 34:35.600
or serendipitous. Yeah. So it just seemed like something that had to be done. And that

34:35.600 --> 34:40.720
kind of kickstarted his change of career. He still kept on being really interested in

34:40.720 --> 34:46.960
all the storage and still is, always has been. And when Docker came on the scene, he jumped

34:46.960 --> 34:53.760
in on that. If you look behind you, you can probably see the DockerCon whale. We're in

34:53.760 --> 35:01.280
Alex's office. Yeah. From back when he was so excited about that though. Um, he took,

35:01.280 --> 35:05.800
we both went to Barcelona to go to DockerCon cause he was desperate to go and find out

35:05.800 --> 35:13.800
everything container. Um, that's 2015, 2014. I don't know. It says on it somewhere. And

35:13.800 --> 35:21.800
all of that led to where you are now, right? Which is you've immigrated here and jumped

35:21.800 --> 35:28.480
from one, you know, from one continent to the next. Yes. Um, and now you're in the US

35:28.480 --> 35:35.040
and how is it being here? Uh, like, is there a culture difference? I know you mentioned

35:35.040 --> 35:41.240
before we had this conversation, you asked, should I try to speak more American during

35:41.240 --> 35:48.120
our conversation? Well, I've in the last year, I've got used to translating my inner thoughts,

35:48.120 --> 35:54.080
just the odd word, the odd concept and changing them for the American version, especially

35:54.080 --> 36:01.040
since I teach children, um, as young as four or five. If I started talking about my primary

36:01.040 --> 36:07.400
school or a rubber, they would have no idea what I was talking about. So I've trained

36:07.400 --> 36:14.000
myself to translate like, Oh, when I was in sixth grade at elementary school, even though

36:14.000 --> 36:22.400
I didn't, but translating it, translating all my words that have different ones. So

36:22.400 --> 36:28.520
you've picked up on like where people's give you strange looks, which words people don't

36:28.520 --> 36:29.520
quite.

36:29.520 --> 36:34.680
Most of the time. Occasionally, uh, I say one and everyone looks at you and it's ah,

36:34.680 --> 36:40.120
what's one I haven't. The other day I said paracetamol. Oh yeah. I know not what that

36:40.120 --> 36:46.320
is. Um, I think it's a set a minute friend here. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Yeah. I

36:46.320 --> 36:49.880
said that a couple of times and I realized that the person I was talking to was just

36:49.880 --> 36:55.400
looking at me, what's she talking about? I don't think they knew if it was a British

36:55.400 --> 37:01.080
thing or if it was just them not knowing something and they didn't want to say, I was actually

37:01.080 --> 37:06.080
talking about Calpol, which is paracetamol in like sugar syrup that you give to little

37:06.080 --> 37:11.360
kids because her, her two year old daughter was having earache and I was like, Oh, in

37:11.360 --> 37:17.880
England we'll just give them some Calpol. She was like, what's Calpol? What's paracetamol?

37:17.880 --> 37:22.400
I find those cultural differences like in language, they're pretty obvious, but there

37:22.400 --> 37:27.960
are also like cultural differences, which you may or may not have picked up on yet in

37:27.960 --> 37:35.800
like different, um, technological communities. Like I think what you'll begin to learn in

37:35.800 --> 37:41.600
your education is like each, um, each community based around different technologies have like

37:41.600 --> 37:48.120
these words and these like tendencies that are culture in themselves. And sometimes you

37:48.120 --> 37:52.760
have to like, uh, do the translation between them. If you're, if you're working between

37:52.760 --> 37:59.600
navigate between them from one to another, which I find totally fascinating. And I don't

37:59.600 --> 38:05.040
know why that is, but you know, I guess that's us as humans. We always want to put in our

38:05.040 --> 38:09.500
own personality on everything. Or no, we've both come up to the, come up with the same

38:09.500 --> 38:17.600
idea separately. I think that's, I think, I feel like that's a way a lot of the reason

38:17.600 --> 38:23.960
between the British American things different because they've just come up with it separately

38:23.960 --> 38:28.220
and given it different words. I think the words are easier to deal with than like the

38:28.220 --> 38:33.760
cultural differences. Can you give me an example of a cultural difference that feels trickier?

38:33.760 --> 38:41.640
I have to remember not to swear as much. Right. Especially in the south. Okay. Um, it's fine

38:41.640 --> 38:48.000
with your friends, but in Britain, I wouldn't feel too worried about swearing in front of

38:48.000 --> 38:55.760
like a parent or something. Right. Not obviously about, um, but I swear it's slipping in. I

38:55.760 --> 39:02.160
wouldn't, but I'm very careful not to cause it would, you'd get an odd look. A different

39:02.160 --> 39:07.800
reaction here. Yeah. It's like less accepted. Yeah. I feel like that. I've realized that

39:07.800 --> 39:13.360
British people swear a lot. So you're learning things about yourself as well. Yeah. I thought

39:13.360 --> 39:19.000
it was normal. Um, until I realized that other people didn't. Right. And like the conversations

39:19.000 --> 39:26.500
I have with my, my parents, I see people here like your parents like that. Yeah. Where that's

39:26.500 --> 39:32.080
just totally commonplace. Yeah. I think you'd find probably a similar reaction in

39:32.080 --> 39:40.760
Canada. Um, is that we approach the, the American acceptance of swearing, um, which I wonder

39:40.760 --> 39:48.080
like, does it make it more potent when you do use it? You know, if you're using it in

39:48.080 --> 39:54.480
regular conversation, does it lose a little bit of the, I think it does actually. Yeah.

39:54.480 --> 39:58.960
But if you hear someone else, then they don't normally cause they're a nice Southern person

39:58.960 --> 40:06.800
that can be brought up well and are very polite and you hear them, you're like, Whoa, that's

40:06.800 --> 40:13.240
kind of a shock. Right. That's fascinating. Yeah. I wanted to ask you a question. If you

40:13.240 --> 40:20.680
had an ask for anybody who's listening, something you'd like them to try or think about or do

40:20.680 --> 40:26.280
perhaps. Um, is there something that comes to mind? So one of the things I was, I was

40:26.280 --> 40:36.280
doing before I moved here, um, was I was actually a humanist celebrant. Really? Can you describe

40:36.280 --> 40:42.300
what a humanist celebrant is for? Um, so they conduct, in my case, funerals, but they can

40:42.300 --> 40:50.360
do baby namings and weddings. Um, you will also need a person in the UK from the council.

40:50.360 --> 40:56.440
If you're doing having a wedding, they haven't had it, so you don't need that yet, but, um,

40:56.440 --> 41:05.560
and they could up ceremonies and they have particular worldview that is not related to

41:05.560 --> 41:12.500
government and it's not related to religion and just believes that you should be good

41:12.500 --> 41:19.160
for your own sake, for the sake of the wider community that you live in. Um, the world

41:19.160 --> 41:25.360
community, your local community and that, yeah, it's devoid from other things and it's

41:25.360 --> 41:31.120
sort of a way of looking at the world and being good to animals and humans and plants

41:31.120 --> 41:38.800
and just trying to be a good person. So being truly all inclusive. Yeah. Um, I would say

41:38.800 --> 41:43.760
if anybody hasn't heard of that, that they should look it up and check it out cause I

41:43.760 --> 41:48.600
think it's amazing. Well, can I ask you a little bit more about it? Yeah, sure. Um,

41:48.600 --> 41:55.480
well first, what attracted you to, to diving into this topic? And, uh, honestly, my, it

41:55.480 --> 42:06.800
was when my dad died and he was very staunchly, aggressively atheist. I'm not saying humanists,

42:06.800 --> 42:15.800
I'm not saying I am. Um, but we were struggling to think of what to do for his funeral service

42:15.800 --> 42:21.440
and not to include anything that he wouldn't want. Because they're typically tied to a

42:21.440 --> 42:25.820
religion or some kind of. They usually are tied to a religion even now. And you get these

42:25.820 --> 42:31.040
people that have not really been a church in 20 years and they end up having a priest

42:31.040 --> 42:37.440
that doesn't know them. So do a funeral service. And that led us to searching on the internet

42:37.440 --> 42:43.480
and finding out about these humanist services, which can be, they're very, very bespoke.

42:43.480 --> 42:50.760
Um, and they can be anything you want and they can show the person's personality. Um,

42:50.760 --> 42:54.600
there's been some, when I did my training, I heard about all these random ones of people

42:54.600 --> 43:01.840
got brought up in their, um, their rally car, um, and their coffin was sort of jammed in

43:01.840 --> 43:07.640
the back and they drove it into the crematorium and they had no speeches, but they just had

43:07.640 --> 43:15.320
40 minutes of metal music. Yeah. That's what I wanted. Fine. Wow. So it sounds like a way

43:15.320 --> 43:20.760
of really personalizing the entire process. Yeah. It can be whatever, which sounds like

43:20.760 --> 43:26.080
that's kind of the point anyways, right? Yeah. Um, so that's about the type of services you

43:26.080 --> 43:33.000
get for the humanists do. But when I found out more about it, I realized it wasn't just

43:33.000 --> 43:38.320
a service that you could go online and order a person to come and do your funeral service.

43:38.320 --> 43:42.520
Although we did have a chap come to our house and he was absolutely lovely. It was, he was

43:42.520 --> 43:52.600
a retired vet and um, as in veterinarian, not as in veteran. Um, and see translation.

43:52.600 --> 43:59.520
Yes. Uh, he came to our house and he was one of the nicest people ever. And he was, and

43:59.520 --> 44:06.000
we could just, he let us do what we wanted and wrote this unbelievably pleasant tribute

44:06.000 --> 44:12.320
of a man he hadn't met, but he, he talked to us for like an hour and a half and found

44:12.320 --> 44:17.760
out everything he could and just got a picture of my dad and made this wonderful thing. That

44:17.760 --> 44:24.280
sounds like quite a skill in itself. It's like getting to know someone that deeply and

44:24.280 --> 44:31.720
to be able to reflect their personality in a way that even their loved ones find touching.

44:31.720 --> 44:32.720
That sounds like a real gift.

44:32.720 --> 44:36.860
And that was most of what the training was focused on was actually that interviewing

44:36.860 --> 44:46.160
skills and um, writing skills and taking that information and writing it into a document.

44:46.160 --> 44:51.720
Um, but when I found out more that it wasn't just a, you know, pay for a man to come to

44:51.720 --> 44:57.240
do your thing, that it was actually just this whole way of life that it, it isn't a religion,

44:57.240 --> 45:05.080
it isn't a political, it's just a, a view of the world. That's really very nice. And

45:05.080 --> 45:10.520
you can pick and choose and you don't have to, you're not like, I am a humanist. Like

45:10.520 --> 45:14.600
it's just, you don't go to, it's not like you go to meetings. It's not like becoming

45:14.600 --> 45:20.680
a Jehovah's witness or something that you have to assign yourself to this. It's just

45:20.680 --> 45:28.680
a way of looking at the world. And it's just a very, very uplifting way of looking at the

45:28.680 --> 45:34.520
world. They believe you have one life and it's up to you to do the best you can and

45:34.520 --> 45:43.720
to enjoy it and to live it the best you can and to, and um, not worry about the rules

45:43.720 --> 45:50.520
of a religion or of a country. It's to worry about the people closest to you, the animals,

45:50.520 --> 45:56.200
the plants, your environment, are you doing the best you can for them? Are you improving

45:56.200 --> 46:00.360
the lives of those around you? Yeah. What an important question for all of us, right?

46:00.360 --> 46:05.400
Yeah. Um, with, you know, you can apply it pretty broadly too. Like just as you were

46:05.400 --> 46:09.160
speaking, I was thinking, okay, you could apply that to your closest loved ones, of course.

46:09.160 --> 46:14.600
But when you mentioned things like environment and plants and animals and things like that,

46:14.600 --> 46:18.440
it feels like, okay, well you could apply that also to Archie, your dog, right? And

46:18.440 --> 46:23.720
you can apply it to the direct environment around you, like your yard or something like

46:23.720 --> 46:29.400
that, but also to the greater environment. Like look at what is a hot topic now of, you

46:29.400 --> 46:36.280
know, the climate crisis and things like that. So, um, it sounds almost like a personalized

46:36.280 --> 46:42.360
philosophy. Yeah. In a way that you get to craft and change as you evolve as well.

46:43.240 --> 46:48.680
Definitely. That you can apply in a really positive way. Yeah. And it's not prescriptive.

46:48.680 --> 46:55.240
Right. And it's not rules sent down from somebody or something above. It's from,

46:55.240 --> 47:01.080
you're only doing it for yourself. It's like introspective. Yeah. Well, since I went through

47:01.080 --> 47:06.840
this journey, I've consciously found myself thinking, no, that that's being a bit selfish.

47:07.960 --> 47:13.880
No, you can do better than that. And trying to be a better, nicer person. So it sounds like it's

47:13.880 --> 47:18.760
really pushed you in all the right directions. Yeah. In many ways, you know, and you get to

47:18.760 --> 47:24.920
define what right means in that context. Yeah, exactly. Well, thank you that I'm going to have

47:24.920 --> 47:31.720
to dive in more with that, but that sounds like a really important place to put your mind and heart

47:32.280 --> 47:36.920
to start some kind of adventure. Right? Yeah, definitely. That's great. Um,

47:36.920 --> 47:40.520
Katherine, thank you so much for sitting down with me and doing this chat. It's been

47:41.080 --> 47:47.160
super lovely and I hope people really enjoy our conversation. It's gone in places that we didn't

47:47.160 --> 47:52.280
expect and that's the best part. I think that's really a treat. So, so thanks for being on the

47:52.280 --> 48:01.160
journey with me.
