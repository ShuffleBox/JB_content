Hi everyone, Joe here with another User Error Extra. This time it's a conversation that

00:10.120 --> 00:14.700
I didn't want to put in the main show. It was a conversation that we kind of needed

00:14.700 --> 00:21.340
to have and we're going to have regardless and I thought let's record it and see how

00:21.340 --> 00:27.320
it works out and maybe release it as an extra. I didn't want to put current events in User

00:27.320 --> 00:31.360
Error. That's not what the show is about. The show is supposed to be entertainment and

00:31.360 --> 00:37.240
it's supposed to take your mind off things. But I knew that if we didn't have this conversation

00:37.240 --> 00:43.840
before we recorded the main show then the current events would slip into the show somehow.

00:43.840 --> 00:47.960
I didn't actually tell Dan and Poppy what my plan was. I just asked them the question

00:47.960 --> 00:52.120
once we'd started recording and kind of had in the back of my mind that maybe it'd work

00:52.120 --> 00:58.200
as an extra and so that's why at the beginning of a recent episode you heard Dan say that

00:58.200 --> 01:02.000
they'd been tricked into recording an extra but I checked with them and they said it was

01:02.000 --> 01:09.000
fine to put it out. So without further ado, let's hear it.

01:09.000 --> 01:14.420
What do you think is going to change as a result of all of this virus business? Is working

01:14.420 --> 01:19.160
from home going to become the norm? Is that going to be the answer to climate change or

01:19.160 --> 01:22.840
are people just going to go back to normal when it gets back to normal?

01:22.840 --> 01:27.440
I think a lot of people will go back to normal but I think people will have that realization

01:27.440 --> 01:33.520
that actually is technically possible for a lot of people. Yes, I know some people can't

01:33.520 --> 01:38.840
but a lot of people can actually technically work from home and also the fact that the

01:38.840 --> 01:46.480
kids can be schooled from home. I know some people school from home already but my kids,

01:46.480 --> 01:54.280
Sam has been sat there with iPad out and being set work and normally he'd be sat in the classroom

01:54.280 --> 01:58.560
with a bunch of his mates but he's actually in his bedroom working.

01:58.560 --> 02:02.680
But isn't school about interacting with other kids and learning life lessons rather than

02:02.680 --> 02:07.520
learning the actual school work? Well, it's a bit of both really. I think what it might

02:07.520 --> 02:13.120
end up being is people realize that a proportion of work can be done remotely. It doesn't have

02:13.120 --> 02:20.000
to be 100% on site. Maybe one day a week they stop going to school and maybe they work from

02:20.000 --> 02:25.000
home. There's 20% of your carbon footprint knocked on the head in one go.

02:25.000 --> 02:29.260
Yeah, definitely would be interesting to see if more people are just straight up working

02:29.260 --> 02:32.160
from home or if there's more of like a hybrid approach.

02:32.160 --> 02:36.280
I think you're probably right that hybrid approach will be what it is and it might be

02:36.280 --> 02:43.440
half and half maybe and you'll schedule days that you need to work together or whatever

02:43.440 --> 02:48.640
and it'll be, I don't know, maybe it'll be the norm to mostly work from home because

02:48.640 --> 02:53.080
what I'm wondering is who is going to be the first office to say, right, everyone come

02:53.080 --> 02:57.360
back in then. No one's going to want to be that firm, are they?

02:57.360 --> 02:58.840
No, I think they'll all do that.

02:58.840 --> 03:01.720
Yeah, I think they will too. They won't give a shit.

03:01.720 --> 03:06.960
But I do think there's the possibility that this is going to be beneficial for the employer

03:06.960 --> 03:13.040
as well because those days that someone might stay at home when the gas man is coming or

03:13.040 --> 03:18.960
when they need to have their boiler serviced or whatever it might be, rather than taking

03:18.960 --> 03:23.280
a day off and not being able to do any work because they're at home, maybe they'll organise

03:23.280 --> 03:27.720
it so actually you can work from home on the day when you have to be there, like whatever

03:27.720 --> 03:35.160
the life thing is that you have to do and the employee benefits because they don't have

03:35.160 --> 03:39.480
to take a day off to do it and the employer benefits because you're not losing a day's

03:39.480 --> 03:43.160
productivity out of someone. Yeah, okay, it might be slightly different productivity and

03:43.160 --> 03:47.760
they can't come into meetings and stuff but there will be proof that it manifestly is

03:47.760 --> 03:50.520
possible because for months we'll have been doing it.

03:50.520 --> 03:57.640
Yeah, I wonder how many people will not be taking sick time or PTO when they just don't

03:57.640 --> 04:00.960
want to come into the office and be like, you know, I'm feeling a little bit under the

04:00.960 --> 04:02.600
weather today, I'm just going to work from home today.

04:02.600 --> 04:09.400
I think companies will certainly enact policies. I think it will be employee-led, there will

04:09.400 --> 04:15.120
be employees pushing from the bottom and innovative companies will push from the top and say,

04:15.120 --> 04:20.000
hey, it really works during coronavirus, we're going to do a sea change. I mean, they could

04:20.000 --> 04:25.120
reduce their office size, they can reduce the infrastructure that they need inside those

04:25.120 --> 04:29.920
offices and reduce their carbon footprint, all the things that people want to do, reduce

04:29.920 --> 04:34.600
their costs, you know, if they've got an expensive office in a central city. There's so many

04:34.600 --> 04:41.260
things about working remotely that even if you only do it half the time, everyone benefits.

04:41.260 --> 04:46.320
How wild would it be if more offices just like rented a co-working space every once

04:46.320 --> 04:50.480
in a while, you just kind of had a rotating schedule and one company shares, you know,

04:50.480 --> 04:53.920
an office building with five other companies and they just each go in one different day?

04:53.920 --> 04:58.960
Yeah, I don't doubt that those companies that run those type of places are going to be showing

04:58.960 --> 05:05.160
research after all this calms down that, you know, co-working places are the best way to,

05:05.160 --> 05:09.120
you know, optimize your homeworking, you know, strike that balance between someone working

05:09.120 --> 05:13.420
at home and working in an office because you get the benefit of being in a room with other

05:13.420 --> 05:19.840
people and you're not traveling a long distance into the office maybe. I don't know. I think

05:19.840 --> 05:20.840
you're right.

05:20.840 --> 05:25.880
What's that going to mean for the price of rents and property, commercial property in

05:25.880 --> 05:31.740
central locations? If there are fewer people working in those locations, then each office

05:31.740 --> 05:36.240
will scale down or be looking to scale down or share spaces or whatever. So there'll just

05:36.240 --> 05:40.760
be less demand. So does that mean that the price will go down and therefore will housing

05:40.760 --> 05:43.360
go down as well closer to the center?

05:43.360 --> 05:44.360
Possibly.

05:44.360 --> 05:51.440
I don't know because I feel like that there's so many places that are just vacant even before

05:51.440 --> 05:57.120
all this, where the landlords didn't want to lower the rent and they were like, well,

05:57.120 --> 06:01.400
we think we can get this much for it. And they're just vacant for like years. It's weird.

06:01.400 --> 06:05.160
You'd think they would just lower the prices, but they just like hold out.

06:05.160 --> 06:09.360
Not in the UK because they brought in a law that says that if you are the landlord of

06:09.360 --> 06:16.240
a commercial premises and it's vacant, I think if it's vacant at all, you have to pay the

06:16.240 --> 06:21.120
business rates, which is like one of the taxes you have to pay for a business. And so that's

06:21.120 --> 06:25.880
normally paid for by the tenant. But if it's empty, then the landlord has to pay it. So

06:25.880 --> 06:30.200
not only are they not getting income, it's actually actively costing them money. And

06:30.200 --> 06:34.960
so that is the incentive to lower the rents and get businesses in there.

06:34.960 --> 06:41.440
So one of the things Canonical did in London is we downsized the head office. We had like,

06:41.440 --> 06:48.120
I don't know, a half of a floor in a building. And because some people work from home and

06:48.120 --> 06:54.920
then some people left and maybe weren't replaced, then we had a lot of people quite spread out

06:54.920 --> 07:00.780
in half a floor of a fairly sizable building. So they squished everyone up a little bit.

07:00.780 --> 07:05.640
It's not like super compact, it's like reasonable space. But they squished everyone up a little

07:05.640 --> 07:11.480
bit, got rid of a few meeting rooms and carved off a chunk. And that's I don't know, legally

07:11.480 --> 07:14.560
how they've done it, whether it's sublet or they've given it back to the building. But

07:14.560 --> 07:18.680
there's now an additional company now in that building in central London. So maybe that's

07:18.680 --> 07:24.120
the way you do it. Because you downsize your company, move to another office or shrink

07:24.120 --> 07:28.480
the office you're in and either sublet it out to somebody else or turn that into co-working

07:28.480 --> 07:32.960
space. And other people could come and maybe your or some of your people could use that

07:32.960 --> 07:37.440
as co-working space. But also you could have other people coming in and using it as co-working

07:37.440 --> 07:42.000
space. So I don't necessarily think that the downsizing will necessarily be a bad thing

07:42.000 --> 07:47.680
for rent because people will still want spaces to meet with people, I think.

07:47.680 --> 07:55.320
And maybe people who otherwise couldn't afford big offices in town, they can afford a smaller

07:55.320 --> 08:02.560
one. So maybe it'll work. I still think that there will be, instead of a premium on premises

08:02.560 --> 08:08.840
and houses in town, I think the premium will start to shift towards decent internet and

08:08.840 --> 08:14.320
infrastructure and house prices. I'm not saying it'll be the only factor, but I think that

08:14.320 --> 08:20.560
going forward, people will be seriously looking at the potential internet speed of houses.

08:20.560 --> 08:25.300
And before it was just, oh, it's got broadband, that's fine. If that was 20 megabit, now that

08:25.300 --> 08:28.960
they'll be thinking, well, that's not good enough. I only want to live somewhere that's

08:28.960 --> 08:35.240
like 50 or 100 plus. And maybe that will now be a factor on the cost of housing.

08:35.240 --> 08:39.040
I don't know anyone who doesn't factor the speed of their broadband into-

08:39.040 --> 08:44.880
Yeah, because you work in IT. But normal people just, you know, has it got internet? Has it

08:44.880 --> 08:48.920
got broadband? Yeah. Okay. And then they, you know, they just deal with like six or

08:48.920 --> 08:51.680
10 megabit DSL or whatever.

08:51.680 --> 08:56.440
Yeah. I definitely think I agree with Joe that I don't think the majority of people

08:56.440 --> 09:04.520
really understand how much bandwidth is or what things require or like, I don't even

09:04.520 --> 09:09.500
really know anything about like, what does a reasonable latency? Like, I don't know.

09:09.500 --> 09:14.520
So I think that that's not something that people really understand. And I don't know

09:14.520 --> 09:20.180
if this will necessarily get them to understand. They'll just be like, well, it didn't work.

09:20.180 --> 09:21.860
The internet's not good.

09:21.860 --> 09:27.800
Maybe the internet providers, the broadband providers will have a work from home package

09:27.800 --> 09:34.040
that like optimizes zoom and hangouts and, you know, video chat stuff, optimizes that

09:34.040 --> 09:39.840
traffic. And, you know, during the during the day and Netflix during the evening or

09:39.840 --> 09:44.960
something like that, you know, maybe, maybe they'll start marketing towards those people

09:44.960 --> 09:50.880
who are looking to work from home and have their little office. Maybe people will start

09:50.880 --> 09:59.120
advertising, you know, better office equipment for home, like tailored for home that has,

09:59.120 --> 10:02.960
you know, a nice laptop desk and you know, that stuff that is already there, but they'll

10:02.960 --> 10:09.920
be marketed directly towards people who want to work from home. I think we'll probably

10:09.920 --> 10:11.720
see more of that as well.

10:11.720 --> 10:15.600
You know, what I'm really interested to see is how many people just absolutely blow through

10:15.600 --> 10:21.600
their data caps, like every month, because that's the thing that not so much here, but

10:21.600 --> 10:24.240
in America, that's pretty standard to have a cap, isn't it?

10:24.240 --> 10:29.080
Yeah. And luckily, the provider that I have doesn't have a cap. But when I had Comcast,

10:29.080 --> 10:36.080
like we had, I don't know, three, four people using it, and we would be at or, or above

10:36.080 --> 10:40.160
our data cap, like almost every month and had to start telling people like, hey, okay,

10:40.160 --> 10:44.240
like we need to figure out how to not, you know, watch as many movies or whatever is

10:44.240 --> 10:47.240
going on, because we're going to get charged pretty quick here.

10:47.240 --> 10:51.880
Yeah, I have read that that is surely going to happen that they're going to have to lift

10:51.880 --> 10:57.680
those caps, at least temporarily. It's interesting how all the things that you think are set

10:57.680 --> 11:06.840
in stone in life have suddenly been changed. Like, I think yesterday, I saw a tweet from

11:06.840 --> 11:15.280
the transport minister that the annual motor vehicle testing, because people can't leave

11:15.280 --> 11:19.320
their house and can't take their car to a garage and have it tested, that's just going

11:19.320 --> 11:26.640
to be extended for six months. So if your car after 30th of March is due for its MOT

11:26.640 --> 11:32.520
test, then you just get extended for six months. Mine's due on the 28th of March. So I'm a

11:32.520 --> 11:34.160
little bit salty about that.

11:34.160 --> 11:38.600
I'm a little confused personally about what to do with my residential parking permit,

11:38.600 --> 11:44.320
because the Department of Revenue is closed. So I can't go in to submit my documents to

11:44.320 --> 11:49.920
get a new one. And it expires at the end of the month. So I have no idea who the hell's

11:49.920 --> 11:53.080
going to come around and give you a ticket. There's like nobody working. It's not like,

11:53.080 --> 11:57.760
I don't know, is a traffic enforcement officers out in the street? I don't know. I mean, that's

11:57.760 --> 12:01.800
the question is like, there's been no statements. There's not even information. They didn't

12:01.800 --> 12:06.240
even say on the website that we're going to be closed. It's weird. So it's like, I don't

12:06.240 --> 12:08.760
know what's going to happen. Am I just going to get tickets all of a sudden and then have

12:08.760 --> 12:12.200
to be like, Oh, okay. Well, you weren't even open. How am I supposed to get a pass? We're

12:12.200 --> 12:13.200
living in weird times.

12:13.200 --> 12:19.120
That's what I mean. It's like, everything's up for grabs. Everything can be changed. Suddenly

12:19.120 --> 12:24.240
my wife gets furloughed from work. She just gets an email that says, Hey, you've been

12:24.240 --> 12:29.520
furloughed. Stay at home. Don't come in. You'll be paid 80% of your salary up to two and a

12:29.520 --> 12:35.080
half thousand, whatever, whichever, you know, and that's it. Like she's been knocking around

12:35.080 --> 12:38.840
the house thinking, what the hell am I supposed to do? I, you know, I was working last week.

12:38.840 --> 12:44.720
I was going to work and now I'm sat at home and the house is tidier than it's ever been.

12:44.720 --> 12:47.600
I can tell you. So yeah, that's quite good.

12:47.600 --> 12:52.880
It's really weird for me. Like I'm just stuck in the house all the time, just making podcasts

12:52.880 --> 12:57.320
and sitting on my ass drinking and occasionally going out for a walk at night. It's my life

12:57.320 --> 13:01.760
has just been turned upside down by this.
