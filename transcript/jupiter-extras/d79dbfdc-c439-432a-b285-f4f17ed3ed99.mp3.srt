1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,880
Welcome to the Dystopia. I just had my whole world

2
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:21,720
shaked. Just shook and ran underneath me. I'm still processing what I was just told.

3
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,520
You're also putting your money where your mouth is. You're planning to accept salary

4
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:28,800
in Bitcoin. It's rather interesting that the new mayor-elect here, Eric Adams, is...

5
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,360
So they're taking salary in Bitcoin in Miami, the mayor is, and now they've launched Miami

6
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,360
Coin.

7
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,320
First, we become friends, and we joke with each other and kid each other all the time.

8
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:42,920
And so maybe it's difficult for him to do it. It's very easy for me to do it. So I don't

9
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:48,120
know if there's a generational thing there or something that's going on.

10
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,120
He's an old mayor.

11
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:55,000
We use an app called Strike, and that allows us to convert it instantly. So it's like a

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,900
direct deposit feature. So it actually directly deposits the money into a digital wallet.

13
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:05,120
And so it's very easy for us to do. And I'm doing it with a variety of different cryptocurrencies

14
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:09,000
on my mayoral salary. And I think, you know, things like putting the Satoshi White Paper

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,640
on our website, we're the first city in the country to do that.

16
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,800
So he wants to make Miami competitive by going all in on crypto.

17
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:19,440
Paying our employees in Bitcoin. We've already paid multiple employees in Bitcoin, including

18
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:24,680
myself. Allowing our residents to pay for fees and taxes in Bitcoin. And then, of course,

19
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:28,220
the Miami coin, which now created a New York coin after the Miami coin.

20
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:32,760
The Miami coin. So you can get paid in Bitcoin. You can pay your taxes in Bitcoin and you

21
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:37,760
can buy and trade the Miami coin. How about this?

22
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:41,440
And then, of course, the Miami coin, which now created a New York coin after the Miami

23
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:46,540
coin, which has generated 30 million dollars in revenue in three months from the mining

24
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,080
revenue that gets put into our digital wallet.

25
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:54,520
30 million dollars in three months for the Miami coin. I want to know, would you buy

26
00:01:54,520 --> 00:02:01,760
a coin for your city? Where the nearest city to you? Would you would you buy your local

27
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,760
coin?

28
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:07,360
Ours in revenue in three months from the mining revenue that gets put into our digital wallet.

29
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,800
We're staking that and we're going to give every one of our citizens a Bitcoin dividend

30
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,280
on a quarterly basis. So now they're going to have money in their pocket from innovation

31
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,680
of the city, but they're going to learn about Bitcoin as well.

32
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:23,360
They're going to give a Bitcoin dividend to the to Miami citizens. I'm having a hard time

33
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,120
even processing these words.

34
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:32,800
Mayor talk to me from a big picture perspective. A lot of critics would say, OK, the appeal

35
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,440
is cost of living. It's the good weather. It's low taxes. Right. But eventually with

36
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:44,760
the flock of people, you're going to need to get better housing, fix, get better schools,

37
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,680
fix the roads, fix the bridges. With that is going to eventually become higher taxes.

38
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:53,040
And it's just going to be this revolving circle. What is the case really that you can make

39
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,160
to stand out for the long term?

40
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,800
I'm laughing because I love when the sense begins to critics say, right, dot, dot, dot.

41
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,720
But for us, it's actually been a completely different story. We've reduced taxes to the

42
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,080
second lowest level since the 1960s. Obviously, we don't have a state income tax and our budget

43
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:13,820
has doubled in size. So the people who think that you have to raise taxes to increase the

44
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:17,800
size of your budget are completely wrong. The more you increase taxes, the more people

45
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,360
are going to flee, which is what we're seeing in some of these high tax states. And then

46
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,760
you're going to lose revenue, which is going to create a budget hole. It becomes sort of

47
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,840
a vicious cycle. So for us, we've seen the exact opposite scenario by having more revenue

48
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,680
in our coffers by reducing taxes. Now we've been able to increase policing while many

49
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,560
cities across America have defunded their police. And guess what happened? They know

50
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,080
it's going to shock you. Crime went down in the city. So while the murder rate is going

51
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:45,360
up across America, it's actually decreasing in the city of Miami. So we're starting to

52
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,880
see these counter narratives. And so they're in there. They're using the Bitcoin to fund

53
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:53,800
certain city initiatives. They're giving a dividend. They have a Miami coin that's gone

54
00:03:53,800 --> 00:04:01,320
to 30 million dollars in three months. There's a lot to process. There's a lot. Optimus Gray

55
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:07,320
says his met his nearest city would be St. Louis. So not going to do it for him. A Seattle

56
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:14,600
coin. I'd have to see outperforms. What would you base it on? The entire thing is completely

57
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:21,920
new to me. I wonder if I could find anything else about it. The greatest investment, the

58
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:26,720
greatest newest investment, Miami coin, you've got to be shitting me. Miami coin. All right.

59
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,360
Here's the coverage of the launch. Let's see what we have.

60
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,440
That Miami coin will set the city up for that lofty long term goal. The cryptocurrency was

61
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:40,040
born out of a project with a nonprofit called City Coins. According to its founders, anyone

62
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:45,800
can download the software, hop on a computer to mint those new coins. The miner keeps 70

63
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:51,200
percent of the profits and the rest goes straight to the city's wallet. And like OK, OK, all

64
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:56,880
right. So a miner keeps 70 percent of the profits. All right. This is that's the key

65
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:02,080
details here. 70 percent of the profits and the rest goes straight to the city's wallet.

66
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:07,760
And like other crypto currencies, Miami coin also trades on an exchange so people can invest

67
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:12,960
in it. This one hit an all time high of just around five cents. It is the first and so

68
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,640
far the only test case of this idea. But since August, the cryptocurrency has brought in

69
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:22,880
just over 10 million dollars for Miami. That's more than three times what officials say.

70
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:29,040
This is this, by the way, is as of I should mention, because this was a recorded theater

71
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:34,240
mode without make it display better for you guys. My cat, my capture device is dying,

72
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:40,000
so I can't play real time video for you. It's a slow, pathetic death to 10 million as of

73
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:50,440
October 5th, and now he's saying 30 million. Hmm. So you get to keep 70 percent. The rest

74
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:55,680
goes to the city to essentially pay for city services or however they're going to spend

75
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:02,480
it. Some cities will probably not spend it very well. But that allows them to back off

76
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:08,120
on paying taxes, theoretically, of course, they'd probably just do both. It's an interesting

77
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:13,280
idea. OK, I guess the more I hear about it, the less I'm hating it, but I'm still feeling

78
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,480
like it's some sort of weird, dystopian future. They forecast it. The city's mayor and a Bitcoin

79
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:24,000
believer, Francis Suarez, says at the current pace it could bring in as much as 60 million

80
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,360
dollars for Miami and eventually subsidize or even replace taxes. But he says Miami's

81
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:35,040
still holding the coins in escrow for a couple months. He says they're doing more due diligence

82
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:39,620
before Miami can start spending these coins. We're going to hold them for a while to make

83
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:44,040
sure that there are no issues related to the technology, and then we can work on a variety

84
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:49,680
of different ideas that we have to make our city better, including educational ideas,

85
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:55,080
including affordable housing and including a lot of issues that, you know, we obviously

86
00:06:55,080 --> 00:07:00,320
as cities across America would love to have more resources to help solve. The project

87
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:05,200
comes with its share of challenges. There are price fluctuations, regulatory questions

88
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:10,320
at the federal level and even money laundering concerns, to name a few. City coins are the

89
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:16,480
latest sign of growing competition to attract the fast growing digital industry and digital

90
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:20,880
asset industries. Suarez has billed Miami as the crypto capital of the country, but

91
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:27,200
Austin, Texas, and Cheyenne, Wyoming are among those also competing to attract crypto companies.

92
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:51,280
Sources tell me Austin and New York are on the shortlist for their own city coin. Well,

93
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:56,240
you're going to see a lot of different implementations possibly, and one of them inevitably, or many

94
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,200
of them will have corruption. And then you will have a currency that the city is creating

95
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:08,320
or an asset being created by the state or the local city that is involved with money

96
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:17,440
laundering and fraud. And these coins, what they'll do is they'll be pumped up in value

97
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:24,600
initially. This is going to be a thing. This is going to be bad for Bitcoin because these

98
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:30,200
coins will initially take off like rockets, like the Miami coin is and others. Miami coin

99
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:36,240
will probably be the strongest because there is a first mover's advantage here. Oh boy.

100
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,640
And then what's going to happen is all the other cities are going to start getting, well,

101
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:44,560
a lot of other cities will start getting involved, states and cities, it's going to be a mess.

102
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:52,520
And you're going to see this happen. As they go up in value, the city officials, the people

103
00:08:52,520 --> 00:09:00,640
running, the managing their part of it will use that inflated temporary price to buy Bitcoin.

104
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:05,420
They're going to turn it around and convert that into Bitcoin and they'll buy Bitcoin

105
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:09,400
when their price is at a premium. And then when they start doing that and they start

106
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:14,840
selling and they start buying the Bitcoin to do it, they have to sell to buy the Bitcoin,

107
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:19,340
that's going to start to crash the price. So the cities will cash out and they'll move

108
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:24,280
this into Bitcoin, the price will drop and it'll artificially inflate the price of Bitcoin

109
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:29,160
while they do it. Then as the value of all these currencies tumbles, after a while they'll

110
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:34,960
all start to tumble. Then the very price that propped up Bitcoin will start to crumble and

111
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:42,800
it'll affect the price of Bitcoin as well. It's going to be a mess. And we do not have

112
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:48,780
a federal government that is capable of properly managing this because there are elements of

113
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:58,760
this I could get on board with. If my local county had a coin, I know this sounds crazy,

114
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:04,760
but I would, I would, if, if I could do something that would help raise revenue for my local

115
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:09,400
county and I could also maybe make a little money, that does seem like there's something

116
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:17,280
to that idea. Um, but I'm pretty skeptical of the implementation. And I suppose if I

117
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:24,800
lived in downtown Seattle and if they raised revenue via cryptocurrency to help with the

118
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,340
homeless population or something, that would be something that I think a lot of my citizens

119
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:36,060
would be compelled by. So that, that shared goal would add value. It would, that would

120
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:41,240
be value created by the Seattle coin. If, if the city of Seattle said, we're going to

121
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:48,840
use these funds to help build homeless camps and set up shelters for the homeless and feed

122
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:57,280
them, a lot of us would think that's a worthy cause. And I could see that adding intrinsic

123
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:02,880
value to something that would otherwise be valueless. If supporting your city is valuable

124
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,120
to you and you can achieve that through a cryptocurrency, I could see some people adopting

125
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:12,560
that and you could even see like local businesses that use the Seattle coin and they get a special

126
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,780
kickback, a special, special percentage from the city. I mean, you could see how far this

127
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:23,580
could go. I don't know if I think it's a good idea or not though. It feels like, it feels

128
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:28,400
like instead of having one true currency, we're going to have thousands and you'll have

129
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:33,020
some big cryptocurrencies that are essentially the primary stores of value that everybody's

130
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:36,000
going to move things in and out of. And you're going to have all these other cryptocurrencies

131
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,120
that are popping off and dying and popping off. It's going to be stocks times a hundred,

132
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:46,480
right? Because the volatility, the speed at which it moves and the global nature and the

133
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:52,680
24 seven aspect of it, right? Because who says a rich billionaire in Russia couldn't

134
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:57,040
go buy up a ton of Miami coin and start effing with the market. I bet you there's nothing

135
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,980
that says you have to be in Miami to own that coin, right? So you could start to see how

136
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:05,060
people could really manipulate this thing and how that would force some sort of federal

137
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:09,440
regulation. And then we get into a state versus federal rights thing. And that's also going

138
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:15,280
to be just a huge political mess. Political lines will be drawn and sides will be declared.

139
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:19,480
That's what I suspect will happen. Miami's kicking it off. Austin's next and New York's

140
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:25,000
on the list. So it's coming. Wonder how long until Portland or Seattle or San Francisco

141
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:54,840
around there. To make those new coins, the miner keeps

142
00:12:54,840 --> 00:13:00,040
70 percent of the profits and the rest goes straight to the city's wallet. If you're just

143
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:04,960
joining us, we've been talking about Miami coin launching. It launched earlier this year.

144
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:09,960
Miami now has their own cryptocurrency that's around 30 million dollars. They're letting

145
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:15,880
citizens pay for taxes in Miami coin or Bitcoin. And some of the city staff, including the

146
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:22,880
mayor, are taking some or all of their paychecks in Bitcoin. Miami says that they can use some

147
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,560
of the funds raised to pay for things like police enforcement and other things that have

148
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:31,560
been defunded recently. So the question I've been asking the chat room is, would you buy

149
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:36,300
a local city coin? Now, Avath in here says that there's no such thing as fixing social

150
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:42,420
problems and using crypto at the same time. And I think he probably knows I kind of disagree

151
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:49,160
with that. My mindset is you have a technology which is amoral and then you have how people

152
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:53,280
use it. And this is a universal debate we have about all kinds of things, but it is

153
00:13:53,280 --> 00:14:00,200
100 percent applicable to crypto currencies as well. You could look at Bitcoin as just

154
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:06,500
a volatile asset that can be a store of wealth and not a currency. And if I think if you

155
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:12,200
start looking at things like Ethereum or Miami coin or Bitcoin as an asset comparable to

156
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:17,200
gold and silver, but digital equivalents, you might start to see some of the shift like

157
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:22,760
the nice thing about Bitcoin for, say, people who are lower on the social tier or don't

158
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:31,680
have a lot of or no disposable income. You can Satoshi down these Bitcoins into teeny,

159
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:36,720
teeny, teeny, tiny amounts and you can buy tiny bits at a time. Ten dollars worth, twenty

160
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,340
five dollars worth. And you can stack that and stack that and stack that and stack that

161
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:51,400
over time. Now, Bitcoin just had a 20 percent value drop, right? But if you started getting

162
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:56,720
in at the beginning of the year, even with this 20 percent drop, Bitcoin has had one

163
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:01,520
hundred and sixty percent gain for the last year, even after the drop. And it's recovering

164
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:08,880
right now from the drop. But even at the bottom of the drop. Bitcoin had gained one hundred

165
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:13,720
and sixty percent in value from the beginning of the year. Now, if you've been stacking

166
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:19,260
like the beginning from the beginning of the year, that's pretty great. And I I just kind

167
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:24,200
of went through this. So I decided to just experiment with this about the beginning of

168
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:29,240
the year. And I started buying small amounts of Bitcoin every Friday, like twenty five

169
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:36,720
bucks here, maybe 50 bucks here, depending on what I could afford. And then by just dumb

170
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:42,600
luck, I decided right before the price crashed over the weekend to cash out some of that

171
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:46,460
Bitcoin for Christmas to buy Christmas gifts, because I think if you can convert that stuff

172
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:51,100
into physical goods like that, that's you know, it's not a good investment strategy,

173
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:59,200
but it's how I'm using it right now. I'd rather use that than credit. So I had put about almost

174
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:04,720
three hundred dollars worth of cash into Bitcoin since the beginning of the year, just buying

175
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:11,180
little bits at a time here and there. And I withdrew this weekend. Four hundred and

176
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:15,680
eighty dollars now after fees was four hundred and fifty dollars. But I put in almost three

177
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:23,260
hundred and I took out after fees four hundred and fifty dollars. And that's just been since

178
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:30,900
about April. And now I'm paying for Christmas with some of that stuff. I don't have another

179
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:36,260
way to build wealth. I can't buy real estate anymore. And even if I could buy real estate,

180
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:41,180
I don't have the personal bandwidth to maintain the real estate to even do the paperwork and

181
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:46,500
pay the taxes. I don't have the bandwidth for that. So and I don't have the I don't

182
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:52,040
have the money to and I don't really have anything to leverage for the loan. So I can't

183
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:57,340
do the real estate thing. I don't really understand the stock market well enough to feel like

184
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:03,400
I'm not going to screw myself. So I don't really do anything there. I don't have a company

185
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:10,300
retirement account because I'm an independent business person in a sole proprietorship.

186
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:16,340
So there's not a lot of tools. Plus, I've chosen a very minimal mobile lifestyle. So

187
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:21,740
I can't really like accumulate valuable things and store them in my RV. And I don't really

188
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:27,560
have any interest in paying for gold because to me, it's just a rock. It's a useful rock

189
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:31,860
that has a lot of good industrial applications. But there's a lot of it out there. And I don't

190
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:39,260
personally want to have a bunch of metals and rocks. I want to store my my wealth digitally.

191
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:44,700
And so Bitcoin is a is a form of mathematically provable property. That's what it is. It's

192
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:52,600
an asset that is mathematically proved and secured by a peer to peer network with a central

193
00:17:52,600 --> 00:18:00,740
ledger that tracks who owns which coins and everyone can have a copy of that ledger.

194
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:05,280
How people use it? Well, I mean, we could talk about how the Biden family pays each

195
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:09,460
other off with diamonds, right? Or we could talk about how most drug sales are in cash

196
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:14,100
or how we give bags of cash to the Afghans. What are they using cash for? Who knows, right?

197
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:23,700
The cash cash is the ultimate crime. Currency. Caches. So we got to be realistic about that

198
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:30,400
by probably orders of magnitude more, right? So the technology does not necessarily equal

199
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,940
the use of it. And there is an opportunity for people that are lower on the social economical

200
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:39,700
ladder to actually build wealth if these things don't blow up in their face. But just like

201
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:47,020
playing in the stock market can blow up in your face times five that so can crypto currencies.

202
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:52,740
But there absolutely is a place for people lower on the wealth ladder. Now, when you

203
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:58,340
start taking it to things like city coins, like Miami coin. And then you times that to

204
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:02,860
an Austin coin. I mean, like, maybe I just I don't know, would you like say you say you

205
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:08,340
knew you were going to move to Austin in two years? Do you start by an Austin coin? It

206
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:14,620
just it starts to it does start to become a casino. And people's concerns about that

207
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:21,060
about the fraud and Ponzi scheme nature of it are legitimate because those aspects of

208
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:26,500
it are concerning. But they don't necessarily mean the technology is bad and there isn't

209
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:50,580
some fundamental use.

210
00:19:50,580 --> 00:20:05,780
You know, my buddy Joe has been taking to calling cryptocurrency like our modern dot

211
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:11,780
com bubble. And I think that might be a good way to think about it. If you were buying

212
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:21,020
stocks back in 2000, and we had the dot com bubble, 95% of those stocks went bust. They

213
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:27,660
just blew up in your face and people went broke. But 5% of those stocks are Amazon,

214
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:34,500
Apple, Microsoft, Rackspace, all the companies that were involved in building the cloud era,

215
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:39,500
from hardware to software to services. Like they were around back then too. And some of

216
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:46,220
those paid off handsomely. But a lot of them didn't. That's where we're at with this whole

217
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:52,500
crypto idea. Like there's some fundamentals there like with the blockchain. Being able

218
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:56,900
being able to send money peer to peer with no middleman to anyone in the world a universal

219
00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:02,580
currency that somebody in Russia and somebody in China and somebody in India and somebody

220
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:08,420
in Canada and somebody in Mexico like all over the world. They all have a common currency

221
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:13,460
they can work with. That's clearly fucking needed. Like that's just obvious, right? That's

222
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:20,000
just like, in the age of the internet, especially like you look at my kids, man, they're growing

223
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,860
up online. Especially these COVID years. You think they're you think they're going to find

224
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:30,540
value in physical crap that you got to move around or or like paperwork you got to deal

225
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:35,420
with now they want something they could buy on their iPhone in 15 minutes. And you know,

226
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:38,820
that often gets thrown around despairingly. But you know what the technology should actually

227
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:47,000
enable that that's not it's not an unrealistic expectation in 2021 and on. So we also have

228
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:54,780
to think about this from a younger generation who values things like avatar skins in roblox.

229
00:21:54,780 --> 00:22:01,740
It's a huge market right now is these digital goods in app purchases, these tokens. And

230
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:10,260
they're I mean, that's how app stores make money now. And if they value that stuff, that

231
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:13,940
stuff is literally never going to gain in value. It's never going to do anything but

232
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:20,540
buy more crap in a game for them. Our crypto currencies really that much more of a leap.

233
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:24,420
Don't they actually make more sense because they're cryptographically verifiable. You

234
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:32,460
can trade them with anybody. They have value amongst a many areas of things and utility.

235
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:38,620
Cryptocurrency is the conversion of energy into wealth into a store value and it's very

236
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:42,580
expensive right now. But that's an area where people are going to invest a lot to is making

237
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:46,980
it greener and greener. And as people do that, that hype cycle is going to keep going. I

238
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:53,540
mean, we we are entering like this.com bubble mutant that's probably going to go for a while

239
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:58,900
it's going to build and it's going to get outrageous. And then one day it's likely going

240
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:04,180
to give and there will be a few left standing. And I think so it's it's not a bad analogy

241
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:12,380
to say it's like the dot com bubble, but just a global 2021 dystopian version of it. All

242
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:16,580
right. Well, Coder's coming up here in just a minute. Mike's going to be joining me shortly

243
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:39,180
and we got a good show plan.

244
00:23:39,180 --> 00:24:04,900
Hey,
