1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,920
What really excites me though is to introduce

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:02,760
our keynote speaker.

3
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,940
Our keynote speaker is Thomas Cameron.

4
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:07,720
He currently works as AWS's solution architect,

5
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:11,520
but he's been doing Linux since before AWS existed.

6
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,560
And he's been a long time speaker at Texas Linux Fest.

7
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,360
And I'm really excited to bring him here

8
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:19,360
to kick off our Saturday presentations,

9
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,080
talking about the state of the union of Linux.

10
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:21,920
Thank you.

11
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:22,740
Thank you.

12
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:23,580
Thank you.

13
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:30,200
Thank you guys very much. I appreciate it.

14
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,560
It is truly an honor to be here.

15
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:36,320
I've been involved with Texas Linux Fest for years

16
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,920
and it's fantastic to be here up on the main stage.

17
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,920
And I appreciate you all being here.

18
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,800
Definitely, you know, welcome and thank you so much

19
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,800
for being here on a Saturday morning.

20
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,800
I know that if you're like me,

21
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,360
you'd rather probably be, you know,

22
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,200
carefully inspecting the backs of your eyelids right now,

23
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,040
but I do appreciate you being here.

24
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,080
Just out of curiosity,

25
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:58,200
how many folks are here from outside of the DFW area?

26
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,120
Wow.

27
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,560
That is phenomenal.

28
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,880
Thank you even more than for traveling to be here.

29
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:06,960
That's amazing.

30
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,000
So who am I and why should you care?

31
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,840
Should you care?

32
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,660
I don't know.

33
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:13,980
We'll see.

34
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,360
A little bit about me.

35
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,600
As mentioned earlier, my name is Thomas Cameron.

36
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,960
I started in the IT industry in 1993.

37
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,880
Raise your hand if you were not born yet in 1993.

38
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,880
Okay.

39
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,560
To me, very honestly,

40
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,880
I still sort of feel like Linux

41
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:38,640
is this new upstart cool technology, you know?

42
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,320
But the reality is it's been around

43
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,960
for a very, very long time.

44
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,120
I have an interesting path

45
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,080
or I had an interesting path to get here.

46
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,920
I actually started out as a police officer.

47
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,780
I was a volunteer

48
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,440
and then a non-sworn corrections officer

49
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,760
and then a sworn police officer.

50
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,600
Spent about eight years in law enforcement.

51
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,120
Realized that I qualified for food stamps

52
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:01,080
and changed careers into IT.

53
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,120
So back in the day,

54
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:07,620
I started out as a Novell certified NetWare engineer.

55
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,180
All right, I'm dating myself, yeah.

56
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:13,880
And I have fond memories of upgrading

57
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,600
a 2.5 megabit per second ArtNet network

58
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,800
to a blazing fast four megabit per second

59
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,800
token ring environment.

60
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,040
All right.

61
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,560
So my point here is I'm not thumping my chest

62
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,520
and saying I'm anything special because I'm not.

63
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,480
I've just been around for a while.

64
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,240
And I think I've got some pretty impressive scars.

65
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,720
Started with Slackware Linux.

66
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,560
When it comes to Linux,

67
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,920
I started with Slackware Linux back in 1995.

68
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,320
I was actually working for Microsoft at the time.

69
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,620
Don't hold that against me.

70
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,640
I was working during the launch of Windows 95.

71
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,120
I was a technical development engineer

72
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,800
at one of the support facilities.

73
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,720
And there was this guy who worked for me

74
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,760
named Tim Goldenberg.

75
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,220
And I will never forget this kid.

76
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,840
This kid who's now 47 years old.

77
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,920
He was talking about Linux.

78
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,520
And we were all learning Windows 95

79
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,120
and we were learning how to integrate 95

80
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,760
into the NT networks, NT 351 and NT 40 beta,

81
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,900
which is pretty cool.

82
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,200
And he kept talking about how Linux was so cool

83
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,480
and it was really up and coming.

84
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,920
And I had drunk the Kool-Aid, honestly.

85
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,040
And I turned to him and I was like,

86
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,520
Tim, man, Unix is dead.

87
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,400
Windows is the future.

88
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,980
And he kept on and kept on and kept on.

89
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,100
And I finally said, dang it, Tim.

90
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,280
What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna set up one machine

91
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,920
with Windows NT 351.

92
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,900
And I'm gonna set up another machine with Linux.

93
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,680
Didn't know anything about Linux at the time.

94
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,780
But I'm gonna set up Linux and I'm gonna prove to you

95
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:50,000
that NT is the superior platform.

96
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,560
You can see how that turned out.

97
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:58,560
So I spent several days, I mean, probably like a week

98
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,340
trying to get Slackware Linux installed

99
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:09,740
on I think at the time it was a Pentium 90 with,

100
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:15,660
I wanna say that I had splurged and spent about $450

101
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:20,660
to get it up to eight megabytes of memory, megabytes.

102
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,240
And I finally, I mean, I had gone through all the

103
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,400
trying to figure out F disk for Linux

104
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,280
as opposed to F disk for DOS.

105
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,240
What do you mean swap partition?

106
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,960
What the hell are you talking about?

107
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,520
Swap is a file, everybody, what?

108
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,200
Boot and root and there's no drive letters.

109
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,040
What the hell's the matter with you people?

110
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:46,600
So I finally, after a week, complete the installation

111
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,640
and it doesn't crash out.

112
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,320
You go complete installation and it's gonna reboot.

113
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,400
And it rebooted and it came up to a login prompt.

114
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,160
And I was like, what the hell do I do now?

115
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,360
So playing around with Linux,

116
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,440
one of the things that actually blew me away

117
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,880
that made me convinced that maybe Tim was right

118
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,880
was and it's silly, echo one greater than

119
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:18,800
slash proc slash sys slash net slash ipv4

120
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,200
slash ip underscore forward.

121
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:26,760
I could turn on and turn off routing in the kernel

122
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,280
from the command line.

123
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,760
On my NT machine, if I had two network cards

124
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,440
or I had a network card and a modem

125
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,960
because back then we were working on modems.

126
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,160
If I had to turn routing on, it said,

127
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,680
I've accepted your changes, now reboot.

128
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,880
I know it's silly, but that was one of the things

129
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:52,080
that made me go, holy crap, this is pretty cool.

130
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,440
So that's sort of how I got started with Linux.

131
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,520
I was certified as a Red Hat certified engineer

132
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,120
back in 1999 on Red Hat Linux 6.1.

133
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,960
I had written a training guide for Red Hat Linux,

134
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,120
about a 450 page training guide.

135
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,200
I owned a small company that did IT consulting and training.

136
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,480
And we developed a training program

137
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,720
that attracted organizations like Compaq.

138
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,400
Compaq did Red Hat training with me.

139
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,000
You guys, some of the older folks in here

140
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,440
will remember Deja News.

141
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,640
Remember the aggregator for Usenet?

142
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,640
They sent their staff to come train.

143
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:35,040
The US Department of the Treasury Internal Revenue Service

144
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,400
sent their people to train.

145
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,200
I was very conflicted about that.

146
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,080
Especially when I got the phone call,

147
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,320
ring, ring, ring,

148
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,520
Cameron Technical Services, can I help you?

149
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,920
This is Agent Jones with the Internal Revenue Service

150
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,080
Division of Criminal Investigations.

151
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,560
Who am I speaking with, please?

152
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,080
Thomas.

153
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,720
I understand you do Linux training, is that correct?

154
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,680
And I'm thinking, what the hell could I have possibly done?

155
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,560
I have some of my agents that need to get Linux training

156
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:25,920
because we do forensics around seized computers.

157
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,560
Said, you like doing that, don't you?

158
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,160
And he goes, oh, I live for it.

159
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,880
So, you know, an interesting time back in the 90s

160
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,440
doing Linux training and consulting,

161
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,200
because it was so new.

162
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,040
Interesting little trivia bit.

163
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:46,600
I am Turbo Linux certified instructor number 001.

164
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,880
Has anyone ever even used Turbo Linux?

165
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,360
Long time ago, right?

166
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,040
Yeah, so my company,

167
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,680
because I had done all this training material

168
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,200
around Red Hat Linux,

169
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,840
my company was contracted by Turbo Linux for a few months

170
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,480
and we developed a training program, put it all together,

171
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,360
wrote the guides, I delivered the first class,

172
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,440
did a train the trainer,

173
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,560
and within like three months they reorganized

174
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,800
and did away with training.

175
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:12,120
But damn it, I am number one.

176
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,440
I worked for Red Hat for about 14 years.

177
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,040
I was a solution architect,

178
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,120
and then I worked my way up from solution architect

179
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,800
to senior to principal to senior principal

180
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,360
to chief architect for the central US.

181
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,840
And then the last four years that I was there,

182
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,560
I was an evangelist for Red Hat Enterprise Linux globally.

183
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,360
Great experience, great company.

184
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,480
I got a lot of Red Hat friends in the audience.

185
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,640
I really enjoyed it, but it was time for a change,

186
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,400
so I did move over to Amazon Web Services

187
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,760
about two and a half months ago,

188
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,960
so I'm still really, really new to AWS.

189
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,400
I do want to make very clear,

190
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,120
I am here as a community member only.

191
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,160
I do not claim to represent AWS,

192
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,200
certainly don't claim to represent Red Hat.

193
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,000
I will talk about experiences,

194
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,760
but my opinions are my own, and they may be wrong.

195
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,080
So, as I said earlier,

196
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,680
I don't claim to be particularly wise.

197
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,360
I've just been doing this for a long time

198
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,960
and I've seen a lot of crazy stuff.

199
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:09,960
So, to talk about what's going on,

200
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,840
I think we kind of have to talk about where we came from.

201
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,520
And so to talk about where we came from,

202
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,200
you need to understand the past

203
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,000
to understand where we're going.

204
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,320
As I alluded to earlier, when I got started with Linux,

205
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,000
I loved it because it was so different

206
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,240
from anything that I had done before.

207
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,800
Real honestly, everything that I'd done previously

208
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,280
was it was software that I'd gotten from work,

209
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,000
or it was software that I got a spare copy

210
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,080
because we used it in the data center or whatever.

211
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,440
And I always sort of had this feeling of,

212
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,520
you know, really, I didn't pay for these licenses,

213
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,560
don't really care because I'm not gonna pay

214
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:49,680
250 bucks for an office suite in 1995 or whatever.

215
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,760
But it was amazing because I could use it,

216
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,240
I could download it, I could play around with it,

217
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,560
and it was totally okay.

218
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,640
It was free software, and that was fantastic.

219
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,600
From a technical perspective,

220
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,440
one of the things that blew me away about Linux

221
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,320
was that it was natively multi-user.

222
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,520
And if you think about it, like when I got started in 1995,

223
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:15,560
the only multi-user service that was out there,

224
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,320
the only multi-user operating system

225
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,440
that was out there for x86 for PCs was,

226
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,280
anyone remember?

227
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,120
Citrix.

228
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,360
You remember Citrix, the Citrix terminal server?

229
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:32,080
Does anyone remember how much that cost?

230
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:35,080
It was insanely expensive.

231
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,560
And here, I had this distro that I could download,

232
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,000
the floppies, and install,

233
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,440
and I had multi-user with actual user accounts

234
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,640
and multiple people could be logged on,

235
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,640
it was no big deal.

236
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,840
So that was a huge, huge change,

237
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,420
and it was really powerful.

238
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,920
Windows, which is what we all knew on the desktop,

239
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,280
used cooperative multitasking.

240
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,480
And cooperative multitasking means

241
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,120
when an application gets launched,

242
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,280
that application basically says,

243
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:05,120
I'm gonna run, and when I'm done,

244
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,560
I'm going to turn control over

245
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,240
to the next process that runs.

246
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,160
Anyone see a flaw with that logic?

247
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,120
If an application crashed and it never got to the part

248
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,640
where it said, okay, now you can go,

249
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,080
there's a reason that control delete

250
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:23,200
is the most famous key sequence in the universe.

251
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,360
And sometimes that didn't work

252
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,800
and you end up having to hit the power button, right?

253
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,000
So with Linux, you actually had this operating system

254
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,080
that went, no, no, no, I'm in charge.

255
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,640
I will let you go, process,

256
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,520
until such time as I deem that you need to stop,

257
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:39,080
and then I will time slice the next process.

258
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,980
So this preemptive multitasking was like,

259
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:43,760
holy cow, it doesn't crash much.

260
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,080
Don't get me wrong, I remember the ping of death, right?

261
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,560
I've crashed Linux machines,

262
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,100
but my point is it was like,

263
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,600
it was this incredible operating system

264
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,160
that was solid and multi-user,

265
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:56,640
and networking was native.

266
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,500
It wasn't an add-on.

267
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,880
If you remember back in the Windows 3.1

268
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,600
and Windows for Workgroups timeframe,

269
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,980
anyone remember Trumpet Windsock, right?

270
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:08,620
Just cut with the veins, not against.

271
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,920
You know, I mean, it was a pain.

272
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,420
It was a pain to get IP networking.

273
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,520
It was a pain to get dial-up.

274
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,600
It was a pain to do all of those things,

275
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,760
and you had to get these add-ons to make it work,

276
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,440
and even then, you're still running a 16-bit OS

277
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,060
that was, you know, cranky and clunky

278
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:26,040
and a pain in the butt.

279
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,740
So the OS was pretty awesome.

280
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,100
Hardware, it's a little challenging.

281
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:37,740
Anybody remember, and this is kind of an eye chart,

282
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:41,580
but you remember the 8-bit ISA bus?

283
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:46,680
And then we got 16-bit ISA that ran at eight megahertz.

284
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,520
Woo-hoo!

285
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,260
We were in high cotton.

286
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:52,960
And then we moved into microchannel architecture,

287
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,900
which is an abomination from IBM

288
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,000
that we shall not mention again.

289
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,640
And then it evolved over time.

290
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,240
We moved into extended ISA or ISA,

291
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,840
so we finally got to 32-bit.

292
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,400
Remember Visa Local Bus?

293
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,780
Visa Local Bus video cards?

294
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,640
Man, that was, ooh, that was awesome!

295
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,980
And then they were, no, no, we're gonna do PCI now.

296
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:14,820
And then, oh, no, no, no, AGP is the way to go,

297
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,280
and AGP is gonna win, I thought.

298
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,620
This PCI thing, no.

299
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:21,360
Well, okay, so maybe I wasn't too correct about that.

300
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,400
And then we finally moved into the PCI Express stuff.

301
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:29,400
But this was a smoking hot video card back in the day.

302
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,500
This was an amazing video card.

303
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,080
This was a Trident video card.

304
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:43,080
Those chips right there, 128K of memory each, baby.

305
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,420
That was a one meg video card.

306
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:50,460
800 by 600, whether you needed it or not.

307
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:56,120
And for those of us who worked in the data center,

308
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:59,500
AHA 1542, baby.

309
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,400
16-bit bus, and I know it's kinda hard to see

310
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,900
because these colors are washed out,

311
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:07,540
but there are banks and banks of jumpers

312
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:12,500
where we had to set I.O. addresses,

313
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:16,420
IRQs, DMA addresses, SCSI IDs,

314
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,040
whether it was gonna terminate on the wire

315
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:22,480
or terminate on the card, and all of it was black magic.

316
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,920
We tried to figure this stuff out,

317
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,480
and you'd get on the news groups

318
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,960
and figure out what the hell this thing was

319
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:31,260
and finally get it working and not touch it ever again.

320
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:37,360
And ribbon cables, 50-pin ribbon cables

321
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,740
that we plugged into the hard drives,

322
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:41,780
and you couldn't forget the terminator.

323
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,100
Because if you didn't have a terminator,

324
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,180
your SCSI signal would reflect off the end of the wire,

325
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:47,380
and it would screw up your whole SCSI chain.

326
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:50,040
And sometimes it'd come loose just because, screw you.

327
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,120
And stuff would go haywire.

328
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,160
And, you remember these?

329
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:00,220
Seagate ST, what is it, 30, I don't even remember,

330
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:02,100
31200 or something like that?

331
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,460
Yeah, 31230N.

332
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,060
This is a SCSI hard drive.

333
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,460
Again, you can't really see it that well,

334
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,640
but there's a jumper bank right there.

335
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,940
We had to set jumpers on the hard drives

336
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:14,400
to give them SCSI IDs.

337
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,940
And if you got them wrong, you had a bad day.

338
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:21,640
This hard drive that I've got up here,

339
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:25,680
I remember buying one for a Novell server.

340
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,980
It's 1.05 gigabyte.

341
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,860
$2400?

342
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,820
For one gigabyte.

343
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,500
This is 128 gigabytes.

344
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,540
Cost about, I don't know, 20 bucks,

345
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,140
and I got it for free at a conference.

346
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:48,140
And this has better throughput than that hard drive.

347
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:53,240
I can put, in fact, I have on my desktop PC,

348
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:58,180
I have a hard drive that's 4,000 times larger than this.

349
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,820
And it cost me less than 200 bucks.

350
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:03,520
So, again, it's been an incredible journey.

351
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,020
Sound cards.

352
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,860
Sound Blaster 16, baby.

353
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:16,120
You had to, again, set jumpers for IRQ,

354
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:19,560
IO ports, memory addresses, all that crazy stuff.

355
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,360
And you had to understand all of those things

356
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:27,360
because you oftentimes had to either compile the kernel

357
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,640
with the correct settings for these things,

358
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,600
or at least know what the settings were

359
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,480
to set a config file or something like that.

360
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:40,340
And don't forget, as I said, we started using modems.

361
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:44,780
And yet again, we had to set jumpers

362
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:47,720
to set what COM port it was emulating or whatever.

363
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,680
But you'll notice on this one, this modem,

364
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:54,060
this was a badass modem, this was a 14.4.

365
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,020
This was some high speed back in the day.

366
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,420
But there's no jumpers on there.

367
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,260
You know why?

368
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,760
It's a win modem.

369
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:04,140
The spawn of Satan.

370
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,960
Because it was all software configurable.

371
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,980
And we didn't, a lot of times Linux

372
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,800
just didn't have the drivers for win modems.

373
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,540
So huge challenges there.

374
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,580
And then there was the monitor.

375
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:22,580
And the reason that I have smoke coming out of the monitor

376
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,760
is that in the early days,

377
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,980
does anyone remember XF86 config?

378
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,060
Right, you would have to run XF86 config

379
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,800
before you could start X.

380
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,900
And you had to tell X,

381
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,540
you had to generate a config file.

382
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,000
You had to define the mode lines.

383
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,540
You had to define the X and Y, start and stop.

384
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:45,040
You had to define the refresh rate.

385
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,640
You had to define all this kind of stuff.

386
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,820
You could literally go in and tell the electron gun

387
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:52,380
to shoot to the left or to the right or up or down

388
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:55,460
and even to keystone and to do the in and out

389
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:56,720
and all that stuff.

390
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,080
And if you didn't pay attention to the warnings,

391
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,920
you could get a 14 inch monitor

392
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,760
that said it was good for 800 by 600 and go,

393
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,860
I wonder if it'll do 1024 by 768.

394
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,700
And XF86 config would go, yeah, sure, let's try it.

395
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,580
Click, start X.

396
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:25,820
Oh crap.

397
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:30,760
So yeah, the early days were pretty crazy.

398
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:35,760
Kids these days with their auto configuring PCI devices.

399
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:37,300
Damn you.

400
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,500
That's right.

401
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,560
But yeah, things were really different.

402
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,000
And in a lot of ways, honestly,

403
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,980
I'm really glad I lived through the painful days.

404
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:49,980
I'm really glad that I had to configure

405
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,740
all these crazy things.

406
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,680
I'm really glad that I had to walk uphill both ways

407
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:57,420
in the snow to get to school because I learned a lot.

408
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:58,780
I really did, I learned a lot.

409
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,280
My first distro was Slackware.

410
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,160
And that was challenging.

411
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,960
It was really tough to get Slackware to play nice.

412
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,320
And I'm glad that I did.

413
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:11,060
And when I started, we had Usenet.

414
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,340
We had Usenet.

415
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:15,000
And maybe if you lived in a big city,

416
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,400
there was a lug close by.

417
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:22,200
You guys remember the comp.os.linux hierarchy?

418
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,540
Comp.os.linux.misc was the place

419
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,280
that you would go to ask questions.

420
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,480
How many folks remember using Claws?

421
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:35,480
Gnoos, yeah, Silfeed?

422
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,420
For those of you who are younger than my IT career,

423
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:44,300
these are old open source tools

424
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,960
that we used to access Usenet.

425
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,540
Usenet was sort of like a precursor

426
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:51,640
to bulletin boards, I guess, or mailing lists.

427
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:56,280
But so you would use Usenet

428
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:59,380
and you could post questions and people would reply.

429
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,680
And the thing that was amazing was

430
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,340
I would see people replying

431
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:08,260
whose names I saw scrolling by as the kernel booted.

432
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:11,720
That was pretty amazing,

433
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:14,600
that the people who were helping

434
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,120
were literally the folks who were writing the code.

435
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,900
And they were willing to help.

436
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:23,360
And Usenet is where I started to understand

437
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,000
what open source was really about.

438
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,700
And I'll talk more about that in a little while.

439
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,140
Mailing lists, this is funny.

440
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:31,040
David, you're on this.

441
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,180
This is the oldest archive that I could find

442
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:36,080
for the Central Texas Linux Users Group mailing list.

443
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,340
David and I are actually trading conversations

444
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,520
back there for Fedora Core 4.

445
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,820
So we're talking about that stuff.

446
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,180
I couldn't find any older archives.

447
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:49,220
I wanna say ct-lug lost a hard drive back in like 05

448
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:51,420
and the archives went away.

449
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:54,700
But so yeah, it was heady times.

450
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:58,160
Just out of curiosity, how many folks are members of lugs?

451
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,300
Not many.

452
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:04,040
I'll talk more about that in a little while too.

453
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,240
The early distros were crazy.

454
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:11,320
Yggdrasil, yeah, Yggdrasil.

455
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,460
Slackware is the oldest surviving

456
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,120
and it's not just surviving, it's thriving.

457
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,220
The oldest surviving distro is Slackware.

458
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,660
Then you had Red Hat and SUSE and Debian.

459
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,500
Mandrake, remember Mandrake Linux

460
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:25,400
before it became Mandriva, before it died, I think.

461
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,760
TAMU Linux, Texas A&M University, gig of Aggies.

462
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,400
Whoop, yeah, sorry.

463
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:36,680
So Mark Ewing was one of the computer science guys

464
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,600
at Texas A&M University.

465
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,580
He came up with, and that's TAMU Linux

466
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,480
over there on the right-hand side.

467
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,380
He developed the Tux logo.

468
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:49,320
And I have actually communicated with him over the years

469
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,860
because I've used his logo for a couple of things

470
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,560
and I always pinged him and just said, is it cool?

471
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,760
And he always responds back and says,

472
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,260
please quit sending me these emails.

473
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,000
I've already told everyone they can use it,

474
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,740
but you know, I just wanna say, SLS.

475
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:02,740
Remember SLS Linux?

476
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,900
Yeah, that's old, I do.

477
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:09,780
Now, so that's where we came from.

478
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:12,380
Who were we back in the 90s?

479
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,020
What do you see on this page?

480
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,760
More importantly, what do you not see on this page?

481
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,860
Oh, and this sucks, I'm sorry,

482
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:22,360
the brightness is all washed out.

483
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:25,560
Any chance we could turn off the front lights?

484
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,700
If it's easily done, if we could turn off the front lights,

485
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,260
that would be awesome.

486
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:31,260
Because I think this is really important.

487
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:36,100
They're all gray beards, like me.

488
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,600
I have become.

489
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,880
But more importantly, what do we not see here?

490
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:45,180
Ooh, that wasn't quite what I meant, but I like it.

491
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:50,180
More importantly, what do we not see?

492
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:55,120
People of color, women, young people.

493
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,900
That's a big problem, folks,

494
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,220
and I'll talk more about that in a little while.

495
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:02,960
So, what were we doing back in the day?

496
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,300
Well, mostly web and edge of network type of stuff, right?

497
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:10,400
We were doing DNS and DHCP and file services with NFS

498
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,380
and Samba, anyone remember Samba?

499
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:15,100
I freaking loved Samba.

500
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:18,440
You know, print services, email services, stuff like that.

501
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,820
I mean, kind of a cheap Unix replacement

502
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:23,180
is really what we were.

503
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:28,160
Why was Linux so successful, do you suppose?

504
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,820
Is it because Linux was awesome

505
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:32,820
and it worked right out of the box every time, everywhere,

506
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,460
and was super high performance?

507
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:39,000
No, because it really wasn't in the early days.

508
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,440
But it was good enough.

509
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,800
It was good enough.

510
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:47,300
And it was free, as in beer, because at the time,

511
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:50,700
myself included, most people didn't understand

512
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:54,140
or really even care that much about free as in speech.

513
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:56,680
And again, I'll talk about that in a little while.

514
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:00,180
And people were passionate about it.

515
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:02,380
People became really fired up.

516
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:04,180
I was one of them, I've made a career

517
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,580
out of working with Linux,

518
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:08,860
and I'm insanely grateful to the community

519
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,320
to be able to have done so.

520
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,820
Do we remember the distro wars?

521
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,400
Yeah.

522
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,300
Tribalism at its best, right?

523
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:25,640
You know, you can see the our blessed homeland

524
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:28,100
versus those barbarous wastes.

525
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:31,040
Our dear leader versus their savage tyrant.

526
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,880
It was all about mine is better than yours

527
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,180
and you ain't got mine.

528
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:41,180
And it did some really, really shitty stuff.

529
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,700
People would ask, what's the best distro?

530
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,020
Which distro should I use?

531
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:47,920
What's going on?

532
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,140
Well, thank you very much for asking.

533
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,740
Let me just tell ya.

534
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,540
What's the best distro?

535
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:58,880
Well, you want enterprise support

536
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,940
and a really long life cycle?

537
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:02,140
Well, clearly Red Hat Enterprise Linux

538
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,580
is the best distro.

539
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:05,820
You want enterprise support and maybe not as long,

540
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:08,280
but really good community and really docs?

541
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:12,680
Well, obviously LTS Ubuntu is the best distro.

542
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:15,220
Do you want the latest and greatest packages,

543
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,620
bleeding edge technology

544
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,660
that's really, really close to upstream?

545
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:22,620
Well, obviously Fedora is the best distro.

546
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:24,100
Do you want a stable long-term release,

547
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,160
but you don't wanna pay for it?

548
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:30,700
Well, clearly CentOS is the best distro.

549
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,540
Do you want an amazing desktop experience

550
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,680
that just works, has all the multimedia,

551
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,180
everything's fine and flashy

552
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:38,440
and you just click next, next, next, and it's fine?

553
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:42,020
Well, obviously Linux Mint is the best distro.

554
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,460
Do you want a distro that's optimized

555
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:48,420
for cloud computing and virtualization workloads?

556
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:51,200
Well, clearly Amazon Linux is the best distro.

557
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,420
Do you want a highly technical distribution

558
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:59,960
for power users that is insanely configurable?

559
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,960
Well, Gentoo is clearly the best distro,

560
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,480
except, wait a minute,

561
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,960
maybe Linux from scratch may make more sense.

562
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,800
And you remember I was talking about the easy to use,

563
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,600
maybe MX Linux or Monjaro.

564
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:20,460
Maybe that might, hmm, you know what?

565
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:24,140
You keep saying that word.

566
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:29,140
I do not think it means what you think it means.

567
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:32,740
Folks, adopting a distro like a religion is stupid.

568
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,040
I've been guilty.

569
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,240
I'm not saying I'm not stupid.

570
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,540
I'm saying I've gotten enough scars

571
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:40,980
that I don't do that anymore.

572
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:46,960
Try a bunch of them, force yourself to learn them.

573
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:51,320
Put whatever, put Ubuntu on your machine, exclusively.

574
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,020
Don't dual boot, put it on and force yourself

575
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:56,500
to live with it for a month or two.

576
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:59,940
Then change over to Slackware, then change over to CentOS,

577
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:03,940
then change over to Arch, then change, learn.

578
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:08,440
Get good at it so that you can have informed decisions.

579
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,940
At the end of the day, folks, it's a kernel,

580
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:14,280
GLibc or similar, look into your utilities

581
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,680
and a bunch of applications.

582
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:20,320
The best distro is the one that does what you need

583
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:24,020
at the best cost, you know?

584
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:26,800
So I'm kind of done with that, that whole

585
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,900
mine's better than yours thing.

586
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,000
So where are we now?

587
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,000
You know what?

588
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,800
We've won.

589
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,300
Linux has won.

590
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:39,700
We're not winning, we've won.

591
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:42,480
We are literally everywhere.

592
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,940
The Linux kernel runs Android.

593
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:47,040
How many folks use Android phones?

594
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,380
Yep, okay, I mean, we're everywhere.

595
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:54,380
The cloud, public clouds, are mostly built on Linux.

596
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:58,900
And I don't mean just a bunch of Linux instances running,

597
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:01,800
I mean the server infrastructure is running Linux,

598
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,100
except for Microsoft, but you know, whatever.

599
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,900
Containers, containerization, the new hotness, right?

600
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,340
This is all cool stuff.

601
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:12,500
Containers are just Linux processes.

602
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,400
Serverless isn't.

603
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,420
It's running on Linux.

604
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:20,140
It's running on a server,

605
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:22,120
you just don't have to mess with it.

606
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:27,780
Always remember, there is no cloud.

607
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:30,320
There's just somebody else's computers.

608
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:36,200
So Linux is being used to track and manage

609
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,360
the planes over US airspace.

610
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:42,800
8,000 to 10,000 planes at any given time over US airspace,

611
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,380
they're being tracked by a cluster of Linux machines.

612
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:48,040
I fly a lot.

613
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:51,680
To me, ain't much more mission critical than that.

614
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:54,380
You know, so we're there.

615
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:56,560
Linux powers the US Bradley fighting vehicle

616
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,320
and the Zumwalt class destroyer.

617
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,720
I'm really mixed about that.

618
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:03,720
I mean, honestly, I'm really mixed about that.

619
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,500
My hope is that they're never used,

620
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,200
that there are never shots fired in anger,

621
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,100
but I know better.

622
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:12,160
If they are, I am confident in our troops

623
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,240
and that technology.

624
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,900
Just out of curiosity, how many folks in here are millennials?

625
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:21,580
No, no, no, I'm not gonna bust on you guys.

626
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:24,020
I'm gonna quote Admiral McRaven,

627
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:27,080
who was the head of Navy Special Forces,

628
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:30,460
think Navy SEALs, and he said,

629
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:32,520
people talk smack about millennials,

630
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,980
they say that they're soft,

631
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:37,700
they've never seen them in a firefight in Afghanistan.

632
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:42,140
So even though I joke a lot about being a gray beard,

633
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:44,940
and I do a lot of jokes about get off of my lawn,

634
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:48,380
I'm real happy with the next generation of folks in IT.

635
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:50,580
I'm really impressed by what I see.

636
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:57,340
And the final, I think most important proof that we've won,

637
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:02,120
IBM is spending $34 billion

638
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,860
for legitimacy in the Linux game.

639
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:10,320
It's the biggest software acquisition that's ever happened.

640
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,160
And everybody, every major tech company out there

641
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,160
is contributing to open source.

642
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:18,840
Google, Intel, Microsoft, Red Hat, IBM, AMD, SUSE,

643
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,840
many, many, many, many, many, many more.

644
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:26,080
Linux runs about 90% of the public cloud.

645
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,680
Linux runs about 82% of the world's smartphones.

646
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:33,320
About 62% of the embedded market is Linux.

647
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:37,420
About 99% of the supercomputer market is Linux.

648
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:41,460
So we've won, and that's a pretty cool place to be.

649
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:44,940
Linux developers are so mainstream.

650
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,900
Now, like I said earlier,

651
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,440
I asked how many folks are members of Lugs,

652
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,580
and there's a pretty small group.

653
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:56,740
And just out of curiosity, for those who are in Lugs,

654
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:58,180
growing or shrinking?

655
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:02,780
Shrunk and then it's growing again.

656
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:05,660
I used to worry a lot about shrinking Lugs.

657
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:08,660
It used to really worry me, but then it hit me.

658
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:17,000
We used to have to band together for support.

659
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,980
We needed each other because there were so few of us,

660
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:24,140
there were so few resources that we got together

661
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:26,040
and we formed tribes in a good way.

662
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,320
Not in the negative tribalism I was talking about earlier,

663
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,620
but we formed tribes and that was a good thing.

664
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:36,320
We're not rare anymore, we're everywhere, right?

665
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,020
So we don't have the need.

666
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:40,460
It's awesome to be at Texas Linux Fest.

667
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:42,200
It's amazing to see all of you here.

668
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,120
And I love that I'm a part of this community,

669
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:47,260
and I love that you're a part of the community with me,

670
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:49,660
but we're not as isolated as we once were.

671
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:53,640
So there's not so much of a need for Lugs anymore,

672
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:58,040
which kind of makes me sad, but I kind of understand it.

673
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,320
And the other thing that is changing,

674
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,380
although not fast enough,

675
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:06,960
this is a picture from Flock to Fedora, it's 2017, I think.

676
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,560
And again, I'm sorry that the lights are bright

677
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,760
and you kind of can't see it,

678
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:13,220
but there's a really, really cool thing that I see here.

679
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:18,160
There are people of color, there are women,

680
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,160
there are folks with disabilities.

681
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:23,200
We are getting more inclusive.

682
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,280
We're not there yet, but we're getting more inclusive.

683
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:29,900
We're getting more inclusive, and that is phenomenal.

684
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,740
There's still a lot of room for improvement

685
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:32,740
in diversity and inclusion,

686
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:35,420
and I think that we need to pay attention to that.

687
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:39,360
And I want to make something really clear.

688
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,360
Diversity is inviting someone to the dance.

689
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,320
And I talk to folks and they're like,

690
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,720
oh, no, no, we work for diversity.

691
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,320
We have hiring requirements that, you know,

692
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:50,000
X percentage of people who come in are people of color,

693
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,360
or women, or disabled, or blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

694
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,300
Okay, that's fine.

695
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,940
Inclusion is asking them to dance.

696
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:02,040
Just because you have hired, you know,

697
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:05,180
X percentage of whatever group doesn't mean

698
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:07,840
that you are including them in your business.

699
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,180
There are way too many examples.

700
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:12,740
You can go to Reddit and find example after example

701
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:16,080
after example of brogrammer culture,

702
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:20,960
of token diversity, and more stories about discrimination

703
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,060
and outright harassment than you could shake a stick at.

704
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:29,080
Don't be that guy, or girl.

705
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:33,280
There are a ton of organizations out there

706
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:36,840
that really work hard to do diversity in tech.

707
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,740
There's Out in Tech for the LGBT community,

708
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:41,880
People of Color in IT, Chick Tech,

709
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,560
which is an organization that I've done

710
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,860
some volunteer work with in Austin and I love,

711
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:47,920
Brown Girls in Tech, Girls Who Code,

712
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:52,920
Trans Tech Social, and TGI Tech for kids who code.

713
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:57,920
And it's not just about LGBT, or women,

714
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:03,200
or it's also about disabilities, right?

715
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,800
And disabilities don't just mean

716
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,700
the ones that you can see, okay?

717
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:10,740
Neurodiversity is a really important topic.

718
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:13,040
There are a lot of folks who are terrified

719
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:17,340
to talk about things like mental health issues in tech,

720
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:18,920
right?

721
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:23,620
I have bipolar folks, it's scary to say that,

722
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:28,860
but it's important to break down the barriers.

723
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:31,960
Mine's controlled by medication, thank God,

724
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:36,960
but people need to feel safe in tech.

725
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,760
And we as a community have done a phenomenal job

726
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,300
in the past of bringing people in and including them.

727
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:43,600
Let's extend that.

728
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,580
So where are we going?

729
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:50,240
Man, I've given up on peering at the crystal ball.

730
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,640
How many folks go back and read the predictions

731
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:55,880
from the previous December every year?

732
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:58,820
And right, that's the reaction, belly laugh.

733
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:03,700
But there are some things that are kind of obvious.

734
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,940
Intel actually went down last quarter in sales,

735
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,300
in data center sales.

736
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:15,300
That is like a category 15 hurricane in the industry.

737
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:18,200
I mean, people, Intel just doesn't miss quarters,

738
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,640
so that's pretty crazy.

739
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:22,220
But the server virtualization market

740
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:24,320
is still expecting to grow.

741
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,620
So what does that say?

742
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:31,020
Public cloud, public cloud is taking over the universe.

743
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:33,100
People are not building private data centers

744
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:35,600
at anywhere near the rate that they used to.

745
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,400
And if you look at, this is actually energy absorption,

746
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:45,400
hmm, what's in Northern Virginia?

747
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:50,840
Well, yeah, yeah, NSA, but over and above that,

748
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:53,340
it's the US East region for AWS.

749
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,020
And if you look at cloud as a percentage

750
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:02,360
of that absorption, look at how much of the megawatts

751
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:06,160
that are being absorbed are being done by cloud providers.

752
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,460
Cloud is eating the universe.

753
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:11,060
And look at the data centers that are under construction.

754
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:13,140
That was in 2018.

755
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:16,940
So it's all moving towards cloud.

756
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:21,200
And this kind of sucks, but the days of the Linux admin

757
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,780
are mostly gone.

758
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,840
If you go to your favorite job site

759
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:29,220
and do a search for Linux admin,

760
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,720
I went to LinkedIn jobs and put in Austin

761
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:34,720
and did Linux admin, and you can see,

762
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,820
there were a few results, man, 46 results.

763
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,320
If I was looking for a Linux admin job,

764
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,220
I would call that a fairly target rich environment.

765
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:43,100
That's all right, I like that.

766
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:48,440
But then I put in cloud architect, 245.

767
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:51,440
Then I backed off and I said,

768
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,440
well, just give me all Linux in Austin.

769
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,740
And I was like, man, that's pretty cool.

770
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:56,680
1500 results for Linux.

771
00:36:56,680 --> 00:37:00,580
That's developers, admins, sales, whatever.

772
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:05,220
And then I did the same thing for cloud, 4,000,

773
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:07,680
just in Austin.

774
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:12,160
In Dallas, in the DFW Metroplex, it's more by a bunch.

775
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:17,200
Employers expect cloud competency.

776
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:23,860
But Linux is a huge underlying component of that.

777
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:27,580
So I'm not at all saying, oh, screw Linux, go cloud.

778
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:31,540
No, what I'm saying is you have an advantage right now.

779
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,080
But you need to understand all the things that Linux does,

780
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,920
sort of architecturally, right?

781
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,420
You need to actually understand networking

782
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:43,660
because cloud is very much about networking,

783
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:45,380
setting up virtual private clouds

784
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:47,720
and subnets and things like that.

785
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,620
You need to understand storage.

786
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:51,900
And I mean, block storage.

787
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:55,560
I mean, file storage, like NFS and Gluster

788
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,960
and things like that, and also object storage.

789
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,680
You need to understand those technologies.

790
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:03,080
Those are all built on Linux, folks, but understand them.

791
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,580
You need to understand application services

792
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:07,240
because the days of somebody

793
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:10,920
who just does Linux are gone.

794
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,780
You need to, at the very least,

795
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:15,880
understand the concepts of programming

796
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,380
and software development.

797
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:21,460
I will never be a good developer.

798
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:25,100
I mean, that's a whole other career path, honestly.

799
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:28,140
And this old dog doesn't wanna learn those new tricks,

800
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:30,140
if I'm being really blunt.

801
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:32,540
But I understand enough about software development

802
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:34,480
that I can have intelligent conversations.

803
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,740
Containerization is taking over the universe.

804
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:39,880
Go see David Sarine's story on,

805
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:43,980
or presentation on containerization later on.

806
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:46,820
And so you need to understand how containers work,

807
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:48,680
and you need to understand, let me go back one.

808
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,420
You need to understand orchestration.

809
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:52,720
So for Kubernetes and things like that,

810
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,020
you need to at least be understanding how it works

811
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:57,460
and preferably learn how to do it.

812
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,360
You need to learn enough about code

813
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,600
to be able to speak intelligently about it.

814
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:06,620
And everything should be infrastructure as code.

815
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:09,220
Everything should be automated.

816
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:11,280
If you are SSH-ing into machines

817
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:15,660
and doing bespoke one-off stuff, you're doing it wrong.

818
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:20,520
And security.

819
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,920
Did I mention security?

820
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:25,500
You really need to understand security.

821
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:28,940
I think that we're going to see

822
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:31,040
a lot more special purpose distros.

823
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,680
Things like what Core OS has done,

824
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,740
Atomic did before that went away,

825
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:38,220
Photon OS, things like that.

826
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:41,480
So I think you're going to see special purpose distros.

827
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,680
I think that that's coming.

828
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:46,020
Fedora and RHEL are doing some really cool things

829
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:49,120
around modularity, having a very slow-moving core

830
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,660
but very rapid-moving app streams.

831
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:53,160
That's neat technology.

832
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,900
I think you're going to see a lot more around that.

833
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:59,600
I will say, and this irritates me,

834
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:02,240
be aware of what I call cloud washing.

835
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,840
Doing the same thing that you do in a data center

836
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:09,120
except virtualizing it in Amazon or Azure

837
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:12,020
or Google Cloud Engine or Rackspace is fine.

838
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:15,880
There is a place for it, but it's not cloud.

839
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,820
That's just hosting, okay?

840
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:18,860
Be aware of that.

841
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:22,220
And don't let yourself go down the path of,

842
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:23,960
oh no, I still do infrastructure stuff

843
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,800
but I'm calling it cloud, and then all of a sudden

844
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:29,600
you're unemployable because you don't know cloud.

845
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:34,200
Because of all of the changes that I mentioned,

846
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,640
I think that the Linux community is morphing and blending,

847
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:39,480
and I think that that is a very, very good thing.

848
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,940
Meetups and lugs and things like that

849
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,140
are amazing ways to cross-pollinate

850
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:47,280
the ability to go to a Kubernetes meetup,

851
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,420
the ability to go to a containerization meetup,

852
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:51,380
the ability to go to a Python meetup

853
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:53,260
is a great way to cross-pollinate,

854
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:55,760
learn additional things, and to grow.

855
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:59,760
And I think that we have the ability to do good things

856
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,860
on an even broader scale.

857
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:04,500
The most proud that I have ever been

858
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,140
to be a part of this community

859
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:08,100
has when I've gone to events

860
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:12,240
and I've seen things like this girl in Bogota, Colombia

861
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,080
who was born without an arm,

862
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:17,020
there's no way her family could afford a prosthetic.

863
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:18,620
So a dude with a Red Hat machine,

864
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:20,280
a Fedora machine actually,

865
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:24,180
and 3D printing software, open source 3D printing software,

866
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:28,260
and some donated materials built her a prosthetic arm.

867
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:33,160
And he does that for kids all throughout Colombia.

868
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,740
One laptop per child,

869
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:38,460
that is one of the most amazing things.

870
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:40,040
It wasn't ultimately successful,

871
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:44,000
but it did do a lot of good and drive down

872
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,120
the costs for computing for underprivileged kids.

873
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,880
We have to remember, folks,

874
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:53,820
that that which has been given freely to us,

875
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:55,120
we need to pass along.

876
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:57,700
We have a responsibility.

877
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:59,640
I'm here because I have a responsibility

878
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,700
to those of you who have come behind me.

879
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:06,100
I hope that you will use your experience

880
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:09,100
and take responsibility for the folks who come after you.

881
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:13,080
We have to empower folks coming into technology.

882
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,880
We have to enrich lives.

883
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,840
We have to make things better.

884
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,780
We have to include,

885
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:24,320
and I think that will make the world a better place.

886
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,360
Thank you very much for having me today,

887
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,860

00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:47,880
