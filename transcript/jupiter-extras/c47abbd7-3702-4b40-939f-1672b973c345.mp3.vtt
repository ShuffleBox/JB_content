00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
Welcome to part two of my conversation with Jason Spizak.

00:03.000 --> 00:06.000
If you haven't had a chance yet, take a moment and go listen to part one.

00:06.000 --> 00:07.000
It's really great.

00:07.000 --> 00:09.000
Don't worry, we'll be right here when you get back.

00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
And now, for side two.

00:12.000 --> 00:22.000
[â™ª Music playing in the background for the rest of the video.

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
So, you use Linux to do your VoiceOver stuff.

00:25.000 --> 00:26.000
Oh, I do.

00:26.000 --> 00:27.000
Wait, let me back it up a little bit.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
You do a bunch of VoiceOver stuff, so much.

00:30.000 --> 00:34.000
You know, this isn't one of your first experiences, but so much that you had to,

00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
you know, we had to keep agreeing to move this date a little bit,

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
because you're doing a bunch of cool projects, so.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.000
I did, I did.

00:40.000 --> 00:46.000
They just released the trailer for Gears Tactics, which is a new Gears of War game.

00:46.000 --> 00:55.000
It's actually a tactical, which is awesome, but it also has really great story and cinematics.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
So, it's like a tactical with cinematics.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
It's so fun.

01:00.000 --> 01:05.000
I've been working on it for about a year and a half, and I play UConn,

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
who is the inventor of all the Locust weaponry.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
It's a prequel, the game is.

01:10.000 --> 01:14.000
And he's in the comics, actually, UConn is.

01:14.000 --> 01:19.000
And so, he's a seven-foot tall lizard creature who sounds nothing like me.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
But you sound like him.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
That's the interesting thing.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
That was just announced, I think yesterday or the day before.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
The trailer for it is wicked awesome.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
Oh, cool.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
And, you know, so I do a lot of voiceover.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
And so, you may have a few studios.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
I do.

01:35.000 --> 01:40.000
We're riding down the Brunch with Brent freeway, and we're taking the Segway.

01:40.000 --> 01:47.000
I have a studio in Los Angeles, and it's just a closet, a converted closet.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
I'm not going to say I got my studio in Los Angeles.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
Those are the best.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
You should see what I'm sitting in right now.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
Right.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
It's a closet.

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
I rent a place in Pasadena, and the landlord has been kind enough

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
to let me just have the closet be a converted studio

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
that I can, by the way, take down at any time

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
because it's made out of PVC and moving blankets, and it's very cool.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
That's a build for another day.

02:08.000 --> 02:13.000
And then at my home in Phoenix, outside of Phoenix in Mesa,

02:13.000 --> 02:18.000
I have a converted closet there, too, that I'm in right now.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
And it's super simple.

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
I have a monitor on a stand that's attached to the wall,

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
and above that is my microphone.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
I've got a Scarlett.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
I think it was an i2.

02:31.000 --> 02:35.000
Yes, this is a two-port i2 with an XLR jack plugged into it.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
It's USB connected to my Linux box.

02:38.000 --> 02:44.000
My Linux box is running KDE Neon, and I use Audacity.

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
So because in my business you don't need to produce your auditions,

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
you really shouldn't, they frown upon that.

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
You would heavily produce your auditions with music and transitions.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
They really just want to hear what your voice sounds like.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
You'll still use compression and normalization and everything,

02:59.000 --> 03:04.000
but they want to hear what your natural voice sounds like,

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
or the voice you're creating sounds like without any shenanigans.

03:07.000 --> 03:17.000
And I use Audacity, and I do, let's see, 20 auditions a week easily.

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
I'm in my studio for hours and hours every day,

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
and I have three waiting for me that are due on Monday.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
You've got work to do.

03:25.000 --> 03:31.000
And everything from Taco Bell's new Nachos Party Packs ads to Toyota.

03:31.000 --> 03:38.000
I've got a Toyota spot that's running, and two video games, animated series.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
I'm on DC Super Hero Girls.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
I'm on Young Justice.

03:42.000 --> 03:47.000
I play Forager and Kid Flash, Wally West on Young Justice,

03:47.000 --> 03:52.000
which was brought back by the internet after it was canceled on Cartoon Network.

03:52.000 --> 03:57.000
So yeah, I do a lot of voiceover, and I love my job.

03:57.000 --> 04:02.000
I've always done cartoon voices ever since I was a kid, imitating Mel Blanc and stuff,

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
you know, sitting too close to the TV.

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
I went out to L.A. to be an on-camera actor, and they were like,

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
no, no, no, we don't need you on camera.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
But you sound great, and you can do voices.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
It's just what I ended up making.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
Making money was the only way.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
It's the thing that I ended up supporting myself with.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
Well, you're in good company, I mean, us podcasters.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
We feel much the same, I think, right?

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
Oh, sure.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
Oh, the renaissance of radio is amazing.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
It was dying a hard death with corporate control,

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
and this is truly the renaissance of radio.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
And because our commutes are longer now,

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
you can listen to long-form things like Brunge with Brent.

04:41.000 --> 04:46.000
If our commutes weren't this long, nobody'd listen to this.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
Thank you, Exoburbs.

04:48.000 --> 04:54.000
But I feel like podcasts, in so many ways, are what radio never was.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
In many ways, they're not commercially controlled.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
At least a lot of the podcasts that are out there

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
have much less corporate control,

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
and some of them have ads and things like that,

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
but the person reads the ad, and then they move on.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
They're not spending a lot of time in their brain

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
thinking about their advertiser, per se, right?

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
Or worrying if they're going to cancel the podcast.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
Some may be, but there's a lot that aren't,

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
that are, you know, free as in freedom,

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
in addition to being free to download.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
Yeah, so I love listening.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
I have a drive from Phoenix to L.A. that's six hours,

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
and I make it once a week.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
So you listen to a thing or two, I would imagine.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
Right.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
Which is, in fact, how I found Linux Unplugged.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
It was the last one on my list.

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
I'd listen to every podcast in the world first.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
And then there it was, sitting there, and I'm like,

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
oh, should I listen to this one?

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
I don't know. I don't know about that icon.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
I don't know.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
Then cheese bacon changed the icons, and I'm like,

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
oh, yeah, I'll listen to that.

05:51.000 --> 05:56.000
The reason you and I even have run into each other

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
is because you were so kind as to email JB and say,

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
hey, guys, been listening for a while.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
But how long have you been listening,

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
and why did you even reach out in the first place?

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
Are you asking me why I'm stocking the boards here?

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
You know, it feels like a real treat that you did,

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
but, you know, why are you and I sitting

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
in the same virtual room right now?

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
I like that you're calling me out for lurking

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
on the boards right now.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
He's like, yeah, so, Jay, how long have you been lurking?

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
Be honest.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
Oh, yeah.

06:25.000 --> 06:31.000
Well, I've been lurking for, what, a month?

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
I've been trying to tell stories here

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
of some of our JB community, right?

06:36.000 --> 06:41.000
And I'm constantly being pleasantly surprised

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
by the great variety and huge reach

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
of some of that community.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
Are you mean we're not all assholes?

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
Except for me.

06:52.000 --> 06:56.000
We have a really great group of people, I think,

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
that surround the open source community,

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
and I'd like to think that we're special in that regard.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
I don't know if we are because I'm not as deep

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
a member of many other communities,

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
perhaps the green building community,

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
and those guys are all pretty cool, too, generally.

07:09.000 --> 07:13.000
But just the community feel of the podcast

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
where Chris goes around the mumble room

07:15.000 --> 07:20.000
and where the podcasts on the Jupiter Broadcasting slate

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
just have this easy going,

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
we have some people on sometimes,

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
sometimes another person's a host feeling about them,

07:27.000 --> 07:32.000
and it's just a relaxed way

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
of dealing with your audience

07:34.000 --> 07:38.000
that is very palpable and enjoyable.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
And I think that's one of the reasons

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
why it's all so fun to listen to.

07:41.000 --> 07:46.000
I'm interested in the topic also.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
That helps.

07:48.000 --> 07:52.000
Your human interest podcast is also super cool.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
It's not strictly about Lennox, you know?

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
Because ultimately it's the human story that interests people.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
Well, it turns out that most of us are human.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
Except me. That is correct.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
You are correct, or you were.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
I am dating Alexa.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
I guess what I'm trying to get to is

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
it feels like such a treat to be sitting

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
in this same conversation with someone like you

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
who obviously you have a breadth of experience

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
that I don't because I'm a little bit younger

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
and I've taken a completely different path

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
doing photography stuff.

08:23.000 --> 08:27.000
But we have many similarities, right?

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
Yeah. I mean, you're human.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
And so am I.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
And you have a thirst for knowledge.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
I mean, there are some people

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
who don't have a thirst for knowledge

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
and they're not very exciting to talk to.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
I feel like when you said photography,

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
I'll bet there's stuff that you could speak to

08:41.000 --> 08:46.000
about doing high-end professional photography here

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
that I would be like, holy moly.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
I mean, I understand that workflow

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
partly from just because photos are files perspective.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
But yeah.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
I mean, you have knowledge to share just the same as me.

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
Yeah. And I feel like that's the real beauty, right?

09:02.000 --> 09:06.000
Is that we all have these very individual experiences

09:06.000 --> 09:10.000
that make us a unique being with unique gifts

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
because of the intersections of all of our interests.

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
So for instance, like you've always had an interest

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
in this voiceover stuff.

09:17.000 --> 09:21.000
And yet you've also had an interest in Linux.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
And in your studio, those two are intersecting

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
on a daily basis.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
So what a cool place to put that, right?

09:27.000 --> 09:30.000
Yeah. And I'm fortunate in that regard

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
that Linux has come so far

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
that I don't have to drop into N-curses

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
to try and enable my Sound Blaster,

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
and it gets all messed up.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
So you've been there.

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
Oh, I'm about to preach to you.

09:43.000 --> 09:47.000
But I feel like Linux is coming of age

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
to where it's useful for so many things

09:50.000 --> 09:55.000
in so many ways that it just wasn't before,

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
even a decade ago.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
But just look at the Raspberry Pi.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
It's good for so much.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
Is it a great computer? No.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
Is it a great computer for a lot of the stuff it's used for?

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
Maybe not.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
But it's the fact that there's so much sharing

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
going on involved with the ideas,

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
and I can just take a Raspberry Pi and do this.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
It's an enabler.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
Again, it's the microcosm of what's it like

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
to share human knowledge.

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
And wow, look how effective that is.

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
Really effective when there's no restrictions on it

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
and everybody's scratching their itch with it.

10:29.000 --> 10:32.000
It's incredibly powerful and fast.

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
The level of innovation that's capable of,

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
we're capable of achieving as a species is incredibly fast

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
in time scales.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
It's just nutty when we work together.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
And my Linux studio is just an example of that.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
I mean that, and I love KDE.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
I'm so glad that Neon came out because for the longest time,

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
KDE was trying to find its way,

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
and then Frameworks 5 came out,

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
and then it was the red-headed stepchild of many distros

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
because it wasn't quite, you know,

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
the transition to 5 wasn't effective

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
because a lot of people were still using 4

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
and they didn't want to switch,

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
and are you going to do to me what 3 did to me?

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
Don't do that to me, you know, and I want KDE 3 better.

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
Eventually, I feel like KDE Neon,

11:09.000 --> 11:13.000
which is a stable base of Ubuntu LTS

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
with the latest sauce of KDE because the project

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
in general puts out some really great software,

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
is a wonderful combination,

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
and it works for me on a daily basis.

11:23.000 --> 11:27.000
And I have had so few problems with it

11:27.000 --> 11:31.000
that coming from 1997 to today,

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
I'm blown away that I have less problems with this

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
than I have, like, with a Mac.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
And having used a Mac for a long time,

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
I'm so grateful for that

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
and that everybody whose time and effort goes into that,

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
and if I file a bug report here or there,

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
I don't have any to file.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
I mean, that's crazy

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
because my use case is pretty flat.

11:53.000 --> 11:59.000
I mean, it's turn on Firefox, turn on Audacity, record,

11:59.000 --> 12:03.000
and then I take that file that was recorded

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
and I send it somewhere in the browser.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
I mean, like, I use two pieces of software,

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
and if you count the file manager, three,

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
like, from a user use case perspective,

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
and it's just a tank.

12:14.000 --> 12:18.000
I hit update, I put all my updates in frequently

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
without any trouble. It's crazy.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
Now, part of that is because I know

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
to buy the right hardware to begin with.

12:24.000 --> 12:27.000
So, let me preface that for everybody listening

12:27.000 --> 12:31.000
that I use the Focusrite Scarlett i2

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
because I know it shows up as a device under Linux

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
that is going to be Linux-friendly to the sound system.

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
It's going to be friendly to Linux's sound system.

12:39.000 --> 12:46.000
I use the hardware, my little NUC that I use,

12:46.000 --> 12:50.000
I use it because I made sure that the hardware inside

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
was well-supported under Linux.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
Like the Wi-Fi, for example.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
Like, it's Intel Wi-Fi.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
It works the best because it's Intel Wi-Fi.

12:58.000 --> 13:02.000
And if you just come to the table

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
with a little bit of that knowledge,

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
there's a lot more choices out there

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
than just buying from somebody pre-installed, you know,

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
because it's so easy to install Linux today, brain dead easy.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
And then I just don't have any issues.

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
I may have to create them, you know, like you guys.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
Like, hey, right before this recording,

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
I'm going to hit just upgrade and, you know,

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
I'm going to force it just because I want to see

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
how awesome I am.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
Keep things interesting, right?

13:28.000 --> 13:31.000
You're going to bend to my will right before this podcast

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
and I'm going to hit upgrade.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
I'm going to change my whole profile around

13:35.000 --> 13:39.000
and then you will do my bidding and record this podcast now.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
I've been there.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
Because, you know, in a sense, we like,

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
I'm sure that's an exercise of our power,

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
aka our knowledge.

13:47.000 --> 13:51.000
We want to feel like we're a little bit, you know, capable.

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
And so we test it that way.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
And that's silly.

13:55.000 --> 13:59.000
But also it's this way of never stopping to learn, right?

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
Sure, it is.

14:00.000 --> 14:04.000
But why do we pick the learning right before we have to use it?

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
That's just dumb.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
Forget it.

14:06.000 --> 14:10.000
Because that's the most exciting time, clearly.

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
Everybody listening to this, everyone who's been on this show,

14:13.000 --> 14:17.000
except for two or three people, have done that.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
And it's dumb.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
Don't do that in production.

14:19.000 --> 14:24.000
But what do you say to somebody who hasn't seen Linux yet

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
or hasn't even, you know, is looking for some hardware

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
and maybe is like, I don't know,

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
like maybe now is the time for me to explore that?

14:31.000 --> 14:35.000
Yeah, but you have to think about that sentence you said,

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
is there's probably not a person in the developed world

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
who hasn't seen Linux yet.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
They just don't realize it.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
That's the real trick, though.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
Right?

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
So if you're talking about desktop Linux,

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
proper desktop Linux,

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
because if they're using Android or they're using a Chromebook,

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
I mean, where in the developed world have you, you know,

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
I've never seen Linux.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
Well, that's not true.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
You have.

14:55.000 --> 14:58.000
I suppose I should be clear about what I mean about Linux.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
Yes, desktop Linux.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
And I think what I mean about desktop Linux

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
is actually some of the philosophies you and I

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
were talking about earlier,

15:06.000 --> 15:10.000
which is to have some of that feeling of digital independence

15:10.000 --> 15:15.000
and some onus in what's happening with your data

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
and those kind of topics, right?

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
And so how do you get someone to transition to that?

15:20.000 --> 15:23.000
You can convince them pretty easily

15:23.000 --> 15:26.000
that Linux is the right choice for some of those things

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
if they care about those things.

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
I think the biggest challenge is getting people to understand

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
why those things matter.

15:33.000 --> 15:36.000
Because if I've got a person who doesn't know Linux

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
and they're unfamiliar with it at all,

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
but they come to me and they go,

15:39.000 --> 15:42.000
you know what, I found this cool thing, Home Assistant,

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
because I am sick of my data getting sent.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
I'm not going to use Alexa.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
Dude, they're in my house spying at me.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
My buddy Brandon, who's the producer of Young Justice,

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
is this way.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
He's like, uses a Mac and everything,

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
but he's like, I'm not using Alexa.

15:53.000 --> 15:56.000
I'm not using Google, you know, to spy on me.

15:56.000 --> 15:59.000
I don't want hockey pucks with, you know,

15:59.000 --> 16:03.000
voices coming at me and knowing that every word I say to my children

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
is going out the other end.

16:05.000 --> 16:11.000
That person is a little easier to work into the desktop Linux fold

16:11.000 --> 16:15.000
because they've already shown that they care some about digital independence,

16:15.000 --> 16:20.000
you know, and there's plenty of people who don't.

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
You know, and we just have to understand that,

16:23.000 --> 16:26.000
that desktop Linux and in general, open source software

16:26.000 --> 16:30.000
isn't the answer to a problem that someone doesn't have.

16:30.000 --> 16:34.000
Well, what's interesting there is they don't even realize

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
that there is a choice or a problem.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
I mean, there's a lot of people who just don't care.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
Yeah, but do they not, I guess that's my question is,

16:41.000 --> 16:46.000
do they not care because they just don't even know it's happening

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
or do they not care by choice?

16:48.000 --> 16:51.000
I have to be honest, the people that I've pressed that issue on,

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
and this is just anecdotal evidence,

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
the people I've pressed that issue on think it's futile.

16:55.000 --> 16:59.000
Hmm, that's, what an awful feeling.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
They really think that so much goes through Amazon

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
and so much goes through Google that even if you were to do all the things

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
you think you're doing, Jason, you're not private.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
You're carrying around an iPhone right now.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
They know where you are.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
Yeah, but I use Apple Maps on my iPhone, not Google Maps.

17:12.000 --> 17:15.000
I use DuckDuckGo and not, you know, whatever.

17:15.000 --> 17:18.000
And, you know, there's mitigations to give them less data.

17:18.000 --> 17:22.000
I don't use Facebook. I don't use Twitter. I don't use Instagram.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
Well, aren't you boring?

17:24.000 --> 17:27.000
You're very boring then. Goodbye.

17:27.000 --> 17:32.000
I am worried that it's not the reason that people wouldn't be interested in Linux

17:32.000 --> 17:37.000
is because if they knew those reasons, they'd say, what's the use?

17:37.000 --> 17:40.000
That's the part that really has me worried.

17:40.000 --> 17:44.000
And there are some people who really, they just don't care.

17:44.000 --> 17:49.000
Most of the people that I've introduced to it are fascinated by it, if anything.

17:49.000 --> 17:53.000
And then I run up against the application firewall

17:53.000 --> 17:58.000
where their work doesn't work with it, their university didn't work with it,

17:58.000 --> 18:03.000
their whatever, they don't like LibreOffice because it's just not Microsoft Office.

18:03.000 --> 18:09.000
And whatever the reason is, paper cut here or there, and they abandon it.

18:09.000 --> 18:14.000
But the irony of that is that I haven't had a single person I've handed a Chromebook to yet,

18:14.000 --> 18:18.000
except for one person whose school would not let them use a Chromebook,

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
online university, stop using it.

18:21.000 --> 18:24.000
So this is a Linux converted Chromebook, yes?

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
No, no, no. This is just Chrome OS.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
Just a regular old vanilla, yeah.

18:28.000 --> 18:31.000
Just Chrome OS because they were so into the Google Apps.

18:31.000 --> 18:35.000
So that data point is like, why is that?

18:35.000 --> 18:39.000
Why can I hand someone a Chrome OS laptop and they got no problem with it?

18:39.000 --> 18:43.000
But when I've handed them Linux laptops in the past, I've run into wrinkles.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
What's the difference there?

18:45.000 --> 18:49.000
Because you and I both know it's just a matter of a few things

18:49.000 --> 18:54.000
because Linux, I can make something run like Chrome OS tomorrow.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
I really could.

18:55.000 --> 18:59.000
I could because I could literally download Chromium OS and Gallium, whatever.

18:59.000 --> 19:03.000
I could make it run like that.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
What's the reason?

19:05.000 --> 19:09.000
Where does the paper cut slide in there?

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
Or that they don't like it?

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
I don't know.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
Or why are you afraid?

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
There are some people who are like you and me who are like,

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
I don't know about Jim.

19:19.000 --> 19:23.000
I just don't think I could give him Linux and he'd be okay with it.

19:23.000 --> 19:26.000
I just, ooh, I'm a little afraid of that.

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
They're either a little too needy or whatever, I don't know what.

19:29.000 --> 19:33.000
But there are sometimes reasons in the back of your mind for certain people also.

19:33.000 --> 19:38.000
Well, and those become some of those barriers for us trying to share

19:38.000 --> 19:43.000
the things we know are good for us, which would be also good for them.

19:43.000 --> 19:49.000
That sentiment you were sharing earlier of like just wanting to spread it widely.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
But those are some of the roadblocks, right?

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
And I'm not sure we understand them quite enough.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
I don't know.

19:55.000 --> 20:04.000
It's very possible my worries are that if I introduce Linux at the wrong time,

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
they'll never do it, right?

20:06.000 --> 20:12.000
Because I have a way and you have a way of fail, try, try again.

20:12.000 --> 20:17.000
And not everybody's wired this way, especially when it comes to the black magic

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
pixie dust box called the computer.

20:19.000 --> 20:24.000
And if I try at the wrong time or if I broach this subject and they're not

20:24.000 --> 20:28.000
interested in what they're seeing over my shoulder on my screen or whatever,

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
and then have a bad experience, I've just ruined it.

20:31.000 --> 20:36.000
I've just ruined it for them and for me and for open source.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
And so I got to feel that out.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
Got to be a little careful about that.

20:40.000 --> 20:43.000
Otherwise it gets a bad name.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
That may be part of it also.

20:45.000 --> 20:49.000
That we are careful not to put it in a place that doesn't belong anymore

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
if we've been burned.

20:51.000 --> 20:55.000
Like the young Linux lover might be like, I'm going to share this with everybody.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.000
Oh yeah, check it out.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
Everybody loves Linux.

20:58.000 --> 21:02.000
And then pretty soon after you get burnt once or twice, you're like, okay,

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
everybody might like Linux.

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
You know, try it again and Linux is pretty cool.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
What do you think?

21:09.000 --> 21:14.000
And I think that could be coloring my perception is because I've used it for

21:14.000 --> 21:21.000
so many years and I may have a bit of an antiquated view because Linux is so much

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
better now than it's ever been.

21:23.000 --> 21:26.000
And I'm on guard against that, but it's possible.

21:26.000 --> 21:31.000
Well, you've likely had that conversation with users more than many of us

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
of trying to introduce Linux.

21:33.000 --> 21:36.000
I mean, you've created a few businesses, right?

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
Yeah.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
My mom doesn't use Linux.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
My dad doesn't use Linux.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
My wife doesn't use Linux.

21:42.000 --> 21:45.000
Like, and these are the people that are closest to me and I love them so much.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
Of course.

21:46.000 --> 21:49.000
My dad is an SAP programmer.

21:49.000 --> 21:55.000
I mean, Windows is where he spent his entire life.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
You know, so forget that.

21:57.000 --> 22:00.000
And so who are you to convince him that his tool was not good enough?

22:00.000 --> 22:07.000
And my mom always gets his old laptop and my mom is not tech savvy in the least.

22:07.000 --> 22:10.000
But if there's a problem, he can help her.

22:10.000 --> 22:13.000
She's right down the hallway from him.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
I'm not.

22:14.000 --> 22:17.000
I'm in a studio 400 miles away.

22:17.000 --> 22:23.000
I can't get a text from my mom when I'm recording Gears of War and like help her out.

22:23.000 --> 22:27.000
So I'd have to feel like it's worth this.

22:27.000 --> 22:31.000
And I just recommended my mom get a Chromebook for the first time,

22:31.000 --> 22:35.000
even though in the back of my mind I'm like, eventually that's going to look just

22:35.000 --> 22:39.000
like a Chromebook, but it's going to have Core Boot and it's going to have KDE Neon

22:39.000 --> 22:42.000
to make it look like, and she won't even know the difference and won't she be happy

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
because she doesn't know.

22:44.000 --> 22:47.000
But then part of me thinks, is it worth it if they don't know?

22:47.000 --> 22:54.000
Is it worth it if the person running your Linux box doesn't know what they have

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
and it's not?

22:56.000 --> 23:00.000
So now I have the mountain to climb of, do I educate them?

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
What will that take?

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
Will they accept it?

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
Will they even understand it?

23:05.000 --> 23:09.000
My mom's in her just about, she's, oh God, I can't say her age on the air.

23:09.000 --> 23:12.000
She'll find me and hunt me down and kill me.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
She'll boil me in acid.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
She's older than me.

23:15.000 --> 23:23.000
And since she's older than me, by just a small amount, ever so slightly,

23:23.000 --> 23:28.000
it's sometimes difficult to explain things like this technologically and educate her

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
on why this makes a difference.

23:30.000 --> 23:33.000
Now she would just blindly trust me, probably.

23:33.000 --> 23:37.000
But is blind trust in the person who gives you the Linux machine any different

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
than trusting Microsoft or Apple?

23:39.000 --> 23:43.000
It feels much the same, considering you don't know what's actually happening

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
either way, right?

23:44.000 --> 23:47.000
She may not have the understanding of what the underlying software is doing,

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
but we do.

23:48.000 --> 23:52.000
Well, and that's the fight, is that open source is really valuable

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
to those people who know.

23:54.000 --> 23:57.000
But there's a whole bunch of people who don't and don't care

23:57.000 --> 24:00.000
or don't have the capacity to know and understand that.

24:00.000 --> 24:04.000
So do we just give it to them and say, ask me questions if you want,

24:04.000 --> 24:07.000
but you don't need to know what's going on behind the curtain.

24:07.000 --> 24:10.000
It's too idealistic for me to think that I can explain what's going on

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
behind the curtain to everybody who touches it.

24:12.000 --> 24:18.000
So then should we not create something like Chrome OS that's completely open

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
and super simple?

24:20.000 --> 24:23.000
You know, is that what gallium is?

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
Do we ship that on hardware?

24:24.000 --> 24:27.000
Do we all get behind one project?

24:27.000 --> 24:32.000
I mean, what's the best way for Linux on the desktop not to be Chrome OS?

24:32.000 --> 24:35.000
Very good question.

24:35.000 --> 24:39.000
I've been around every corner of that idea in 22 years,

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
and I don't have the answer.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
And I'm of above average intelligence.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
At least that's what the IQ test said when I was a kid.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
You said you were so good at connecting dots.

24:47.000 --> 24:48.000
Oh, yeah.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
Sort of relying on you here.

24:50.000 --> 24:55.000
So you've been listening to this podcast, and this is the big reveal.

24:55.000 --> 24:58.000
Jason's going to solve the problem of desktop Linux.

24:58.000 --> 25:06.000
Next week on Brunch with Brent.

25:06.000 --> 25:12.000
So for you then, where do you take that energy of just wanting to dive into Linux

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
every single day?

25:13.000 --> 25:17.000
Where do you put it now knowing you're up against some of these challenges?

25:17.000 --> 25:20.000
I built a home assistant system for my dad.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
I gave it WireGuard.

25:22.000 --> 25:32.000
My oldest nephew, Kai, is a wonderful young man who has a thirst for knowledge

25:32.000 --> 25:36.000
when it comes to computers and has ever since he was like five.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
He's eight now.

25:37.000 --> 25:40.000
I've given him a Linux computer, a Raspberry Pi,

25:40.000 --> 25:44.000
helped him install on his computers over Thanksgiving.

25:44.000 --> 25:47.000
His task was to take this Linux computer where the hard drive had died.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
We put in an SSD together.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
He's eight.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
We put in an SSD together.

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
I watched him.

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
He did it himself.

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
That's so awesome.

25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
He put the OS on there.

25:56.000 --> 25:59.000
He goes, I go, Kai, which OS do you think we want?

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
And he goes, hmm.

26:01.000 --> 26:10.000
Well, XFCE is okay, but it's not as capable as KDE, I think.

26:10.000 --> 26:13.000
KDE Neon is really capable.

26:13.000 --> 26:14.000
And I love the way it looks.

26:14.000 --> 26:17.000
I can customize it really well.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
So let's go with KDE Neon.

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
Okay, buddy.

26:20.000 --> 26:23.000
Let's download the image onto this USB stick here.

26:23.000 --> 26:24.000
Okay, good.

26:24.000 --> 26:28.000
We're going to use DD and get that on there because we only rock the old school crap

26:28.000 --> 26:29.000
when I'm training people.

26:29.000 --> 26:32.000
And I'm like, okay, let's go.

26:32.000 --> 26:33.000
Put it in the side.

26:33.000 --> 26:34.000
Make sure it boots from the stick.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
You know how to make sure it boots from the stick?

26:35.000 --> 26:39.000
Yeah, you just go in the BIOS and you switch it to make sure if it's not already booting from that.

26:39.000 --> 26:40.000
Okay, buddy, go ahead.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.000
And this is old hat to him.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
He's eight.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.000
This is old hat.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
Like, yeah, dude, why are you asking me that?

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
It's the BIOS.

26:46.000 --> 26:47.000
That's so awesome.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
And then we boot into the OS.

26:49.000 --> 26:53.000
He watches the KDE Neon install, you know, clicks the reboot, pulls the USB stick out

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
and everything, and he's just tooling around in there.

26:55.000 --> 26:59.000
He goes, you know, I like the desktop with a little bit of a darker theme than this.

26:59.000 --> 27:03.000
It comes with this light theme, and I'm not sure that's for me.

27:03.000 --> 27:07.000
So he goes into the system settings and pokes a few and goes to the dark breeze theme, you know.

27:07.000 --> 27:16.000
And I just walk away with a big smile on my face because that's a future CEO or software engineer or kernel contributor.

27:16.000 --> 27:20.000
And so the answer is I do what I can.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
That's all any of us can be expected.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
Share it to those who want to listen, yeah.

27:24.000 --> 27:25.000
You do what you can.

27:25.000 --> 27:30.000
You find the avenues, find your strongest soldiers and advocates, give them the weapons necessary,

27:30.000 --> 27:33.000
and then, you know, you can help other people along the way.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
What's wrong with giving somebody a Chromebook?

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
It's Linux and it's also Linux compatible.

27:37.000 --> 27:41.000
And just make sure you send it to Matt so he can do the firmware before you give it to your mom.

27:41.000 --> 27:44.000
I mean, come on, let's all be realistic.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
Thank you, Matt.

27:46.000 --> 27:47.000
Right?

27:47.000 --> 27:48.000
I mean, come on.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.000
Yeah, for sure.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
But that's the way to think, right?

27:51.000 --> 27:56.000
The way to think is if I can't get you to be my software engineer and I can't get you to understand all of this,

27:56.000 --> 28:01.000
how can you help your grandson?

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
You can help in this way.

28:03.000 --> 28:06.000
Linux is the disease that will never leave me.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
It's the bug, isn't it?

28:08.000 --> 28:09.000
It is, man.

28:09.000 --> 28:14.000
One of my first mentors in photography said, oh, geez, Brent, I think you got the bug.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
Yeah.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
And it's hard to get rid of it.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
It sure is, isn't it?

28:19.000 --> 28:26.000
Because the reason is because you see a task before you and you immediately think how best to solve it

28:26.000 --> 28:30.000
is the open source toolkit that includes Linux and Friends.

28:30.000 --> 28:39.000
Because your eyes have now seen this path, you can't go, yeah, well, I'm just going to buy some commercial piece of crap

28:39.000 --> 28:42.000
and turn it on.

28:42.000 --> 28:46.000
Your brain is like, well, this could so much be better solved this way.

28:46.000 --> 28:51.000
And oh, I'm running into the limitations of this piece of hardware that's not really a hardware limitation,

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
it's a software limitation.

28:52.000 --> 28:56.000
Ugh, I needed to do this or whatever.

28:56.000 --> 29:02.000
And pretty soon, if you've had exposure to the open source world, you're going to ask questions.

29:02.000 --> 29:05.000
You're going to go out there on the internet, you're going to ask people, you're going to see what the thing is,

29:05.000 --> 29:11.000
and then pretty soon you start working backwards from that and you only start buying hardware that's open source friendly

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
because you don't want to run into a wall.

29:13.000 --> 29:21.000
Or when you do, you want to be able to rebuild the wall or stucco the wall or put a door in the wall.

29:21.000 --> 29:25.000
It's not the wall that bothers us, it's the inability to tear it down.

29:25.000 --> 29:28.000
Or to do anything with it but stare at a wall.

29:28.000 --> 29:33.000
Yeah, I think you've likely described the motivations for many of us listening.

29:33.000 --> 29:40.000
You were telling me earlier that you were recently at Comic-Con, which is a huge thing, and I've never been,

29:40.000 --> 29:45.000
and you hold a special place there for some people, which is, I'm sure, a nice feeling.

29:45.000 --> 29:52.000
This is San Diego Comic-Con, we're talking about, like, I had been hoping for many, many years to play the Joker.

29:52.000 --> 29:57.000
And Mark Hamill plays the Joker in a lot of video games and animated series.

29:57.000 --> 30:06.000
And Mark was very busy with Star Wars and a few other things, and he just was like, well, he gets the first shot at playing it.

30:06.000 --> 30:13.000
And he did not want to play that role for this particular animated series.

30:13.000 --> 30:19.000
He was either a little too busy or he wanted to do another project or whatever as an actor, you know, he has a lot of things on his plate.

30:19.000 --> 30:26.000
And so Warner Brothers turned to me and asked, will you be the Joker in Batman Hush, which is an animated movie?

30:26.000 --> 30:29.000
And I was like, that's awesome.

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
Yeah, don't mess this up, Spezac.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
And so I did.

30:33.000 --> 30:40.000
I asked them if they wanted me to do something similar to Mark or what is the vein of the Joker because the Joker can be different stylistically.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
Like, I also play the Lego Joker in movies.

30:42.000 --> 30:47.000
I also play the Lego Joker.

30:47.000 --> 30:50.000
I saw the scene with the spoon, which made me laugh.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
Oh, Spoonie, tell me I'm the best.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
You're the best Joker.

30:54.000 --> 30:58.000
Oh, yes.

30:58.000 --> 31:04.000
Yeah, so I play Lego Joker, but not in the theatrical release.

31:04.000 --> 31:10.000
That was a guy from Saturday Night Live or I can't remember the actor's name.

31:10.000 --> 31:23.000
But yeah, in a lot of the direct DVD movies and one or two games, the serious Joker, the animated movie Batman Hush Joker,

31:23.000 --> 31:34.000
was a little closer to a cross between probably the Joker in The Dark Knight and Jack Nicholson somewhere in between those two.

31:34.000 --> 31:40.000
There's a little bit of Cesar Romero thrown in there sprinkled because I grew up watching Cesar Romero as the Joker on the Batman TV show.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
I'm old!

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
But not the goofy type.

31:44.000 --> 31:53.000
There's this way of seeing what Cesar Romero is doing as kind of just unhinged and frightening in a way that can be construed goofy,

31:53.000 --> 31:58.000
but I wanted to bring some of that unhinged menace.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
Like, whoa, where's this guy going with this?

32:00.000 --> 32:06.000
So yeah, I got to do, I got to be the Joker.

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
Oh, hello bats.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
That sounds so frightening in my ears.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
It was a lot of fun.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.000
It was so fun.

32:13.000 --> 32:18.000
There's a scene in Batman Hush where he's in the alley and it's famous in the comics.

32:18.000 --> 32:26.000
Batman Hush, it's adapted from a comic graphic novel series and there's a scene in the alley where Batman,

32:26.000 --> 32:32.000
I'm not going to spoil it for people who haven't seen it, almost breaks his code because the Joker has,

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
he thinks the Joker has done something.

32:34.000 --> 32:42.000
And it was one of my favorite scenes ever as an actor to act because, you know, it's just wild and unhinged.

32:42.000 --> 32:48.000
And there's this wild fight between the Joker and Batman where Joker's not really fighting.

32:48.000 --> 32:51.000
Batman's just literally beating him up within an inch of his life.

32:51.000 --> 32:57.000
And it's just, it was a very intense scene to do as an actor.

32:57.000 --> 33:00.000
Yeah, and it was so great. It was just so great. Yeah.

33:00.000 --> 33:05.000
It's so fascinating to me that you get to live all of these various characters.

33:05.000 --> 33:11.000
Like you have to kind of become them, at least in your own rich imagination, right?

33:11.000 --> 33:14.000
And to then tell their story.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
Yeah, I have to.

33:16.000 --> 33:19.000
I don't have a, I mean, there are some people who probably could,

33:19.000 --> 33:22.000
I know a few of them that can just throw up, spin up a voice.

33:22.000 --> 33:25.000
And I tend to do a lot of physicality.

33:25.000 --> 33:30.000
I tend to do a lot of, you know, certain, hold my body a certain way

33:30.000 --> 33:38.000
and move my hands and my face and everything because it's all linked together to me

33:38.000 --> 33:42.000
to fully inhabit something because my job is to get you to never not hear Jason.

33:42.000 --> 33:48.000
My job is to just have you not see anything or hear anything but the character.

33:48.000 --> 33:49.000
And...

33:49.000 --> 33:54.000
So when I do Forager on Young Justice, you can hear Forager's voice.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
You're not hearing Jason anymore.

33:56.000 --> 34:00.000
When you're watching this bug with six arms on Young Justice,

34:00.000 --> 34:03.000
that's just what your brain is processing.

34:03.000 --> 34:08.000
You're like, that's what a bug with six arms from New Genesis sounds like.

34:08.000 --> 34:15.000
And the closer I am to me, the more imagination it takes

34:15.000 --> 34:20.000
to definitely imagine that person in a circumstance that's different than mine.

34:20.000 --> 34:21.000
It's different than me, right?

34:21.000 --> 34:24.000
Like, it's a Wally circumstance on Young Justice.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
His voice is pretty similar to mine.

34:26.000 --> 34:30.000
You can hear his voice when I'm, you know, when my voice is going on a lot,

34:30.000 --> 34:33.000
just my normal voice, you can hear intonations of Wally in there.

34:33.000 --> 34:42.000
And it is difficult to explain but to make sure it sounds like Wally

34:42.000 --> 34:45.000
and not Jason because they're different.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.000
It's actually more work.

34:46.000 --> 34:50.000
It's actually more difficult than to sound like something that sounds nothing like me.

34:50.000 --> 34:53.000
Hey, inches above sizzling death, I'm entitled to speak my mind.

34:53.000 --> 34:59.000
You know, Wally has a lot of energy and he's a lot, you know, very present

34:59.000 --> 35:02.000
and, you know, goofy, a lot of the ways that I'm goofy.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
And you bring yourself into every character.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
I mean, even in The Joker, as frightening as that sounds,

35:06.000 --> 35:10.000
you have nothing but your own psyche to process the imaginary circumstance

35:10.000 --> 35:13.000
and so you have to do that.

35:13.000 --> 35:17.000
You know, ultimately, it's coming through your AI running in your brain.

35:17.000 --> 35:18.000
Next question.

35:18.000 --> 35:19.000
I'm just kidding.

35:19.000 --> 35:20.000
Next.

35:20.000 --> 35:25.000
It just, I imagine that you don't ever run out of different voices.

35:25.000 --> 35:26.000
Me?

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
Because of the rich imagination that you have.

35:28.000 --> 35:29.000
No, no, no.

35:29.000 --> 35:33.000
Yeah, my imagination has always been one of my greatest assets, thankfully.

35:33.000 --> 35:39.000
There's no corner to which I don't love to retreat and pull up some wonderful sauce

35:39.000 --> 35:42.000
and bring it with me in a bucket to the next moment.

35:42.000 --> 35:49.000
I also feel like when I was young, I went on a trip to Disney World, Florida

35:49.000 --> 35:50.000
to Epcot Center.

35:50.000 --> 35:56.000
This was in seventh grade and it's really the first big trip outside of, you know,

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
close to my house I'd ever been on.

35:58.000 --> 36:04.000
And we went to the Epcot Center and there's this little place,

36:04.000 --> 36:07.000
I'm not sure if it's still there, I haven't been in a long time,

36:07.000 --> 36:11.000
where it's like the Imaginarium, I think it's called.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
And they were singing this song,

36:13.000 --> 36:16.000
Imagination, and you're like, oh.

36:16.000 --> 36:25.000
And as a kid, it was celebrating the aspect of your personality that can create,

36:25.000 --> 36:30.000
that can become whatever you want, that can alter reality to become

36:30.000 --> 36:33.000
what you'd like it to be, to make the world a better place.

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
All you need is your imagination.

36:35.000 --> 36:39.000
And that's true. That really is true.

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
That's why it's so powerful is that it's true.

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
And yet also so often lost.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
And I never forgot that.

36:45.000 --> 36:50.000
It reinforced me at just the right time, maybe through luck,

36:50.000 --> 36:55.000
to understand that my greatest power is my ability to imagine

36:55.000 --> 36:59.000
things that are not yet here or things differently than as they are.

36:59.000 --> 37:04.000
And it's a useful tool. It's a useful tool.

37:04.000 --> 37:07.000
That's the seeds of innovation, isn't it?

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
I think so. I think so.

37:09.000 --> 37:12.000
I'm also a fan of meditation.

37:12.000 --> 37:15.000
For the last four years, I've been doing mindfulness meditation.

37:15.000 --> 37:20.000
And it has helped me a lot, you know, to just be in the moment

37:20.000 --> 37:24.000
and not treat anything as negative, whether your foot is sore

37:24.000 --> 37:28.000
because you've been standing here talking to Brent in your studio

37:28.000 --> 37:34.000
and you feel the walking down the street, the breeze against your fingertips.

37:34.000 --> 37:40.000
And to be in that exact moment without your brain going anywhere

37:40.000 --> 37:44.000
but right here has helped me focus.

37:44.000 --> 37:47.000
It has helped me a lot to not get lost in thought,

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
some of which can be negative.

37:49.000 --> 37:54.000
And instead, if the thought enters your brain, to not dwell on it

37:54.000 --> 37:58.000
and to let it leave just the same way that it appeared,

37:58.000 --> 38:01.000
it offers me a great freedom.

38:01.000 --> 38:06.000
I have much more control over my emotions and a situation

38:06.000 --> 38:09.000
and I'm okay to see where things go.

38:09.000 --> 38:12.000
I don't have to think, oh, well, I feel super uncomfortable right now

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
and have to deal with the uncomfortableness.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
I can just say, oh, well, I feel super uncomfortable right now.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
I wonder what's about to happen next.

38:18.000 --> 38:22.000
And it's really changed my outlook on life.

38:22.000 --> 38:25.000
I would like to think that it's made me a better actor

38:25.000 --> 38:28.000
and a better father and a better human being.

38:28.000 --> 38:32.000
But yeah, so I'm a big fan of mindfulness meditation actually.

38:32.000 --> 38:37.000
What a gift to you as a person to do it for yourself, right?

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
To impact all of those areas.

38:39.000 --> 38:43.000
I was listening to Sam Harris and he's big into mindfulness meditation

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
and I was like, oh, that's interesting. Maybe I'll give that a shot.

38:45.000 --> 38:50.000
And I didn't do it through his app or anything like that.

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
I had some, I have nasal polyps.

38:52.000 --> 38:55.000
So you can hear that my natural voice has a little bit of a nasal tonality to it

38:55.000 --> 38:59.000
when I'm not trying to get around that.

38:59.000 --> 39:03.000
You can hear that my voice has a very nasal tonality to it when I'm not trying.

39:03.000 --> 39:06.000
And that's because I have nasal polyps.

39:06.000 --> 39:09.000
It's a genetic condition where the inside of your sinuses has growth.

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
Einstein had it, for example. Bill Clinton had it.

39:11.000 --> 39:14.000
It's just a genetic condition.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
So I had to have surgeries to cut them out.

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
So they use a laser endoscope to go up there.

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
They cut holes in my bones the very first time I ever had the surgery

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
and they just cut the growths out.

39:22.000 --> 39:25.000
And I just need to keep having them cut out because they keep growing.

39:25.000 --> 39:28.000
That's just part of my genome.

39:28.000 --> 39:32.000
And the fourth time I had this surgery, I was in a lot of pain

39:32.000 --> 39:36.000
and I just decided to take a little break from life, you know, just two weeks

39:36.000 --> 39:39.000
because I'm bandaged up and I'm healing.

39:39.000 --> 39:44.000
I read the Dalai Lama's Art of Happiness and I'm not a Buddhist,

39:44.000 --> 39:47.000
I'm not a religious person at all, but there was a lot of stuff that spoke to me in there

39:47.000 --> 39:50.000
and I was like, huh, he's been meditating since he's four.

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
He has these really cool perspectives.

39:52.000 --> 39:55.000
Maybe I could try meditating. Maybe it will help me.

39:55.000 --> 40:00.000
And so I just began my practice and there was just no way for me to get my brain to stop.

40:00.000 --> 40:05.000
I mean, shit, I can't even get my mouth to stop and I'm talking to you for four hours

40:05.000 --> 40:10.000
and people are falling asleep and they've gone to go get coffee and make popcorn

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
and then they've come back and they're like, Jesus, Jason's still talking.

40:12.000 --> 40:15.000
In that one sentence, there's no commas.

40:15.000 --> 40:19.000
And I thought, how am I going to do this?

40:19.000 --> 40:24.000
My brain, my thoughts are just always intruding on the present moment

40:24.000 --> 40:27.000
and they're powerful, powerful imagination.

40:27.000 --> 40:30.000
I'm very intellectual. I like to learn things.

40:30.000 --> 40:34.000
And just gradually, the same way that you open a door

40:34.000 --> 40:37.000
so that you won't make a creaking sound when a baby's sleeping,

40:37.000 --> 40:40.000
you're like, I'm going to open the door just a little

40:40.000 --> 40:43.000
and then just a little bit more and just a little bit more

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
and eventually the door is all the way open.

40:45.000 --> 40:48.000
I think my door is half the way open.

40:48.000 --> 40:53.000
First it was just seconds and then it was 10 seconds of peace

40:53.000 --> 40:56.000
and then it was 30 and then it was a couple of minutes

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
and then it was, I can only do this when I'm walking.

40:58.000 --> 41:01.000
And now it's like, oh, I can do this when I'm driving.

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
Oh, I can do this when I'm standing in line.

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
Oh, I can do this when this person's yelling at me.

41:05.000 --> 41:12.000
It's just an eventual place that your mind, you make a space in your mind

41:12.000 --> 41:22.000
and initially I likened it to like a gap, like if you ever watch an arc,

41:22.000 --> 41:26.000
a spark, an arc between two contact points

41:26.000 --> 41:30.000
and the further that gap is, the further the electric arc goes.

41:30.000 --> 41:34.000
And I likened to the fact that the beginning of my practice,

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
the two contacts were very close together.

41:36.000 --> 41:39.000
What would happen in the world would immediately happen in my head

41:39.000 --> 41:42.000
and it would immediately come out and that could be thoughts.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
That could happen to the world and I immediately have these thoughts

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
and I'd immediately embroil in these thoughts.

41:46.000 --> 41:49.000
I was just widening that gap.

41:49.000 --> 41:54.000
So what happens to me, I feel it, understand what's happening

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
and then I let it go.

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
I don't hold on to it.

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
I'm not holding on to this thought.

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
It's not circling in a spiral in my head.

42:02.000 --> 42:05.000
I'm like, okay, that's interesting.

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
Now I created like a gap, a mini gap.

42:07.000 --> 42:11.000
Well, huh, I wonder if I keep doing this, the gap will get bigger.

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
Well then eventually there's not really a gap.

42:13.000 --> 42:16.000
What you're doing is something comes on,

42:16.000 --> 42:21.000
it stays for as long as it stays like a sound, like a bell ringing.

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
When the bell stops ringing, the sound is gone.

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
You can't hold on to the sound any longer than that in your ears.

42:25.000 --> 42:30.000
It's gone and it leaves.

42:30.000 --> 42:37.000
So eventually it was more about going from a tiny little gap

42:37.000 --> 42:40.000
between the outside world and my thought process and everything else

42:40.000 --> 42:43.000
to letting it go completely.

42:43.000 --> 42:46.000
Like there's no other contact

42:46.000 --> 42:49.000
instead of there being two contacts really close together.

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
That's the only metaphor.

42:51.000 --> 42:54.000
That's the only metaphor I have for what meditation did for me.

42:54.000 --> 42:58.000
Yeah, but it puts it in a visual way that is helpful.

42:58.000 --> 43:02.000
I've certainly dabbled in some meditation

43:02.000 --> 43:07.000
and have known that it's one of the things I should probably do for myself regularly

43:07.000 --> 43:10.000
that would help me the most.

43:10.000 --> 43:11.000
How did you try?

43:11.000 --> 43:15.000
I mean, did you do walking meditation, sitting?

43:15.000 --> 43:19.000
What was that like, the attempt to practice?

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
I generally hyperfocus quite easily.

43:21.000 --> 43:26.000
What I mean by that is like I can dive into something for three hours when I'm learning it

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
and then I forget about the world.

43:28.000 --> 43:33.000
So I think that helps me to be able to sit still.

43:33.000 --> 43:38.000
And so I have tried those kind of simple methods of just like, okay,

43:38.000 --> 43:43.000
just sitting and watching whatever's happening on the inside.

43:43.000 --> 43:48.000
And the first few times I did it, it went from, huh,

43:48.000 --> 43:51.000
this is really curious to the second time I did it

43:51.000 --> 43:55.000
or maybe not exactly the second time, but I remember distinctly one of the times I was like,

43:55.000 --> 43:58.000
well, this is a really scary place.

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
I don't even know what's going on today, right?

44:00.000 --> 44:05.000
And it was fascinating to just pause.

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
And that's what I found to be the most powerful.

44:07.000 --> 44:11.000
Even if I can't pause my thoughts, I can watch them and it's like, okay,

44:11.000 --> 44:16.000
that is a reflection of the state of being that I'm experiencing currently.

44:16.000 --> 44:21.000
And even just getting that far was like, oh, okay,

44:21.000 --> 44:27.000
this is telling me a lot about myself that I did not know when I'm just busy and busy and busy and busy.

44:27.000 --> 44:33.000
I think the idea of examining the state is one that programmers can probably understand.

44:33.000 --> 44:38.000
And anybody listening to this that you can relate to that, yeah, we are.

44:38.000 --> 44:39.000
We're like just a big state machine.

44:39.000 --> 44:44.000
And there's this idea that we're moving from one state to the next

44:44.000 --> 44:49.000
and that your brain somehow comes along for this ride

44:49.000 --> 44:52.000
and then it's changing the condition that it's under.

44:52.000 --> 44:57.000
And that the driver of the car, you know, the thinker of the thoughts,

44:57.000 --> 45:00.000
somehow is participatory in the machine state.

45:00.000 --> 45:05.000
And the most interesting thing about meditation for me is there is no driver of the car.

45:05.000 --> 45:11.000
There is no, there doesn't have to be, that does not have to participate in the state.

45:11.000 --> 45:12.000
The state is just what it is.

45:12.000 --> 45:19.000
And that was really weird to get to that realization and to see that or feel that

45:19.000 --> 45:26.000
where the loss of self, even however temporary in my young practice of only like three or four years,

45:26.000 --> 45:32.000
to feel the sense of self disappear and all that's left is the state.

45:32.000 --> 45:35.000
People hear that and they go, you're just lying.

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
You're just, you're making shit up.

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
You want to sound like you're important.

45:39.000 --> 45:43.000
You want to sound like you're cool and smart and doing something other people don't do

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
and whatever, hipster.

45:45.000 --> 45:48.000
And I, it's the only way I can describe it.

45:48.000 --> 45:53.000
Well, and if you speak to anyone who's done this for any significant length of time,

45:53.000 --> 45:56.000
that's a theme that comes up over and over and over and over.

45:56.000 --> 46:00.000
So it's like, well, you haven't all got in a room and agreed to lie about this thing.

46:00.000 --> 46:01.000
There's something real going on here.

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
Maybe, or we all just share the same lie.

46:03.000 --> 46:07.000
I mean, it could be that, you know, your brain's being convinced that that's what you're feeling

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
when you're not and yourself is leaving.

46:09.000 --> 46:15.000
But there's super small and easy tricks you can do to focus your attention.

46:15.000 --> 46:20.000
And then when your memory, like the thing that's running in the background,

46:20.000 --> 46:24.000
remembering all your memories, whatever that's called, hippocampus.

46:24.000 --> 46:25.000
I don't even know what the word is, whatever.

46:25.000 --> 46:30.000
But whatever it's doing, you realize that you don't quite have a memory of anything else

46:30.000 --> 46:33.000
but the sense of the sensation of whatever that was.

46:33.000 --> 46:37.000
You don't have the memory of the fact that you were meditating.

46:37.000 --> 46:41.000
Like, you do remember before, when you started meditating,

46:41.000 --> 46:45.000
and you do remember before that moment when you were feeling comfort, whatever.

46:45.000 --> 46:50.000
But then after, you remember what it was like to catch yourself and be like,

46:50.000 --> 46:51.000
wait, what?

46:51.000 --> 46:58.000
Your memory like takes us just a little, like it goes offline for a minute or two?

46:58.000 --> 47:01.000
That can be very interesting.

47:01.000 --> 47:06.000
I'm not saying that happens all the time to me, but that also is very interesting.

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
That's super rare.

47:08.000 --> 47:13.000
You know, a really interesting metric that I've noticed for myself is that

47:13.000 --> 47:17.000
I remember every single place that I've sat down to meditate,

47:17.000 --> 47:20.000
whether it was for five minutes or 30 minutes.

47:20.000 --> 47:26.000
It's that those experiences, as simple as they may seem from the outside,

47:26.000 --> 47:32.000
become really powerful to the point where they're significant enough to remember.

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
Well, and that's funny because I do remember.

47:34.000 --> 47:37.000
Like, I remember I was sitting in the car and I was driving to Phoenix

47:37.000 --> 47:40.000
and my arms were right in front of me.

47:40.000 --> 47:43.000
And I had this experience where I was just looking at my arms,

47:43.000 --> 47:47.000
but they were no longer my arms, and I wasn't taking, you know, MDMA,

47:47.000 --> 47:50.000
and I wasn't, you know, doing any fungus.

47:50.000 --> 47:57.000
I was just like, not out of body, in body, that they were arms,

47:57.000 --> 48:01.000
but they were not belonging to a person.

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
And it was really weird.

48:03.000 --> 48:08.000
And I remember it because when I was like, I came out of it or whatever,

48:08.000 --> 48:12.000
but I couldn't tell you anything else that was happening.

48:12.000 --> 48:15.000
I couldn't tell you what was on the radio.

48:15.000 --> 48:20.000
I couldn't tell you anything else about the experience except for that I know

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
that this happened.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
You know, it was just weird.

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
Because I have a semi-photographic memory.

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
It's one of the ways I remember lines.

48:28.000 --> 48:32.000
And so, my short-term memory is off the chain.

48:32.000 --> 48:37.000
And, like, if I walk into a place and I can tell, like, what people are dressed as,

48:37.000 --> 48:41.000
and if the cop interviews me, like, 10 minutes after it, I can be like,

48:41.000 --> 48:45.000
this is exactly what everything looked like, and it's pretty darn close.

48:45.000 --> 48:49.000
But give it a couple of weeks, man, does it start to fade away.

48:49.000 --> 48:52.000
And then years, my brother has to remind me of something.

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
And I'm like, oh, yeah, I did that. I was there.

48:54.000 --> 48:58.000
So that helps learning lines because I can look at the lines.

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
I can know what I'm about to say.

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
I can put the paper down and say it.

49:02.000 --> 49:06.000
Super helpful in my line of work, right, on the motion capture stage

49:06.000 --> 49:09.000
where you have to wear the motion capture helmet.

49:09.000 --> 49:12.000
Like golemses, you have to wear the helmets.

49:12.000 --> 49:15.000
And then you have to say, yes, precious.

49:15.000 --> 49:19.000
And you're hopping around like a creature.

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
You can't have the script in your hand.

49:21.000 --> 49:25.000
So, you have to memorize it.

49:25.000 --> 49:29.000
So, lucky that that's just a benefit of the way my brain is constructed.

49:29.000 --> 49:34.000
And it gets better with practice, but I've always had a memory good at it.

49:34.000 --> 49:42.000
And it's interesting that that tends to sort of get fuzzy and weird in those moments.

49:42.000 --> 49:46.000
Even minutes after, I should have been able to know what everything was going on.

49:46.000 --> 49:49.000
So, there's a part of my consciousness that's online.

49:49.000 --> 49:52.000
And when I'm meditating, it goes offline.

49:52.000 --> 50:00.000
That is linked to the perception data of that I'm collecting everything around me

50:00.000 --> 50:05.000
to the point where I can tell you, yeah, well, she raised her hand just five minutes ago.

50:05.000 --> 50:08.000
And didn't you see she had a bracelet on and she's wearing a pink sweater?

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
Yeah, she's right behind that guy, blah, blah, blah, blah.

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
And like you turn around and that's the case.

50:12.000 --> 50:19.000
I've heard often that those who meditate often feel almost like it's a nap of sorts.

50:19.000 --> 50:23.000
You know, the way we describe a nap to like go get a tiny boost of energy.

50:23.000 --> 50:27.000
But it's like a totally different approach.

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
And what you're describing reminds me of that.

50:29.000 --> 50:34.000
It's like, okay, all of these systems that are active 100% of the time that your eyes are open during the day

50:34.000 --> 50:37.000
are just kind of shutting down in a very helpful way.

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
Yeah, I guess I never really thought it like that.

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
Like systems offline.

50:41.000 --> 50:45.000
Jason's visual perception system offline.

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
Jason's memory system offline.

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
Conserving energy in suspend.

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
Loss of self.

50:51.000 --> 50:54.000
But not only conserving energy, but going to a completely different place,

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
which is the fascinating thing.

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
I don't even know if this would be beneficial to anyone else.

50:58.000 --> 51:02.000
I talk about it, I say these are the benefits that I have derived from it.

51:02.000 --> 51:07.000
And even if it's psychological trickery and somehow I've managed to trick myself into this state of flow

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
while doing nothing.

51:09.000 --> 51:12.000
State of flow while not flowing, while not doing something.

51:12.000 --> 51:15.000
Except for concentrating really hard on not doing anything.

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
That it's different than flow.

51:17.000 --> 51:23.000
And being that I derive this benefit is a fact to me.

51:23.000 --> 51:26.000
Whether it's true or not, I guess, right?

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
It's just so weird.

51:28.000 --> 51:32.000
I mean there's scientific studies on the brains of meditating people

51:32.000 --> 51:36.000
and they have different wave patterns and they have different permanent states

51:36.000 --> 51:40.000
that are different than the states of the brain of people who don't meditate.

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
So I mean there is scientific evidence for that.

51:42.000 --> 51:45.000
I don't know the efficacy of the studies.

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
I don't know how the peer review has been.

51:47.000 --> 51:52.000
But I imagine it would be neat to continue to study it.

51:52.000 --> 51:56.000
To see if there's anything scientifically we can gain rather than just AI feel better.

51:56.000 --> 51:59.000
Because there are people who put crystals all over themselves and feel better.

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
I'm not one of those people.

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
And I'm not one of the people who think, yeah, that's going to work.

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
They're all different tools, right?

52:05.000 --> 52:12.000
Anytime you gather data about something, then you have at least a reasonable surety

52:12.000 --> 52:18.000
that another human who engages in a given practice can get a similar outcome or result.

52:18.000 --> 52:24.000
And so if you're hoping to help people, that can only help to have the data.

52:24.000 --> 52:28.000
No knock on people who just love to put crystals all over themselves.

52:28.000 --> 52:32.000
You don't have to give me the hate mail because I'm not on social media.

52:32.000 --> 52:35.000
I'm not on Twitter or Facebook or Instagram.

52:35.000 --> 52:38.000
I dumped all that stuff a year ago and I'm so much happier.

52:38.000 --> 52:44.000
Could you think of one tip for someone who wanted to just kind of try meditation?

52:44.000 --> 52:51.000
Not necessarily dedicate to it, but just give it like a quick try just to see?

52:51.000 --> 52:55.000
I think Sam Harris's Waking Up app is actually pretty darn good.

52:55.000 --> 52:59.000
I mean, I've used it also.

52:59.000 --> 53:05.000
I shared it with my brother and my friend Nathan and they've gotten good results.

53:05.000 --> 53:08.000
It's difficult to continue the practice.

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
There is no tip for beginning.

53:10.000 --> 53:16.000
Yes, you can follow the first couple episodes and he's a great guide for it.

53:16.000 --> 53:19.000
The trouble with like, show me how to work out.

53:19.000 --> 53:20.000
Okay, great.

53:20.000 --> 53:24.000
I put my bicep here, I lock it at my hip and I do a curl like this.

53:24.000 --> 53:27.000
Okay, I make sure that when I do my shoulder press that the weight doesn't go too far behind my head.

53:27.000 --> 53:28.000
Okay, great.

53:28.000 --> 53:29.000
He showed me how to work out.

53:29.000 --> 53:35.000
Now, getting my ass to work out, that is a totally different story, baby.

53:35.000 --> 53:36.000
That's the hardest part, isn't it?

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
I know how to work out.

53:38.000 --> 53:43.000
I don't know why I'm not working out because it's difficult.

53:43.000 --> 53:52.000
It's hard even though I do see some result when I do work out and that's the long tail of meditation.

53:52.000 --> 53:56.000
You know, I said it often that showing up is like 50% of the work.

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
It is.

53:58.000 --> 54:05.000
And the cool part is you can meditate anywhere with just even seconds so you don't really have an excuse.

54:05.000 --> 54:08.000
You don't have to get your workout clothes or your yoga outfit.

54:08.000 --> 54:09.000
You don't have to do anything.

54:09.000 --> 54:14.000
You don't even have to be a quiet place really because you can start mindfulness by listening to horribly noisy things.

54:14.000 --> 54:20.000
So really, if you're looking at barrier to entry, it's low.

54:20.000 --> 54:25.000
I only need to buy a Fitbit and the right shoes and I can meditate tomorrow.

54:25.000 --> 54:35.000
So I feel like it's easy to begin and probably difficult to continue.

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
Like all good things.

54:37.000 --> 54:47.000
Jason, if you wanted to put out a question to the community or even something you'd like them to try or think about,

54:47.000 --> 54:50.000
is there anything you want to throw out there for those who are listening?

54:50.000 --> 54:56.000
I would like to see people try to assess their digital independence.

54:56.000 --> 54:59.000
I would like for them to understand what it means.

54:59.000 --> 55:08.000
When the United States was formed and many representative republics, the idea behind it was the opposite of tyranny,

55:08.000 --> 55:15.000
was we are sick of being told everything that we can do, we can say what we can believe or whatever.

55:15.000 --> 55:26.000
And I really would like it if we could have some independence and interact with each other on humans as close to a level playing field as possible.

55:26.000 --> 55:30.000
Now, I'm fully aware that our country was founded by slaves.

55:30.000 --> 55:33.000
I'm a third generation American, so I wasn't even here for that.

55:33.000 --> 55:43.000
But the idea that our Constitution was written by people who were experiencing tyranny and wanted to escape that.

55:43.000 --> 55:50.000
That if you could say to yourself, well, we're increasingly living in a world that does not have boundaries.

55:50.000 --> 56:01.000
I mean, the great firewall of China is there, but the internet exists and the ability for us to get from one place to another via plane and talk to each other and it's pervasive.

56:01.000 --> 56:05.000
So those type of boundaries are becoming less important.

56:05.000 --> 56:20.000
What's more important now is your digital freedom, your freedom to move ideas, your freedom to move value around without gatekeepers and arbiters and tyranny.

56:20.000 --> 56:33.000
It's so valuable as our species steps into the next millennium and things get increasingly away from using natural resources of the earth to move things around and just using ones and zeros.

56:33.000 --> 56:51.000
If you can explore the idea, the mental exercise of living in a world where your digital independence is as constricted as it would be in a world without a representative republic, a way to vote.

56:51.000 --> 56:56.000
Even though a lot of people think that may not have an effect, it does.

56:56.000 --> 57:07.000
You're an incumbent and a whole bunch of people vote for someone else in the primary and you ended up not representing your party because they picked a different person from your party and they did what they incumbent did you.

57:07.000 --> 57:10.000
They primaried you. There's a fear there.

57:10.000 --> 57:14.000
There is a fear from the elected official that they could get voted out.

57:14.000 --> 57:15.000
Still exists.

57:15.000 --> 57:21.000
What would it be like in a world, a digital world, where those freedoms are gone?

57:21.000 --> 57:26.000
You don't have any choice what to use, what to think or read.

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
It's being fed to you.

57:28.000 --> 57:40.000
You don't have a way to escape it because you have to do your banking and it's required and you have to do your job and this is required and you can't get away.

57:40.000 --> 57:48.000
Yeah, I mean, those sound like extremely powerful perspectives and a little bit scary in many ways, right?

57:48.000 --> 57:51.000
Yeah, I went all serious.

57:51.000 --> 57:58.000
I went 100% serious and then people are listening to that and they're like, well, I'm getting out the scissors now for a little self-mutilation.

57:58.000 --> 57:59.000
Thanks, Jason.

57:59.000 --> 58:02.000
You're really great and I have to up my Zoloft dosage.

58:02.000 --> 58:05.000
I really appreciate your podcast.

58:05.000 --> 58:11.000
Mr. Spizak, just wait till I show up at your door with my unholstered rifle.

58:11.000 --> 58:15.000
Yeah, unfortunately, I don't mean it in a depressing way.

58:15.000 --> 58:18.000
I mean it in a just think about that.

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
You don't want that.

58:20.000 --> 58:23.000
Like all of a sudden, I was like, don't think about that.

58:23.000 --> 58:24.000
You don't want that.

58:24.000 --> 58:27.000
You'd like to live in a world where you have some choice.

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
Digitally, you have a choice.

58:29.000 --> 58:34.000
And right now, you think you have choices like in consumer products and everything.

58:34.000 --> 58:43.000
But once you get down to only a few handful of companies controlling everything, I mean, ask people who live in an area where they can only get Comcast Internet.

58:43.000 --> 58:49.000
And just magnify that times whatever products or services that you have to access.

58:49.000 --> 58:58.000
And believe me, every company wants a monopoly, even though it's really the worst way to do business and bad for a lot of things.

58:58.000 --> 59:04.000
They can be much more profitable if they don't usually, but it's easier not to compete.

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
It just is.

59:06.000 --> 59:11.000
And open source has a way of ruining everybody's party.

59:11.000 --> 59:22.000
I mean, if you're a capitalist, if you're a capitalist in a monopolist or you're a corporation and you've got an open source competitor, you're like, ah, I can't get rid of this.

59:22.000 --> 59:23.000
What do I do?

59:23.000 --> 59:24.000
Sue them?

59:24.000 --> 59:25.000
What do I do?

59:25.000 --> 59:29.000
Well, look, nobody would use it if you were not a turd.

59:29.000 --> 59:32.000
So, you know, don't be a turd.

59:32.000 --> 59:57.000
Yeah, one thing I really appreciate about like throwing your mind in those imaginations, you know, to take them way over here, you know, to stretch them as far as they can is that it gives you the sort of energy or the perspective or the will to say, oh, OK, well, maybe we're not that far, but we sure are going down that road.

59:57.000 --> 01:00:06.000
So what can I do in my own personal choices to turn that around to things that I actually believe in much more?

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:18.000
I find that change requires energy and deriving energy from yourself and your own motivations is a talent and a personality trait.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:24.000
But I find that deriving energy from helping other people is almost universal.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:29.000
So there are many self-starters, there are many people who can just be like, I want to change.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.000
I want to change tomorrow.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.000
I'm going to do that.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
And they do that.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:51.000
But they're almost universally, if you're helping someone and the two of you are doing it together or the three of you or the 20 of you and you feel like you're not alone in this endeavor and you might be doing someone else good and helping them.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
For some reason, change isn't so hard then.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:57.000
I mean, you just described open source projects with the collaborations that happen.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:10.000
It's like, OK, well, we may have met a few of the people that we're interacting with to create these projects or but there's this sense that you just want to make us all better in the process of collaboration.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:14.000
And as we've seen that that certainly happens.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:15.000
That's what you would hope.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:19.000
So if you're looking for the energy to change, do it for a fellow human being.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:20.000
It'll help.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Thank you so much for bouncing all these ideas around and sharing your perspectives.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:30.000
And I've really I was really looking forward to doing this conversation.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
And the occasional silly voice.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:40.000
And if you would give us one more silly voice of your choosing, it doesn't have to be silly.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:43.000
Would you have something in mind?

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.000
I need to give you some context.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:49.000
I know I could do a really good Ollivander from Harry Potter.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:52.000
I remember every wand I've ever sold, Mr. Potter.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:02:00.000
It's curious that you should be destined for this one when its brother gave you that scar.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Oh, we do not speak his name, but he who must not be named did great things.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:11.000
Terrible, but great.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Whatever. And I think it's clear we can expect great things from you anyway.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Whatever that. Yeah.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
So I do a pretty good Ollivander.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
Do I pause now?

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.000
No, you can do whatever.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.000
I mean, I could do just I could do voices forever, man.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.000
I love it.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
Of course. Well, I mean, it's it's it's in you.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
You can't get rid of that, I think, right?

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
No, I'm possessed.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:36.000
Thank you so much for connecting with us in the first place, for sitting down with me and having a chat.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.000
I really appreciate it.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:40.000
And it's so great to know you're out there listening.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.000
That's that's for sure.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.000
So thank you.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Yeah. So you better do a good job.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
Yeah, thanks.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:49.000
Can you give us a little outro to something real quick?

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
Let's see.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:03:00.000
You have been listening to Brunch with Brent, an incomparable smorgasbord of intelligent conversation and wit.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:13.000
