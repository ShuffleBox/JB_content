00:00.000 --> 00:02.740
Welcome to part two of my conversation with Peter Adams.

00:02.740 --> 00:03.860
If you haven't had a chance yet,

00:03.860 --> 00:05.600
take a moment and go listen to part one.

00:05.600 --> 00:07.580
If you have already, here's side two.

00:17.580 --> 00:19.420
So when I came back to photography,

00:21.380 --> 00:23.460
full-time as a professional,

00:23.460 --> 00:25.520
it was like one,

00:25.520 --> 00:30.340
it was so high on my list of projects that I wanted to do

00:30.340 --> 00:32.860
just because it had made such an impact

00:32.860 --> 00:36.100
in my personal life and my professional life.

00:36.100 --> 00:38.020
And I knew the story,

00:38.020 --> 00:41.080
I knew the power of open source.

00:41.080 --> 00:46.080
And I just couldn't believe that there was

00:47.900 --> 00:50.720
effectively zero photography documenting

00:50.720 --> 00:55.120
this amazing community of people doing this amazing work.

00:55.120 --> 00:58.120
So that was where I dove into it.

00:58.120 --> 00:59.600
Yeah, the story of open source

00:59.600 --> 01:03.440
is so much told through code.

01:03.440 --> 01:05.960
I guess as a medium of expression perhaps,

01:05.960 --> 01:10.960
but having other media forms capturing that same essence

01:12.280 --> 01:16.620
is I think a nice way to fill it out a little better.

01:16.620 --> 01:19.120
Yeah, I mean, as much as it's code and projects,

01:19.120 --> 01:21.520
I mean, open source is really all about the people

01:21.520 --> 01:24.180
because without the people,

01:24.180 --> 01:26.120
there would obviously there would be no code,

01:26.120 --> 01:28.360
but without the personal stories

01:28.360 --> 01:33.360
of why people invest their time and energy in open source,

01:33.660 --> 01:35.080
it's that personal experience

01:35.080 --> 01:36.660
that leads people to open source.

01:36.660 --> 01:41.340
That's what I found in my travels and talking to people.

01:42.700 --> 01:44.740
People don't go into open source,

01:45.760 --> 01:47.660
like they go into a profession saying,

01:47.660 --> 01:51.360
oh, well, I could be a lawyer, I could be a doctor,

01:51.360 --> 01:52.720
I could do open source.

01:52.720 --> 01:53.880
That's not how it goes, right?

01:53.880 --> 01:58.880
People are somehow there's a personal experience

01:59.680 --> 02:02.840
or something that has impacted them

02:02.840 --> 02:05.200
that has led them to open source.

02:05.200 --> 02:07.200
Whenever I discover that about somebody

02:07.200 --> 02:09.400
and I hear their personal story,

02:09.400 --> 02:12.120
that's one of the most exciting things about open source

02:12.120 --> 02:14.360
to me is just seeing the community

02:14.360 --> 02:16.760
through that collection of personal experiences.

02:16.760 --> 02:20.760
I would echo that completely through every single one

02:20.760 --> 02:24.560
of the discussions that I've had here on this show.

02:24.560 --> 02:28.640
I've discovered that every person has a story

02:28.640 --> 02:30.180
of how they came to open source

02:30.180 --> 02:32.160
or how it came into their life.

02:32.160 --> 02:34.200
And they're pretty varied.

02:34.200 --> 02:37.400
For you, that was surrounded

02:37.400 --> 02:40.760
by quite a bit of an important piece of history,

02:40.760 --> 02:44.080
but lots of it's in a professional setting and all of that.

02:44.080 --> 02:46.280
But for many people,

02:46.280 --> 02:51.280
it's been sort of passed on by their brother in my case,

02:51.600 --> 02:55.000
or a friend who just suggests that,

02:55.000 --> 02:57.960
no, I think you'd like this, you should check it out, right?

02:57.960 --> 03:00.680
It's that really kind of intimate story

03:00.680 --> 03:03.600
that we all have connected to it that I agree

03:03.600 --> 03:08.600
is quite a powerful force and never really leaves us, right?

03:09.720 --> 03:12.800
It doesn't, it's so weird, right?

03:12.800 --> 03:16.600
Because I mean, there's so few things that stick with you,

03:16.600 --> 03:18.320
I think, kind of like this.

03:18.320 --> 03:20.720
I mean, yeah, you're always into things

03:20.720 --> 03:23.560
and you're into certain bands or you're into certain music

03:23.560 --> 03:27.520
or certain art or certain lifestyle

03:27.520 --> 03:29.520
or whatever it is over the years,

03:29.520 --> 03:31.880
that kind of comes and goes and fades away.

03:31.880 --> 03:33.240
The open source stuff doesn't,

03:33.240 --> 03:35.680
I don't ever see anybody say,

03:35.680 --> 03:39.040
I was really into open source in the early 2000s,

03:39.040 --> 03:42.640
but not anymore, like that has never happened.

03:42.640 --> 03:43.840
I've never heard that.

03:43.840 --> 03:47.960
That has never once ever been something I've ever heard.

03:48.960 --> 03:51.120
I meet these people and I photograph people,

03:51.120 --> 03:53.000
they've been doing it for 20 years,

03:53.000 --> 03:55.920
they've been doing it for a decade,

03:56.840 --> 03:59.360
or they just discovered it and it's like all consuming

03:59.360 --> 04:01.040
and they've oriented their life

04:01.040 --> 04:03.440
where everything is open source now

04:03.440 --> 04:06.560
and their whole careers is geared around open source

04:06.560 --> 04:08.320
and they would never work for anything

04:08.320 --> 04:10.120
other than open source company.

04:10.120 --> 04:12.320
I mean, it's just, it grabs you.

04:12.320 --> 04:15.360
It's, and I think really takes hold of you.

04:15.360 --> 04:18.160
I think once you embrace the philosophy,

04:18.160 --> 04:20.360
it makes a lot of sense on so many levels

04:20.360 --> 04:24.800
that people have a hard time seeing the world

04:24.800 --> 04:26.680
through another lens after that, right?

04:26.680 --> 04:28.320
Yeah, and I'm sure everyone listening

04:28.320 --> 04:30.840
can totally relate to that feeling.

04:30.840 --> 04:35.280
And it's also true that many who come to open source

04:35.280 --> 04:38.960
and invest their time into making open source better

04:38.960 --> 04:42.520
and building things tend to keep with it

04:42.520 --> 04:45.640
until quite a late age as well.

04:45.640 --> 04:50.200
Like you don't ever really get out of it for any reason.

04:50.200 --> 04:51.040
No way.

04:51.040 --> 04:53.120
It becomes a part of your personality, really.

04:53.120 --> 04:55.440
Yeah, I mean, a lot of,

04:55.440 --> 05:00.080
look at the folks at Bell Labs that were developing Unix

05:00.080 --> 05:03.440
in the 70s.

05:03.440 --> 05:05.680
Many of them are still writing code.

05:05.680 --> 05:08.280
A lot of them work at Google,

05:08.280 --> 05:11.280
but many of them are, they're still writing code today.

05:11.280 --> 05:12.480
And they've been writing code

05:12.480 --> 05:17.480
and doing different projects throughout the decades.

05:17.760 --> 05:19.360
That's so amazing.

05:19.360 --> 05:20.600
And all open source.

05:20.600 --> 05:22.920
I mean, some people have done commercial ventures

05:22.920 --> 05:23.760
alongside of that,

05:23.760 --> 05:28.760
but they've always contributed to a core open source project

05:29.000 --> 05:34.000
or added to the open source corpus, if you will,

05:34.200 --> 05:37.120
over the decades, right up till today.

05:37.120 --> 05:39.000
It's amazing.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.200
I hope to join that group, you know?

05:41.200 --> 05:43.560
I think you and I are well on our way.

05:43.560 --> 05:44.880
We're pretty big.

05:44.880 --> 05:47.280
Right, we can only aspire to that.

05:47.280 --> 05:48.120
Yeah.

05:49.680 --> 05:53.480
Can I ask you some maybe a bit more challenging questions

05:53.480 --> 05:56.680
because they're questions that I think

05:56.680 --> 05:58.680
are around the open source philosophy

05:58.680 --> 06:01.600
and how that integrates into our lives a little bit.

06:01.600 --> 06:03.440
And certainly they are questions

06:03.440 --> 06:05.600
that I've thought about lots and lots.

06:05.600 --> 06:09.200
So you mentioned how you had

06:09.200 --> 06:12.600
that pretty powerful experience around open source

06:12.600 --> 06:17.600
and dedicated to always then building the future projects

06:18.240 --> 06:20.600
around open source technologies.

06:20.600 --> 06:22.720
And so I guess the question I have is,

06:22.720 --> 06:24.080
was that a challenge for you

06:24.080 --> 06:28.600
when you came back into photography, when you did,

06:28.600 --> 06:30.920
considering that photography has been classically

06:30.920 --> 06:35.920
such a sort of commercial software, you know,

06:37.000 --> 06:39.960
it's sort of a mono crop of software out there

06:39.960 --> 06:41.680
that almost every photographer uses.

06:41.680 --> 06:43.120
Was that a challenge for you?

06:43.120 --> 06:44.760
Oh my God, absolutely.

06:44.760 --> 06:49.160
I mean, you know, I've been using Adobe Photoshop

06:49.160 --> 06:51.080
since version 3.0.

06:51.080 --> 06:53.840
And so I've kind of grown up with that.

06:53.840 --> 06:58.000
And that's just been my way to wean myself

06:58.000 --> 07:01.560
out of the dark room and off of analog tools

07:01.560 --> 07:04.560
and into the digital world over the last decade.

07:04.560 --> 07:07.040
I've never really been in a position with Photoshop

07:07.040 --> 07:12.080
where I felt like I was hamstrung by it or locked into it.

07:12.080 --> 07:15.000
But I would say like, that's maybe one of the only pieces

07:15.000 --> 07:17.160
of software where I felt that way.

07:17.160 --> 07:22.160
The other pieces of software, you know, oh man, absolutely.

07:22.600 --> 07:26.200
I mean, don't get me talking about, you know,

07:26.200 --> 07:28.880
digital asset management, you know,

07:28.880 --> 07:33.520
like all the wasteland of software products

07:33.520 --> 07:36.400
that I've used and I'm sure you've used over the years

07:36.400 --> 07:40.400
trying to organize your catalog, maintain metadata,

07:40.400 --> 07:42.680
publish stuff up to the internet,

07:43.560 --> 07:46.320
you know, do specialty processing on files

07:46.320 --> 07:49.600
or noise reduction, God, it's just,

07:49.600 --> 07:51.640
I mean, I have a folder that's just like,

07:51.640 --> 07:53.680
it's just a wasteland of stuff.

07:53.680 --> 07:55.200
Like a graveyard almost.

07:55.200 --> 07:57.280
It's a graveyard, it's a total graveyard.

07:57.280 --> 08:00.760
And it's super frustrating.

08:00.760 --> 08:03.080
And you know, it's like you're dealing with bugs

08:03.080 --> 08:05.040
and there's no way, there's nothing you can do.

08:05.040 --> 08:06.880
You're just, you're totally beholden

08:06.880 --> 08:09.600
on the software company fixing it.

08:09.600 --> 08:12.680
And I know there's, you know, now there's some good

08:12.680 --> 08:16.840
open source tools out there, but I tend to, you know,

08:16.840 --> 08:19.560
I think, you know, GIMP being the, you know,

08:19.560 --> 08:23.440
probably the best one and the most well-known one,

08:23.440 --> 08:25.720
I can't give up Photoshop for that.

08:25.720 --> 08:30.720
And also I have the whole hardware lock-in problem.

08:30.760 --> 08:33.040
I shoot with a phase one camera,

08:33.040 --> 08:35.080
which is a digital medium format camera.

08:35.080 --> 08:39.120
And I shoot tethered, you know, from the camera

08:39.120 --> 08:43.520
into the computer, you know, for most of my, you know,

08:43.520 --> 08:45.360
for all the portraits in this project

08:45.360 --> 08:46.920
and most of my commercial work.

08:46.920 --> 08:50.160
And you know, that goes into Capture One,

08:50.160 --> 08:52.080
which is their software.

08:52.080 --> 08:57.080
And you know, there's just, it produces the best results.

08:57.080 --> 08:59.560
And now if there was an open source tool

08:59.560 --> 09:02.480
that could seamlessly handle my phase one

09:02.480 --> 09:06.440
and the, you know, the a hundred megapixel files

09:06.440 --> 09:09.720
that come out of it and do it better than Capture One

09:09.720 --> 09:12.320
in terms of image quality and workflow,

09:12.320 --> 09:14.540
I would absolutely use that.

09:14.540 --> 09:17.360
But because it's such specialty software,

09:17.360 --> 09:22.360
no one has really, really taken that up as open source,

09:23.920 --> 09:25.540
you know, at a level that, you know,

09:25.540 --> 09:28.680
would work as a professional, you know, for professionals.

09:28.680 --> 09:30.280
At least as far as I could tell, maybe it's out there

09:30.280 --> 09:32.640
and I just don't know about it.

09:32.640 --> 09:34.960
But that's been, yeah, that's been frustrating.

09:34.960 --> 09:38.960
I, and I've run into tons of bugs with their software

09:38.960 --> 09:41.840
and, you know, I know all the work arounds

09:41.840 --> 09:44.600
and you know, it's, and I shake my head every time,

09:44.600 --> 09:45.680
you know, thinking, oh God,

09:45.680 --> 09:48.080
I just wish there was a community behind this

09:48.080 --> 09:50.560
that could improve this faster, you know,

09:50.560 --> 09:53.260
and God forbid that, God forbid they go out of business

09:53.260 --> 09:54.960
or whatever, you know,

09:54.960 --> 09:57.480
that's always in the back of my mind, absolutely.

09:57.480 --> 10:01.680
I echo those thoughts completely because, you know,

10:01.680 --> 10:06.680
the whole reason I got into open source so deeply

10:07.040 --> 10:10.100
was a lot of the same sort of worries

10:10.100 --> 10:11.640
that you were just mentioning.

10:12.640 --> 10:14.700
You know, for a long time I started,

10:14.700 --> 10:16.280
I guess I'm a slightly younger than you,

10:16.280 --> 10:19.040
so I started, you know, I was doing the Photoshop 7,

10:19.040 --> 10:23.300
which if anyone, you know, has had darkroom experience

10:23.300 --> 10:26.440
and has used Photoshop around that time

10:26.440 --> 10:30.320
or even earlier as you did, it's an amazing gift.

10:30.320 --> 10:34.020
Like the things you can reproduce digitally

10:34.020 --> 10:38.520
that you could accomplish previously in the darkroom,

10:38.520 --> 10:42.720
just the ability to sort of repeat those steps digitally

10:42.720 --> 10:45.480
so you can create, you know, the same effect

10:45.480 --> 10:50.480
on a series of photographs is like a kind of mind blowing

10:50.720 --> 10:53.640
for photographers who've started in the film industry

10:54.680 --> 10:56.480
or the film era, I should say.

10:56.480 --> 10:59.520
And so I don't disagree that Photoshop

10:59.520 --> 11:03.160
is an absolutely amazing thing for sure.

11:03.160 --> 11:06.440
And that's why, you know, not quite 90%,

11:06.440 --> 11:08.560
but it feels like 90% of photographers

11:08.560 --> 11:10.320
end up using it at some point.

11:10.320 --> 11:14.600
But for me, so I had, you know, tons of experience

11:14.600 --> 11:17.560
doing that on Windows and Mac as well,

11:17.560 --> 11:20.640
and certainly used some phase one products

11:20.640 --> 11:24.800
and Hasselblad stuff, and so you kind of realize

11:24.800 --> 11:29.800
that it's quite a commercial industry

11:30.840 --> 11:32.480
around the whole photography industry.

11:32.480 --> 11:36.560
And that's great because it has really come a long way

11:36.560 --> 11:38.740
very quickly if you look at all the technologies

11:38.740 --> 11:42.040
that have had to come in place to make the images

11:42.040 --> 11:43.240
that we can create now.

11:43.240 --> 11:45.460
You know, you're talking 100 meg files like it's nothing,

11:45.460 --> 11:47.400
but that was a big feat, right?

11:47.400 --> 11:48.240
Oh, it's huge.

11:48.240 --> 11:52.340
And the quality coming out of it is like really unbelievable,

11:52.340 --> 11:55.320
you know, before you used to have to shoot 8x10

11:55.320 --> 11:56.820
to get anything close to that.

11:58.320 --> 12:01.960
And so I'm not suggesting at all that Photoshop

12:01.960 --> 12:04.400
and the phase one products and all of the commercial stuff

12:04.400 --> 12:08.000
is not great because it is.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.080
But what worried me for a long time,

12:10.080 --> 12:12.100
once I sat down and started thinking,

12:12.100 --> 12:15.000
okay, if I'm gonna run my photography business

12:15.000 --> 12:19.620
for a few decades, how are these things

12:19.620 --> 12:21.320
gonna start affecting me?

12:21.320 --> 12:23.640
And it was similar to the experiences

12:23.640 --> 12:27.280
that you had early in the tech industry

12:27.280 --> 12:30.820
was that anyone can change anything

12:30.820 --> 12:33.440
and you have little control over it.

12:33.440 --> 12:36.400
So that is the kind of the thought process

12:36.400 --> 12:39.360
that threw me into open source

12:39.360 --> 12:44.300
and gave me the challenge of trying to create

12:44.300 --> 12:46.720
a photography workflow that's 100% open source

12:46.720 --> 12:50.840
that would not compromise too much the end product

12:50.840 --> 12:53.800
that I was trying to create, especially for clients.

12:53.800 --> 12:56.200
And is Photoshop part of that workflow for you

12:56.200 --> 12:59.080
or have you managed to wean yourself off of Photoshop

12:59.080 --> 12:59.920
as well?

12:59.920 --> 13:04.920
I've managed to create a 100% open source workflow,

13:04.920 --> 13:07.520
which is no small thing, like you're saying wow,

13:07.520 --> 13:08.360
because you know what?

13:08.360 --> 13:10.320
That's super impressive.

13:10.320 --> 13:11.280
You know what goes into it.

13:11.280 --> 13:14.280
But it's not without its compromises, right?

13:14.280 --> 13:17.440
Like software like the GIMP or Krita

13:17.440 --> 13:21.080
are really impressive, you know,

13:21.080 --> 13:23.520
the minds that have gone into making that.

13:23.520 --> 13:24.920
I can't even imagine how many hours

13:24.920 --> 13:27.200
went into creating that kind of stuff.

13:28.100 --> 13:30.540
And yet, just because of the nature of it,

13:30.540 --> 13:31.880
they're implementing features all the time,

13:31.880 --> 13:33.640
but it's still not at the same place

13:33.640 --> 13:35.920
that some of the commercial software is, right?

13:35.920 --> 13:36.760
And you know that well,

13:36.760 --> 13:39.080
you're using this stuff on a daily basis.

13:39.080 --> 13:42.460
And so it has its compromises.

13:42.460 --> 13:43.800
I would say the piece of software

13:43.800 --> 13:46.000
that's made it all happen for me

13:46.000 --> 13:48.800
is a piece of software called Darktable

13:48.800 --> 13:53.800
that has come a long way in the last seven or so years.

13:54.160 --> 13:59.160
And I would say now I end up spending 70% of my time there.

14:00.240 --> 14:01.240
Interesting.

14:01.240 --> 14:04.840
And for anyone who knows photography software,

14:04.840 --> 14:06.880
it's much like Lightroom.

14:06.880 --> 14:10.640
It's almost like a Lightroom analog or alternative,

14:10.640 --> 14:14.200
but not all photographers can accomplish what they need to

14:14.200 --> 14:15.380
in that one piece of software,

14:15.380 --> 14:18.360
because it's designed to accomplish, you know,

14:18.360 --> 14:21.640
a certain workflow and it'll get you so far.

14:21.640 --> 14:23.320
I wonder if it, does it, do you know,

14:23.320 --> 14:25.040
does it handle phase one files?

14:25.040 --> 14:26.520
Do you know?

14:26.520 --> 14:28.280
I don't know it, but I have a feeling

14:28.280 --> 14:29.740
that you and I after this conversation

14:29.740 --> 14:31.200
might dive in and go learn that.

14:31.200 --> 14:32.640
Yes, I think I may.

14:32.640 --> 14:35.560
I think on my wish list is to have a conversation

14:35.560 --> 14:38.560
much like this with some of the people there

14:38.560 --> 14:41.700
who are creating Darktable and have dedicated

14:41.700 --> 14:44.360
to making that wonderful piece of software.

14:44.360 --> 14:49.360
But yeah, maybe it is the next step for you

14:49.520 --> 14:52.520
in sort of pushing those beliefs.

14:52.520 --> 14:54.300
But I really don't know.

14:54.300 --> 14:57.800
I mean, the phase one stuff is pretty specialized.

14:57.800 --> 15:02.760
I know it's easy enough for people in open source

15:02.760 --> 15:06.080
to sort of deconstruct, you know,

15:06.080 --> 15:08.680
files from Canon cameras and Nikon cameras,

15:08.680 --> 15:11.320
because there's a huge user base, right?

15:11.320 --> 15:13.120
But I really don't know what it's like

15:13.120 --> 15:15.220
for the phase products, for instance,

15:15.220 --> 15:17.600
but hopefully there's some incentive.

15:17.600 --> 15:19.920
Yeah, I mean, I'll take a look at it.

15:19.920 --> 15:22.880
I mean, I think it's gonna happen for me

15:22.880 --> 15:26.880
where I think the open source tools will at some point

15:26.880 --> 15:30.680
have, you know, the critical mass of features

15:30.680 --> 15:34.980
that I need and rely on, and I could start to use those.

15:34.980 --> 15:37.720
Because I mean, Photoshop is adding features

15:37.720 --> 15:40.080
at such a rate, you know, and features

15:40.080 --> 15:41.320
that I just don't use.

15:41.320 --> 15:42.160
Fair enough.

15:43.120 --> 15:46.080
This is the whole like Microsoft Word thing all over again,

15:46.080 --> 15:49.100
where, you know, you buy it because it's a word processor,

15:49.100 --> 15:51.240
and then it's, you know, a to-do list,

15:51.240 --> 15:53.240
and then it's a publishing, you know, platform,

15:53.240 --> 15:55.200
and then it's a collaboration platform,

15:55.200 --> 15:58.640
and it's all this stuff that is not a word processor anymore.

15:58.640 --> 16:02.360
And that's when you just go to, you know,

16:02.360 --> 16:04.120
an open source, you know, word processor,

16:04.120 --> 16:08.120
because you only need 10 features to do, you know,

16:08.120 --> 16:10.840
to write your manuscript, and you don't need, you know,

16:10.840 --> 16:15.360
the monolith that the commercial product has become.

16:15.360 --> 16:18.320
And I think the same thing is gonna happen

16:18.320 --> 16:21.480
probably with Photoshop, maybe with Darktable as well.

16:21.480 --> 16:24.200
Maybe that's the project that really, you know,

16:24.200 --> 16:27.600
makes it happen on the digital side.

16:27.600 --> 16:30.640
Actually, these days, I think about that a lot less

16:30.640 --> 16:33.040
just because I find that the software, you know,

16:33.040 --> 16:37.120
for me is working, and I don't have as many issues there.

16:37.120 --> 16:40.560
I'm particularly excited about for, you know,

16:40.560 --> 16:42.920
in the photography world, for open source to come in

16:42.920 --> 16:47.160
and just completely devastate what's happening

16:47.160 --> 16:51.400
are camera operating systems and lighting control.

16:51.400 --> 16:54.080
Yes, absolutely.

16:54.080 --> 16:57.480
I cannot wait for somebody to,

16:57.480 --> 17:01.480
and I have seriously considered doing this myself,

17:01.480 --> 17:06.480
starting a lighting comp, like a lighting company

17:06.920 --> 17:10.200
around commodity lighting

17:10.200 --> 17:13.520
with open source software running it.

17:13.520 --> 17:16.480
Because there are so much

17:16.480 --> 17:20.120
that I want out of my lighting, you know, equipment,

17:20.120 --> 17:22.000
and to be able to do,

17:22.000 --> 17:25.120
that I wanna be able to program my lighting equipment

17:25.120 --> 17:26.520
to do certain things.

17:26.520 --> 17:29.200
Because, you know, like this project is a great example.

17:29.200 --> 17:31.480
You know, it's a six light setup.

17:31.480 --> 17:33.200
It's not the same light for everybody

17:33.200 --> 17:34.280
because you have to look at that,

17:34.280 --> 17:36.520
but, you know, it's largely, you know,

17:36.520 --> 17:38.800
the same distance from the backdrop.

17:38.800 --> 17:41.520
And, you know, you're using a similar modifier

17:41.520 --> 17:42.920
to make it consistent.

17:42.920 --> 17:47.480
And, you know, it's just like just getting your lights

17:47.480 --> 17:51.920
to respond in a consistent, repetitive way.

17:51.920 --> 17:54.440
And you're, you know, with the radio slaves

17:54.440 --> 17:59.440
and triggering and all of that stuff is super funky.

18:00.040 --> 18:02.120
It's just so funky.

18:02.120 --> 18:03.760
It always has its problems.

18:03.760 --> 18:06.240
And I think the skill of being a photographer

18:06.240 --> 18:08.960
is to always be dealing with those curve balls,

18:08.960 --> 18:10.360
you know, in real time.

18:10.360 --> 18:11.200
Totally.

18:11.200 --> 18:13.720
And you have a catalog of things that could go wrong

18:13.720 --> 18:15.160
at any one point.

18:15.160 --> 18:16.720
You have a catalog of things that go wrong

18:16.720 --> 18:18.600
and you have like three backups.

18:18.600 --> 18:21.000
You know, like I have like three sets of radio slaves,

18:21.000 --> 18:23.680
like from three different vendors, like.

18:23.680 --> 18:24.520
Yeah.

18:24.520 --> 18:26.640
And it's just like, and you have to,

18:26.640 --> 18:28.800
because you could get into a position where like,

18:28.800 --> 18:33.560
oh, well, you know, the Profoto Air is being blocked by,

18:33.560 --> 18:37.600
you know, you're in a studio or you're in a stadium

18:37.600 --> 18:39.840
and, you know, there's lots of other radio going on

18:39.840 --> 18:40.680
and it's interfering.

18:40.680 --> 18:41.840
So you gotta have a pocket wizard.

18:41.840 --> 18:43.360
So you have to do that.

18:43.360 --> 18:45.800
And it's just like getting all this shit to work.

18:45.800 --> 18:48.400
And then like the rate of features

18:48.400 --> 18:53.400
that are not coming out from these vendors is so painful

18:53.560 --> 18:55.320
because you just see it and you're like, oh my God,

18:55.320 --> 18:59.240
please, please let me control the lighting temperature

18:59.240 --> 19:00.080
within the light.

19:00.080 --> 19:03.120
Like, please make it possible

19:03.120 --> 19:06.200
for me not to have to cart around gels.

19:06.200 --> 19:10.440
Like, I know it exists on like the, you know,

19:10.440 --> 19:12.560
hot light side, but like on the strobe side,

19:12.560 --> 19:14.080
please let me have that.

19:14.080 --> 19:16.920
So, and even the camera, like phase one is wonderful.

19:16.920 --> 19:18.840
And they put out a lot of great features

19:18.840 --> 19:21.960
and phase one is kind of a specialized platform.

19:21.960 --> 19:24.520
But there's little things that I know

19:24.520 --> 19:26.920
like would be really good ads.

19:26.920 --> 19:29.400
And why can't I write that code

19:29.400 --> 19:31.560
and put that in my camera, right?

19:31.560 --> 19:35.320
And that's the area, camera and lighting,

19:35.320 --> 19:40.120
to me that is the most frustrating right now, at least.

19:40.120 --> 19:42.960
And I really hope, you know, if somebody came along,

19:42.960 --> 19:44.440
if anybody's listening and they wanna start

19:44.440 --> 19:49.360
an open source professional photographer strobe company,

19:49.360 --> 19:52.880
you know, hit me up because I just think it would be,

19:52.880 --> 19:55.240
it would be so impactful.

19:55.240 --> 19:57.280
I know so many photographers that would be like,

19:57.280 --> 19:59.680
oh yes, please, let's please do that.

20:00.600 --> 20:03.040
Well, you know, I've got my hand up

20:03.040 --> 20:08.040
and I know a few people who know a lot about technology

20:08.800 --> 20:12.520
and are really passionate amateur photographers

20:12.520 --> 20:15.200
and really good, my friend Alex,

20:15.200 --> 20:17.440
who also hosts, self-hosted here

20:17.440 --> 20:18.680
on the Jupiter Broadcasting Network.

20:18.680 --> 20:22.800
He's a massive photographer and very interested

20:22.800 --> 20:25.720
and I'm sure he would have his hand raised as well.

20:25.720 --> 20:27.400
So I feel like, you know,

20:27.400 --> 20:29.360
the beautiful thing about photography is,

20:29.360 --> 20:30.920
at least I'll speak for myself,

20:30.920 --> 20:33.720
is that it can be very technical

20:34.840 --> 20:38.600
in a way that someone who easily latches

20:38.600 --> 20:42.520
onto the computer worlds can also appreciate.

20:42.520 --> 20:45.160
Like that for me was a really nice,

20:45.160 --> 20:48.720
not transition, but those two exist at the same time,

20:48.720 --> 20:51.160
but also a really nice way to be creative as well.

20:51.160 --> 20:54.760
So I know a lot of people who do coding

20:54.760 --> 20:58.120
or are involved in tech and IT somehow

20:58.120 --> 20:59.960
who are also just in love with photography.

20:59.960 --> 21:02.320
So I feel like you might be surprised

21:02.320 --> 21:04.920
with how many people hit you up with that offer, you know?

21:04.920 --> 21:05.800
It's so necessary.

21:05.800 --> 21:07.440
I mean, also, and you look at like what's happening

21:07.440 --> 21:11.920
in the smartphone photography world

21:11.920 --> 21:15.240
with all the sort of algorithmic photography,

21:15.240 --> 21:16.760
you know, that's starting to happen now.

21:16.760 --> 21:18.200
All the algorithms that are at work,

21:18.200 --> 21:19.800
every time you press the shutter button

21:19.800 --> 21:21.800
on your iPhone or your Android,

21:21.800 --> 21:23.640
you know, it's taking seven pictures

21:23.640 --> 21:26.120
and averaging the exposure and applying a sharpening

21:26.120 --> 21:28.840
and, you know, stitching things together

21:28.840 --> 21:32.280
and doing a long exposure and blending and filtering.

21:32.280 --> 21:33.640
You know, it's like the algorithms

21:33.640 --> 21:35.840
that are at work there are amazing.

21:35.840 --> 21:39.600
And Google and Apple have some of the best

21:39.600 --> 21:41.880
software engineers in the world.

21:41.880 --> 21:44.920
They have a little bit of a corner on that talent.

21:44.920 --> 21:48.520
And I worry that some of these other camera companies,

21:48.520 --> 21:50.800
you know, that may not be able to get,

21:50.800 --> 21:53.960
you know, may not be able to access that talent,

21:53.960 --> 21:54.960
how do they compete?

21:54.960 --> 21:58.840
You know, like how do they stay abreast

21:58.840 --> 22:01.960
and get access, you know, to the best tech

22:01.960 --> 22:05.000
and the best programmers or the best innovations?

22:05.000 --> 22:08.160
And to me, it's so obvious that it's open source.

22:08.160 --> 22:09.320
It's out there.

22:09.320 --> 22:12.160
So there's so many open source developers

22:12.160 --> 22:15.360
that are also, you know, into photography

22:15.360 --> 22:18.720
and could be contributing to these areas

22:18.720 --> 22:21.680
that if any of these companies opened up their platforms,

22:21.680 --> 22:23.040
even the slightest bit,

22:23.040 --> 22:25.480
I mean, even if it wasn't just like a totally,

22:25.480 --> 22:26.840
you know, open source OS,

22:26.840 --> 22:29.240
although I think phase one,

22:29.240 --> 22:30.680
I think when you start the camera,

22:30.680 --> 22:32.600
you're actually booting a Linux kernel.

22:32.600 --> 22:34.200
I wouldn't be surprised.

22:34.200 --> 22:37.040
Yeah, and I think the same is on Hasselblad

22:37.040 --> 22:38.280
and some of these other ones.

22:38.280 --> 22:40.960
You know, if the startup time is more than like a second,

22:40.960 --> 22:43.880
I think you're actually booting into Linux.

22:43.880 --> 22:46.160
And that's not a dig on Linux.

22:46.160 --> 22:48.880
That's just to say there's like a full blown OS.

22:48.880 --> 22:50.400
Yeah, there's a whole operating system

22:50.400 --> 22:52.040
booting in a few seconds, right?

22:52.040 --> 22:53.320
Which is amazing, right?

22:53.320 --> 22:54.680
And that's so cool.

22:54.680 --> 22:57.080
So like, can we please open that up?

22:57.080 --> 23:01.380
Like, because there'd be a flood of talent and innovation

23:01.380 --> 23:03.460
that would go into the space

23:03.460 --> 23:06.000
in a way that would be so phenomenal.

23:06.000 --> 23:09.800
And I just think like, that may be more impactful

23:09.800 --> 23:14.800
even than the sort of image processing and manipulation side

23:16.440 --> 23:18.600
just because so much can happen in the camera

23:18.600 --> 23:20.740
and between the lights these days.

23:20.740 --> 23:23.760
That's my personal preference.

23:23.760 --> 23:25.920
If somebody is listening out there is working on it,

23:25.920 --> 23:29.080
please let us know because we're ready for that.

23:29.080 --> 23:29.920
Absolutely.

23:29.920 --> 23:33.560
And it feels like then it's a bit of a dream

23:33.560 --> 23:37.240
that I've had as well to accomplish,

23:37.240 --> 23:38.780
just to grow the dedication I've had

23:38.780 --> 23:43.360
to creating an open source post-production process,

23:43.360 --> 23:46.320
but to open that up into the entire pipeline, right?

23:46.320 --> 23:51.320
From Capture to lighting to sort of printing as well.

23:51.360 --> 23:56.360
So I would love to dedicate my life to making that happen.

23:57.240 --> 23:58.400
I'm totally into that.

23:58.400 --> 23:59.800
So it's gotta happen.

23:59.800 --> 24:00.960
I mean, I'm a little afraid

24:00.960 --> 24:03.720
that like there's this giant sucking sound into my iPhone

24:03.720 --> 24:07.800
and that like 10 years from now everything may,

24:07.800 --> 24:11.120
we may, you and I are gonna pack up our equipment

24:11.120 --> 24:14.280
and go on a job and it's gonna be,

24:14.280 --> 24:16.000
consist of six iPhones

24:16.000 --> 24:18.720
and a whole bunch of lighting equipment.

24:18.720 --> 24:22.520
But so I'm a little worried that photography,

24:22.520 --> 24:27.520
there's this giant sucking sound into the mobile platforms.

24:27.520 --> 24:32.520
But there are laws of physics that are at work that-

24:33.960 --> 24:35.600
Thank goodness they're on our side.

24:35.600 --> 24:37.560
That are on our side in terms of just,

24:37.560 --> 24:40.400
you wanna have a certain amount of image quality

24:40.400 --> 24:43.640
in a certain size, you've gotta have glass,

24:43.640 --> 24:45.640
that's gotta have a sensor of a certain size

24:45.640 --> 24:47.520
and you gotta have glass that's a certain size.

24:47.520 --> 24:51.600
And so I think there's always gonna be camera companies

24:51.600 --> 24:56.480
that are gonna be servicing videographers and photographers.

24:56.480 --> 25:01.480
And I just wish that one of them would realize

25:01.560 --> 25:04.400
that they can make it a competitive advantage

25:04.400 --> 25:05.720
to be open source,

25:05.720 --> 25:09.880
as opposed to keeping this whole proprietary arms race

25:09.880 --> 25:14.320
that's been going since the beginning of time

25:14.320 --> 25:16.760
and use open source as a competitive advantage,

25:16.760 --> 25:18.360
be the open source camera company,

25:18.360 --> 25:20.560
be the open source lighting company,

25:20.560 --> 25:23.280
or at least have an open source component.

25:23.280 --> 25:26.440
Because I just think like they'll run away with the market.

25:26.440 --> 25:28.280
Everybody, nobody wants to be locked

25:28.280 --> 25:29.600
into these proprietary systems

25:29.600 --> 25:32.360
that are so slow in the photography world.

25:32.360 --> 25:35.520
I mean, nobody I've ever met has been like,

25:35.520 --> 25:38.600
you know what, I'm really, really happy

25:38.600 --> 25:41.240
with the way the menuing system works on my Sony,

25:41.240 --> 25:44.800
or I'm really, really happy with the way

25:44.800 --> 25:49.800
my Profoto light works with this trigger or that trigger.

25:51.360 --> 25:53.120
I mean, I've never heard that before.

25:53.120 --> 25:55.280
Never, it hasn't happened, so.

25:55.280 --> 25:57.000
Well, I think some people listening to this

25:57.000 --> 25:59.440
will certainly point us towards

25:59.440 --> 26:00.920
some of the open source firmware

26:00.920 --> 26:05.480
that was able to be loaded onto certain camera,

26:05.480 --> 26:07.600
certain Canon cameras.

26:07.600 --> 26:08.720
I don't know if that's still true,

26:08.720 --> 26:13.600
and I haven't really owned any Canon cameras.

26:13.600 --> 26:15.080
I know, me neither.

26:15.080 --> 26:16.840
But when I heard about that,

26:16.840 --> 26:18.800
and I've certainly seen it in action,

26:18.800 --> 26:20.400
and I've done some research around it,

26:20.400 --> 26:22.240
it was really exciting for all of the reasons

26:22.240 --> 26:23.600
that we're talking about here.

26:23.600 --> 26:26.800
Oh, I remember that, and I was so, so excited about that.

26:26.800 --> 26:30.600
And then I was like, I just don't own any Canon gear,

26:30.600 --> 26:31.880
you know, so.

26:31.880 --> 26:33.640
That's how I felt.

26:33.640 --> 26:37.520
But it feels like, geez, that would be a nice place to go.

26:37.520 --> 26:40.920
And this conversation is reminding me a little bit

26:40.920 --> 26:45.120
about what's happening in the hardware sphere

26:45.120 --> 26:46.720
around computers themselves, you know?

26:46.720 --> 26:50.560
There are a few open hardware vendors

26:50.560 --> 26:54.080
kind of trying their very best to make a difference

26:54.080 --> 26:56.400
out there, but it's not an easy place, right?

26:56.400 --> 27:01.040
It's dominated by lots of really big commercial giants.

27:01.040 --> 27:05.200
Yeah, and also, I know you know this,

27:05.200 --> 27:08.280
photographers don't have any time to really,

27:08.280 --> 27:11.320
I mean, you and I, we would love to burn a weekend

27:11.320 --> 27:16.320
on this problem and working around something on our own

27:18.040 --> 27:19.840
and scratching our own itch.

27:19.840 --> 27:23.160
But, you know, there's many months where we just don't,

27:23.160 --> 27:24.620
we're not gonna have that time, right?

27:24.620 --> 27:27.600
So the equipment has to work, it has to be bulletproof,

27:27.600 --> 27:29.360
it has to be supported.

27:29.360 --> 27:31.840
And I think, you know, every time I say that,

27:31.840 --> 27:36.440
I just have these flashbacks to my son, Oracle,

27:36.440 --> 27:39.680
you know, EMC storage days and thinking the same thing,

27:39.680 --> 27:40.520
right?

27:40.520 --> 27:41.360
Of course.

27:41.360 --> 27:43.020
And I just know how that story ends.

27:43.020 --> 27:45.520
And I know that this is, you know,

27:45.520 --> 27:47.840
this is exactly the same, you know,

27:47.840 --> 27:50.480
this is exactly the same issue, just with a completely

27:50.480 --> 27:52.120
different technology domain.

27:52.120 --> 27:54.040
So it's gonna happen here.

27:54.040 --> 27:56.760
It's just a question of who's gonna do it and, you know,

27:56.760 --> 27:59.620
and when, and if it's one of the existing manufacturers

27:59.620 --> 28:04.480
that, you know, becomes enlightened and gets the religion

28:04.480 --> 28:08.520
or whether a new manufacturer is gonna come along and-

28:08.520 --> 28:09.360
And change the game.

28:09.360 --> 28:11.800
Use open source and change the game, right?

28:11.800 --> 28:15.240
And that'll be super exciting.

28:15.240 --> 28:18.240
You know, either way, I'm good either way.

28:18.240 --> 28:20.080
But I just hope somebody does it soon.

28:20.080 --> 28:23.600
Well, yeah, I hope you and I are both around to see that.

28:23.600 --> 28:26.960
For sure, we need it sooner than later, I feel like.

28:26.960 --> 28:28.080
I know.

28:28.080 --> 28:29.640
In terms of photography,

28:29.640 --> 28:33.580
have you put any thought around the emergence

28:33.580 --> 28:37.060
of some of this artificial intelligence stuff

28:37.060 --> 28:40.560
in developing, you know, portraits and things like that?

28:40.560 --> 28:43.680
Cause I've heard a few stories recently

28:43.680 --> 28:47.680
of AI creating some really interesting,

28:47.680 --> 28:51.760
at least I very much hesitate to call them portraits

28:51.760 --> 28:55.600
for an obvious reason, which is that I don't want to equate

28:55.600 --> 28:59.320
them to the craft that you and I spend all of our time on,

28:59.320 --> 29:02.340
but there's some interesting stuff happening out there.

29:02.340 --> 29:03.400
I mean, I haven't really.

29:03.400 --> 29:05.600
I mean, you know, the closest I come is, you know,

29:05.600 --> 29:06.880
on the iPhone with, you know,

29:06.880 --> 29:10.240
all the portrait lighting effects that Apple introduced

29:10.240 --> 29:13.040
and, you know, all the algorithms that are at work

29:13.040 --> 29:15.200
and even, there's some good algorithms actually,

29:15.200 --> 29:19.280
even on the phase one now for long exposures

29:19.280 --> 29:21.480
and things like that, but in terms of AI,

29:21.480 --> 29:25.680
in terms of stylistic preferences or things like that,

29:25.680 --> 29:29.280
I haven't really delved into that.

29:29.280 --> 29:31.920
What have you been seeing that has been intriguing you?

29:31.920 --> 29:35.000
Well, yeah, I think where I'm going with this is,

29:35.000 --> 29:37.240
you know, artificial intelligence has been really impressive

29:37.240 --> 29:40.640
in many areas and digital photography,

29:40.640 --> 29:44.440
if you look at it, is just, it's really just, you know,

29:44.440 --> 29:47.040
you and I are taking real life and digitizing it

29:47.040 --> 29:50.160
in some ways, if you look at it through that lens.

29:50.160 --> 29:52.340
And so some might argue that you can create

29:52.340 --> 29:56.160
that digital version from scratch using some intelligence

29:56.160 --> 29:57.600
instead of real life.

29:57.600 --> 30:01.480
And so the way I've been thinking about it is in terms

30:01.480 --> 30:05.720
of what is the future of photographers and photography.

30:05.720 --> 30:08.960
And I don't know that that's coming soon,

30:08.960 --> 30:12.000
but if we're peering into the future,

30:12.000 --> 30:16.320
maybe 20, 30 years or so, you know,

30:16.320 --> 30:18.740
I'm just throwing a number out there, but what do I know?

30:18.740 --> 30:23.640
It feels like crafted images coming out of some,

30:23.640 --> 30:25.680
you know, a few algorithms, at least,

30:25.680 --> 30:30.080
I see it kind of in the sphere of stock photography first.

30:30.080 --> 30:32.200
You know, you have a lot of photographs

30:32.200 --> 30:37.200
that are not necessarily tied to a specific person

30:37.200 --> 30:41.300
or individual, but are really useful

30:41.300 --> 30:42.620
for a bunch of other reasons.

30:42.620 --> 30:45.340
And so I've been just seeing artificial intelligence

30:45.340 --> 30:49.620
as a really interesting expansion

30:49.620 --> 30:52.460
of who we are as photographers.

30:52.460 --> 30:56.700
And it both intrigues me and scares me at the same time.

30:56.700 --> 30:57.540
No, totally.

30:57.540 --> 30:58.860
I mean, what was that project?

30:58.860 --> 31:00.480
Was it the research group?

31:00.480 --> 31:02.100
Was it Samsung or?

31:02.100 --> 31:05.460
I forget which research lab came out with like the ability

31:05.460 --> 31:10.460
to create portraits of like fake people

31:11.140 --> 31:14.100
from photographs of real people?

31:14.100 --> 31:15.300
Oh man, yeah, right.

31:15.300 --> 31:20.300
Like, it was like these incredible like, you know, photos

31:20.580 --> 31:22.580
that you weren't like, oh, that's like a Photoshopped photo.

31:22.580 --> 31:24.880
It was like, no, that's like a real person,

31:24.880 --> 31:26.380
but that person actually doesn't exist.

31:26.380 --> 31:29.400
It's the eyes from one person and the hair from another

31:29.400 --> 31:31.660
and the facial structure from a third.

31:31.660 --> 31:33.780
And, you know, the algorithms are able

31:33.780 --> 31:37.060
to produce these lifelike, you know, very real,

31:37.060 --> 31:40.580
photorealistic, you know, images of people

31:40.580 --> 31:41.840
from the source material.

31:41.840 --> 31:43.620
I think that's fascinating.

31:43.620 --> 31:46.700
And I think, you know, from an artistic standpoint,

31:46.700 --> 31:48.840
I mean, there's tons of photographers today

31:48.840 --> 31:52.680
that are doing so, you know, incredible photo manipulation.

31:52.680 --> 31:56.460
And, you know, I think that there'll be a whole realm of art,

31:56.460 --> 31:58.960
you know, much like the, I don't know how familiar you are

31:58.960 --> 32:03.960
with the whole processing space, all the generative art

32:04.420 --> 32:09.420
that's being generated using JavaScript and, you know, data

32:10.260 --> 32:15.260
and using programs like P5.js and processing.js

32:17.220 --> 32:20.620
that are doing all this sort of like algorithmic artwork

32:20.620 --> 32:22.660
all from data, which is,

32:22.660 --> 32:25.380
I'm personally super fascinated by that.

32:25.380 --> 32:29.140
So I think it'll be, I think it's gonna happen.

32:29.140 --> 32:33.440
How will it aid us as professionals?

32:35.220 --> 32:39.300
You know, ego-wise, you know, I don't, you know,

32:39.300 --> 32:41.620
I want to think, oh, well, you know,

32:41.620 --> 32:43.100
damn algorithm's never gonna do better

32:43.100 --> 32:45.660
than you and I are gonna be able to do it.

32:45.660 --> 32:48.380
But I think that, you know, the AI will, you know,

32:48.380 --> 32:51.680
be really helpful in automation.

32:51.680 --> 32:54.780
I mean, I personally, I would like to just be able

32:54.780 --> 32:58.120
to go into a shoot and open up a case,

32:58.120 --> 33:02.420
have five drones pop out and, you know, the AI is like,

33:02.420 --> 33:03.800
oh, you wanted Rembrandt lighting?

33:03.800 --> 33:05.380
Great, let me get in position.

33:05.380 --> 33:08.380
You know, like to me, that's what I want.

33:08.380 --> 33:10.980
That's a, you know, I could see that being like

33:10.980 --> 33:13.420
super impactful, but I'm still driving the boat, right?

33:13.420 --> 33:16.300
I'm still saying, oh, Rembrandt lighting or, you know,

33:16.300 --> 33:19.380
or, you know, put a flag over there and-

33:19.380 --> 33:21.620
You're automating your photography assistants.

33:21.620 --> 33:23.180
Yeah, exactly.

33:23.180 --> 33:26.420
I may be more like a little bit more like machine learning

33:26.420 --> 33:27.900
where the algorithm's like,

33:27.900 --> 33:31.060
oh, Pete likes his flags on the right, not the left.

33:31.060 --> 33:33.300
You know, like stuff like that, I could be,

33:33.300 --> 33:35.820
I could see that being like really super helpful.

33:37.020 --> 33:39.480
But, you know, maybe it gets to a place where, you know,

33:39.480 --> 33:43.180
you and I are, you know, deploying the algorithms

33:43.180 --> 33:44.060
and not much else.

33:44.060 --> 33:46.620
I don't know, it'll be interesting to see.

33:46.620 --> 33:48.420
Well, I think it's interesting to look at it

33:48.420 --> 33:52.300
as a toolkit really, which is what you alluded to there

33:52.300 --> 33:55.780
is, you know, the cameras in our hands

33:55.780 --> 33:58.580
and the software that we throw those images into

33:59.460 --> 34:01.540
and even, you know, the printers and all of that stuff,

34:01.540 --> 34:04.740
they're just tools to allow us to be expressive.

34:04.740 --> 34:09.460
And so as our tools evolve, so too do our expressions.

34:09.460 --> 34:14.260
And so those of us who I think are keen to stay

34:14.260 --> 34:19.260
with those leaps in technology kind of get to create

34:19.580 --> 34:21.540
in a totally different way.

34:21.540 --> 34:24.140
If we're willing to bring those things in,

34:24.140 --> 34:27.620
some people unfortunately get caught up in, you know,

34:28.780 --> 34:30.220
it's almost seen as a rivalry, you know,

34:30.220 --> 34:32.940
when new innovative tools like that come into play.

34:32.940 --> 34:35.780
But if you're open to them, man, can you create

34:35.780 --> 34:37.900
some really different things or approach, you know,

34:37.900 --> 34:39.820
typical problems in a really different way?

34:39.820 --> 34:42.060
Yeah, I mean, I think you're totally right with that.

34:42.060 --> 34:45.780
And I think maybe, you know, the place that that comes in

34:45.780 --> 34:47.700
first is in post-processing, right?

34:47.700 --> 34:52.700
Because I mean, if we had an AI that could go through,

34:54.260 --> 34:57.940
you know, a thousand layered Photoshop files

34:57.940 --> 35:02.940
and know all of the layered edits that I typically do

35:03.620 --> 35:05.580
or you typically do on your portraits

35:05.580 --> 35:09.340
or, you know, on certain types of events or whatever it is,

35:09.340 --> 35:12.860
it's absolutely possible for an AI to learn, you know,

35:12.860 --> 35:15.940
your style, learn Peter's style, learn Brent's style.

35:15.940 --> 35:17.500
And welcomed, I would say.

35:17.500 --> 35:18.660
Exactly, right?

35:18.660 --> 35:22.620
Because so much of that is a, you know,

35:22.620 --> 35:24.500
it's an iterative process, yes,

35:24.500 --> 35:28.300
but there's a style that you have as a photographer

35:28.300 --> 35:32.140
that comes out, there's a thread through your post-processing

35:32.140 --> 35:33.700
of everything you do,

35:33.700 --> 35:35.220
just like there's a thread through mine.

35:35.220 --> 35:38.740
And so to have an AI be able to pick up that thread

35:38.740 --> 35:42.740
and learn that thread so that it can apply it for you

35:42.740 --> 35:47.300
without you having to do 60 edits over two days

35:47.300 --> 35:49.780
because you gotta think about it more.

35:49.780 --> 35:51.220
And if the AI is like, look,

35:51.220 --> 35:53.500
I know tomorrow you're gonna wake up and think this is crap.

35:53.500 --> 35:56.660
So, you know, I'm gonna delete these four layers

35:56.660 --> 35:57.900
and I'm gonna add these six

35:57.900 --> 36:01.340
because you really liked these in the last hundred edits.

36:01.340 --> 36:04.940
I can see that, that can be kind of cool.

36:04.940 --> 36:08.340
For those who don't know photography quite that much,

36:08.340 --> 36:11.660
like capturing photographs with your camera

36:11.660 --> 36:14.840
is definitely quite obviously a really important part of it,

36:14.840 --> 36:19.380
but the editing after the fact is almost 50% of it,

36:19.380 --> 36:22.420
I would say, you know, you need both to be great,

36:22.420 --> 36:24.020
but there's such a creative expression

36:24.020 --> 36:25.540
in that process as well.

36:25.540 --> 36:26.780
Oh, totally, totally.

36:26.780 --> 36:30.060
Yeah, if we continue with this imagination that you have

36:30.060 --> 36:34.660
where that process can be captured and repeated easily,

36:34.660 --> 36:36.660
maybe you'll agree with me, but I won't speak for you,

36:36.660 --> 36:39.900
but I would totally welcome sitting at my computer less

36:39.900 --> 36:43.020
and being out into the world capturing photographs more.

36:43.020 --> 36:46.700
If I could be certain that the output was still

36:46.700 --> 36:49.620
within the realms of the kind of things that I love,

36:49.620 --> 36:50.820
I would totally welcome that.

36:50.820 --> 36:53.460
You know, just as a professional photographer,

36:53.460 --> 36:55.580
you're always managing your time

36:55.580 --> 36:59.740
and so many of your shoots and your projects

36:59.740 --> 37:01.660
and the way you schedule your time

37:01.660 --> 37:04.080
is all around trying to find efficiencies, right?

37:04.080 --> 37:07.940
So, you know, let's shoot a collection of subjects together.

37:07.940 --> 37:10.500
Let's do the capture, you know, on the same day

37:10.500 --> 37:12.820
in the same studio, bring everybody in

37:12.820 --> 37:14.740
because we can just keep shooting

37:14.740 --> 37:16.420
and we don't have to, you know, start and stop

37:16.420 --> 37:17.260
and things like that.

37:17.260 --> 37:18.360
And the same with post-processing,

37:18.360 --> 37:21.360
like then let's have a week where we just go through

37:21.360 --> 37:23.200
and do all the post-processing together

37:23.200 --> 37:24.780
and make it consistent.

37:24.780 --> 37:28.580
So it's a huge consideration, you know,

37:28.580 --> 37:30.240
on what you're trying to do, you know,

37:30.240 --> 37:32.420
to get this, you know, to manage your time

37:32.420 --> 37:37.420
and apply your style and effectively batch up your work

37:37.420 --> 37:40.420
so that you can get some kind of efficiency on it.

37:40.420 --> 37:42.620
So yeah, an AI could change that game.

37:42.620 --> 37:45.900
I mean, that could be, that would be super welcome.

37:45.900 --> 37:48.660
You wouldn't be locked in your studio, you know,

37:48.660 --> 37:51.260
for a week after a shoot, you know, just doing editing.

37:51.260 --> 37:53.300
You could actually be shooting every day

37:53.300 --> 37:55.820
and the computer could be applying your style for you.

37:55.820 --> 37:56.660
That would be awesome.

37:56.660 --> 37:58.260
And if you grow that a little bit

37:58.260 --> 38:03.260
and see it as open-source AI, if we can build such a thing,

38:03.500 --> 38:06.260
man, those, those kinds of things are awesome.

38:06.260 --> 38:08.560
Man, those, those kinds of preferences and scripts

38:08.560 --> 38:10.580
can be shared around and modified and combined

38:10.580 --> 38:11.420
and all of that stuff.

38:11.420 --> 38:13.300
It would be a really, quite a wonderful

38:13.300 --> 38:14.900
creative exercise, really.

38:14.900 --> 38:16.020
Yeah, no, I think so.

38:16.020 --> 38:18.240
I mean, there's, you have like a hint of that right now

38:18.240 --> 38:21.460
with the sort of like recipes and Lightroom.

38:21.460 --> 38:23.140
I don't know if Darktable has a similar thing,

38:23.140 --> 38:27.180
but like people sell, you know, like Lightroom presets

38:27.180 --> 38:29.820
and Photoshop filters and, you know,

38:29.820 --> 38:33.500
the sort of Instagram filter, you know, effect.

38:33.500 --> 38:36.620
But, you know, that's just like, that's like a blunt

38:36.620 --> 38:38.340
instrument, you know, I mean, we're, you know,

38:38.340 --> 38:41.940
with an AI would come in and be like, you know,

38:41.940 --> 38:44.940
being able to apply selective contrast to different parts

38:44.940 --> 38:47.820
of a face because it just knows like,

38:47.820 --> 38:49.940
you like more contrast over here.

38:49.940 --> 38:53.220
That this specific person needs this specific, yeah.

38:53.220 --> 38:54.300
Exactly.

38:54.300 --> 38:55.900
So it's coming, I'm sure of it.

38:55.900 --> 38:57.460
Oh man, you're getting me all excited.

38:57.460 --> 38:58.300
I know.

38:58.300 --> 39:00.820
I mean, we just hope, hopefully it'll be open-source

39:00.820 --> 39:04.740
and not some proprietary black box.

39:04.740 --> 39:07.140
Yeah, not a fan of black boxes.

39:07.140 --> 39:08.780
No, black box is not so good.

39:08.780 --> 39:11.380
I've been, I feel like I've been trying to rub, you know,

39:11.380 --> 39:13.820
paint off the side of black boxes for a long time.

39:15.940 --> 39:17.780
You mentioned that in the past,

39:17.780 --> 39:19.140
you've been to a few conferences.

39:19.140 --> 39:22.820
Do you have any lined up yet where you're hoping to be

39:22.820 --> 39:24.760
capturing a few of these photographs?

39:24.760 --> 39:29.760
This year, I'm just thinking the one that is closest out

39:29.760 --> 39:32.000
is the Red Hat Summit,

39:32.000 --> 39:35.000
which this year is actually gonna be in San Francisco.

39:35.000 --> 39:38.280
I photographed, I had a great time two years ago.

39:38.280 --> 39:42.760
I did a whole bunch of photography around that conference.

39:42.760 --> 39:45.960
And so I hope to do that one again this year.

39:45.960 --> 39:49.440
The folks at All Things Open are super supportive

39:49.440 --> 39:51.080
and they've invited me.

39:51.080 --> 39:52.440
I've shot there a couple of years ago.

39:52.440 --> 39:53.400
They invited me last year

39:53.400 --> 39:55.760
and they've kind of given me an invitation

39:55.760 --> 39:57.040
for this year as well.

39:57.040 --> 40:01.080
So, or hopefully I can do that conference again.

40:01.080 --> 40:02.880
That's sort of at the end of the year.

40:02.880 --> 40:04.200
The middle, I'm not sure yet.

40:04.200 --> 40:05.600
That's, we'll see.

40:05.600 --> 40:09.360
But those two are ones that I kind of have penciled in,

40:09.360 --> 40:11.600
you know, my calendar as placeholders right now.

40:11.600 --> 40:15.420
I was just speaking, I mentioned my friend Alex earlier.

40:16.520 --> 40:18.600
He's a Red Hat employee.

40:18.600 --> 40:22.840
And so he, I guess he does a little bit of everything.

40:22.840 --> 40:24.880
He's kind of one of those amazing people.

40:24.880 --> 40:28.080
But he was talking about Red Hat Summit

40:28.080 --> 40:29.640
and how great it is.

40:29.640 --> 40:31.760
But he was also in the same breath mentioning

40:31.760 --> 40:34.960
All Things Open and how that's kind of in his backyard

40:34.960 --> 40:37.660
and was mentioning how maybe I should join him there too.

40:37.660 --> 40:40.720
So maybe if the stars align, you and I might get to meet.

40:40.720 --> 40:41.980
Ooh, that would be awesome.

40:41.980 --> 40:44.560
Perhaps at All Things Open, which would be a real treat.

40:44.560 --> 40:48.000
That's I think in October, if I remember correctly.

40:48.000 --> 40:50.600
Yeah, it's like, it's towards the end of the year now.

40:50.600 --> 40:51.440
Yeah.

40:51.440 --> 40:53.920
It's always a, I try to do like a New York,

40:53.920 --> 40:56.520
you know, tack it onto a New York trip.

40:56.520 --> 40:57.780
Since you're in the neighborhood, yeah.

40:57.780 --> 40:59.040
It's just a question of, you know,

40:59.040 --> 41:00.760
making the logistics happen.

41:01.800 --> 41:03.320
It's all logistics, yeah.

41:03.320 --> 41:04.920
It's all logistics.

41:04.920 --> 41:06.400
Well, that would be really exciting.

41:06.400 --> 41:07.520
I think it would be a real treat

41:07.520 --> 41:10.480
for those who get to see some of your work

41:10.480 --> 41:12.500
either exhibited at some of these,

41:12.500 --> 41:15.040
if you get that opportunity or even just the chance

41:15.040 --> 41:19.200
to photograph a few more pioneers in open source.

41:19.200 --> 41:20.280
Can't wait to see those.

41:20.280 --> 41:21.640
Yeah, I mean, that's the beautiful thing

41:21.640 --> 41:23.960
about this project is there's so,

41:23.960 --> 41:25.620
open source is such an evolving thing

41:25.620 --> 41:28.120
and there's so many new projects,

41:28.120 --> 41:30.980
new contributions, new applications.

41:30.980 --> 41:33.400
So it's, there's always,

41:33.400 --> 41:35.560
I'm always finding out about new people

41:35.560 --> 41:38.560
and new contributions.

41:38.560 --> 41:41.200
And I have, you know, I have a running, you know,

41:41.200 --> 41:43.800
huge research list of hundreds of people on it

41:43.800 --> 41:46.400
that I'm constantly, you know, reviewing

41:46.400 --> 41:50.060
and trying to find people to photograph, so.

41:50.060 --> 41:52.040
Great, yeah, it sounds like you won't soon run out

41:52.040 --> 41:53.480
of great people to photograph.

41:53.480 --> 41:56.440
No, no way, not with this community.

41:56.440 --> 41:59.640
It's just a, it's a burgeoning community, so.

41:59.640 --> 42:01.240
That's amazing to hear, great.

42:02.280 --> 42:04.520
I wanted to ask you a question

42:05.600 --> 42:07.440
that you might wanna send out to the communities

42:07.440 --> 42:09.200
and to the listeners.

42:09.200 --> 42:12.800
Is there something that you would like listeners

42:12.800 --> 42:16.120
to think about or to try or go and see something

42:16.120 --> 42:19.100
you'd like them to experience, anything at all?

42:19.100 --> 42:21.520
I would say, you know, there's probably two things

42:21.520 --> 42:23.320
that I've been, you know,

42:23.320 --> 42:26.400
particularly interested in most recently.

42:26.400 --> 42:28.720
You know, the first one I actually mentioned already,

42:28.720 --> 42:33.720
which is the whole generative art category

42:34.000 --> 42:36.080
where people are using these open source tools,

42:36.080 --> 42:38.500
mostly around processing and JavaScript.

42:38.500 --> 42:42.760
And there's a library written by Lauren McCarthy,

42:42.760 --> 42:44.520
who's an artist out here in LA,

42:44.520 --> 42:48.000
and she created this tool called p5.js.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.520
And it's just so cool, and it just,

42:50.520 --> 42:52.840
it's used to create all this like really cool

42:52.840 --> 42:56.120
algorithmic art and visualization work.

42:56.120 --> 42:58.920
And there's a whole community of artists,

42:58.920 --> 43:01.720
and her artwork also is particularly,

43:01.720 --> 43:04.120
and her projects are particularly cool.

43:04.120 --> 43:07.320
So I would encourage everybody to check out Lauren's work,

43:07.320 --> 43:12.320
Lauren McCarthy, and p5.js, and just that whole world.

43:13.120 --> 43:15.840
You could just, you could burn an afternoon easily

43:15.840 --> 43:17.160
just diving into that.

43:17.160 --> 43:19.120
You might have just scheduled in an afternoon

43:19.120 --> 43:20.600
for me this week.

43:20.600 --> 43:21.520
Yeah, exactly.

43:21.520 --> 43:23.760
It's just like, it's like open source art,

43:23.760 --> 43:26.720
and you know, data visualization, JavaScript,

43:26.720 --> 43:30.580
it's got a lot, there's a lot there, a lot there to like.

43:31.820 --> 43:35.060
The other thing that I've been really interested in recently

43:35.060 --> 43:40.060
is open access data, and sort of open data movement

43:41.460 --> 43:44.720
in general, you know, and I photographed some folks

43:44.720 --> 43:49.360
from Wikipedia, but you know, the work that Carl Malamud

43:49.360 --> 43:54.360
is doing around making the law accessible is fascinating.

43:55.400 --> 43:58.680
Like I never really knew this until I started digging

43:58.680 --> 44:03.000
into his work, but there's a lot of state law,

44:03.000 --> 44:06.960
and like, you know, and stuff as mundane as like

44:06.960 --> 44:11.480
building codes, and fire codes, and stuff like that,

44:11.480 --> 44:15.320
that is locked behind like paywalls.

44:15.320 --> 44:18.280
That seems unbelievable because those are expected

44:18.280 --> 44:21.120
to be followed by masses of people.

44:21.120 --> 44:22.920
And they are, and because of that,

44:22.920 --> 44:24.800
there's wonderful businesses out there

44:24.800 --> 44:29.800
that are able to extract, you know, hundreds or thousands

44:30.520 --> 44:34.340
of dollars for access to basically the law,

44:34.340 --> 44:38.560
essentially to the law, and he has just, you know,

44:38.560 --> 44:43.560
been a crusader on getting that all of this,

44:43.880 --> 44:48.000
you know, legal documents and the law online,

44:48.000 --> 44:52.360
freely accessible, you know, re-keyed in, typed in,

44:52.360 --> 44:56.200
you know, he's like, he's got lawsuits and stuff before,

44:56.200 --> 44:58.080
you know, the US Court of Appeals,

44:58.080 --> 45:00.440
that people have tried to stop him.

45:00.440 --> 45:02.520
His website is just fascinating.

45:02.520 --> 45:07.520
And I mean, so I would encourage people to dig into him,

45:08.760 --> 45:13.760
and his website, which is public.resource.org,

45:13.840 --> 45:15.720
and just learn about kind of what he's doing

45:15.720 --> 45:18.440
and support him because in this day and age

45:18.440 --> 45:22.760
where institutions are, you know, especially in the US here,

45:22.760 --> 45:24.680
but I think really around the world in general

45:24.680 --> 45:29.680
are under a lot of pressure, and the rule of law

45:29.680 --> 45:32.360
is under a lot of pressure, you know,

45:32.360 --> 45:35.440
what can we do to help, you know, bolster democracy

45:35.440 --> 45:40.040
and access to the law and strengthen our civic,

45:40.040 --> 45:41.380
you know, institutions?

45:41.380 --> 45:43.120
I think his work is more important now

45:43.120 --> 45:44.560
maybe than ever before.

45:44.560 --> 45:46.360
So I would encourage people to check him out too.

45:46.360 --> 45:51.360
I think that's another Saturday you could easily burn

45:52.760 --> 45:55.920
on digging into his work in that whole world.

45:55.920 --> 45:58.200
Wow, that sounds like someone who's dedicating their time

45:58.200 --> 46:03.200
to that kind of challenge, so worthwhile,

46:04.080 --> 46:07.320
and sounds like such an important area

46:07.320 --> 46:08.800
for all of us to benefit from.

46:08.800 --> 46:11.360
Yeah, and it's even more impressive.

46:11.360 --> 46:14.920
He's doing it around the world, so it's not just in the US.

46:14.920 --> 46:17.480
He's also, he was just in India.

46:17.480 --> 46:20.480
I think he's also doing it for the government there.

46:20.480 --> 46:24.600
So it's a global crusade, if you will,

46:24.600 --> 46:27.120
and I think he's really at the forefront of this.

46:27.120 --> 46:30.120
So it's definitely worth taking a look at his work

46:30.120 --> 46:31.720
and digging into that website.

46:31.720 --> 46:34.160
Yeah, and it sounds like work that feels like we need more

46:34.160 --> 46:36.240
now around the world than ever really

46:36.240 --> 46:41.160
with things going digital and some of the unfortunate

46:42.280 --> 46:44.440
directions that some governments have been going with,

46:44.440 --> 46:47.280
the data and data hoarding and protection

46:47.280 --> 46:48.120
and that kind of stuff.

46:48.120 --> 46:52.040
So I really welcome that sharing.

46:52.040 --> 46:54.200
If you're gonna have a democracy

46:54.200 --> 46:57.560
and you certainly want the law to be accessible, right?

46:57.560 --> 47:02.560
So it seems obvious, but it's, but it's not, it's crazy.

47:04.520 --> 47:07.120
Carl knows that better than anybody, I think, so.

47:07.120 --> 47:09.680
Oh man, I wonder what inspired him

47:09.680 --> 47:11.200
to kind of dedicate his time to this.

47:11.200 --> 47:14.480
That would be an equally great chat, I think.

47:14.480 --> 47:16.560
He has a fascinating story and it goes back,

47:16.560 --> 47:18.920
like I won't spoil it as you dig into it,

47:18.920 --> 47:22.760
but it goes back to the early days of commercial internet,

47:22.760 --> 47:27.760
the nineties getting the SEC Edgar filing database online.

47:27.960 --> 47:30.680
And so it's, he's got a really rich history

47:30.680 --> 47:31.760
doing this for a long time.

47:31.760 --> 47:33.840
So it's cool stuff.

47:33.840 --> 47:35.640
It reminds me of some of the work that's happening

47:35.640 --> 47:39.960
like at the EFF and the Software Freedom Conservancy

47:39.960 --> 47:44.040
and those kinds of organizations that I think often

47:44.040 --> 47:46.320
we just take for granted that they exist.

47:46.320 --> 47:49.540
And yet I think we shouldn't, like they're doing work

47:49.540 --> 47:53.140
that probably a lot of us hold dear to our hearts

47:53.140 --> 47:55.560
and really believe in, but just don't have the time

47:55.560 --> 47:57.880
or the expertise to do ourselves, right?

47:57.880 --> 48:01.640
So we gotta support these organizations

48:01.640 --> 48:03.860
and these people as much as we possibly can.

48:03.860 --> 48:06.380
Yeah, I mean, the two biggest ones

48:06.380 --> 48:08.500
in the sort of open data world

48:08.500 --> 48:10.640
and sort of open knowledge access,

48:10.640 --> 48:13.280
Wikipedia is just incredible, obviously.

48:13.280 --> 48:15.480
That's the one that everybody knows.

48:15.480 --> 48:17.640
The Internet Archive also, I mean,

48:17.640 --> 48:20.240
people have probably interacted with the Internet Archive

48:20.240 --> 48:22.560
through the Wayback Machine and looking for,

48:22.560 --> 48:24.280
you know, I was looking for a webpage

48:24.280 --> 48:26.680
that no longer exists anymore maybe,

48:26.680 --> 48:30.360
but, or your high school MySpace page

48:30.360 --> 48:34.080
or whatever it is that you're trying to find from,

48:34.080 --> 48:37.280
you know, make sure is or is not accessible.

48:37.280 --> 48:41.480
But the Internet Archive also has all this amazing,

48:41.480 --> 48:43.960
they have an entire scanning operation

48:43.960 --> 48:45.960
and they're scanning in books,

48:45.960 --> 48:48.680
they're scanning in recordings from,

48:48.680 --> 48:52.480
lifted from 45, you know, vinyl.

48:52.480 --> 48:56.500
I mean, it's just, it's incredible the archive,

48:56.500 --> 48:58.000
you know, what's in that archive,

48:58.000 --> 48:59.920
the classic computer games,

48:59.920 --> 49:03.280
which is actually one of my favorite console games,

49:03.280 --> 49:06.400
you know, that used to play in the arcades,

49:06.400 --> 49:08.680
you know, those are all accessible in the Internet Archive.

49:08.680 --> 49:10.880
And it's just, this stuff is, you know,

49:10.880 --> 49:15.680
as wonderful as the web is the one thing,

49:15.680 --> 49:19.040
you know, that is not built into it is archival.

49:19.040 --> 49:23.400
So, you know, the web is constantly growing and dying

49:23.400 --> 49:24.920
and parts of it are fading away.

49:24.920 --> 49:27.960
And the Internet Archive is kind of, you know,

49:27.960 --> 49:31.640
has stepped in and really is the mechanism

49:31.640 --> 49:34.360
that is filling that gap.

49:34.360 --> 49:36.200
But it's also the mechanism filling that gap

49:36.200 --> 49:39.360
for the world's libraries with books that are out of print.

49:39.360 --> 49:40.760
Public domain and all of that.

49:40.760 --> 49:44.800
Yeah, and not just that, but also software as well,

49:44.800 --> 49:46.600
old software.

49:46.600 --> 49:48.480
So it's fascinating.

49:48.480 --> 49:50.440
You could spend an entire, you know,

49:50.440 --> 49:51.600
way more than a Saturday,

49:51.600 --> 49:53.480
you could spend your whole weekend in the Internet Archive

49:53.480 --> 49:56.140
or your whole month in the Internet Archive.

49:56.140 --> 49:58.300
But I just think like those things are,

49:58.300 --> 50:00.760
they're a little bit of the personification of open source,

50:00.760 --> 50:02.920
like not just from the data,

50:02.920 --> 50:04.840
but also a lot of the technology

50:04.840 --> 50:07.400
that's used to operate all that stuff is, you know,

50:07.400 --> 50:09.260
there's open source underneath all that too.

50:09.260 --> 50:12.240
So it's an accessible thing for a lot of people

50:12.240 --> 50:13.880
can really wrap their head around it.

50:13.880 --> 50:15.000
Aren't we lucky?

50:15.000 --> 50:15.840
That's cool.

50:15.840 --> 50:16.680
That's cool stuff.

50:17.920 --> 50:21.920
Have you considered doing a self-portrait of yourself

50:21.920 --> 50:24.120
for this Faces of Open Source project?

50:24.120 --> 50:26.040
Because it sounds like you're an important piece

50:26.040 --> 50:26.920
of that as well.

50:26.920 --> 50:28.760
That's a great question.

50:28.760 --> 50:31.120
I have not considered doing that.

50:31.120 --> 50:32.060
Would you?

50:32.060 --> 50:35.040
I would consider it, but you know,

50:35.040 --> 50:37.960
I would say I'm slightly uncomfortable

50:37.960 --> 50:40.080
in terms of my contributions

50:40.080 --> 50:42.640
compared to the contributions of the people

50:42.640 --> 50:45.200
that are being photographed.

50:45.200 --> 50:47.480
You know, so much of, you know,

50:47.480 --> 50:50.180
I try hard as a photographer

50:50.180 --> 50:54.420
not to insert myself into the story, right?

50:54.420 --> 50:57.460
Just cause I think it changes the story.

50:57.460 --> 50:59.440
And I realize in this case, you know,

50:59.440 --> 51:02.680
there's some open source, you know,

51:02.680 --> 51:04.640
nature to what's happening here.

51:04.640 --> 51:08.600
But for the most part, it's a documentary project.

51:08.600 --> 51:12.040
And, you know, just like a documentary filmmaker

51:12.040 --> 51:12.960
wouldn't write themselves

51:12.960 --> 51:15.920
into the script of a documentary necessarily,

51:15.920 --> 51:20.920
unless you're Werner Herzog or, you know,

51:22.600 --> 51:24.640
certain documentary filmmakers do do that.

51:24.640 --> 51:25.480
And it works out.

51:25.480 --> 51:28.940
Michael Moore and folks do a great job of doing that.

51:28.940 --> 51:33.360
I haven't felt like I would add anything

51:33.360 --> 51:36.480
to the project by being a part of it.

51:36.480 --> 51:37.320
But I have to admit,

51:37.320 --> 51:39.680
I've never really spent a lot of time considering it.

51:39.680 --> 51:41.220
I appreciate your perspective there

51:41.220 --> 51:46.200
because when you said inserting yourself into it

51:46.200 --> 51:49.880
changes the project, I think you're completely right.

51:49.880 --> 51:52.920
There is, I think as you know,

51:52.920 --> 51:55.200
there are many photographers in the industry

51:55.200 --> 51:58.880
who sort of lead with ego first

51:58.880 --> 52:03.000
and that often is attractive and useful in many ways

52:03.000 --> 52:04.540
and yet changes the work, right?

52:06.080 --> 52:10.820
And if you are trying to be a bit more documentary in nature

52:10.820 --> 52:14.140
and complimentary to the people in front of the camera,

52:15.360 --> 52:17.240
instead of focusing on yourself,

52:17.240 --> 52:19.160
I could see why that would change things.

52:19.160 --> 52:21.680
So your answer is making me reflect

52:21.680 --> 52:25.320
even more on my question, which is a good sign.

52:26.520 --> 52:29.360
So yeah, I appreciate that answer for sure.

52:29.360 --> 52:31.440
It just changes the dynamic a little bit.

52:31.440 --> 52:32.280
Certainly.

52:32.280 --> 52:33.760
You know, I'd have to think about it more,

52:33.760 --> 52:37.720
but I've never considered doing that for other projects.

52:37.720 --> 52:41.560
I think, you know, if it was, you know, if I was

52:41.560 --> 52:45.120
a significant contributor to some massive open source thing

52:45.120 --> 52:46.680
and, you know, or something like that

52:46.680 --> 52:48.740
and the fact that I was included

52:48.740 --> 52:51.220
made the project possible or something like that,

52:51.220 --> 52:54.040
then maybe, but I don't think any of that

52:54.040 --> 52:56.760
is happening here with this project.

52:56.760 --> 52:58.440
Well, I think what's interesting

52:58.440 --> 53:01.920
and really what the crux of my question was

53:01.920 --> 53:04.120
is just to sort of nudge you

53:04.120 --> 53:05.700
towards a little bit of self-reflection

53:05.700 --> 53:09.200
and to acknowledge that the project you're doing here

53:09.200 --> 53:12.080
is really important and it's a bit of a gift

53:12.080 --> 53:13.860
to the open source community

53:13.860 --> 53:17.480
and there's real personality in those photographs

53:17.480 --> 53:19.800
and I think that's what really drew me to them.

53:19.800 --> 53:23.360
You know, I've looked at a number of photographs in my day

53:23.360 --> 53:26.600
and the thing that attracted me

53:26.600 --> 53:28.120
to the series you've created is that

53:28.120 --> 53:31.320
you can read the person's personality

53:31.320 --> 53:34.560
in each of the photographs that you've done of them

53:34.560 --> 53:38.480
and that is not always that straightforward

53:38.480 --> 53:40.340
or that easy to accomplish

53:40.340 --> 53:42.120
and so browsing through the photographs,

53:42.120 --> 53:44.720
even if you don't recognize the people,

53:44.720 --> 53:47.120
it's really fun to go through

53:47.120 --> 53:51.200
and see sort of the different types of personalities

53:51.200 --> 53:54.160
that are included in this wild and crazy thing

53:54.160 --> 53:55.460
we call open source,

53:56.360 --> 54:00.560
but also you get to sort of click on these faces

54:00.560 --> 54:01.860
and learn about the people

54:01.860 --> 54:05.860
and be surprised about where they've put their time

54:05.860 --> 54:07.960
and how much history they may have

54:07.960 --> 54:12.960
or how young they might be and are totally diving in.

54:13.040 --> 54:16.680
So it felt to me, at least when I've been going through it,

54:16.680 --> 54:18.860
and it takes a few sessions because there's a lot of them,

54:18.860 --> 54:22.960
but it feels like a total ride and an education

54:22.960 --> 54:27.000
in just everyone who's made what we're living possible.

54:27.000 --> 54:30.040
So I found it really super fun, super entertaining.

54:30.040 --> 54:32.360
So from that angle too, yeah.

54:32.360 --> 54:33.200
Yeah, thank you.

54:35.200 --> 54:36.040
I love hearing that

54:36.040 --> 54:40.000
and so glad that you're digging it.

54:40.000 --> 54:43.080
It is fun to learn about the people I try to include

54:43.080 --> 54:45.820
and the captions that we do,

54:46.680 --> 54:51.680
something also about the person's extracurricular activities,

54:52.080 --> 54:52.920
if you will,

54:52.920 --> 54:54.920
because what's also really interesting

54:54.920 --> 54:56.440
about the people in the project

54:56.440 --> 55:00.720
is that a good number of them

55:00.720 --> 55:03.160
do way more than just open source, right?

55:03.160 --> 55:06.440
Like they may have a whole nother superpower

55:07.320 --> 55:10.320
that is not even, you would never think,

55:10.320 --> 55:15.320
whether it's Ken Thompson invented Unix with Dennis Ritchie,

55:15.600 --> 55:19.960
but Ken is also an accomplished pilot.

55:19.960 --> 55:21.420
Yeah, one thing I've mentioned here before

55:21.420 --> 55:24.400
is what I'm really fascinated in

55:24.400 --> 55:25.880
and that you're discovering as well

55:25.880 --> 55:30.480
is that juxtaposition between all of a person's experience

55:30.480 --> 55:32.520
and the contributions they make

55:32.520 --> 55:34.880
to a great number of areas in life, right?

55:34.880 --> 55:37.440
And that's what makes us all quite unique

55:37.440 --> 55:40.960
and I feel really fascinating.

55:40.960 --> 55:44.240
Every single person has this quite interesting story to tell

55:44.240 --> 55:47.440
and you're helping to tell that in a little way.

55:47.440 --> 55:50.640
Peter, if people wanted to get connected with you

55:50.640 --> 55:53.320
or I guess to see some of these photographs,

55:53.320 --> 55:55.480
where would they go for that?

55:55.480 --> 55:58.560
I mean, the best place to view the project is online

55:58.560 --> 56:03.560
at facesofopensource.com and all the portraits,

56:04.020 --> 56:05.320
I put all the portraits up there

56:05.320 --> 56:07.840
and you can kind of click through the slideshow of them all

56:07.840 --> 56:11.480
with the captions and there's links there

56:11.480 --> 56:14.800
back to my professional photography website as well.

56:14.800 --> 56:17.440
So if you wanna see more photography,

56:17.440 --> 56:19.900
there've been some interesting sort of adjunct projects

56:19.900 --> 56:22.000
that have come out of this that I have

56:22.000 --> 56:26.420
on my peteradamsphoto.com website.

56:26.420 --> 56:28.080
Yeah, I was digging into those a little earlier.

56:28.080 --> 56:31.220
There's one on printed circuits,

56:31.220 --> 56:33.680
which is really, it's like portraits of circuit boards,

56:33.680 --> 56:36.200
which is really fabulous and really interesting.

56:36.200 --> 56:38.480
Yeah, we can talk for another hour about that.

56:38.480 --> 56:41.400
Well, Peter, thank you so much for connecting with me

56:41.400 --> 56:44.640
and for chatting about some of your life's experience

56:44.640 --> 56:46.640
in open source and this photography project.

56:46.640 --> 56:48.360
It's been really fun.

56:48.360 --> 56:50.320
Hey man, thank you for having me

56:50.320 --> 56:54.240
and it's been an honor to spend some time talking to you.

56:54.240 --> 56:55.080
Well, thank you.

56:55.080 --> 56:57.200
Yeah, and hopefully maybe we get to meet

56:57.200 --> 56:59.080
at some of these conferences at one point.

56:59.080 --> 57:00.120
That would be a real treat.

57:00.120 --> 57:01.800
Yes, let's make that happen.

57:01.800 --> 57:03.200
Yeah, that'd be amazing.

57:03.200 --> 57:04.040
Thanks, Peter.

57:04.040 --> 57:24.040
Thanks, Peter.
