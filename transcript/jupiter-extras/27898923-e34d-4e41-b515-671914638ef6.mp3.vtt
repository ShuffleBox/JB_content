00:00.000 --> 00:15.360
Hi, everyone. Welcome to Brunch with Brent. It's my pleasure to be joined today by Brennan

00:15.360 --> 00:17.360
Bruce. Brennan, how you doing?

00:17.360 --> 00:19.600
I'm doing all right. Today's going pretty well.

00:19.600 --> 00:28.640
Yeah, well, that's good to hear. We got connected by a few friends of ours in the Jupiter broadcasting

00:28.640 --> 00:33.360
network, because you're the director of customer support at Linux Academy.

00:33.360 --> 00:34.080
Correct.

00:34.640 --> 00:42.000
And I would imagine that holds quite a bit of responsibilities. At least the title sounds like

00:42.000 --> 00:42.720
it does.

00:42.720 --> 00:53.440
Yeah. Right now the team is seven people. I have two in Australia, one in Tennessee,

00:53.440 --> 01:01.120
and then the rest are all in Texas with me. And we manage all the day-to-day operations

01:01.120 --> 01:04.800
for the support team for Linux Academy.

01:04.800 --> 01:09.680
Nice. I would imagine every single day is a little bit different for your team. That's

01:09.680 --> 01:11.200
kind of the nature of support, isn't it?

01:11.200 --> 01:17.840
Oh, it's a very reactive, so grab bag is probably the best description of the problems we see.

01:17.840 --> 01:24.400
I would imagine there's some repetition, but yeah, you just like all sorts of stuff. And

01:24.400 --> 01:29.040
so are you dealing with customers directly or is it internal support? Is it a little

01:29.040 --> 01:30.080
bit of both?

01:30.080 --> 01:37.520
So up until roughly two weeks ago, we handled both internal and external support. The internal

01:37.520 --> 01:44.880
support just got moved over to an IT operations team. So we are getting used to having nothing

01:44.880 --> 01:46.080
but external now.

01:46.080 --> 01:51.280
Right. So a little bit of relief there, but at least it allows you to concentrate your

01:51.280 --> 01:57.040
time a little bit because you've got a little bit of two worlds. You've got a crew of people

01:57.680 --> 02:02.400
face-to-face with you where you're located, it sounds like, and also some remote staff.

02:02.400 --> 02:07.040
Is it kind of a completely different dynamic working with those or is it working out pretty

02:07.040 --> 02:08.400
well? How does that work?

02:08.400 --> 02:14.240
So everyone technically works remote. We have an office here in San Antonio that we go into

02:14.240 --> 02:19.920
twice a week, just to kind of see each other and have some face time. But for the most

02:19.920 --> 02:26.000
part, we all work remote. So I've gotten used to nothing but Slack calls and Zoom calls

02:26.000 --> 02:27.840
in order to talk to people.

02:29.440 --> 02:36.080
And how is that for you? Is that a nice rhythm or would you prefer a little bit more time?

02:36.080 --> 02:40.560
Because I know many of us in the industry, we're doing a lot of remote time now, but

02:40.560 --> 02:42.560
there are some challenges that come with that too.

02:42.560 --> 02:47.920
It's weird. I've had this discussion with other people and I've found that remote work

02:47.920 --> 02:53.120
for people in a transactional business like support, where I get a ticket, I work the

02:53.120 --> 02:58.880
ticket, I go to the next one. Remote is perfect for them, assuming everybody has a work ethic.

02:58.880 --> 03:04.080
That's got to be announced up front. But for people in that transactional setting, they

03:04.080 --> 03:11.680
tend to manage themselves very closely because they're afraid, subconsciously, consciously,

03:11.680 --> 03:17.120
that they're going to lose that privilege of working from home if they slack off. So

03:17.120 --> 03:22.000
they're always hustling. Whereas when you have people who are project based and you

03:22.000 --> 03:27.200
say, all right, you've got three months to finish this. Well, they may slack off for

03:27.200 --> 03:31.520
two months because, hey, as long as I get it done by the third month, we're all good.

03:32.400 --> 03:38.160
So these like micro projects seem to lend well to that remote stuff. And it sounds

03:38.160 --> 03:43.840
to me like being part of a team is likely a really big part of that because you want to

03:45.280 --> 03:48.560
make sure that you're doing well for your team as well, that you're not letting anybody

03:48.560 --> 03:52.240
down or forcing some work on someone else. If you've got the right team around you, that

03:52.240 --> 03:56.720
sounds like a pretty powerful environment. Yeah, I kind of describe it as an oligarchy.

03:56.720 --> 04:02.080
You know, I make all the final calls, but realistically, it's very democratic because

04:02.080 --> 04:06.640
if they don't like it, they're not going to do it. So I've got to make sure that it's

04:06.640 --> 04:13.760
balanced and that they understand any of the choices I make for the team. They understand

04:13.760 --> 04:18.400
the benefit, the cost and the benefit for it. So you may not like it, but hey, this

04:18.400 --> 04:23.600
is the payoff if you stick with it. Has anyone joined your team who has never done remote

04:23.600 --> 04:28.800
before? Like, is there some mentorship that happens there or some kind of adjustments

04:28.800 --> 04:36.560
for someone like that? Three of my employees came from another large hosting provider here

04:36.560 --> 04:44.480
in San Antonio. And for the most part, they worked in a major office. So for them, they

04:44.480 --> 04:48.800
were ready to be at home. They were ready to have some of that freedom back because

04:48.800 --> 04:52.320
they already knew they could do the work. They just hated having to deal with some of

04:52.320 --> 04:56.320
the people that they dealt with on a day to day. And it's not to say they were asocial

04:56.320 --> 05:01.760
or didn't want to be around people. They're actually great people people. But you have

05:01.760 --> 05:07.680
those that that office feeling where you wonder, is somebody standing right next to me? Are

05:07.680 --> 05:10.960
they gonna come bother me? Do they want to talk to me? Because I've got work to do.

05:10.960 --> 05:16.960
You know, I can totally relate to that because I'm a photographer primarily. And so I'm

05:16.960 --> 05:21.360
working from home all the time. Well, I say from home, but I'm always traveling. And so

05:22.400 --> 05:27.840
the home ends up being wherever I am. But but a home base, right? That's away from a

05:27.840 --> 05:34.720
standard sort of large office. And the reason I I'm asking those questions is it's such a

05:34.720 --> 05:40.640
curious thing to me, like, I've lived in that world quite a lot and have had to learn how

05:40.640 --> 05:47.680
to do it myself. And, you know, I've tripped along the way. And, and yet, I've heard repeatedly

05:47.680 --> 05:51.440
from, you know, employees who are used to the sort of corporate environment like that,

05:51.440 --> 05:56.880
how, once you figure out how to be, you know, consistently productive, on your own, that

05:56.880 --> 06:02.640
freedom can just increase productivity and happiness and that sense of flexibility to

06:02.640 --> 06:09.040
is sounds really essential. Yeah, I mean, my background was actually as a cook and chef

06:09.840 --> 06:17.760
for almost two decades before I ever got into tech. Nice. And management, aside from managing

06:17.760 --> 06:26.640
kitchens, which is another animal all unto itself, I'd never been in a full on corporate

06:26.640 --> 06:34.720
style management role. So I had to teach myself analytics. I'd never done it. I've done like

06:34.720 --> 06:41.520
cost benefit stuff for like inventory control, but never gone, okay, I need to find metrics

06:41.520 --> 06:46.400
that show that my employees are doing a good job. What metrics are important? How do we

06:46.400 --> 06:52.480
know what is good? What is bad? What's good data, bad data? Those were questions I never

06:52.480 --> 06:59.120
had to ask before. And if I were in a corporate setting, and all the floundering I went through

06:59.120 --> 07:05.360
trying to figure it out, I would have looked like an idiot. But being able to hide in my,

07:05.360 --> 07:10.240
you know, living room, and figure this out in the middle of the night, because that's

07:10.240 --> 07:15.600
when I decided I was going to work on it. It was it was easy. It was more of a comfortable

07:15.600 --> 07:22.960
experience. Do you feel like sometimes working when you're your most optimal, or at least

07:22.960 --> 07:28.720
when, you know, an idea really grabs you, and you can just dive into it? Do you feel

07:28.720 --> 07:35.600
like that's an advantage as well? Oh, absolutely. It actually helps a lot with having a worldwide

07:35.600 --> 07:41.040
team. You know, like I said, I have two guys in Australia who work for me. And that's because

07:41.040 --> 07:46.480
for them, what is a daytime shift is overnight for us. So I end up getting close to like

07:46.480 --> 07:52.560
a 24 seven coverage without having to have, you know, somebody up in the middle of the

07:52.560 --> 07:56.960
night. Oh, that's nice. But having to get used to the fact that I was going to have

07:56.960 --> 08:04.320
to meet with them at a time that was comparable for both of both parties took some getting

08:04.320 --> 08:08.160
used to. But I was like, hey, this is great, though, because I can say, all right, today's

08:08.160 --> 08:13.920
gonna be the day where I can go out and go shopping at noon, because I'm going to be

08:13.920 --> 08:19.840
working until midnight. So I'll just shift my hours around. And having that flexibility

08:19.840 --> 08:25.440
is tremendous when you need to be able to think on your feet, and the world doesn't

08:25.440 --> 08:33.040
revolve around the nine to five schedule. Yeah, I could see how from the business perspective,

08:33.040 --> 08:39.840
that sort of flexibility in support is like, totally essential that that 24 hour cycle

08:39.840 --> 08:45.360
I hadn't even thought of because we sort of think in these, you know, eight hour or more

08:45.360 --> 08:50.320
max 12 hour cycles. But yeah, I could see how having someone sort of on hand at any

08:50.320 --> 08:55.440
time, especially with a, you know, how Linux Academy is is such a sort of web based business

08:55.440 --> 09:00.080
wherever anybody can join from anywhere at any time, I could see how that would really

09:00.080 --> 09:03.920
be quite essential. It's fascinating. I just, you know, we're talking about analytics, I

09:03.920 --> 09:10.640
just got into using like Google Analytics to track our it's basically our FAQ page.

09:10.640 --> 09:16.160
It's, we use Zendesk. So it's called a knowledge base. But I wanted to track which ones were

09:16.160 --> 09:21.760
most popular to see, you know, where, where we could do better and where we are doing

09:21.760 --> 09:27.680
the best. And got into messing with Google Analytics, having never messed with it before.

09:27.680 --> 09:35.360
And I was shocked at how much information was in there. And found that while our student

09:35.360 --> 09:44.960
base is primarily North American, so, excluding Mexico, so Canada and the United States are

09:45.840 --> 09:54.720
combined, I think 67 68% of our student base. And the rest tends to be centered around

09:54.720 --> 10:04.400
around India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia. So the Middle Eastern countries have

10:04.400 --> 10:08.960
another good like 27%. I thought, okay, so that's what I should see when I look at the

10:08.960 --> 10:15.520
analytics. But looking at our FAQ pages, I found that it was almost inverted. The people

10:15.520 --> 10:21.200
in North America aren't going to the FAQ pages at all. But those in the Middle East are pouring

10:21.200 --> 10:27.600
over pages. Like I was able to track one guy who went through and read almost 60 articles

10:27.600 --> 10:31.520
that we'd written. Nothing that had anything to do with each other, just reading articles.

10:32.800 --> 10:34.160
That's fascinating.

10:34.160 --> 10:38.480
Yeah, I was like, wow, I would have thought it would be, you know, where we have the most

10:38.480 --> 10:44.480
people. That's where the most people are going to our FAQ. No, it's the inverse. The other

10:44.480 --> 10:48.160
group really wants to know a lot. And they'll just sit there and read.

10:48.160 --> 10:56.720
Wow. Do you feel like that speaks a little bit to like, learning culture in different

10:57.360 --> 11:04.560
places in the world? Because I, you know, what you've just described is also the opposite of

11:04.560 --> 11:08.880
what I would have thought. Like, it almost tells a story that you could have never imagined unless

11:08.880 --> 11:15.360
you had that data, which I suppose, shows the strength of data. But you think it's a cultural,

11:15.360 --> 11:22.240
like a learning culture difference? Or maybe, I don't know. What do you think? Any theories?

11:22.960 --> 11:29.200
So I haven't got enough data to prove my hypothesis. But the best one I've come up with

11:29.200 --> 11:34.240
is that if you know English as a second language or a third or fourth language,

11:35.120 --> 11:41.440
it is easier for you to go and read it and be able to look up the words that you don't know

11:41.440 --> 11:48.400
in English. Then it is for you to try and play with it and figure it out in a system that's

11:48.400 --> 11:54.640
written in English. If you go on and try and mess with a new program and all the buttons are in

11:54.640 --> 12:02.480
English, or in this case for us, let's say they're in Flemish and you don't speak Flemish. So you're

12:02.480 --> 12:07.280
looking at going, okay, I don't know what that is. I might be able to figure that that means stop

12:07.280 --> 12:16.000
because it's red. But this company has written articles about their program. And if you go sit

12:16.000 --> 12:22.880
there and learn Flemish and try and translate as you go, you can learn it. That's the only thing

12:22.880 --> 12:28.480
I've come up with so far, that and possibly that it's just a different culture that they are

12:28.480 --> 12:35.200
accustomed to going and reading in order to understand. Whereas in the more Western cultures,

12:35.200 --> 12:42.080
we have a quicker need to get the information. If I don't get it in a couple of clicks, I'm not

12:42.080 --> 12:47.280
messing with it. I think you're onto something though with that theory because when you put it

12:47.280 --> 12:51.680
in the perspective of flipping the coin and playing with a tool that's in a completely

12:51.680 --> 12:59.120
different language, it sounds to me almost like learning what I'll call offline. So not in a live

12:59.120 --> 13:06.160
environment so that you can sort of spend the time slowly understanding all of the concepts before

13:06.160 --> 13:12.720
you dive into the actual, you know, nitty gritty of doing it. That would make a lot of sense to me

13:13.600 --> 13:19.520
from the perspective of confidence, especially if it's a different language, right? You can wrap

13:19.520 --> 13:24.640
your head around a whole lot of concepts and the whole thing before you sort of dive in and poke

13:24.640 --> 13:29.440
around. So I think you're onto something there. One of the other big things we found out with

13:29.440 --> 13:37.920
this was we started mapping what pages people are going to the most. And we found that on a monthly

13:37.920 --> 13:45.760
basis, the most popular was one on how to connect to our hands-on labs. And I thought, well, why is

13:45.760 --> 13:50.880
that? I mean, there are directions at every lab that tell you how to do it. Why do they need to

13:50.880 --> 13:56.240
come read this? And I mean, and we're talking like a magnitude of difference. Like in December,

13:56.960 --> 14:03.360
9,000 unique people and unique IP addresses went and read the article that we had written

14:03.360 --> 14:10.880
in support on how to connect to hands-on labs. And the next closest thing was, it was like a

14:10.880 --> 14:16.960
description, a comparison between what a cloud playground is and what cloud servers are. And

14:16.960 --> 14:23.760
it went from 9,000 for connecting to like 3,000. So three times less.

14:24.560 --> 14:24.800
Wow.

14:25.360 --> 14:32.240
And I was like, that's huge. Why is that? And I go and look at how the interface was written.

14:32.240 --> 14:38.880
So if you go to a lab, how the directions are written there are, if you are unfamiliar with

14:38.880 --> 14:47.200
how to use things like say SSH or PuTTY, they're confusing. But you go to our article in the support

14:47.200 --> 14:52.080
FAQ, and we've got like diagrams and pictures and a step-by-step walkthrough. And I was like,

14:52.080 --> 14:56.400
well, that explains it. If you're brand new and you don't understand, and somebody is already

14:56.400 --> 15:01.360
making a leap of logic for you saying, oh, you should know this before you start. Yeah, you're

15:01.360 --> 15:05.680
going to go read another article on it. It's almost like the data is telling you a whole

15:05.680 --> 15:14.560
bunch of stories. How could that not be helpful for you and your team to create better experiences

15:14.560 --> 15:21.680
for the end user? It sounds like it allows you almost to empathize with the person on the other

15:21.680 --> 15:24.000
end. Does that feel accurate?

15:24.000 --> 15:31.440
I am a very numbers-driven, data-driven person, even though I didn't understand it until I had

15:31.440 --> 15:38.240
the tools. And I started seeing parts of my personality really come out as I dug deeper

15:38.240 --> 15:42.640
into stuff. And I was like, this is what I need to know. I have always wanted to understand,

15:43.760 --> 15:50.320
but I didn't have the knowledge on how to collect data. And now I can sit here and go, okay,

15:51.040 --> 15:57.680
I feel that it should be this way. Let me see if the logic backs it up. It makes a world of

15:57.680 --> 16:02.480
difference, especially when you're talking about solving people's day-to-day problems,

16:03.200 --> 16:08.560
if you can understand where they're coming from first and why they have the problem in the first

16:08.560 --> 16:19.120
place. Because it is a flaw of working in support that eventually you get to, I wouldn't say a jaded

16:19.120 --> 16:26.480
place, but more of a callous place. You've built up a reaction to seeing a similar question over

16:26.480 --> 16:30.480
and over. So you just get to a point where like, okay, these people just don't know what they're

16:30.480 --> 16:36.720
doing. Is it that they don't know what they're doing or did you not teach them? Where is the

16:36.720 --> 16:44.080
real failing? Yeah. Interesting. I feel like the data that you're diving into is telling you a

16:44.080 --> 16:53.520
story that's actually sort of leading you to some hints at human nature almost. So it's curious to

16:53.520 --> 16:57.200
me those two worlds because the data-driven world, you know, usually is super technical and stuff

16:57.200 --> 17:01.680
like that. But that's actually allowing you to see sort of the human element of it all,

17:03.040 --> 17:09.520
which is fascinating. And like the example you just gave in those sort of calloused perspectives,

17:09.520 --> 17:17.120
if you've spent that much time and support, I could see how seeing it from the other side and

17:17.120 --> 17:22.240
just asking different questions with that data behind you would allow for quite a powerful

17:22.240 --> 17:26.880
transformation in the approach that you take there. So that's really fascinating to me.

17:27.440 --> 17:32.000
Okay. So you said you do photography. I would compare it to trying to explain shutter speed.

17:32.800 --> 17:37.360
For you, I'm sure the idea of like, hey, if you leave the aperture open longer, yeah,

17:37.360 --> 17:43.600
you're going to overexpose the film. That just seems logical to you. But to somebody who's never

17:43.600 --> 17:48.000
messed with a camera and only knows if I click this button, it should do something, the idea

17:48.000 --> 17:55.360
of aperture is a huge thing. I had no idea that the film stayed exposed and the lens stayed open

17:55.360 --> 18:00.640
longer. And if you grew up with only digital cameras, that idea is completely lost.

18:00.640 --> 18:06.560
It's a good example because, you know, often as professionals or people who've spent, you know,

18:06.560 --> 18:13.200
countless hours on a certain technology or in this example on learning cameras and stuff, like

18:13.200 --> 18:20.240
for me, I don't even consciously think about using my camera anymore. It just sort of happens

18:20.240 --> 18:26.800
subconsciously. And the same is true of technology, right? Like for those of us who have spent years

18:26.800 --> 18:32.800
doing deep dives and learning this and are curious about it, some of those simpler concepts can often

18:33.360 --> 18:39.840
get lost because, you know, we're not beginners anymore. So in your position and your team's

18:39.840 --> 18:45.520
position, having that, trying to maintain some sort of empathy for that beginner or someone

18:45.520 --> 18:51.040
who's new to a platform, that sounds pretty essential almost. It's funny, the more we talk

18:51.040 --> 18:58.240
about this, I think back to how I got started really diving into customer issues and the way

18:58.240 --> 19:05.360
that they see problems. And I actually wrote a talk on it to try and put in words what I was

19:05.360 --> 19:11.520
thinking. It was a bit tongue-in-cheek. It was called How to Train Your Customer. This is the

19:11.520 --> 19:17.680
talk you gave at B-Sides in San Antonio, right? Yes. Were you there? I didn't, but I did get to

19:17.680 --> 19:22.960
see it. So I got to appreciate that sort of tongue-in-cheek approach that you take. Oh,

19:22.960 --> 19:27.280
yeah. No, I'm glad because now I don't have to like fully explain everything. You get some of

19:27.280 --> 19:34.560
the reference points, but you do. You see, regardless of what problem they're bringing to you,

19:34.560 --> 19:41.440
you'll see these marked approaches on how the problem is presented. You have people who will

19:41.440 --> 19:49.600
just go, your site is slow. How do you know it's slow? What are you comparing it to? What does slow

19:49.600 --> 19:56.080
mean? Yeah. All these questions that come up as a support person, they don't occur to the person

19:56.080 --> 20:02.320
on the other side. They're just frustrated and they go, site is slow. I am mad. So you have to

20:02.320 --> 20:07.600
train them in the way in which you respond. Now, if you do what every single support person has

20:07.600 --> 20:13.840
done for years now and gone, you need to clear your cache and cookies, try resetting your router.

20:13.840 --> 20:21.440
It's got to be your Wi-Fi. Those cookie cutter responses, people become numb to them. So they'll

20:21.440 --> 20:27.520
start responding back. And that's what I noticed is that people will pay attention to troubleshooting

20:27.520 --> 20:34.080
methods you use so that they can have validation that the problem is you. Well, what if you could

20:34.080 --> 20:42.400
turn that around? What if, hey, by the way, I was troubleshooting your problem and here are the

20:42.400 --> 20:51.920
tests I ran. I ran an S-trace on my own machine to see how fast things are. Here are my ping tests,

20:51.920 --> 20:57.280
you know, whatever it was. And you show them those steps, would they start giving you that

20:57.280 --> 21:04.160
data back? And we did a small test within our support team and found that on about 20% of the

21:04.160 --> 21:10.160
time, they did. These repeat people that we found would start using these tests as if they were

21:10.160 --> 21:15.040
trying to show us off, you know, show us up and go, ah, it's still you. Look, I did it this time.

21:15.040 --> 21:21.200
I did these tests. I'm like, cool. So this does work. We can start training people to give us

21:21.200 --> 21:29.120
better data. What I gather from that story is almost that support, or at least good support,

21:29.120 --> 21:35.920
is sort of a team effort between you and the person, you know, with the complaint or the

21:35.920 --> 21:42.080
support issue. And though they may not see it that way, you have to try to convince them somehow,

21:42.080 --> 21:47.120
maybe with a few different types of approaches that that's actually the case because everyone

21:47.120 --> 21:53.280
wants a positive outcome, right? But it sounds like there's, depending on the person and the

21:53.280 --> 21:57.440
issue, there's a whole bunch of different ways to achieve that. Yeah. I mean, you're always going to

21:57.440 --> 22:04.880
have people who just want something for free. Those people exist. That's a real thing. Okay.

22:04.880 --> 22:09.520
But the way people view support as being cookie cutter in their responses,

22:09.520 --> 22:13.840
support has become cookie cutter in the way they view the people coming in. They assume

22:13.840 --> 22:18.720
everybody's out for something free. Well, they're not. But they don't know how else to get your

22:18.720 --> 22:24.400
attention if they don't go for the grandiose because we've become numb. We've become this

22:25.920 --> 22:30.080
self-insulating group who are like, we've got to protect ourselves because you don't know how hard

22:30.080 --> 22:34.640
it is to do this day in and day out. You're right. But you kind of did it to yourself too.

22:34.640 --> 22:39.600
And the only way to fix it is to change your behavior so they learn how to behave differently.

22:39.600 --> 22:43.280
And then we can all start getting along. A weird hippy thought.

22:43.280 --> 22:50.400
I like it. I like it. How do you think that support fits into sort of the greater

22:51.360 --> 22:56.240
tech realm? Because you've got engineers, you've got coders, you've got all that,

22:57.280 --> 23:03.360
so many different types of professions in there. But for you, how do you feel like support fits in?

23:03.360 --> 23:10.080
I see support in a unique way. I tell everyone on my team, if I see you on my team

23:10.080 --> 23:16.640
after three years, you better be taking my job because this should totally be just the stepping

23:16.640 --> 23:24.640
stone. This should not be where you end. And that I think is what has really hurt support in the

23:24.640 --> 23:31.360
long run. There are some people who are genuinely good at it and they love doing it. But for the

23:31.360 --> 23:36.080
most part, it should be the stepping stone into something larger in tech. It should be that entry

23:36.080 --> 23:43.280
level job. Nobody wants to be the front desk guy forever. And if they do, you know it by the way

23:43.280 --> 23:47.680
that they come to work and they just glow and they're happy because they found the job for them.

23:48.560 --> 23:51.600
But how many support people do you see that look like they're dead on the inside?

23:52.400 --> 23:58.000
And it's because there is a lifespan, a shelf life for support, and it's about two to five years.

23:58.000 --> 24:03.360
So I tell them after three years, if you're not gunning for my job, you need to go. You don't

24:03.360 --> 24:10.000
belong here anymore. You should have grown and I failed you somewhere. I want everyone on my

24:10.000 --> 24:19.600
support team to feel like they have a path somewhere. If it's in development or, hey,

24:19.600 --> 24:24.560
you know what? I just really liked the company, but I didn't have the skills to work in marketing yet.

24:24.560 --> 24:30.160
So I took what I could get. Cool. Let's get you working on how marketing works. I don't know

24:30.160 --> 24:35.360
anything about it, but let's go find out together. I really like that approach. I would imagine as

24:35.360 --> 24:41.280
well for anyone who's sort of aiming a little higher into marketing, for instance, to continue

24:41.280 --> 24:48.320
that example, I would imagine being in support gives you a connection to the end user and an

24:48.320 --> 24:54.960
understanding of the end user and of the product that maybe you don't necessarily get elsewhere.

24:54.960 --> 25:02.720
And I could see how that might be valuable in the long, long run. Yeah, I see support should always

25:02.720 --> 25:11.760
be the megaphone for the company so that they speak for the customer or the student or, you know,

25:11.760 --> 25:18.080
the client. Their job is really to go, hey, we have a problem here. What team do I have to reach

25:18.080 --> 25:23.440
out to? Okay, I need engineering. Engineering, please understand this part of the site is broken,

25:23.440 --> 25:28.960
and we have this many people who are upset about it. Or, hey, marketing, you sent out this email

25:28.960 --> 25:35.040
and there were five misspellings in it, and we've got a bunch of tickets where people are upset

25:35.040 --> 25:38.320
because you can't spell the company name right or whatever it is.

25:38.320 --> 25:43.120
I really like all of those perspectives. So it sounds like you're the right person for being

25:43.120 --> 25:50.480
where you are right now. That sounds pretty good. One thing that I wanted to mention quickly on that

25:50.480 --> 26:00.320
topic is, I read recently how Toby Lutke, who is the Shopify CEO, I think a few times a week,

26:00.320 --> 26:06.080
just like sits down and takes a few support tickets, which I found fascinating. And I think

26:06.080 --> 26:13.040
it's, which I found fascinating because it gives you, you know, of course, he built that business

26:13.040 --> 26:18.320
from the ground up. So he's gotten that connection with users previously, but he's continued that

26:18.320 --> 26:26.080
throughout. It sounds like having an understanding of sort of the entire scope of an organization,

26:26.080 --> 26:29.920
at least just a little bit, sounds like it's really informative for everybody.

26:29.920 --> 26:36.640
We have a small lapse in time from my overnight guys to my morning guys. It's about four hours. So

26:36.640 --> 26:40.000
when I get in in the morning, the first thing I do is I go through the tickets that have not been

26:40.000 --> 26:45.040
sorted yet. And it gives me kind of an idea of what were they seeing last night and what can I

26:45.040 --> 26:52.560
expect to see this morning and keep a pulse of what is going on with the day-to-day business.

26:52.560 --> 26:56.800
Inevitably gives you some perspective on how everything's going, I would imagine.

26:56.800 --> 27:04.560
There have been a lot of, not issues, but like events that we were able to see ahead of time

27:05.120 --> 27:09.600
because I was like, all right, you know, I'm sorting this and I've seen the same issue six

27:09.600 --> 27:15.600
times. And since I'm not working the issues, I'm not getting the lapse between, I'm just going,

27:15.600 --> 27:22.000
okay, this belongs here, that belongs there. You know, I get more of a digest effect. I can go,

27:22.000 --> 27:28.560
okay, hey, we've got, you know, in a four hour block of time, eight tickets about this one thing,

27:29.440 --> 27:33.280
what's going on there. And I can start diverting my energy there to start the day.

27:33.280 --> 27:38.800
You mentioned a kitchen experience for almost 20 years. I wanted to ask you a little bit about that.

27:38.800 --> 27:47.120
I have often been fascinated about sort of the internal workings of kitchens and have read about

27:47.120 --> 27:53.440
it a bunch, but haven't actually had that experience. But I'm curious how for you,

27:54.320 --> 28:01.600
are there some skills from that kitchen experience that translated to this new fast paced environment

28:01.600 --> 28:12.880
you're in now? Yes. There are a couple of things. One, I don't get the nervousness, the fear

28:12.880 --> 28:18.480
that people have in dealing with other people. Oh my, these people might be upset with me. No,

28:18.480 --> 28:23.680
I'm sorry. Once somebody's like held knives to you and there's fire around you and hot oil and I

28:23.680 --> 28:30.560
could die, the dude from accounting is not going to bother me. But the other thing, the biggest part

28:30.560 --> 28:36.160
of it was I got, when I got to Linux Academy, pretty much got to build the support team from

28:36.160 --> 28:42.000
the ground up and we got to put it together the way we wanted to see it. And I decided I was going

28:42.000 --> 28:48.640
to go with the kitchen brigade style. And in that, everybody who comes in starts at the bottom.

28:49.840 --> 28:55.440
No matter what, you start as a dishwasher or a fry cook and you work your way through the kitchen

28:55.440 --> 29:00.640
until you get to a higher level. Nobody gets hired and you know, I'm not going to go pick up

29:00.640 --> 29:06.640
a saute cook. I'm going to move my grill guy over and I'm going to move my fry guy to grill

29:06.640 --> 29:10.000
and I'm going to move my dishwasher over to fry and I'm going to hire a new dishwasher.

29:10.000 --> 29:17.680
That way, at any point in time, if one member of that chain falls out from below, like say the

29:17.680 --> 29:23.840
dishwasher calls in sick, every single person on that team has washed dishes and they know what it

29:23.840 --> 29:29.120
takes and they can pitch in and do it. There won't be that ego of, oh, that's beneath me. I got hired

29:29.120 --> 29:34.640
to do saute. No, you didn't. You got hired to do dish. You just got lucky enough to work your way

29:34.640 --> 29:42.320
up to saute. Wow. I can certainly see the advantage to that. Now it's an investment, right? That takes

29:42.320 --> 29:47.520
time to move people through all those stations. It does take time. And when you very, at the very

29:47.520 --> 29:54.960
beginning, it is the hardest because what happens is most cooks, most chefs will bring an already

29:54.960 --> 29:59.920
built team. So they've been going through this time and time again. So they'll bring a team with

29:59.920 --> 30:06.000
them from the last place they worked and go, okay, I know you went through the same thing I did. You

30:06.000 --> 30:11.200
understand this. I don't have to reteach you. But everybody new has to go through that.

30:12.000 --> 30:19.920
It sounds as well like a part of it is accepting that the team is in constant flux. Like everyone

30:19.920 --> 30:24.480
is constantly growing and everything is constantly changing and the people in the positions are

30:24.480 --> 30:30.480
constantly sort of rotating. So I could see how that would be helpful as well because we tend to

30:30.480 --> 30:36.480
want to think in sort of binaries or black and whites and simplify things like, okay, this person

30:36.480 --> 30:42.320
in HR is always going to be the person in HR, but that's just not the reality of life. And I would

30:42.320 --> 30:49.600
imagine that kitchen experience or at least that system to work on that really pays back in many,

30:49.600 --> 30:56.480
many ways. Yeah, it makes everything very dynamic, but it also, I firmly believe that if you really

30:56.480 --> 31:02.800
understand something, you can teach it. So it ensures that, hey, you want to move up, you're

31:02.800 --> 31:07.360
going to have to train the guy beneath you so he can take your spot. So you have to be able to teach

31:07.360 --> 31:12.880
them what it is you do daily. And the guy above you, the place you want to go, he's going to teach

31:12.880 --> 31:17.680
you that. And everybody's wanting to do that because that's how they get out of the spot

31:17.680 --> 31:26.080
they're in. That's so awesome. I had never really gained that insight into how kitchens work. Like

31:26.080 --> 31:33.840
I kind of gathered that there's a progression, but it seemed to me almost like your standard

31:33.840 --> 31:38.240
corporate progression where it's just like, oh, I'm going to get the next thing. But it sounds

31:38.240 --> 31:46.240
like the whole team supporting each other in this kind of pass it on approach. That sounds

31:46.240 --> 31:56.320
super powerful. It's funny. Kitchens can be the most vulgar, most offensive, ugly thing on the

31:56.320 --> 32:03.200
face of it. But deep down, everybody in there, the reason why they get like that is everybody in

32:03.200 --> 32:09.040
there knows it's going to be high stress. There isn't going to be a point in time where, all right,

32:09.040 --> 32:14.080
dude, we're all going to just hang out and watch YouTube together. No, we are all going to be

32:14.080 --> 32:21.440
working. We're going to be sweating. The conditions are crap. They just suck. It's hot. There's not a

32:21.440 --> 32:28.560
day that goes by where it's going to be cool in the kitchen. It's going to be 110. And the guy

32:28.560 --> 32:36.400
next to you on either side of you has weaponry that he brings with him daily that he sharpens.

32:36.400 --> 32:42.480
And you need to make sure everybody agrees, everybody gets along. We may not like each other

32:42.960 --> 32:48.480
outside of work. But when we're at work, we're here to work and we all love each other. It's a

32:48.480 --> 32:50.000
weird dichotomy that exists.

32:50.000 --> 32:55.760
And you're all pointed in the same direction, right? You have no choice. So this well oiled

32:55.760 --> 33:03.680
machine that is a kitchen needs to be that way. I would imagine that the stress is almost required

33:03.680 --> 33:10.880
to have it be at its most efficient. And everybody sort of plays an essential role from the bottom

33:10.880 --> 33:11.680
right to the top.

33:11.680 --> 33:17.600
Yeah, the hardest part for me, really, when I got into a corporate environment was I've become so

33:17.600 --> 33:25.200
accustomed to conflict resolution, starting and ending in about 30 seconds. I just turn to the

33:25.200 --> 33:31.440
guy next to me and tell him, you suck, and you either need to go home or pick up the pace. His

33:31.440 --> 33:36.560
feelings aren't hurt. He just knows he has two options right now. He can work and get paid or he

33:36.560 --> 33:42.800
can go home. But I can't turn to the guy next to me or in the cubicle next to me and go, dude, you

33:42.800 --> 33:48.480
suck. Can you do your job or not? Because then he starts crying or he runs off to HR and I'm in

33:48.480 --> 33:56.640
trouble. But that conflict resolution in the kitchen is necessary because if we have to stop

33:56.640 --> 34:01.440
and talk about our feelings, everything in the kitchen comes to a standstill. And now what was

34:01.440 --> 34:09.040
a well-oiled machine that was cranking out 200 plates a night is now pushing nothing out of the

34:09.040 --> 34:11.200
kitchen. It's all stopped.

34:11.200 --> 34:14.880
It's from 100 to zero. There's not really much in between, is there?

34:14.880 --> 34:24.480
No. It's why it appears like a very coarse and pirate brigade is what I hear a lot. It looks

34:24.480 --> 34:29.440
like a bunch of pirates on a ship. But it's because they don't have a choice. They don't have

34:29.440 --> 34:38.720
time to consider feelings. Now, that was the kitchen experience I grew up with. I've heard

34:38.720 --> 34:48.240
that lately it's changed and there has been a surge of a more calm and almost zen-like approach

34:48.240 --> 34:52.320
to kitchen running. I don't know how that would look because I can't imagine it. It just never

34:52.320 --> 34:57.360
was a thing for me. I would be more comfortable with Gordon Ramsay yelling and throwing my plates

34:57.360 --> 35:02.720
on the floor than I would be if some guy looked at me and goes, this one just isn't right. I would

35:02.720 --> 35:08.560
like you to try again. I'd be frightened by that guy. That guy would scare me because I'm waiting

35:08.560 --> 35:09.840
for him to explode.

35:09.840 --> 35:16.000
Or because maybe you can't trust what he's saying. Like, is that really what he's feeling? And where's

35:16.000 --> 35:22.800
the sense of urgency or severity at the mistake? Mistakes in that sort of high-stress environment

35:22.800 --> 35:28.720
are almost completely unacceptable because it changes the entire dynamic, doesn't it?

35:28.720 --> 35:34.560
But yeah, it definitely led me to, when I got here, when I got into tech, everybody's like,

35:34.560 --> 35:39.200
wow, how do you handle all the stress and all this? I'm like, nobody's yelling at me today.

35:39.200 --> 35:40.400
This is a cakewalk.

35:40.400 --> 35:47.840
This is a cakewalk. I don't know what to tell you. This is calm. I actually started developing an

35:47.840 --> 35:54.240
issue where I got so accustomed to background noise, I would have to turn things on so that

35:54.240 --> 36:00.000
there'd just be random noise. Not in that sense like people have a show going. I want construction

36:00.000 --> 36:02.880
equipment somewhere, banging pots and stuff.

36:02.880 --> 36:07.280
Is there such a thing as a white noise from a kitchen that you can turn on and tune out the

36:07.280 --> 36:10.640
world? Maybe it's a market opportunity.

36:12.000 --> 36:16.320
I would say just as a slight aside for anybody who's interested in reading up on that

36:16.320 --> 36:21.200
kind of kitchen experience, I have two recommendations. And maybe you can add to

36:21.200 --> 36:27.360
these if you've done that kind of reading. But I just came across randomly a book called Heat

36:27.360 --> 36:35.040
by Bill Buford. And he, so you know it, he describes his experience sort of learning

36:35.040 --> 36:40.720
the kitchen from the likes of Mario Batali and going to Italy and doing a bunch of crazy stuff.

36:40.720 --> 36:46.880
So that book is very entertaining. I would imagine for someone in the kitchen, as well as someone

36:46.880 --> 36:52.240
outside of a professional kitchen, you know, I've never really had tiny experiences, but that book

36:52.240 --> 36:59.280
was fascinating to me, and totally agrees with everything you just said. And I guess anything,

36:59.280 --> 37:03.360
you know, Anthony Bourdain is pretty well known for his kitchen confidentials and stuff. So

37:03.360 --> 37:05.040
those are two fascinating reads.

37:05.040 --> 37:13.120
Everybody I know when that came out was like, all right, who is this guy? Because this is spot on,

37:13.120 --> 37:20.480
you know, it was almost like he was explaining our lives to us. And if you haven't read it,

37:20.480 --> 37:23.040
Medium Raw is also really good by him.

37:23.040 --> 37:25.360
Oh, what's that like?

37:25.360 --> 37:31.200
It's more of what happens when you become a hack, when you become me now, you know, hey, you used

37:31.200 --> 37:36.560
to work in a kitchen, and all you do is talk about it. You're not really a cook anymore. You're not

37:36.560 --> 37:41.920
one of us. Very odd feeling. You know, I'll go out with my girlfriend, we'll go to restaurants,

37:41.920 --> 37:47.920
and I try and identify with the waitstaff and the bartenders and the cooks, and they can tell I know

37:47.920 --> 37:53.120
what I'm talking about, but they also know I'm not one of them anymore. And it's, do you do,

37:53.120 --> 37:58.240
it's like, you start to feel like a fraud in what used to be your own home.

37:58.240 --> 38:01.120
I suppose it's a change of identity in some ways.

38:01.120 --> 38:08.160
Oh, my fingers used to be like black with soot underneath them and burnt and calluses. And now

38:08.160 --> 38:11.040
I'm like, I don't know when I last got a manicure.

38:11.040 --> 38:13.920
The things we put ourselves through.

38:13.920 --> 38:21.040
I have been beaten. I've been bloodied. I've been burnt. And now I'm like, oh, I really should

38:21.040 --> 38:25.520
change clothes or something. You know, the weird things that crossed my mind now when at the time

38:25.520 --> 38:30.320
it was like, okay, I need to put cornstarch underneath my arm so I can stop the sweating.

38:30.320 --> 38:36.880
Do you feel like, you know, you're still getting beat and burnt and all of that, but just in more

38:36.880 --> 38:42.000
of a sort of a mental capacity instead of that physical stuff? Like, has it just transformed,

38:42.000 --> 38:43.600
or is it gone completely?

38:43.600 --> 38:50.640
It has transformed, but it's taken me a while to get used to it. The thing about being in the

38:50.640 --> 38:57.920
restaurant is a lot of the beatings were upfront in your face. You knew what was coming. There was

38:57.920 --> 39:06.240
no power play. There was no backstabbing, because if somebody was a backstabber, everybody called

39:06.240 --> 39:16.000
them out. Everybody knew. While there are politics in the kitchen, it's more like watching, I can't

39:16.000 --> 39:22.720
remember what they're called, in the UK, basically their version of senators and congressmen, where

39:22.720 --> 39:29.280
they're all out there just making fun of each other open. Whereas I get into a corporate setting

39:29.280 --> 39:33.760
here, and it reminds me of US politics, where everybody says nice things about each other,

39:34.320 --> 39:38.080
even though they hate each other. I'm like, uh-uh, you don't like me, you don't like me,

39:38.080 --> 39:40.560
you can tell me that. You're not going to hurt my feelings.

39:40.560 --> 39:45.600
Interesting. It's like clear direct communication versus sort of hiding the stuff between the

39:45.600 --> 39:46.320
lines.

39:46.320 --> 39:52.480
Yeah. It's like everybody's afraid to have an emotion because that makes them weak. I'm like,

39:52.480 --> 39:57.760
no, no, no, no, no. You've got to get beyond letting the emotion control you, and you just

39:57.760 --> 40:03.040
control your emotions. You go, hey, look, I'm angry at you because you did this, this, and this.

40:03.760 --> 40:09.120
Then when you've gotten that off your chest, you get to stop being angry. It's like people

40:09.120 --> 40:11.360
don't know how to shut that off, I guess.

40:11.360 --> 40:13.600
Maybe it results problems a little faster, too.

40:13.600 --> 40:19.440
How did you ever switch from the kitchen into what you're doing now? Those seem, on the

40:19.440 --> 40:25.200
surface, like very different things, despite the similarities and how one is really a gift

40:25.200 --> 40:28.160
to the other, but how did that transition ever happen for you?

40:28.160 --> 40:36.480
Taking a step back. I got to a point where my knees hurt, my back hurt. I was doing 18-hour

40:36.480 --> 40:41.600
days, and I was exhausted. I started looking around. I was like, I'm not going to be Anthony

40:41.600 --> 40:47.040
Bourdain. I'm not going to be Jamie Oliver. I'm not going on Food Network, and it doesn't

40:47.040 --> 40:55.200
look like I'm going to get my own restaurant anytime soon. So, am I ready to do this for

40:55.200 --> 41:01.520
another 20, 30 years, working on the line, possibly running a kitchen, but never running

41:01.520 --> 41:08.320
the restaurant? And I decided I didn't want to do it. It just became that simple of like,

41:08.320 --> 41:13.120
I don't want to do this. I didn't have a college degree. I have a high school diploma, and

41:13.120 --> 41:18.880
that's it. So, I was talking with a friend, and he said, well, you ought to take a shot

41:18.880 --> 41:24.240
at Linux. Why? I don't know. I know how to use a computer. He's like, yeah, you know

41:24.240 --> 41:29.280
more than most people. You can turn it on. It's a really low bar to set. He's like, and

41:29.280 --> 41:35.840
you can read. So, here, and he gave me this like tome of a book. It was a thousand-page

41:35.840 --> 41:38.400
book called the Linux Bible.

41:38.400 --> 41:40.400
It sounds appropriate as a first one.

41:40.400 --> 41:46.080
Yeah, that's what he gave me. He's like, here, take this. Go and learn it. Where do I start?

41:46.080 --> 41:52.320
He's like, start on page one and read through the book. Okay. So, I start out with that,

41:52.320 --> 41:58.480
and then there was a group here in San Antonio called the Open Cloud Academy who were doing,

41:59.040 --> 42:05.680
it was like a 10-week bootcamp where you go through, you learn the basic LAMP stack, Linux,

42:05.680 --> 42:14.080
Apache, MySQL, or MySQL, depending on your preference, and PHP. At the end of it, really,

42:14.080 --> 42:17.680
when I look back, I'm like, wow, of all the things I've learned, that should have taken

42:17.680 --> 42:24.560
me like three days, not 10 weeks. But knowing very little, it was great because I got to

42:24.560 --> 42:31.680
meet people and interact. And at the end of it, we were told everybody who goes through

42:31.680 --> 42:35.920
the program and you had to pay for it. That's the other big thing. It did cost money. So, it wasn't

42:35.920 --> 42:41.120
free. So, you really wanted to apply yourself. But at the end of it, everybody would be offered the

42:41.120 --> 42:44.640
opportunity to interview with a major hosting company.

42:44.640 --> 42:46.720
That's worth the money alone sometimes.

42:46.720 --> 42:52.080
Yeah. And this is when my competitive brain kicks in because I'm like, okay, there's a class of 20.

42:53.200 --> 42:59.120
The class who did this before us, there were 20 there. Five got hired. All right. So, I have a

42:59.120 --> 43:06.560
one in four shot. I've got to figure out who are the 15 people I can beat. And it just became that.

43:06.560 --> 43:11.360
I was like, all right, I'm going to push through. How do you outrun a lion? All you got to do is

43:11.360 --> 43:18.080
be faster than the slowest guy. That was all I was going for. I don't want to be number 15.

43:18.800 --> 43:26.080
I will take number 16. I'll be that high. That's fine. I'll be the dumbest one of the smart group,

43:26.080 --> 43:31.680
but I'm getting hired. We get our RHCSA certification. So, the system admin.

43:32.400 --> 43:38.560
And I go through the interview process and I find out it's probably two years later. So,

43:38.560 --> 43:43.680
two years after getting hired, I run into some of the people who had interviewed me and they're like,

43:43.680 --> 43:50.000
yeah, you weren't hired for your skill. You were hired because you were just weird enough

43:50.000 --> 43:54.480
that we thought you'd be interesting to keep around. All right. I'll take it.

43:54.480 --> 43:57.440
That's sort of a backhanded compliment, right?

43:58.640 --> 44:04.000
And so from that, I was like, all right, you know, I did sysad work, sysadmin work for

44:05.440 --> 44:11.520
two years. And then I went on to work in OpenStack deployments. So, converting

44:12.240 --> 44:18.000
major companies data centers, their existing hardware into cloud servers. And I did that

44:18.000 --> 44:24.800
for two years. And then just on a lark, I was like, you know, why not shoot for the big leagues?

44:24.800 --> 44:31.840
Linux Academy is hiring. Let's see if they'd give me a job running their newly designed support

44:31.840 --> 44:38.000
team. Oddly enough, I got picked up for about the same reason. We thought you were crazy enough to

44:38.000 --> 44:43.520
build this. You can never really predict that kind of stuff. Like you had a friend who had enough

44:43.520 --> 44:51.120
clarity and was generous enough to sort of hand you some pretty critical pieces of information

44:51.120 --> 44:55.200
and some support at a time when, you know, it sounds like that really turned your life around

44:55.200 --> 45:02.000
in a or at least switched directions. That took you to where you are here. How could you have ever

45:02.000 --> 45:07.680
predicted that? But it's those people that come into our lives for small moments and give us,

45:07.680 --> 45:11.520
you know, the Linux hint. And then we just get hooked from there.

45:11.520 --> 45:19.200
And I wanted to ask you if you have an ask of our community, if you want them to go see something,

45:19.200 --> 45:23.600
find something, learn about something and go try something. Is there anything you'd like to throw

45:23.600 --> 45:28.320
out there? In general, if you have an issue, if you have a concern, if you have a problem,

45:29.360 --> 45:35.760
don't sit on it. Talk, get it out there. The only way for people to help you solve the problem

45:36.320 --> 45:40.640
is if they know you have one. That sounds pretty important. You got to raise your voice

45:40.640 --> 45:47.840
before anybody even knows that you need some help. I would assume that fits both in the support realm

45:48.720 --> 45:51.760
and the bug tracking realm, but also just in life in general.

45:52.400 --> 45:56.560
Yeah. I mean, if you hear that somebody has a problem and they've raised a concern,

45:57.840 --> 46:05.200
don't shut them out. You know, at least give it the time and energy to look at it and establish

46:05.200 --> 46:11.040
where the actual problem exists. Because sometimes you might hear, oh, you know, the lights aren't

46:11.040 --> 46:16.000
working. Was it the lights aren't working or there's no power or is there no power because

46:16.000 --> 46:20.880
you didn't pay the bill? You know, run it down a bit, figure out where the real problem is. Don't

46:20.880 --> 46:25.440
just start treating symptoms. So doing some investigation is, sounds like it's pretty

46:25.440 --> 46:32.880
essential. Yes. Well, if you wanted to send people where they can say hi or that kind of thing,

46:32.880 --> 46:41.040
where would you send people? You can find me on Twitter. I am at netchromancer, N E T,

46:41.040 --> 46:47.920
chromancer, as in I revive dead connections. That sounds like a perfect place to send people.

46:50.400 --> 46:56.880
Well, thank you so much for your time. It's been a real pleasure and I've loved all these topics. So

46:56.880 --> 47:03.040
thanks for chatting and hopefully we get to meet in person. I know you've been at Linux Fest in

47:03.040 --> 47:09.200
the past, so hope maybe you might be there this year. I don't know. Or otherwise we'll see each

47:09.200 --> 47:14.320
other somewhere. Yeah, I'm all over the place. I'll in fact be, if anybody's out there, going to

47:14.880 --> 47:20.560
B-Sides Bryan College Station coming up in a couple of weeks and I'll be out at Scale in March

47:20.560 --> 47:25.840
as well. Nice. So people can find you there. That's great. Well, thank you so much again and

47:25.840 --> 47:27.840
thanks for your time.
