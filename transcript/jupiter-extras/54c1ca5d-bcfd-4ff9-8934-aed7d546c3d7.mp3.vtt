00:00.000 --> 00:16.400
Well, hello, everyone. This is Brunch with Brent. I'm joined today by Jim Salter. Jim,

00:16.400 --> 00:17.880
thanks for joining me. How are you doing?

00:17.880 --> 00:19.560
Doing good, Brent. How about you?

00:19.560 --> 00:23.880
I'm doing pretty well. It's such a treat for me to have you on because you and I haven't

00:23.880 --> 00:28.280
necessarily had the chance to connect that much, even though we're both doing some pretty

00:28.280 --> 00:34.240
cool Jupyter broadcasting content on a regular basis. But I wanted to give some people a

00:34.240 --> 00:40.640
little bit of a background on some of what you do. Many will know you as a tech reporter

00:40.640 --> 00:47.440
at Ars Technica. Most will know you probably as being co-host of TechSnap with Wes. You've

00:47.440 --> 00:50.520
been doing that for a little while now, haven't you?

00:50.520 --> 00:55.120
I think we're closing in on a year. I'm not sure. I did several as a guest before they

00:55.120 --> 00:57.920
brought me on, so it gets a little hazy.

00:57.920 --> 01:02.200
But has that deep kind of thinking always been a part of you, or is it something you've

01:02.200 --> 01:04.400
developed out of necessity?

01:04.400 --> 01:11.320
I think that's pretty much always been me. I was the kid that before the internet would

01:11.320 --> 01:16.600
literally just start reading random things out of Encyclopedia Britannica and going from

01:16.600 --> 01:23.760
volume to volume and to see that, to see the other. I want to absorb information, and I

01:23.760 --> 01:30.960
want to think about what you can do with it and what it really means and new things you

01:30.960 --> 01:33.080
might be able to do.

01:33.080 --> 01:38.640
Understanding a concept deeply allows you to interact with it in a way that allows you

01:38.640 --> 01:46.600
to be more creative. I've noticed that certainly, because I tend to be quite slow and deep as

01:46.600 --> 01:53.040
well when I commit to learning something. And I've noticed that it allows me to kind

01:53.040 --> 02:00.040
of make all these connections that I wouldn't if I didn't give it that time. Do you find

02:00.040 --> 02:06.040
that too? Like connecting a whole bunch of different ideas is what keeps you deep diving?

02:06.040 --> 02:11.280
So there's like a really seminal moment in my own personal career progression, right?

02:11.280 --> 02:17.520
So I'm about to turn 48 years old, so obviously there was no internet when I was a kid. Some

02:17.520 --> 02:23.920
people had computers at home, but that wasn't particularly common either. I was kind of

02:23.920 --> 02:27.560
lucky that way, and a lot of people didn't necessarily believe yet that computers were

02:27.560 --> 02:31.440
ever really going to matter much to most people, as weird as that might seem now.

02:31.440 --> 02:32.880
It does, yeah.

02:32.880 --> 02:39.240
But I had been, I mean my hello world was at like age, I don't know, maybe six on a

02:39.240 --> 02:44.200
trash 80. So it didn't take me that long to figure out that I thought computers were

02:44.200 --> 02:50.520
seriously cool. And when I discovered that there was a job, a computer programmer, and

02:50.520 --> 02:56.040
it paid well, I'm like, well, this is obviously going to be my life. And it didn't necessarily

02:56.040 --> 03:00.280
work out all that cleanly.

03:00.280 --> 03:01.640
Life never does, right?

03:01.640 --> 03:09.480
No, it doesn't. But one way or another, I assumed for a good long time that my life

03:09.480 --> 03:17.200
is going to be about writing code and programming computers. But I enlisted in the Navy at age

03:17.200 --> 03:23.760
17, don't recommend, not a good idea. And I thought that I was going into a real high

03:23.760 --> 03:29.760
tech field. I enlisted to be a reactor operator and discovered to my great dismay that that's

03:29.760 --> 03:32.480
not really this amazing high tech thing.

03:32.480 --> 03:37.660
I don't know if you know this, but a nuclear reactor is basically a giant Zippo water.

03:37.660 --> 03:43.440
It gets hot and it boils water. You run steam turbines with that. The same way you would

03:43.440 --> 03:48.160
have it with a coal boiler and a black gang in the late 1800s. You know, they called them

03:48.160 --> 03:52.640
black gangs because all the coal dust and they were literally shoveling chunks of rock

03:52.640 --> 03:59.040
into a fire. That's what a reactor does. And I don't want to get too deep into my deeply

03:59.040 --> 04:04.920
weird Navy career, but like even that didn't end up sticking. And I wound up a whole tech,

04:04.920 --> 04:10.320
which basically means like a welder with some other stuff thrown in and that didn't actually

04:10.320 --> 04:13.080
suit me, but that was my rate and there was no getting around it.

04:13.080 --> 04:23.600
So then I end up in a repair planning department on a large ship and they had IBM PCs in there.

04:23.600 --> 04:28.320
Several of them that they would plan jobs on. The PCs weren't networked. You know,

04:28.320 --> 04:32.880
they were just individual, not connected to any network at all type stuff up on it and

04:32.880 --> 04:39.000
be done. And they ended up needing a pretty massive upgrade that they had no idea how

04:39.000 --> 04:44.880
to accomplish because the repair manual for the Navy had upgraded. It went from the repair

04:44.880 --> 04:50.480
manual mark one to the repair manual mark two. And the folks, the Frank Cable had been

04:50.480 --> 04:58.800
provided this program that somebody had written at the behest and you know, with the money

04:58.800 --> 05:04.640
invested of the Navy that would just barely allow you to design a repair job according

05:04.640 --> 05:09.720
to the repair manual mark one. But this thing, I mean it was terrible. It was like a fill

05:09.720 --> 05:16.220
in the blank kind of a thing. You couldn't copy and paste. You couldn't even non-destructively

05:16.220 --> 05:23.920
backspace. It was horrible and there was absolutely no way to make this limited thing, you know,

05:23.920 --> 05:28.460
output a job that was planned according to the repair manual mark two.

05:28.460 --> 05:32.140
So the repair department is flummoxed. Like they're starting to get yelled at because

05:32.140 --> 05:36.400
their repair jobs aren't compliant with the latest regulation. But they're like, you know,

05:36.400 --> 05:42.000
we can't because our tools only allow us to do the mark one stuff. And the word gets around

05:42.000 --> 05:45.960
is the word, you know, tends to that, you know, this guy, Petty Officer Salter, he's

05:45.960 --> 05:52.000
real good with computer. And so at some point without, you know, no longer knowing what

05:52.000 --> 05:57.400
the hell else to do, these folks asked me, they're like, so if we asked you to, could

05:57.400 --> 06:03.640
you write a program like this one that would allow us to, you know, design these jobs in

06:03.640 --> 06:09.240
accordance with the brand manual mark two? And I took a very careful look at it and I

06:09.240 --> 06:18.080
thought for a day about my answer and I told them the next day, I can, but I shouldn't.

06:18.080 --> 06:23.400
Here's what we should do instead. And I got them on board with a plan instead to use the

06:23.400 --> 06:28.320
MS-DOS version of WordPerfect. I think it was 5.1. And I said, you know, look, we can

06:28.320 --> 06:34.440
design these jobs in WordPerfect. You have all the modern features of writing a document.

06:34.440 --> 06:39.040
You do it basically free form, but you adhere to what you're supposed to do. And I said,

06:39.040 --> 06:44.720
you know, then further, we have a local network file server that everybody's connected to

06:44.720 --> 06:50.840
and we have two drives that everybody can access. We have a working drive that everybody

06:50.840 --> 06:55.200
can read and write to. And then we have an approved job drive. So every time a job has

06:55.200 --> 07:00.320
been done being designed and it's been approved and it's ready to go, then the shop supervisor

07:00.320 --> 07:05.760
copies that over to the approved drive that everybody can read, but nobody but the supervisor

07:05.760 --> 07:11.400
is able to write to. And they know I can copy an old job out of that, know that everything

07:11.400 --> 07:17.480
in that is completely kosher, and I can edit that and adapt it to a new job that's similar.

07:17.480 --> 07:22.940
This basically tripled shop throughput. It allowed them to get jobs done far quicker,

07:22.940 --> 07:26.760
you know, the design phase, than they had been able to do with the old system, as well

07:26.760 --> 07:31.520
as, you know, do it in accordance with the repair manual mark one. And I remember thinking

07:31.520 --> 07:35.420
to myself, you know, after the dust had settled and I had, you know, designed this network

07:35.420 --> 07:40.400
with no kidding, you know, coax in between the machines, you know, old 10 base teeth

07:40.400 --> 07:46.360
in that all this kind of thing. And we, you know, we'd had a month or two and I saw how

07:46.360 --> 07:53.040
well everything was working. Anyway, I remember very specifically thinking to myself, this,

07:53.040 --> 07:57.920
this is how you get things done. You don't just sit down and write a program. Anytime

07:57.920 --> 08:01.960
there's something you want to do, you need to have an awareness of what software is out

08:01.960 --> 08:08.280
there already and what the actual best way to deal with your real workflow is. And it's

08:08.280 --> 08:12.760
not usually going to be right in code from scratch. So that was basically the day that

08:12.760 --> 08:19.040
I knew. No, my ideal job was not computer programmer. It was a sad man.

08:19.040 --> 08:25.460
That also sounds like the beginnings of the, cause I know you're a big open source fan

08:25.460 --> 08:30.840
and it sounds to me like just the way you approached that particular problem took some

08:30.840 --> 08:36.960
of those ideas in there. I don't know if you knew open source at that time, but it sounds

08:36.960 --> 08:40.640
to me like it was like, okay, well some of these tools already exist. Why are we trying

08:40.640 --> 08:46.720
to rewrite them? Maybe we can just implement them in a different way that solves our problems

08:46.720 --> 08:48.880
in the present and also in the future.

08:48.880 --> 08:56.200
It's definitely an adjacent thought process, but I was not aware of open source then. Open

08:56.200 --> 09:02.640
source existed, but not very many people really had it on their radar at this point. This

09:02.640 --> 09:09.600
would have been, I want to say like 1992, maybe 1993. It was definitely not 94.

09:09.600 --> 09:11.120
Yeah, right.

09:11.120 --> 09:18.840
So I wasn't aware of open source. I was familiar with the older, like there were programs that

09:18.840 --> 09:24.080
were in the public domain or then later on there was shareware. Open source hadn't reared

09:24.080 --> 09:28.840
its head to me personally yet. I do know that when a few years later I did discover open

09:28.840 --> 09:36.000
source when I was a civilian again in the mid to late nineties, very rapidly I was like,

09:36.000 --> 09:40.060
this is important. This really means something.

09:40.060 --> 09:49.360
Because the difference between I have to go get approval from a boss to get say Photoshop

09:49.360 --> 09:55.760
or Microsoft Office or whatever, not only for myself, but for any other people that

09:55.760 --> 10:02.560
I want to enable to do something as a computer person, that's frequently a lot harder than

10:02.560 --> 10:07.120
teaching the people or enabling them or getting the thing done, right?

10:07.120 --> 10:11.760
That's why you have so many shadow IT departments where people just surreptitiously do whatever.

10:11.760 --> 10:17.640
But I'm like, when you've got a program, like say compare GIMP to Photoshop, there

10:17.640 --> 10:23.240
are things that Photoshop does considerably better than GIMP, but GIMP is really important

10:23.240 --> 10:28.840
even when it's not as good as Photoshop because it's accessible to everybody. When you can

10:28.840 --> 10:34.960
do the same thing in both programs and you know how to do the same thing in both programs,

10:34.960 --> 10:38.920
that knowledge in GIMP is really important because you can take it with you anywhere

10:38.920 --> 10:43.360
and you can use it anywhere. You don't have to get somebody else's approval to use it.

10:43.360 --> 10:47.940
You don't have to get somebody else's approval to teach somebody else how to use it. It's

10:47.940 --> 10:53.920
just like the whole freaking human race has this thing now and that's amazing.

10:53.920 --> 11:01.320
Yeah. And lowering that barrier of entry is so important for like future creativity and

11:01.320 --> 11:07.100
future sort of thought processes too in someone, especially young people, but anybody who's

11:07.100 --> 11:08.600
learning something new, right?

11:08.600 --> 11:12.880
Yeah, it is. And you know, I mean, there are other awesome things about open source and

11:12.880 --> 11:18.680
I bought onto all of those pretty early as well. You know, once I encountered the concept

11:18.680 --> 11:23.100
of, you know, like the BSDs and I learned about how, you know, at the time the largest

11:23.100 --> 11:28.080
website in the world or the most heavily trafficked, you know, ftp.cdrom.com, I was like, you know,

11:28.080 --> 11:31.800
this is running on commodity desktop machines, running a free operating system and it's

11:31.800 --> 11:38.160
literally serving more traffic than anything in the world. I'm like, okay, I need some

11:38.160 --> 11:39.160
of that.

11:39.160 --> 11:40.560
There must be something here, right?

11:40.560 --> 11:44.160
Yeah. So, you know, then when I read, you know, from the other side of the open source

11:44.160 --> 11:49.480
camp, Eric S. Raymond's, The Cathedral and the Bazaar, you know, his arguments about

11:49.480 --> 11:54.680
how open source produced better code, you know, because of the greater visibility and,

11:54.680 --> 11:59.880
you know, peer review and this and that and the other, I was perfectly willing to believe

11:59.880 --> 12:04.940
and buy into all that. And, you know, I still do. I think it's very true. I also have the

12:04.940 --> 12:12.920
experience of having written proprietary code for purpose myself versus whether it's starting

12:12.920 --> 12:19.200
out to write open source code or converting, you know, what had been a proprietary project,

12:19.200 --> 12:24.120
you know, into something open source and, and, you know, thinking even before anybody

12:24.120 --> 12:29.440
else says anything, just to myself realizing people are going to see this crap I wrote.

12:29.440 --> 12:36.480
It needs to be professional. It needs to be good. Just it works, you know, with the thing

12:36.480 --> 12:43.000
that you do it for that day is not good enough. And, um, I think it's really hard to get that

12:43.000 --> 12:49.160
without open source, you know, I mean you can, you can Institute code reviews within a company

12:49.160 --> 12:55.320
for proprietary code, of course, but I don't really see how over the course of time you

12:55.320 --> 13:00.200
don't eventually end up having standard slip a little bit and they may not get all the

13:00.200 --> 13:04.040
way down to like, well, this is good enough for me. It's the thing I do and it, you know,

13:04.040 --> 13:08.000
doesn't really break off enough to piss me off. Like you can, you can get north of that,

13:08.000 --> 13:12.920
but I don't see how you keep from slipping down to the point where you have this little

13:12.920 --> 13:16.960
insular community and well, it just needs to be good enough for this little insular

13:16.960 --> 13:21.700
community standards. You don't have to be worried that literally anybody in the world

13:21.700 --> 13:26.880
can take a look at this thing that you did that granted it works, but they're like, what

13:26.880 --> 13:28.200
did you do?

13:28.200 --> 13:33.040
I think some of the coolest things that happen with open source is when someone takes a project

13:33.040 --> 13:40.800
and uses it in a completely different way than originally intended and yet still a plausible

13:40.800 --> 13:44.840
application, right? And like perhaps when you wrote the code, you had a certain intention,

13:44.840 --> 13:49.760
but could never imagine its other uses. And how much of a gift is that?

13:49.760 --> 13:54.460
That is a definite gift. Um, you know, that's also, again, that's, that's one of those things

13:54.460 --> 14:00.840
that leads you to writing higher quality code. When you, you really realize people are liable

14:00.840 --> 14:05.880
to use this in ways that I didn't intend. It forces you to write a lot more defensively

14:05.880 --> 14:13.760
and consider a lot more use cases. And sometimes that consideration can lead you to avoid errors

14:13.760 --> 14:18.400
and what would have been a lot of unnecessary rework because you're thinking from the start

14:18.400 --> 14:24.600
with like, okay, how do I make this the most broadly functional and not just functional

14:24.600 --> 14:29.080
in this one specific use case that I have for it?

14:29.080 --> 14:34.080
So what about the challenges then of taking that approach? I would imagine there are some

14:34.080 --> 14:40.400
like that sounds like perhaps more work or more intentional work. What would you say

14:40.400 --> 14:42.360
are the, are the downsides if any?

14:42.360 --> 14:49.960
I don't think there are downsides. I mean, it's, it's quote more work unquote, but you

14:49.960 --> 14:55.000
know, that's like saying, yeah, it's, it's more work to do a job right than to do it,

14:55.000 --> 15:01.400
you know, crappy and half ass. So it's just, it's forcing you to do it right. That's more

15:01.400 --> 15:06.480
work than having done it half ass, but you didn't half ass it. So.

15:06.480 --> 15:14.340
And so take us back to when you are on that ship. Um, like that was clearly a changing

15:14.340 --> 15:18.040
moment for you, but how did things progress for you from there?

15:18.040 --> 15:23.060
That's kind of a rough story. So this was the Navy, um, in the early to mid nineties

15:23.060 --> 15:29.240
post tail hook era. And I'm still very young. And to understand some of it, you have to

15:29.240 --> 15:33.600
understand a little bit of background on like how the Navy works and specific rates work

15:33.600 --> 15:39.280
in the Navy. So I went in as a reactor operator, which the base rate to that as ET electronics

15:39.280 --> 15:45.000
technician, right? And the reason that I was no longer a reactor operator, it boils down

15:45.000 --> 15:50.280
to I pissed off the wrong people. Don't get me wrong. I, I truly meant well and I was

15:50.280 --> 15:57.280
a very earnest person as a young man. Like I wanted to do the right thing as a, as a

15:57.280 --> 16:03.840
person, as a soldier for the Navy, as a whole, my unit, the whole mind, but I wanted to have

16:03.840 --> 16:07.960
a little bit more input into that process than you're really supposed to have is, you

16:07.960 --> 16:15.200
know, like a 19 year old enlisted dude. And that didn't fly. And, um, I disagreed with

16:15.200 --> 16:20.800
some of the things that some of the brass were doing in the, uh, in the prototype, the

16:20.800 --> 16:27.960
reactor prototype that, um, I was completing my two year Naval nuclear power training pipeline

16:27.960 --> 16:32.000
in. And as a result of that, they found a way to get me out of the program to make a

16:32.000 --> 16:36.680
long story short. And I assumed, okay, well I'm going to go to the fleet as an electronics

16:36.680 --> 16:41.440
technician, but that's okay. I'll be out of most of this politics that will probably

16:41.440 --> 16:45.640
suit me better. It'll be electronics. My dad was a broadcast engineer and I always, you

16:45.640 --> 16:49.560
know, like really dug the hole, like, you know, he's over there soldering on circuit

16:49.560 --> 16:52.760
boards and whatever. So that's going to be me now. And I had that a school as part of

16:52.760 --> 16:57.840
my training, so it's going to be great. It'll be fine. But the Navy decided to cross rate

16:57.840 --> 17:02.440
me involuntarily to whole tech, which like I said, is mostly welder. It's a very blue

17:02.440 --> 17:10.200
collar thing. And, um, advancement in the enlisted Navy is based first and foremost

17:10.200 --> 17:16.160
on how well you take written tests. So what do you think? Does the typical welder do a

17:16.160 --> 17:21.200
great job taking written examinations? I would imagine that's not their forte. It is not

17:21.200 --> 17:27.640
their forte. Um, it was my forte, which is, you know, the majority of the reason why at

17:27.640 --> 17:33.400
not quite 20 years old, I was an E five. So that's the rate that was the rank that I got

17:33.400 --> 17:37.120
cross rated into as a whole tech. And I went to a whole tech a school, you know, which

17:37.120 --> 17:43.720
is all of like seven weeks of, you know, learned to weld. And then I'm, you know, unleashed

17:43.720 --> 17:50.000
on the fleet as an E five, you know, theoretically whole tech, but a real HD two, you know, whole

17:50.000 --> 17:55.440
tech second class, that's E five, a real HD two typically started welding, uh, when they

17:55.440 --> 18:00.020
were in high school or junior high school was already really good at it before they

18:00.020 --> 18:05.880
ever joined the Navy. Uh, and then because they're not typically good at all at written

18:05.880 --> 18:10.960
examinations, they'll end up having to retake the tests and, you know, get more points just

18:10.960 --> 18:14.400
for time and service to the point that there probably won't be 30 by the time they hit

18:14.400 --> 18:20.900
E five, but they're pushing 30. So now here's me. I literally just had my 20th birthday

18:20.900 --> 18:27.420
in a school and you know, I'm, I'm an HT two and that does not fly with whole tech.

18:27.420 --> 18:32.400
So that's what gets me into the, you know, the shop with all the computers in it, which

18:32.400 --> 18:37.320
was whole techs and machinist mates, but there's computers here. That's also why finally getting

18:37.320 --> 18:41.320
to answering your, your, your real question, you know, how did things go from there? So

18:41.320 --> 18:46.620
I did this awesome thing and you know, made the, the, uh, planning and repair shop way

18:46.620 --> 18:51.500
more efficient. How'd that go for me? And the answer is I got absolutely terrible performance

18:51.500 --> 18:56.840
valuations because although I had done this great thing with the computers, that wasn't

18:56.840 --> 19:00.320
my job and I wasn't much of a whole tech.

19:00.320 --> 19:07.600
Oh, and so do you feel like that is a problem with such hierarchical structures of that

19:07.600 --> 19:12.960
sort? Is that if you didn't do the specific thing you were designed to do, even though

19:12.960 --> 19:16.800
it was for the greater good that it's seen as a negative?

19:16.800 --> 19:23.820
I think that's a problem that a lot of really capable people have and any, I'm not trying

19:23.820 --> 19:29.120
to puff myself up, but a lot of the people who do go on to change the world, they're

19:29.120 --> 19:34.160
so frequently or, you know, like college dropouts or whatever. I think the reason for that is

19:34.160 --> 19:39.760
that really capable people frequently don't fit well in organizations. You know, organizations

19:39.760 --> 19:45.080
are specifically trying to avoid needing really unusual people because they want to be able

19:45.080 --> 19:50.840
to replace personnel as they retire or leave for a different job or whatever.

19:50.840 --> 19:57.120
So when you have somebody who's really capable, who shows up, if you're running that organization,

19:57.120 --> 20:01.120
if you're an exceptional leader, maybe you can figure out something great to do with

20:01.120 --> 20:08.260
that person and you can figure out kind of a transition in and a transition out where

20:08.260 --> 20:14.960
you use this exceptional person to do an exceptional thing that lasts and can be carried on, you

20:14.960 --> 20:19.000
know, by the people that you can find day in and day out.

20:19.000 --> 20:24.720
If you're not an exceptional leader, then one of two things happens. Either that person

20:24.720 --> 20:30.480
ends up making those changes anyway, but doing it, you know, outside the scope of the organization

20:30.480 --> 20:35.160
and they basically become, I mean, they're kind of a cancer. You know, you ever work

20:35.160 --> 20:40.600
someplace where you're like, oh, you know, you got to talk to Joe back in the back. Like

20:40.600 --> 20:44.000
he's the only one that knows how to do, you know, half these things.

20:44.000 --> 20:49.840
Well, so on the one hand, Joe's probably a really capable person, but on the other hand,

20:49.840 --> 20:53.840
he's cancer to that organization because what happens when Joe's out sick or what happens

20:53.840 --> 20:59.860
when Joe retires or dies or moves on or whatever, the organization's kind of screwed, right?

20:59.860 --> 21:06.440
So you either end up with a Joe and, you know, your people don't really know how to get the

21:06.440 --> 21:11.940
mission accomplished. Or, you know, if again, you know, you're not the great leader and

21:11.940 --> 21:17.000
you don't know what to do with a Joe, Joe just ends up getting fired. You know, you

21:17.000 --> 21:23.400
yell at him all the time. You, you piss him off. Maybe you fire him, maybe he quits, but

21:23.400 --> 21:27.160
you know, it doesn't work. You didn't find a place for Joe in your organization because

21:27.160 --> 21:33.000
there's this like inherent mismatch, right? Yeah. One of you is really bad for the other.

21:33.000 --> 21:37.500
So moving it back to me, I mentioned, you know, I got, uh, the worst eval of my Navy

21:37.500 --> 21:44.200
career immediately after tripling the throughput of this shop. Wow. You want to hear about

21:44.200 --> 21:49.680
the best eval I got in my Navy career? I could just imagine, I'm going to guess at it probably

21:49.680 --> 21:54.800
when you just didn't do very much and wasn't very inspired or. Oh, it is so much more colorful

21:54.800 --> 22:00.240
than that Brent. Oh, please give it to me. So, uh, you know, fast forward a couple of

22:00.240 --> 22:06.020
years and I'm no longer stationed on board Frank Cable. Um, now I'm on the Charleston

22:06.020 --> 22:11.160
Naval base, uh, and the repair division of SEMA, the shore intermediate maintenance activity.

22:11.160 --> 22:15.640
I'm still fixing boats, but now I'm doing it from a building rather than another boat.

22:15.640 --> 22:23.520
And I end up in their, um, automated reports and retrieval system maintenance document

22:23.520 --> 22:29.880
collection. So the acronym doesn't matter. What really matters is what the job of ours

22:29.880 --> 22:36.240
Medco was is, uh, everybody's using these AT&T 3B2 mini computers. Uh, actually they're

22:36.240 --> 22:39.480
not using the mini computer directly. They've got dumb terminals in every shop and on the

22:39.480 --> 22:45.400
dumb terminal, they have an application that they log in, uh, all the, the personnel hours

22:45.400 --> 22:50.600
that were worked on these repair jobs for each shop. Right? So, uh, maybe you got three

22:50.600 --> 22:57.560
E4s and an E5, uh, your shop will be budgeted a certain amount of personnel hours and you

22:57.560 --> 23:01.760
document how you spent them, whether it was on this job or that job or the other job or

23:01.760 --> 23:07.420
training or they took leave. You, you, you enter all this stuff in. So this goes to ours

23:07.420 --> 23:14.000
Medco and ours Medco's job is to analyze this and look for trends, either good or bad,

23:14.000 --> 23:19.900
which ultimately usually just turns into an exercise of the higher ups who direct ours

23:19.900 --> 23:25.480
Medco tell us, look for this particular statistic and we will come down like the hammer of God

23:25.480 --> 23:30.320
on anybody that has too high a number on that statistic. Okay. You remember the, the cartoon

23:30.320 --> 23:33.720
way back in the day, Bugs Bunny with the dam and like he keeps sticking his finger in the

23:33.720 --> 23:38.880
hole and then another hole pops open and the water comes out of there. Yeah. So, I mean,

23:38.880 --> 23:42.320
this is what goes on, right? Like, you know, you've got your bad stat of the week. So all

23:42.320 --> 23:47.040
the shops lie about that bad stat of the week because they've heard which one it is. Um,

23:47.040 --> 23:52.200
and meanwhile they camouflage, you know, all the evidence of not a whole lot of efficiency

23:52.200 --> 23:58.280
going on in something else. So we got all this stuff going on. Uh, the brass doesn't

23:58.280 --> 24:03.880
really have much of any genuine idea of how efficient all the shops are, but everybody's

24:03.880 --> 24:07.720
doing all this active stuff and rah, rah, rah, I'm doing my part to, you know, make

24:07.720 --> 24:14.920
sure everything's efficient. So part of this job, uh, was we would have to take these reports

24:14.920 --> 24:20.560
that were printed out on, you know, wide format, uh, tractor feeds paper, you know, the old

24:20.560 --> 24:25.200
school like alternating green and white rows. Um, all this stuff would be physically printed

24:25.200 --> 24:33.600
out from the 3B2 and in order to analyze it, we would then have to type it back in to a

24:33.600 --> 24:44.840
different application on the same dumb terminal connected to the same 3B2. Oh no. Yeah, it

24:44.840 --> 24:50.120
was fabulous. Um, so, so, you know, we're, we're doing this as what it boils down to.

24:50.120 --> 24:54.800
Um, and you do this at night. Uh, it's like a swing shift, you know, after the normal

24:54.800 --> 24:57.620
working hours are done for all the shops, you get all their time for the day and you

24:57.620 --> 25:02.560
enter their time in one night I'm working with this guy, petty officer Baron. He's also

25:02.560 --> 25:09.680
a second class and an E5 and he's on his way out of the Navy in theory, um, on a, a medical

25:09.680 --> 25:16.720
discharge because his shoulder got hurt. And, uh, Baron was one of these sailors who you

25:16.720 --> 25:23.800
have to demonstrate to him that he has to do something or there will be bad consequences

25:23.800 --> 25:26.520
or he's not going to do it. He's not going to take your word for it. There's going to

25:26.520 --> 25:30.560
be bad consequences. You know, you're going to have to go through the whole cycle with

25:30.560 --> 25:35.400
this guy. So putting him on swing shift with another junior enlisted person and no other

25:35.400 --> 25:42.720
supervision is not the best answer. And, uh, everybody else has left. It's like five o'clock.

25:42.720 --> 25:47.320
Um, people have only been gone for like half an hour. We've got another three, four hours

25:47.320 --> 25:51.600
worth of work, you know, for the two of us together to get done before we can be done

25:51.600 --> 25:56.960
and go home. And, uh, Baron just looks at me and says, well, that's it. I'm done, man.

25:56.960 --> 26:04.000
You look, I'm out. And I'm like, what? No, you're not. You got to do your half of this

26:04.000 --> 26:10.360
crap. Um, and, uh, so Baron just tries to head for the door and, uh, I have already

26:10.360 --> 26:15.880
informed him. Yes, I will physically prevent him from leaving. So we get in a knock down

26:15.880 --> 26:23.960
drag out fight. This is not a fist fight. Nobody threw a punch, but I will say that

26:23.960 --> 26:29.280
I left a dent in the office coffee maker, the exact size and shape of his skull. And

26:29.280 --> 26:33.800
it finally ended up, uh, I will admit he was bigger than, than I was. And, uh, it ended

26:33.800 --> 26:38.880
up with him bending me backwards over a table with one arm behind me and a hammer lock.

26:38.880 --> 26:42.860
And as his thumb went down toward my eyeball, I told him, if you touch my eye, you're going

26:42.860 --> 26:48.840
to have to kill me. And then he let go. And we sat there just like coffin for a few minutes.

26:48.840 --> 26:53.000
Like, have you ever really gotten in a hard fight for awhile? And like, you're just coughing

26:53.000 --> 26:57.120
afterward because you've been exerting yourself. Yeah. So it's that. Wow. So I was a little

26:57.120 --> 27:01.820
bit, I was in considerably better shape than he was. So I was like recovered quicker than

27:01.820 --> 27:05.920
he was. Um, he still kind of, you know, breathing heavy and coughing and he said, all right,

27:05.920 --> 27:09.920
well I'm out of here. And I said, no, you're not. And he's like, what are you talking about?

27:09.920 --> 27:18.960
I won the fight. I said, you ready to do it again? Man, F you Salter. And so we finished

27:18.960 --> 27:26.400
out the night, but you know, in the course of this like 15 minute, uh, barrage of physically

27:26.400 --> 27:30.280
throwing each other around the office, we have shredded like half the paperwork, you

27:30.280 --> 27:35.040
know, under the wheels of the rolling chairs. Like I said, I left a clearly skull shaped

27:35.040 --> 27:40.520
dent in the coffee maker. Um, you know, and you can imagine the rest of the damage, although

27:40.520 --> 27:47.340
we didn't break any equipment to the point of unusability, but it's very obvious. Some,

27:47.340 --> 27:53.240
some crap has gone down the next morning. And, uh, when I roll in at, uh, you know,

27:53.240 --> 27:58.960
about, uh, noon, because again, I'm working the swing shift doing this stuff. Uh, the,

27:58.960 --> 28:03.160
the chief petty officer who also was my chief on board the Frank cable and gave me the terrible,

28:03.160 --> 28:07.860
you know, evaluation there. Oh yeah. Uh, he was like, you know, Salter, what the hell

28:07.860 --> 28:14.440
happened in here last night? And I'm like, Oh man, cause you know, there, there was a

28:14.440 --> 28:21.680
time, uh, that just brawls between sailors and the Navy were openly to be expected. But

28:21.680 --> 28:28.080
that time was in the Vietnam era. It was not post tail hook. And I'm just like, you know,

28:28.080 --> 28:35.100
once I tell chief Millie this, it can't be untold. So I look at him and I maintain eye

28:35.100 --> 28:41.160
contact for a second and say, are you sure you want me to answer that question chief?

28:41.160 --> 28:46.440
And, uh, he is just spit man. He's like, you know, you're, you're F and D and blah, blah,

28:46.440 --> 28:50.960
and right. I want you to answer that question, Salter. And I said, I need to close the door,

28:50.960 --> 28:55.600
chief. He said, all right, everybody out. And the couple other people that were in there,

28:55.600 --> 28:59.880
you know, eagerly anticipating, they, they file out disappointedly. And I go close the

28:59.880 --> 29:03.600
door and I sit back down and I, I explained the whole thing to him. I tell him, you know,

29:03.600 --> 29:10.960
everything that went on. And, uh, he says, all right, I said, so am I okay chief? And

29:10.960 --> 29:16.720
he said, yep, you're fine. Good job. Glad you made him do his work. And I'm just like,

29:16.720 --> 29:23.640
okay. So that eval period, I got a four, four Oh is a perfect eval in the Navy. I got four

29:23.640 --> 29:29.880
Oh across the board, including in leadership, which is a, a, a step that is not normally

29:29.880 --> 29:35.200
measured for an E five. Like that's an optional and it's not normally actually evaluated until

29:35.200 --> 29:39.100
you know, you hit E six. Yeah. I got four Oh across the board, including leadership

29:39.100 --> 29:44.080
for bashing Baron's head into the coffee maker and leaving a debt of that is great. I, I,

29:44.080 --> 29:49.120
I thought maybe this story was going to go into some kind of like efficiency, uh, section,

29:49.120 --> 29:55.200
but clearly you were, uh, enforcing your own dismay with apparently what I was actually

29:55.200 --> 30:04.600
doing is finally I was fitting into the organization. Oh, interesting. And when did you realize

30:04.600 --> 30:09.840
that like for yourself, when did you say, Oh shit, now I actually, I'm one of them.

30:09.840 --> 30:15.520
I don't know if I ever articulated it before right now, honestly, but you know, like I've,

30:15.520 --> 30:20.560
I've had, uh, I've had the thoughts before about how, you know, an inordinately capable

30:20.560 --> 30:25.720
person in an organization can easily end up becoming a cancer to the organization and

30:25.720 --> 30:32.040
how, you know, I have been cancer to organizations in the past myself. And so, you know, just

30:32.040 --> 30:35.160
saying all those things to you at the same time, it's like, it's kind of obviously you'll

30:35.160 --> 30:40.120
okay. Yeah. It was, it's, it's a funny story. And that's what got me the four Oh evals,

30:40.120 --> 30:44.520
but it also fits, you know, into the whole context we've been talking about. I finally

30:44.520 --> 30:48.960
fit into the organization and did it really well. The organization needed me to make this

30:48.960 --> 30:54.280
recalcitrant petty officer do his job. And I did that. And you know, there you go. Here's

30:54.280 --> 31:01.800
your four Oh, interesting. I did notice earlier today, uh, and this will be a slight aside

31:01.800 --> 31:07.080
was totally connected. I ran into a word twice this morning. Uh, and then I was like, okay,

31:07.080 --> 31:11.880
I got to go research what the heck this word means. And so I was looking at, um, a brain

31:11.880 --> 31:18.960
pickings article about Martha Martin Luther King and, uh, the word in specific was gadfly.

31:18.960 --> 31:24.360
And I ran into that word again in your Twitter description. And I was like, all right, I

31:24.360 --> 31:29.200
gotta go look this up. Cause it wasn't a term I had run into. Uh, can you give us a quick

31:29.200 --> 31:35.760
like what a gadfly is? And I think that might just tie into this story a little bit.

31:35.760 --> 31:41.080
A gadfly is just, it's a constant irritant that you just can't quite get to leave you

31:41.080 --> 31:46.140
alone. That just keeps causing problems and you swat at it and swat at it. But you know,

31:46.140 --> 31:48.040
it's still there, still buzzing in your ear.

31:48.040 --> 31:53.520
Yeah. So I, I was doing a deep dive on this word cause it ended up really speaking to

31:53.520 --> 32:00.760
me. And, um, I grabbed that it actually, the first mention of it in that context was from

32:00.760 --> 32:06.600
Socrates. And he said, you know, just to paraphrase stinging people into fury in service of the

32:06.600 --> 32:12.560
truth. And I thought, Oh, that is interesting. And when you were telling this story, I was

32:12.560 --> 32:16.080
thinking about that thinking, yep, that's pretty accurate.

32:16.080 --> 32:21.480
Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's, uh, it it's me.

32:21.480 --> 32:28.320
At least I feel like we need people who are pushing some buttons and asking the hard questions

32:28.320 --> 32:32.800
and doing the deep dives where other people maybe aren't, aren't willing to.

32:32.800 --> 32:39.200
I mean, the positive way to look at being a gadfly is, uh, you know, it's contextual.

32:39.200 --> 32:47.640
It's you need one when you have a negative complacency that needs to be disturbed. And

32:47.640 --> 32:52.400
that's something that, uh, you know, like it or not, I'm really well suited to, I am

32:52.400 --> 32:56.200
that guy that comes into the like, Oh, well, you know, everything's normal and this is

32:56.200 --> 33:01.400
fine, but it's not fine. And just won't leave you alone about like, no, no, no, actually

33:01.400 --> 33:06.960
pick your head up and look around you. This is not good. There are better ways or at the

33:06.960 --> 33:12.040
very least, this is not good. And we need to think about it. I'm, I'm that guy, whether

33:12.040 --> 33:16.800
I like it or not, whether you like it or not, I am that guy. So I might as well find, you

33:16.800 --> 33:18.640
know, positive ways to do it.

33:18.640 --> 33:25.920
I feel like having people like you is definitely a good tool, uh, in keeping everybody in check

33:25.920 --> 33:30.820
to those people looking and looking over our shoulders to keep us doing the good work and

33:30.820 --> 33:38.640
not the bad work. Uh, so thank you from the community for doing that kind of stuff.

33:38.640 --> 33:43.440
You don't always get thanks for being the irritating fly buzzing, but, uh, you're welcome

33:43.440 --> 33:44.600
and thank you.

33:44.600 --> 33:49.440
And that's kind of what's captured in, in that word, right? Is like you're an irritation,

33:49.440 --> 33:57.600
but with the greater good in mind. And that's kind of a tough position to play because you're

33:57.600 --> 33:59.920
the bad guy and the good guy all at once, right?

33:59.920 --> 34:00.920
Yeah, it is.

34:00.920 --> 34:02.600
Does that ever put you down?

34:02.600 --> 34:07.200
Well, to, to, to answer a different question that you didn't actually ask, um, you know,

34:07.200 --> 34:12.320
GADfly is one of those things that for me, it feels comfortable to call myself that because

34:12.320 --> 34:17.000
I feel like there is some humility in it. You know, like you're not saying, Oh, you

34:17.000 --> 34:22.680
know, I'm this awesome person. I'm this great leader. You know, I'm this, uh, influencer.

34:22.680 --> 34:26.920
You're just, you know, I'm the irritating fly that's buzzing around in your ear. I feel

34:26.920 --> 34:31.360
like it's okay to say that about yourself. And then you kind of let everybody else judge

34:31.360 --> 34:36.240
like, okay, well, you know, is this a good irritant or a bad irritant?

34:36.240 --> 34:40.400
That distinction is actually important.

34:40.400 --> 34:43.120
It gets, um, productive irritant.

34:43.120 --> 34:47.360
So like you can strive to be a productive irritant, but I think it's, it's fair to

34:47.360 --> 34:52.920
say I'm an irritant and it's, it's certainly fair to say I strive to be productive, but

34:52.920 --> 34:56.520
you let everybody else judge that. You don't, you don't get to make that call about yourself.

34:56.520 --> 35:03.000
I mean, if you do, that's how you become the person in need of a GADfly yourself, right?

35:03.000 --> 35:07.640
Cause you've sunken into that unproductive complacency of just like, Oh, you know, I'm

35:07.640 --> 35:08.640
awesome.

35:08.640 --> 35:13.200
You know, there's this trope about, uh, you know, Roman emperor supposedly had somebody

35:13.200 --> 35:18.100
on hand, like at all times beside them to just occasionally throughout the day, lean

35:18.100 --> 35:23.640
over and murmur into their ear. You too are mortal. You will die. Uh, you know, to keep

35:23.640 --> 35:28.840
them grounded in the idea that, you know, I am just a person, I'm not a God, you know,

35:28.840 --> 35:30.800
here at the head of the Roman empire.

35:30.800 --> 35:40.300
We all need a, that and B to do what we can ourselves to avoid really obviously needing

35:40.300 --> 35:41.300
that.

35:41.300 --> 35:45.660
Yeah. It sounds to me like there's a little bit of stoic philosophy in there that you

35:45.660 --> 35:52.560
just threw in there is like, we all have faults and all need to be reminded of that and that

35:52.560 --> 35:59.080
we're mortal. And, uh, I guess sometimes it's important to remember that our time here is

35:59.080 --> 36:04.040
pretty short and we should try to do the, the best possible things we can with that

36:04.040 --> 36:08.120
time or those efforts, even if it's a bit challenging.

36:08.120 --> 36:12.360
And also, you know, that we're, we're all part of a society. If you want to talk, you

36:12.360 --> 36:17.720
know, philosophy, then now we're getting into John done, but yeah, no, no person is an island.

36:17.720 --> 36:23.560
We are all part of a greater society and we need to fit into it and we need to be good

36:23.560 --> 36:27.680
and be productive with and for one another as well as for ourselves.

36:27.680 --> 36:31.840
You know, as you were saying that, I was thinking, Oh, doesn't the Navy fit into that too? You

36:31.840 --> 36:36.800
know, there's this interconnected web of people that you don't get to choose those people.

36:36.800 --> 36:42.040
Well, I suppose the Navy does, but true of our greater society too, right? Like we all

36:42.040 --> 36:47.340
have to find a way to create an excellent environment that we all want to be a part

36:47.340 --> 36:48.340
of.

36:48.340 --> 36:55.480
It's, it's so easy to veer into uncomfortable, you know, political directions, but how many

36:55.480 --> 37:01.640
people do you know who aren't wall street stock brokers who just wax enthusiastic about

37:01.640 --> 37:07.240
how lucky we are to have like wall street, you know, stock players among us who are just

37:07.240 --> 37:12.360
flinging around, you know, these stocks several times a day and you know, pocketing changes

37:12.360 --> 37:14.480
in value as they move them around.

37:14.480 --> 37:20.020
Um, you know, I hear arguments about, you know, technically why that supposedly creates

37:20.020 --> 37:26.440
fluidity that, you know, assists business and happening, which all sound kind of dubious,

37:26.440 --> 37:30.520
but uh, you know, at the end of the day, it's like, okay, what are you really doing for

37:30.520 --> 37:38.440
the world? And I feel like if you don't have a clear and cogent answer as to what your

37:38.440 --> 37:43.960
career is doing positive for the world, and it doesn't have to be like amazing, right?

37:43.960 --> 37:50.600
I mean, if you're working at a fast food place and you're making sandwiches, you are accomplishing

37:50.600 --> 37:55.880
a real good for the world. You know, I mean, you are a necessary part in a system that

37:55.880 --> 38:00.960
freaking feeds people. That's great. You go home and you hold your head high, but you

38:00.960 --> 38:04.360
know, if you're making a ton of money, but you're having a lot of trouble putting your

38:04.360 --> 38:10.600
finger on like, okay, you know, what's the thing I do that makes people's lives better?

38:10.600 --> 38:14.760
What's the value you're providing? Yeah. What's the value you're providing? Like if you can't

38:14.760 --> 38:22.540
really answer that solidly, if you can't feel it in your bones, I don't know how to wrap

38:22.540 --> 38:28.240
that up exactly. Other than, you know, that's, it's not, it's not good. So it sounds pretty

38:28.240 --> 38:32.040
important to stop every once in a while and take a look at what you're doing and measure

38:32.040 --> 38:36.800
whether the value you're providing is the kind of value you want to be injecting into

38:36.800 --> 38:41.680
the world. Absolutely. For you, like some of your writing that you're doing, cause you're,

38:41.680 --> 38:47.000
you're clearly doing some for Ars Technica and I think in a few other places, um, what

38:47.000 --> 38:51.760
would you say is like the main motivator then for that kind of writing? What are you trying

38:51.760 --> 38:56.280
to achieve with it? That literally just came up in a comment thread. Give me a second.

38:56.280 --> 39:04.360
Let me look that up. Really? Okay. So, uh, Ars Reader, VFRX wrote, first read through

39:04.360 --> 39:08.880
Jim's articles really seems targeted to techie prosumer people. I'm not saying it's a bad

39:08.880 --> 39:13.240
thing and I'm not saying the sysadmins don't read this site, but this conversation section

39:13.240 --> 39:18.000
and they're referring, you know, to the comments on that article has rarely left me thinking

39:18.000 --> 39:23.640
I'm talking to adults or professionals. So it struck a chord with me and I had to sit

39:23.640 --> 39:27.040
down, like I had to put the phone down and sit down at a computer and apply to it because

39:27.040 --> 39:31.260
I had an answer for that. I'm like, I've actually given some serious thought to this.

39:31.260 --> 39:37.880
My own personal strictly techie blog is focused purely on it professionals or seriously advanced

39:37.880 --> 39:43.040
prosumer types. But when writing for ours, I usually intend my writing to be, and this

39:43.040 --> 39:48.600
is a bulleted list, an appetizer for the technically minded or technically interested general audience,

39:48.600 --> 39:54.320
a dessert for senior it people in or adjacent to the discipline I'm writing about. Finally,

39:54.320 --> 40:00.440
most importantly, last bullet, a hearty meal for larval form or junior it professionals.

40:00.440 --> 40:04.360
So you know, that's, that's my biggest thing is I want to reach the people who are where

40:04.360 --> 40:10.040
I was, you know, when I was in my teens and twenties and didn't quite know, I knew that,

40:10.040 --> 40:13.200
you know, I wanted to do computer stuff and that computer stuff was cool and there were

40:13.200 --> 40:19.280
all these amazing potentials. I kind of sensed out there, but I wasn't quite sure how to

40:19.280 --> 40:25.760
get there. Right? Those are the people that I'm absolutely the most interested in reaching.

40:25.760 --> 40:29.560
I do definitely want to reach, you know, the people who are just kind of interested and

40:29.560 --> 40:35.440
I do want to reach and make my content valuable for my peers. But it's those junior folks

40:35.440 --> 40:40.180
I really, really want to be like, Oh, awesome. Jim wrote about this thing and like that got

40:40.180 --> 40:43.600
me excited about it. And then I went and you know, started getting my hands dirty with

40:43.600 --> 40:48.160
it. Now I can do a thing. That's, that's my big go to.

40:48.160 --> 40:52.720
So inspiring others to, to create good in their own way.

40:52.720 --> 40:58.040
Inspiring them to become more capable. Given what I'm writing about, it's, it's hard to

40:58.040 --> 41:02.840
say that, you know, particularly the technical stuff. I mean, you can talk about, you know,

41:02.840 --> 41:07.520
the good in some ethical sense I might be doing by, you know, pissing off Linus Torvalds

41:07.520 --> 41:11.600
when he gets too shirty. Um, but you know, for the most part, if like if I'm writing

41:11.600 --> 41:16.760
about a VPN or, you know, some mesh networking or whatever, it feels a little too highfalutin

41:16.760 --> 41:21.800
to say, you know, I'm helping people do good. I mean, maybe I am, but ultimately really

41:21.800 --> 41:28.240
what I'm doing is I'm, I'm trying to make people more capable, more self-determined.

41:28.240 --> 41:34.280
Well, maybe simply by giving them the tools, it gives them the option to do whatever they

41:34.280 --> 41:38.520
may with them. But without tools, you can't do very much. Can you?

41:38.520 --> 41:43.720
Without tools and you know, some, some understanding of, you know, what you can do with them and

41:43.720 --> 41:49.240
how. So like I can show somebody what Nebula is, you know, the, uh, Slack engineering's,

41:49.240 --> 41:53.840
uh, VPN mesh product. I can tell somebody what it is and I can tell them how to set

41:53.840 --> 41:59.240
it up and I can, I can point out, you know, some of the like really cool general, very

41:59.240 --> 42:04.440
broad new concepts and capabilities it brings. But like, I don't want to tell somebody like

42:04.440 --> 42:10.480
exactly how to use it necessarily. I want people to know like what this thing is and

42:10.480 --> 42:16.120
like, you know, what, what its shape in the world looks like and, you know, give them

42:16.120 --> 42:19.160
an ability to start getting their hands dirty with it and, you know, really start doing

42:19.160 --> 42:24.120
stuff. And I fully expect that, you know, lots of them will do things that I never thought

42:24.120 --> 42:27.160
of, you know, I mean, but that's, that's the whole point, right?

42:27.160 --> 42:30.400
That's the whole idea of leadership, isn't it? To inspire others.

42:30.400 --> 42:35.840
Leadership and, uh, you know, open source and Unix modular design. Yeah. All of that.

42:35.840 --> 42:39.500
Yeah. It's always been interesting to me how, and I'm not sure which comes first, but we'll

42:39.500 --> 42:47.380
explore that here. Um, I'm always curious how the spirit of open source can be applied

42:47.380 --> 42:53.640
to far more than just software. And what I mean by which came first is like, are the

42:53.640 --> 42:59.140
people who are so passionate about open source, like you and I, are they interested because

42:59.140 --> 43:04.080
that's where their nature is and open source is just a really beautiful way to let that

43:04.080 --> 43:10.680
shine or is it that it inspires people to just look at things differently and to solve

43:10.680 --> 43:12.400
problems in a different way?

43:12.400 --> 43:16.280
I mean, it's going to be different for different people, right? I think I was just about the

43:16.280 --> 43:21.520
most fertile ground possible for the seed of open source to reach because, you know,

43:21.520 --> 43:27.960
the concept of empowerment and the philosophical ideals and the pragmatism of some really impressive

43:27.960 --> 43:32.240
code, like all of that just all came together and every last bit of that is what I was looking

43:32.240 --> 43:38.260
for, right? I mean, open source was firing on all cylinders as far as like how to reach

43:38.260 --> 43:42.840
and impress a larval form, Jim Salter. Right. But, um, you know, there's going to be a lot

43:42.840 --> 43:47.040
of people that, uh, they're affected by the philosophical stuff, but they don't, they

43:47.040 --> 43:50.920
don't really want to think about it. They don't care about it personally. Maybe they

43:50.920 --> 43:56.160
should. They don't, it's not wrong. I mean, I feel like it's kind of a shame that everybody

43:56.160 --> 44:02.520
doesn't see that, but not everybody's going to see things the same way you do. And that's

44:02.520 --> 44:06.960
okay. Right. So some people are just going to be like, well, you know, I don't really

44:06.960 --> 44:11.200
care about GPL or MIT or whatever. I just care that, you know, here's this awesome

44:11.200 --> 44:15.920
software and I want to use it. It's the best software for the use case. And that's okay

44:15.920 --> 44:19.440
too. It's like the pragmatic approach. You know, you'll have people with philosophical

44:19.440 --> 44:24.800
disagreements over, you know, whether the quote correct unquote approach to open source

44:24.800 --> 44:31.560
is, you know, strong copy left or weak permissive. And, um, it's, it's okay to have your own

44:31.560 --> 44:36.760
thoughts about, you know, which one is better for more things. But the most important thing

44:36.760 --> 44:43.560
is to remember that there is no one correct answer. The world actually needs both. You

44:43.560 --> 44:48.740
know, there's, there's kind of this waterfall when it comes to licensing and just the pragmatic

44:48.740 --> 44:55.480
capability of tools, right? If you have a near universal need that can be fulfilled

44:55.480 --> 45:01.280
by software, that need will frequently be fulfilled first by proprietary software, but

45:01.280 --> 45:05.320
proprietary software has its hurdles, right? Like you have to pay money for it and maybe

45:05.320 --> 45:09.440
you don't even care about the money, but maybe dealing with that is a pain in the butt.

45:09.440 --> 45:13.080
Like, you know, you end up, you're running a company and now you're paying somebody 65

45:13.080 --> 45:18.080
grand to be your licensed compliance officer. And you know, it's annoying and getting in

45:18.080 --> 45:23.680
your way and you want to be able to do without it. And you either then are motivated to write

45:23.680 --> 45:29.840
or to find and consume some open source product. And now you've done away with the roadblocks

45:29.840 --> 45:34.440
that proprietary put in your place, but you're still doing the thing you wanted to do. So

45:34.440 --> 45:40.880
there was still the proprietary software didn't fulfill all the motivations to write open

45:40.880 --> 45:46.160
source software to do the same thing, right? So eventually somebody is going to do that.

45:46.160 --> 45:50.480
Once it becomes trivial enough, once it's a well enough understood concept, maybe once

45:50.480 --> 45:55.640
computing resources have become more powerful one way or another, eventually the task that

45:55.640 --> 45:59.340
proprietary software accomplished, somebody is going to do something open source. Now

45:59.340 --> 46:04.640
let's say that the person who did it open source, they wrote a GPL and that's fine and

46:04.640 --> 46:10.040
that's good. And one of the wonderful things about the GPL is that it prevents some really,

46:10.040 --> 46:16.560
you know, well-heeled organization from co-opting your code and turning it proprietary and then

46:16.560 --> 46:21.720
changing it once it's proprietary and choking out your original code base, right?

46:21.720 --> 46:28.640
That's good, but, but it still gets in some people's way. Somebody wants to be able to,

46:28.640 --> 46:33.240
you know, add that library into a proprietary project or a weak permissive license project

46:33.240 --> 46:38.640
or something that doesn't mix and match well with the GPL. To do that, they need a weak

46:38.640 --> 46:43.560
permissive license. So even though now you've got proprietary software that does this thing

46:43.560 --> 46:48.640
and you've got GPL software that does this thing, eventually if it's a strong enough,

46:48.640 --> 46:53.200
universal enough need, somebody is going to be motivated to write and other people are

46:53.200 --> 46:58.480
going to be motivated to consume a weak permissive license version of the thing.

46:58.480 --> 47:06.160
So ultimately everything is flowing downhill towards the most permissive, least restrictive

47:06.160 --> 47:11.920
licensed version of the thing that the absolute most of humanity can use. But there's reasons

47:11.920 --> 47:17.480
for proprietary licenses to make sense. There's obviously reasons for the GPL to make sense

47:17.480 --> 47:23.800
and all my own code is licensed GPL v3. But yeah, I think you have to recognize and realize

47:23.800 --> 47:29.460
that whatever your personal thing you got going on is, all of these are valid approaches

47:29.460 --> 47:30.460
to a problem.

47:30.460 --> 47:33.040
They all have their value in their place somewhere, right?

47:33.040 --> 47:35.560
They do. They absolutely do.

47:35.560 --> 47:42.200
So Jim, if you wanted to put something out to the community, like an ask of the community

47:42.200 --> 47:47.280
or something you'd like them to think about, that kind of thing, what would you like to

47:47.280 --> 47:48.740
send out there?

47:48.740 --> 47:57.080
It's frustrating to me to see the nonstop divisiveness and being jerks to one another.

47:57.080 --> 48:02.520
BSD fans say Linux is terrible and you shouldn't use Linux and you should come use BSD. Linux

48:02.520 --> 48:07.480
fans say BSD is terrible and you shouldn't use that and everything should be GPL or everything

48:07.480 --> 48:13.400
should be Linux. Licensing fans argue about the licenses and sow all this hate about that.

48:13.400 --> 48:20.200
Cut it out. Do your thing. Do a good thing. If you think the world needs a GPL version

48:20.200 --> 48:27.880
of a tool, then develop that thing or find that thing and consume it. Add to its value.

48:27.880 --> 48:35.120
Tell other people about it. File bug reports. Submit patches. Do positive stuff. Don't

48:35.120 --> 48:41.400
spend all your time saying, oh well BSD license version of thing is terrible or anything written

48:41.400 --> 48:48.640
on their cuddle is terrible. No, be positive. We got enough negative in the world. Be positive.

48:48.640 --> 48:51.720
That's coming from a guy that calls himself a gadfly.

48:51.720 --> 49:00.640
Well put. Yeah, we're hearing that often now from a bunch of different people. I certainly

49:00.640 --> 49:09.560
hope that the hope for good there can overwhelm that negativity. Of course, I'm sort of an

49:09.560 --> 49:13.840
optimist. I do want to make one clarification though.

49:13.840 --> 49:16.280
Please. Another thing that I see called for a lot

49:16.280 --> 49:21.320
is oh well if we just didn't have all these desktop environments. We got all these different

49:21.320 --> 49:26.960
things competing. That's what's keeping us down. No, no, no. That is the exact opposite

49:26.960 --> 49:31.460
of how open source works. Open source works because you can do your thing that satisfies

49:31.460 --> 49:35.540
your need and other people can contribute to it and make it better and the best ideas

49:35.540 --> 49:42.360
rise to the top. Neither open source nor software development in general works by telling 50,000

49:42.360 --> 49:47.080
people your job is now to code this one piece of software the way that I want you to code

49:47.080 --> 49:52.720
it. That's not how it works. Please stop. If you think your thing, whether it's you

49:52.720 --> 50:01.360
wrote it or you use it or whatever is great, then promote it in positive ways. Don't neg

50:01.360 --> 50:06.480
everybody else's thing. Don't say everybody else's thing needs to go away. Just promote

50:06.480 --> 50:07.480
your thing.

50:07.480 --> 50:11.800
Yeah. What I find most interesting about some open source projects and the tools that have

50:11.800 --> 50:18.000
risen to the top is that they tend not to rise to the top because someone has paid all

50:18.000 --> 50:22.460
sorts of marketing dollars for it. They rise to the top because they're great innovative

50:22.460 --> 50:29.280
ideas and because other people tend to believe in them. What better reason for that stuff

50:29.280 --> 50:30.280
to float to the top?

50:30.280 --> 50:36.480
Yeah, you accrete mindshare. That's how things float to the top, especially in the open source

50:36.480 --> 50:44.000
world is the accrete mindshare, the accrete developer mindshare, the accrete user mindshare.

50:44.000 --> 50:48.360
They reach the attention of people who do promotion, whether it's professional promotion

50:48.360 --> 50:53.240
or circle of friends or whatever. That's how you get to the top. You get to the top by

50:53.240 --> 50:54.560
making something awesome.

50:54.560 --> 50:59.840
Jim, thank you so much for joining me today. I have learned certainly a lot in this conversation

50:59.840 --> 51:04.200
and hopefully we get to chat together again soon. Thanks.

51:04.200 --> 51:05.200
Thanks for having me, Brent.

51:05.200 --> 51:30.240
It's been a pleasure.
