00:00.000 --> 00:09.920
Hey, Billy, Daddy and I brought home a Windows Home Server to help organize our family.

00:09.920 --> 00:10.920
What's that?

00:10.920 --> 00:12.920
Well, Billy, a server is...

00:12.920 --> 00:13.920
Me!

00:13.920 --> 00:15.920
I'm a stay-at-home server!

00:15.920 --> 00:16.920
Wow!

00:16.920 --> 00:20.360
Let's go, Billy.

00:20.360 --> 00:23.040
I'll show you what a stay-at-home server is all about.

00:23.040 --> 00:24.240
I'll have him home by dinner.

00:24.240 --> 00:25.640
Eh, keep him till morning.

00:25.640 --> 00:27.640
All right, there we go.

00:27.640 --> 00:28.640
That's it.

00:28.640 --> 00:29.640
I guess that's all there is.

00:29.640 --> 00:34.120
I could play the whole thing, but I'd have to go get the YouTube video.

00:34.120 --> 00:37.720
I love that clip, though, because I bought that dumb home server that's in that cartoon.

00:37.720 --> 00:40.480
All right, setting up for a live stream here.

00:40.480 --> 00:44.640
If you're just getting on, we have the chat room up.

00:44.640 --> 00:45.640
It's going.

00:45.640 --> 00:46.640
Join me.

00:46.640 --> 00:49.280
We've got a couple of things to talk about on the live stream, bit.ly slash Jupiter chat.

00:49.280 --> 00:53.360
If you're listening to this on playback, well, thanks for just saying hi and checking us

00:53.360 --> 00:54.360
out.

00:54.360 --> 00:56.920
Just hanging out today.

00:56.920 --> 01:01.960
We are in the Coder Pre-Show time zone right now, so I thought we'd have a few things to

01:01.960 --> 01:02.960
talk about.

01:02.960 --> 01:10.480
And I kind of wanted to start with trouble in NVIDIA land, it seems to persist.

01:10.480 --> 01:15.080
If you thought all was well with NVIDIA on Linux, it is not so.

01:15.080 --> 01:22.120
Matthew Miller, the lead of the Fedora project, tweeted about what he calls the NVIDIA conundrum.

01:22.120 --> 01:28.120
The drivers on Linux are still in bad shape.

01:28.120 --> 01:31.840
He says it's a Fedora perspective, but he thinks it's a shared problem, which I'm sure

01:31.840 --> 01:35.480
he's right on that.

01:35.480 --> 01:39.320
And he writes, on one hand, users just want their hardware to work.

01:39.320 --> 01:40.320
I've got a laptop.

01:40.320 --> 01:41.560
I've got an NVIDIA card.

01:41.560 --> 01:44.280
Make it go, which I think that's true.

01:44.280 --> 01:49.200
I think a lot of people feel that way, desktop, laptop, regardless.

01:49.200 --> 01:51.360
He says, and I don't have anything against proprietary software.

01:51.360 --> 01:55.000
I mean, I find it boring, but sure, keep your secrets.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.840
Software patents are another issue, but that's not this thread.

01:57.840 --> 02:01.200
But the exciting thing about Fedora and the free and open source software endeavor in

02:01.200 --> 02:06.680
general is that we're building a shared common good, something that belongs to all of us.

02:06.680 --> 02:08.120
It doesn't just belong to coders.

02:08.120 --> 02:10.320
It doesn't just belong to billionaires.

02:10.320 --> 02:12.480
It doesn't just belong to any shareholders.

02:12.480 --> 02:15.040
It doesn't belong to an IP holder conglomerate.

02:15.040 --> 02:18.360
It belongs to you and me, no matter who you are.

02:18.360 --> 02:22.240
And I mean, literally you reading this, if you've tried a Linux distro, or if you've

02:22.240 --> 02:28.080
used Corita or LibreOffice on Windows, or if you use WSL, or if you're even interested

02:28.080 --> 02:30.720
in this whole world of amazing software is yours.

02:30.720 --> 02:33.880
And you should feel that pride of ownership.

02:33.880 --> 02:37.880
We're making a digital public good, something that advances the world for everyone.

02:37.880 --> 02:42.400
And many big companies are part of it, pitching in and sharing code, ideas, paid time, other

02:42.400 --> 02:43.400
resources.

02:43.400 --> 02:44.400
And that's amazing.

02:44.400 --> 02:49.080
For graphics, that includes Intel and AMD, because their participation in the whole shared

02:49.080 --> 02:54.280
thing, if you install Fedora Linux, their hardware just works because of that.

02:54.280 --> 02:56.720
And it works to the best of its potential.

02:56.720 --> 03:02.560
Meanwhile, Nvidia is just, nah, they've intentionally been not part of the project of building a

03:02.560 --> 03:07.320
shared thing, or they want to benefit from it, sell stuff that benefits from the collective

03:07.320 --> 03:09.520
while keeping their own part walled off.

03:09.520 --> 03:14.880
So going back to that first point, I see that they have such a dominant market position

03:14.880 --> 03:16.460
right now.

03:16.460 --> 03:21.080
That's a case to be made for papering that over, and doing a whole bunch of extra bending

03:21.080 --> 03:26.720
over backwards work in the shared community to hide that they're not actually a participant,

03:26.720 --> 03:30.200
to make it easy for users who shouldn't have to care.

03:30.200 --> 03:35.320
But it sucks to spend effort that way, when all we have is limited resources and time.

03:35.320 --> 03:39.480
I'd rather spend that on graphics card companies who are part of the whole open source project.

03:39.480 --> 03:45.200
If you're going to do any special extra work, shouldn't it be for AMD or Intel GPUs?

03:45.200 --> 03:48.900
We could make a special thing which detects Nvidia hardware and does kid glove special

03:48.900 --> 03:52.900
handling to hide Nvidia's lack of support, but that really hides that we don't want

03:52.900 --> 03:54.680
to do that for others.

03:54.680 --> 03:58.280
It's tempting to do that, but also accompanying it with a rant like this one.

03:58.280 --> 04:00.880
But that's just preaching to the wrong audience at the wrong time.

04:00.880 --> 04:03.820
Again, users just want their hardware to go.

04:03.820 --> 04:07.000
And a lecture while trying to do that is likely to backfire.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.600
So honestly, I don't know what to do.

04:08.600 --> 04:12.920
I've heard all the arguments for Dora and the Red Hat desktop team have done a huge

04:12.920 --> 04:15.920
amount of papering over.

04:15.920 --> 04:19.840
That's why it can work so smooth out of the box on other distros right now.

04:19.840 --> 04:23.840
But I don't think any of that will make the situation better long term.

04:23.840 --> 04:27.160
If you work at Nvidia and happen to see this, maybe you can make a difference.

04:27.160 --> 04:28.800
Come on, join us.

04:28.800 --> 04:34.000
Work directly on the Nuvu driver team, so it just works our Nuvu driver team, so it

04:34.000 --> 04:35.880
just works on new hardware.

04:35.880 --> 04:38.080
And for everyone else, tell Nvidia the same.

04:38.080 --> 04:41.720
Redistributable binary kernel drivers really don't cut it.

04:41.720 --> 04:46.280
They make us do extra work that would be better directed elsewhere, both users and distros,

04:46.280 --> 04:51.720
and they sometimes literally make us choose between security updates and graphics.

04:51.720 --> 04:56.600
Either way, Nvidia is in the position to make it better, and that's where you should push.

04:56.600 --> 04:57.600
Okay.

04:57.600 --> 05:01.200
Thread done, he says.

05:01.200 --> 05:02.200
That's a...

05:02.200 --> 05:04.680
Boy, that's a lot, right?

05:04.680 --> 05:08.920
When I read that, I have actually a lot of mixed feelings.

05:08.920 --> 05:12.840
Of course I am frustrated that Nvidia hasn't done better.

05:12.840 --> 05:16.960
I've been frustrated for nearly 20 years that Nvidia hasn't done better.

05:16.960 --> 05:22.760
I'm frustrated by this entire thing, because, you know, it feels like, I think at the root

05:22.760 --> 05:29.100
of it, what bothers me is that it comes from a position of weakness on Linux's part.

05:29.100 --> 05:36.400
Because the Linux desktop has essentially failed at getting a large market share, vendors,

05:36.400 --> 05:41.840
maybe particularly arrogant vendors, are not forced to adapt.

05:41.840 --> 05:46.280
And you know, in a lot of ways, free software is a radical idea.

05:46.280 --> 05:52.780
And if you want a large corporate leader to adapt to your radical idea, you got to have

05:52.780 --> 05:55.160
a lot of weight behind that demand.

05:55.160 --> 05:58.920
And if you don't have a lot of weight behind that demand, there's really no incentive for

05:58.920 --> 06:03.320
that large company to adapt to suit you.

06:03.320 --> 06:06.280
Because you will have to adapt to suit them.

06:06.280 --> 06:13.040
So if they do nothing, you're forced to adapt, and they save time and money.

06:13.040 --> 06:17.460
So I'm frustrated because Linux has never really been in a position to have any leverage

06:17.460 --> 06:18.880
in this conversation.

06:18.880 --> 06:26.560
The best that we have is that enterprise deployments of render farms and other shops that use GPUs

06:26.560 --> 06:30.600
at scale on Linux boxes need NVIDIA drivers often.

06:30.600 --> 06:34.700
So that has compelled NVIDIA to a certain degree to support Linux.

06:34.700 --> 06:40.640
But the irony of that situation is it's not really that big of a problem in the long-term

06:40.640 --> 06:46.640
support distros like RHEL or Ubuntu 16.18.2004, et cetera, et cetera.

06:46.640 --> 06:48.120
They don't change very much.

06:48.120 --> 06:51.000
So NVIDIA doesn't have to do much to keep up with them.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.760
Maybe the rare security patch here and there.

06:53.760 --> 06:54.760
But everything's documented.

06:54.760 --> 06:57.080
The APIs don't change.

06:57.080 --> 07:04.440
And ironically, Red Hat and Canonical are likely making revenue by selling solutions

07:04.440 --> 07:06.680
that accommodate that problem.

07:06.680 --> 07:10.960
So in a really weird, twisted way, Matthew Miller's employer may actually be profiting

07:10.960 --> 07:16.020
from the fact that some people have to accommodate for the NVIDIA driver at scale, and so they

07:16.020 --> 07:20.240
are buying RHEL licenses, ironically.

07:20.240 --> 07:26.120
And I think the reason why ultimately this has gotten me upset is because, boy, can I

07:26.120 --> 07:30.200
really understand where Matthew's coming from here.

07:30.200 --> 07:34.320
Imagine how frustrating it is when you have a limited amount of team availability, X amount

07:34.320 --> 07:41.320
of team availability, and you have to spend that precious resource accommodating a vendor

07:41.320 --> 07:47.640
who doesn't even try nearly as much as some of the other vendors who are now upstreaming

07:47.640 --> 07:49.440
that code.

07:49.440 --> 07:52.300
I get how annoying that is.

07:52.300 --> 07:54.040
So I totally connect with that position.

07:54.040 --> 08:00.980
And as an end user, I connect with all the people who are so sick and tired of this problem.

08:00.980 --> 08:07.040
People who are just longtime Linux users and have had to deal with this.

08:07.040 --> 08:10.760
And of course, I have to acknowledge that there is a bit of history with Fedora in this

08:10.760 --> 08:13.040
capacity, isn't there?

08:13.040 --> 08:21.480
Fedora was one of the last standard desktop distros to properly support NVIDIA.

08:21.480 --> 08:25.940
You know, and it took a lot of work for them to get it to that place.

08:25.940 --> 08:31.240
So there's a bit of history here with this particular topic as well.

08:31.240 --> 08:37.280
So you know, I find that to be a pretty difficult situation because it seems like there's a

08:37.280 --> 08:38.280
no-win.

08:38.280 --> 08:46.320
And, I don't know, maybe eight, nine years ago, there was a lot of talk about an open

08:46.320 --> 08:51.280
source GPU, but it just didn't pan out, you know?

08:51.280 --> 08:52.280
It just didn't pan out.

08:52.280 --> 08:53.280
It just...

08:53.280 --> 08:55.740
I mean, there's still a couple of them ongoing, actually.

08:55.740 --> 08:57.920
So I shouldn't say it didn't pan out completely.

08:57.920 --> 09:04.680
It's just evolved into different projects that haven't materialized in a consumer product.

09:04.680 --> 09:07.040
And then of course, you see what Apple's doing with their whole M1.

09:07.040 --> 09:08.800
They're just building their own GPU now.

09:08.800 --> 09:13.240
They got in a fight with NVIDIA years ago over a faulty part in the MacBooks.

09:13.240 --> 09:15.400
And now they're just moving on.

09:15.400 --> 09:17.860
They're just moving on, I guess.

09:17.860 --> 09:21.760
So we're going to hang out for a bit more because Mike is taking the week off to hunt

09:21.760 --> 09:22.760
lizards.

09:22.760 --> 09:24.160
Iguanas are a big problem down there.

09:24.160 --> 09:27.560
I've already recorded the episode, so I'm hanging out with you guys.

09:27.560 --> 09:39.440
A little boost!

09:39.440 --> 09:46.240
Speaking of the M1 hardware, the Asahi Linux.org website for the Linux on Apple Silicon project

09:46.240 --> 09:48.120
got a nice refresh.

09:48.120 --> 09:51.840
People that are watching live, I have it up on the Vigistream right now.

09:51.840 --> 09:53.400
And it's nice and clean and simple.

09:53.400 --> 09:57.800
I bet you I could see this appealing to people who are Mac users.

09:57.800 --> 10:02.000
And it's still early days over there, so we don't want to oversell it.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.720
But they got links to the Wiki.

10:03.720 --> 10:10.560
They got links to the release announcement that explains where they're at.

10:10.560 --> 10:12.680
I don't know if I've actually said this on air.

10:12.680 --> 10:14.280
I think we said it in Linux Unplugged.

10:14.280 --> 10:20.200
But to get started, you just need Mac OS 12.3, obviously an M1 machine.

10:20.200 --> 10:25.480
And then they just have you, all really safe and good things, curl a shell script and pipe

10:25.480 --> 10:26.480
it to shell.

10:26.480 --> 10:28.520
You just curl that thing.

10:28.520 --> 10:32.520
And then the next thing you know, it's formatting your Mac and, well, that's at least resizing

10:32.520 --> 10:33.520
your partition.

10:33.520 --> 10:34.520
Oh, man.

10:34.520 --> 10:42.720
Okay, so there's like a billionaire-sized elephant in the room.

10:42.720 --> 10:45.520
I feel like we have to address the breaking news of the day.

10:45.520 --> 10:47.960
This is CNN Breaking News.

10:47.960 --> 10:52.520
All right, if you guys, you guys must have seen this because the whole internet is flipping

10:52.520 --> 11:02.320
out that Elon Musk has taken 10%-ish of Twitter, 9.2% of a passive stake in the Twitter corporation.

11:02.320 --> 11:05.720
He sniped it at a low, low price, too.

11:05.720 --> 11:14.360
And of course, then tweeted, when everybody found out, oh, hi, lol, incredible.

11:14.360 --> 11:19.260
And then there's also a lot of people saying that this feels like a personal, like Elon's

11:19.260 --> 11:22.540
just doing this because he's sick and tired of Twitter and it affects his life.

11:22.540 --> 11:28.720
And that this purchase is only 1% of his net worth, 1% of his net worth there.

11:28.720 --> 11:30.980
How about that?

11:30.980 --> 11:34.960
This guy on Twitter says that for weeks, Elon Musk trashed Twitter and then purchased nearly

11:34.960 --> 11:38.440
3 billion worth of Twitter shares for a low price on Friday.

11:38.440 --> 11:46.000
This Friday, he made close to a billion dollars off of Twitter.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
Well way to go.

11:47.000 --> 11:51.720
He sure, I mean, he sure knew, whoever's buying for Elon knew to buy at the right time.

11:51.720 --> 11:52.720
That's pretty incredible.

11:52.720 --> 11:57.080
$2.89 billion, Elon Musk buys Twitter.

11:57.080 --> 11:58.180
What do you say chat room?

11:58.180 --> 12:00.240
Is this a good thing, good or bad?

12:00.240 --> 12:02.360
That's all you got to tell me, then we can go from there.

12:02.360 --> 12:04.520
Is this a good thing or a bad thing?

12:04.520 --> 12:06.520
Drop it in the chat room.

12:06.520 --> 12:11.640
Tell me what you think because, you know, I don't really follow Elon that closely.

12:11.640 --> 12:15.760
I'm obviously aware of all like some of the crazy stuff that he does and tweets and stuff

12:15.760 --> 12:17.200
like that.

12:17.200 --> 12:20.680
But I'm not sure if this is a good thing or a bad thing.

12:20.680 --> 12:31.240
So go ahead and give it a spin, let me know, good or bad?

12:31.240 --> 12:32.640
It's a mixed bag, everybody says.

12:32.640 --> 12:38.960
Wow, wow, that was, that was really sort of, huh, you mean like almost everything is a

12:38.960 --> 12:40.440
mixed bag actually?

12:40.440 --> 12:42.520
Yeah, I suppose so.

12:42.520 --> 12:45.080
I wonder how Twitter's doing in the stock market right now.

12:45.080 --> 12:48.600
I wonder how the world is responding to this.

12:48.600 --> 12:51.840
Seems like it's a mixed response overall.

12:51.840 --> 12:54.440
MailChimp has disclosed a breach.

12:54.440 --> 13:03.240
Hackers accessed 319 accounts, stole audience data from 102 clients, and it has led to a

13:03.240 --> 13:06.280
phishing scam that's already kicked off of crypto users.

13:06.280 --> 13:10.600
And I don't mean to laugh, but it's just so damn impressive how fast those scams kick

13:10.600 --> 13:11.600
off.

13:11.600 --> 13:16.840
MailChimp has confirmed that their service has been compromised by an insider targeting

13:16.840 --> 13:18.520
crypto companies.

13:18.520 --> 13:19.600
Well that explains that.

13:19.600 --> 13:27.000
That's why, ah, he writes, we've managed to take the phishing domain offline.

13:27.000 --> 13:30.840
We're trying to determine how many email addresses have been affected.

13:30.840 --> 13:34.520
Wow, that's coming from the Trezor wallet account.

13:34.520 --> 13:41.600
So Trezor, which is probably the leading crypto hardware wallet, had their MailChimp list

13:41.600 --> 13:44.680
compromised and they were targeted it looks like.

13:44.680 --> 13:48.200
We will not be communicating by newsletter until the situation is resolved.

13:48.200 --> 13:55.440
Do not open any emails appearing to come from Trezor until further notice.

13:55.440 --> 13:56.640
They've taken the domain down.

13:56.640 --> 14:00.760
Damn, that is a shitty situation because those guys are supposed to be all about hardware.

14:00.760 --> 14:04.960
Now it doesn't actually compromise your account or your device, but they can send you an email.

14:04.960 --> 14:09.640
And you know the internet, people are already clicking that thing.

14:09.640 --> 14:15.240
You know one thing people could consider if you use a mail client like Thunderbird, and

14:15.240 --> 14:21.960
a lot of Kmail, a lot of clients will do this, is you could turn off HTML email rendering.

14:21.960 --> 14:26.300
And then a lot of clients will let you turn it on per email.

14:26.300 --> 14:28.120
And that really solves a lot of this.

14:28.120 --> 14:30.920
You know, don't open attachments, that kind of stuff.

14:30.920 --> 14:33.320
Don't use Windows.

14:33.320 --> 14:41.400
But you just turn off HTML email and you solve a lot of these problems.

14:41.400 --> 14:47.600
I feel like MailChimp needs to explain a little more about what happened there though.

14:47.600 --> 14:50.520
I do not like that.

14:50.520 --> 14:52.600
That seems bad.

14:52.600 --> 14:53.600
That seems real bad.

14:53.600 --> 15:01.240
Ask not what your podcast can boost for you, but what you can boost for your podcast.

15:01.240 --> 15:07.800
Cardano Nerd sent us 115 sats in response to last week's episode of Koda Radio, episode

15:07.800 --> 15:10.160
459.

15:10.160 --> 15:15.720
And in that episode we were talking about, okay well, what if you like the idea of decentralized

15:15.720 --> 15:18.800
blockchain technology, you're not really sure if any of this crap is going to stick around

15:18.800 --> 15:24.160
for very long, but if you wanted to make a bet today for a development platform, which

15:24.160 --> 15:25.160
one would you consider?

15:25.160 --> 15:30.400
And I think Solana came up quick on Mike's radar, but I kind of said maybe put Solana

15:30.400 --> 15:31.880
in a watch and wait area.

15:31.880 --> 15:35.600
I think that one, you know, I think it's a pets.com of crypto.

15:35.600 --> 15:39.280
I think Solana is going to do really good for a while, then eventually it's going to

15:39.280 --> 15:40.720
topple.

15:40.720 --> 15:44.560
But it looks like Cardano Nerd agrees, based on the name, that he says here, I came to

15:44.560 --> 15:47.000
the same conclusion about the chains you mentioned.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
Cardano's the way to go.

15:48.000 --> 15:51.120
I was cheering down the interstate listening.

15:51.120 --> 15:52.120
Thank you.

15:52.120 --> 15:53.120
Thank you.

15:53.120 --> 15:55.640
Yeah, so the computer guy asked why disable HTML?

15:55.640 --> 15:58.980
Because a lot of these things that are downloading images in the background, first of all that

15:58.980 --> 16:02.720
pings their server and lets you know that it's a live email inbox, and then they can

16:02.720 --> 16:04.120
start targeting that.

16:04.120 --> 16:08.920
But also if there's anything that's exploitable in your email client that's, like maybe it's

16:08.920 --> 16:13.280
in a web browser, or maybe it's Outlook and it's using embedded edge.

16:13.280 --> 16:14.540
I don't know how they do it anymore.

16:14.540 --> 16:18.560
But if there's any vulnerabilities in the renderer of that email that can be triggered

16:18.560 --> 16:23.120
by HTML, if you turn off the HTML, then you're just getting plain text.

16:23.120 --> 16:24.760
Nothing in there is getting rendered.

16:24.760 --> 16:26.100
Nothing's getting executed.

16:26.100 --> 16:27.100
Nothing like that.

16:27.100 --> 16:31.280
So it's just a layer of safety because it basically makes your email inert text, which

16:31.280 --> 16:33.520
is always going to be safer, right?

16:33.520 --> 16:38.280
And you know, I don't do it myself because I use webmail, and so I don't really have

16:38.280 --> 16:39.880
a choice.

16:39.880 --> 16:42.520
So it's not a hard rule that I follow.

16:42.520 --> 16:45.800
But I actually do think it does make a difference.

16:45.800 --> 16:53.480
Fortnite raises $144 million for Ukraine relief.

16:53.480 --> 16:57.120
After two weeks after Epic Games said all of its Microsoft proceeds from the game would

16:57.120 --> 17:04.260
go to humanitarian efforts, Alphabet's Wing Division plans to begin drone delivery services

17:04.260 --> 17:08.960
in the Dallas-Fort Worth area on April 7th, starting with Walgreens and health and wellness

17:08.960 --> 17:11.040
products from Walgreens.

17:11.040 --> 17:14.680
I think this is going to be huge, you guys.

17:14.680 --> 17:21.760
I really think that drone delivery is probably what industry is going to do in an attempt

17:21.760 --> 17:24.600
to sort out the truck problem.

17:24.600 --> 17:28.200
I just watched a documentary this morning, actually, from the Wall Street Journal.

17:28.200 --> 17:31.000
It was about, I think it was about 10 days ago they released it.

17:31.000 --> 17:34.160
So it's probably on their YouTube channel, if you're curious.

17:34.160 --> 17:39.240
And it was sort of a, this is why the supply chain is going to be really screwed up.

17:39.240 --> 17:43.920
Even if we get it resolved at the ports and in China, the trucking industry inside the

17:43.920 --> 17:49.880
US is completely falling apart in a very dramatic, very profound way.

17:49.880 --> 17:52.700
And it's really looking rough.

17:52.700 --> 17:57.120
And so you can see in there, and they kind of get into this, companies like Walmart and

17:57.120 --> 18:04.080
Amazon and apparently Google and others really are investing heavily into drones now.

18:04.080 --> 18:07.960
And I just saw a drone now that's getting up to like a hundred pound, 200 pound loads.

18:07.960 --> 18:12.920
It looks more like a military drone than it does actually a delivery drone.

18:12.920 --> 18:15.160
It doesn't look anything like a DJI.

18:15.160 --> 18:21.440
Oh, they have some video of it here too, fascinating.

18:21.440 --> 18:23.800
I think this is a render, but this is the idea.

18:23.800 --> 18:26.880
Oh, and the packaging swings, it's kind of like loose.

18:26.880 --> 18:32.240
We launched two sites there, then we launched in Helsinki and Finland, then we launched

18:32.240 --> 18:33.240
in Virginia.

18:33.240 --> 18:36.200
That was our first site in the United States.

18:36.200 --> 18:41.480
And then it was really exciting in October of 2021, we announced Texas as our next service

18:41.480 --> 18:42.480
area.

18:42.480 --> 18:49.440
So we're north of Dallas in the city of Frisco and Little Elm.

18:49.440 --> 18:54.820
Wing is a company that's trying to solve for convenience with environment in play.

18:54.820 --> 19:00.920
In many ways, Wing is a software company, but on top of that, we actually design drones

19:00.920 --> 19:02.360
for commercial use.

19:02.360 --> 19:06.080
Interesting that they don't mention it's part of Google.

19:06.080 --> 19:10.640
The thing about getting into this new industry, many people don't know what they don't know.

19:10.640 --> 19:14.200
And so they're going to get a service that they've never seen before.

19:14.200 --> 19:18.200
Yeah, I like drones.

19:18.200 --> 19:21.320
People who live here, you are going to be some of the first people in the United States

19:21.320 --> 19:23.200
to experience our service.

19:23.200 --> 19:27.440
So what that means is we have an app, you'll see a marketplace within the app.

19:27.440 --> 19:31.160
Let's say you need some mouthwash, toothpaste and deodorant.

19:31.160 --> 19:34.920
So you put those things in your cart and then you add your address.

19:34.920 --> 19:39.700
You'll see a delivery zone, maybe two, maybe three, just depending on your home.

19:39.700 --> 19:40.700
You'll pick that.

19:40.700 --> 19:44.680
Let's say you want to be comfy, stay in your PJs, you click the backyard today.

19:44.680 --> 19:46.480
And then you do it from the metaverse.

19:46.480 --> 19:47.480
It's all cool.

19:47.480 --> 19:50.720
You never have to leave your house ever again.

19:50.720 --> 19:55.760
I mean, of course, then there's the businessman of me who says, well, maybe I need a mic cable

19:55.760 --> 19:56.760
in order to go on air.

19:56.760 --> 19:58.960
Sure would love having a microphone cable.

19:58.960 --> 19:59.960
I don't know.

19:59.960 --> 20:03.920
I've always been told and I've always heard that if they launch these things in Texas,

20:03.920 --> 20:05.600
I'm going to shoot it out of the sky.

20:05.600 --> 20:08.600
So we'll see, because that's where they're launching it first.

20:08.600 --> 20:12.440
They're going to launch it in Texas in the Dallas, Fort Worth area.

20:12.440 --> 20:14.440
They're doing it on April 7th.

20:14.440 --> 20:17.120
So that's coming in pretty, pretty soon.

20:17.120 --> 20:21.160
Hey, I want to mention we have a new sponsor for Koder radio, which I would have read on

20:21.160 --> 20:25.840
the air today, but it's already over, but it's tail scale, which I think a lot of you

20:25.840 --> 20:27.120
probably are familiar with tail scale.

20:27.120 --> 20:31.160
That's tailscale.com slash Koder, and it'd be great to just give them a, this is their

20:31.160 --> 20:34.840
first episode, the beginning of the quarter kind of go figure we're doing a prerecord

20:34.840 --> 20:36.280
this week.

20:36.280 --> 20:39.440
So give them a little, give them a little JB love, because I think that's an awesome

20:39.440 --> 20:40.440
sponsor.

20:40.440 --> 20:44.640
And if you go to tailscale.com slash Koder, you'll get your first 20 devices for free.

20:44.640 --> 20:47.160
Of course, you're letting them know that you're supporting JB.

20:47.160 --> 20:55.100
If you're not familiar, tail scale has become my go to mesh wire guard VPN solution.

20:55.100 --> 21:01.880
So I have created a flat mesh network of a lot of my devices, including my Bitcoin node,

21:01.880 --> 21:07.080
my laptops, my phone, my tablet, a couple of VMs.

21:07.080 --> 21:12.160
I've created this large mesh VPN network and I use tail scale to manage all of that.

21:12.160 --> 21:17.920
And the sweet thing is tail scale takes like two minutes to set up.

21:17.920 --> 21:21.280
It's you're going to, you're going to be blown away how fast you could get a wire guard VPN

21:21.280 --> 21:23.040
up and going.

21:23.040 --> 21:31.000
And so give them a little go give them a little Monday boost tailscale.com slash Koder.

21:31.000 --> 21:36.200
Sometimes I feel like I'm the Commodore 64.

21:36.200 --> 21:37.200
That's right.

21:37.200 --> 21:39.960
Tailscale.com slash Koder.

21:39.960 --> 21:42.560
And just, you know, try it out.

21:42.560 --> 21:43.960
If nothing else, go load the page.

21:43.960 --> 21:48.120
So we get a little hit on the web counter, but I think even better go over there and

21:48.120 --> 21:51.640
sign up and try it out.

21:51.640 --> 21:54.920
So that way they say, holy smokes, we signed up for this Koder radio podcast and we're

21:54.920 --> 22:00.000
just getting such great results because that is a sponsor I'd love to work with for a while.

22:00.000 --> 22:03.120
They're a super cool company, super cool tool.

22:03.120 --> 22:05.160
And I frickin love wire guard.

22:05.160 --> 22:06.160
Frickin love it.

22:06.160 --> 22:07.160
All right.

22:07.160 --> 22:08.160
So I think I'm just looking at everything.

22:08.160 --> 22:09.160
So that's probably it.

22:09.160 --> 22:10.160
That's probably it.

22:10.160 --> 22:12.800
I'm going to read a couple of boosts and then I think I'll probably get the heck out of

22:12.800 --> 22:13.800
here.

22:13.800 --> 22:17.800
Chat room, if you got any thoughts on anything we talked about, drop them in that IRC.

22:17.800 --> 22:20.920
Our matrix server is still up, but it's in rough shape.

22:20.920 --> 22:25.600
It's standing, but it's standing just barely.

22:25.600 --> 22:29.000
The computer guy says, as a Texan, I don't think it's going to be a problem.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.520
Random hackers with GPS spoofers are stealing packages.

22:31.520 --> 22:33.000
That might be an issue though.

22:33.000 --> 22:35.560
It's the high tech version.

22:35.560 --> 22:36.560
That's great.

22:36.560 --> 22:41.320
Kpox says, I'm pretty sure even in Texas it's illegal to randomly fire into the air.

22:41.320 --> 22:42.320
Yeah, I know.

22:42.320 --> 22:47.480
That's why I always thought when people always said to me, when people always said, oh yeah,

22:47.480 --> 22:49.560
I'm going to shoot it down if it's up here in the air.

22:49.560 --> 22:51.120
I'm going to shoot that thing.

22:51.120 --> 22:53.160
I always thought, really though?

22:53.160 --> 22:54.160
Are you really?

22:54.160 --> 22:57.180
Cause like you're going to probably have the cops show up because somebody's probably going

22:57.180 --> 22:58.180
to turn you in.

22:58.180 --> 23:00.120
All right, let's load up the old boost page here.

23:00.120 --> 23:02.440
It takes a second because boost.

23:02.440 --> 23:06.240
There's a lot of boosts there and thanks you guys for sending those in.

23:06.240 --> 23:09.840
These things, you know, here's the thing though.

23:09.840 --> 23:13.320
How long until it's, how long until these things are delivering a meal?

23:13.320 --> 23:15.280
How long until they're delivering a meal?

23:15.280 --> 23:17.840
That's, that's going to be no time at all.

23:17.840 --> 23:19.880
I'll tell you what.

23:19.880 --> 23:20.880
All right.

23:20.880 --> 23:24.680
So, uh, our first boost, come on, there we go.

23:24.680 --> 23:31.780
Our first boost came in and said, hello to Chris and the team.

23:31.780 --> 23:33.800
Thanks for everything you do.

23:33.800 --> 23:34.800
Boosting is getting addicting.

23:34.800 --> 23:37.520
That was in response to episode four 59.

23:37.520 --> 23:38.520
Thank you.

23:38.520 --> 23:39.520
Uh, Petar.

23:39.520 --> 23:45.440
P E T A R. I'm going to say Petar, what do you think?

23:45.440 --> 23:46.440
I don't know.

23:46.440 --> 23:47.440
I don't know.

23:47.440 --> 23:48.920
I'm not sure about that.

23:48.920 --> 23:54.920
Uh, user 46, uh, wrote in with a boost askewt boost.

23:54.920 --> 23:56.200
This is the first time we use Bitcoin.

23:56.200 --> 23:57.200
It seems legitimate.

23:57.200 --> 23:59.520
I'm glad you did the stream to help people get set up.

23:59.520 --> 24:01.680
It's more complex than it should be.

24:01.680 --> 24:05.680
I had to have a 30 sat cover for this, for a 2000 sat wallet.

24:05.680 --> 24:08.060
You know, if you don't know what we're talking, what he's talking about, I did a live stream

24:08.060 --> 24:12.840
that we posted over at extras dot show, uh, which I thought was fun.

24:12.840 --> 24:16.400
We covered a little bit of community stuff that we're working on some, some JB behind

24:16.400 --> 24:20.840
the scenes news, um, cause we're heading out soon.

24:20.840 --> 24:25.880
He sent me a DM with, oh yeah, okay, thanks.

24:25.880 --> 24:26.880
That's great.

24:26.880 --> 24:30.520
Uh, I'm having trouble accepting DMS at the moment because of the load of the server.

24:30.520 --> 24:33.920
So I may not have seen it yet.

24:33.920 --> 24:37.200
I'm at maximum, maximum server load, I guess.

24:37.200 --> 24:43.720
So I haven't gotten to a couple of D a couple of DMS are just like, uh, failed to load today.

24:43.720 --> 24:48.640
It's like Mike says, it feels like the Commodore 64 sometimes I feel like I'm the Commodore

24:48.640 --> 24:49.640
64.

24:49.640 --> 24:50.640
Yeah.

24:50.640 --> 24:51.640
That's how I feel too sometimes.

24:51.640 --> 24:57.740
Cause it's just so dang slow, but, and go figure it happens right as we're leaving to

24:57.740 --> 24:58.820
go to North Carolina.

24:58.820 --> 25:00.560
So we're all going to be traveling.

25:00.560 --> 25:01.560
I hope it loads.

25:01.560 --> 25:03.160
I hope it continues to run.

25:03.160 --> 25:05.640
Maybe we could reboot everything once before we go.

25:05.640 --> 25:08.360
And then when we get back, I think we're just going to have to try to hit that as hard as

25:08.360 --> 25:09.360
possible.

25:09.360 --> 25:14.120
It's just go figure that it happens just as we're like backing up.

25:14.120 --> 25:15.680
Uh, that's, that's it.

25:15.680 --> 25:16.680
Isn't it?

25:16.680 --> 25:17.680
That's how it always goes.

25:17.680 --> 25:18.680
Anyways.

25:18.680 --> 25:19.840
I'm going to wrap it up there.

25:19.840 --> 25:21.080
Coder is already recorded this week.

25:21.080 --> 25:22.080
So you get that.

25:22.080 --> 25:23.680
It'll be in the feeds in a little bit.

25:23.680 --> 25:25.400
Thank you for joining me today and hanging out.

25:25.400 --> 25:26.400
Join me next Monday.

25:26.400 --> 25:30.400
Hopefully the show will be back to its regular time and good luck to Mike on hunting those

25:30.400 --> 25:31.400
iguanas.

25:31.400 --> 25:34.080
Hopefully he gets them things.

25:34.080 --> 25:36.280
Those things got salmonella in their poop.

25:36.280 --> 25:37.280
It's true.

25:37.280 --> 25:38.280
That's a real fact.

25:38.280 --> 25:43.280
I don't know how, I don't know why there's so many of them, but it's all true.

25:43.280 --> 25:44.280
All right.

25:44.280 --> 25:45.280
Thanks for hanging out.

25:45.280 --> 26:09.280
We'll see you next time.
