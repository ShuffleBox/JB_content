1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,060
There we go, there we go.

2
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:17,060
Hello guys, are you ready?

3
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,060
Are you ready to do this?

4
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,060
I'm excited.

5
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,060
We've got Brent here, we've got Wes here.

6
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:21,060
Hello gentlemen.

7
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:22,060
Hello.

8
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:23,060
Hello.

9
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:24,060
Hello.

10
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,060
That's a great tune you chose there.

11
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:28,060
That's a little Ronald Jankies classic right there.

12
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:29,060
Really?

13
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:30,060
Really.

14
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,060
It's been a while.

15
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:33,800
Going back to our roots with that one.

16
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,480
We have an open mumble room too, but only just a few brave souls in the mumble room

17
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,480
right now.

18
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,480
Hello mumble room.

19
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,000
How are you guys doing?

20
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,120
Just Mini Mac, Bearded Tech in there, we've got a couple listeners.

21
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,120
Hey, hello.

22
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,040
Hey Mini Mac, how are you doing?

23
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,240
I'm doing well, I'm doing well, thank you.

24
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:53,000
So Bearded Tech wanted to just join us right now.

25
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,040
He was just eating something, but he won't be here.

26
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,760
It's dinner time for some people.

27
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,760
It's dinner time for some people.

28
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,040
It's some people's bedtime.

29
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:03,840
On the West Coast, we're still actually an hour before it's quitting time.

30
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:10,040
So we actually want to do more of these streams going forward, and we would try to do them

31
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,240
at different times.

32
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,640
So hopefully we'll find something that works for everybody.

33
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,480
Now something new we're trying for this stream is we're putting the matrix chat up on the

34
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:23,400
screen just as an experiment, it's just a rough test.

35
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,840
So if you're an IRC lover, don't worry, it's not done yet.

36
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:31,360
We still have more work to do before we can make that transition, but we do have it up

37
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,560
on the screen today.

38
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,360
So part of the Bitcoin giveaway that we're doing in a little bit will require that you

39
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,400
join our matrix server.

40
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,440
So hopefully that works, we'll see.

41
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:46,720
It's under a lot of load because the community has been growing like crazy, but that's going

42
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,760
to be one of the things required.

43
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:53,320
So go to joinmatrix.org to get information on that, but we'll have more details soon.

44
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,540
We have a lot to do today.

45
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:59,520
We've got a special guest joining us, we've got a Bitcoin giveaway to get people started

46
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,140
on their Boost wallets, we've got an AMA to do, all of that.

47
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:06,500
So let me start by thanking Linode for sponsoring this.

48
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,160
They made this possible, they helped out.

49
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:14,260
So go to linode.com slash Jupiter, that's right, linode.com slash Jupiter, and give

50
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:18,560
them a big Thursday thank you for helping us out with this live stream.

51
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,660
Support these streams by visiting linode.com slash Jupiter, or you can do it after the

52
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:25,440
fact too if you're not watching live.

53
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,520
Linode's what we really use to run everything that we've built in the last two and a half

54
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,160
years, and man have we been using the crap out of Linode recently.

55
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,840
It's so great how flexible it is, we tried different storage systems, local disk versus

56
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:44,180
object storage versus volumes, and we've really been throwing everything at our matrix system

57
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:48,360
recently and the flexibility of Linode and the capability to do a quick snapshot before

58
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,040
we make some kind of devastating change.

59
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:56,420
It's a real peace of mind, because people take the matrix server pretty serious now.

60
00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:01,400
We've created a valuable community resource, and so we don't want to screw it up.

61
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,160
And so it's really nice to have some of the flexibility of Linode's backup and snapshot

62
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:09,700
and storage systems as we're experimenting with different stuff, or to be able to just

63
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,320
add and resize disks and RAM and stuff like that.

64
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,280
They make it all really straightforward.

65
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,140
And the performance is always top notch.

66
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:22,640
And they've been rolling out MVME storage, and I didn't even know they were doing this

67
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,680
until I was in the Linode dashboard the other day.

68
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,960
But they're upgrading some systems to the MVME storage for free.

69
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,920
For total, they're just like, push this button if you want to migrate to MVME PCIe super

70
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,640
fast storage.

71
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,640
It's so great.

72
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:41,080
Linux users, I think, really can tell that the company loves and gets Linux.

73
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,040
I mean, that's why they got into the business.

74
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,920
And now 19 years later, they're just the best place to host a portfolio or something that's

75
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,800
going to be able to handle millions of users.

76
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:57,160
So support this here stream, maybe help us secure future stream support, and get yourself

77
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,640
a $100 credit to try out Linode.

78
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:03,760
That's a great deal, linode.com slash Jupiter.

79
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,440
And thanks to Linode for sponsoring this stream.

80
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,560
All right, so we're going to do the giveaway.

81
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:15,120
But there is a series of things that I want to give you time to set up, because you're

82
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,120
going to have to get an app.

83
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,880
You're going to have to get Matrix.

84
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,940
And also, it's not necessarily a bad idea to get in the mumble room.

85
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:29,600
Just in case a Matrix takes a cramp or something goes wrong, voice communications is always

86
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,600
the best.

87
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,480
But additionally, when it comes to AMA time, you can always ask your question right there

88
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,480
in the mumble room.

89
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:41,440
And it's like a super low latency, high fidelity feed of the live stream right in your ears.

90
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,120
That's true.

91
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,120
That's always a really good point.

92
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:48,440
It's the lowest latency, highest quality audio stream you can get.

93
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,840
Linuxunplugged.com slash mumble for the details on that.

94
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,840
Hey, I like that, confetti effects on the chat room.

95
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,640
Thanks, Tim.

96
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,700
That's pretty great.

97
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:05,200
So Tim there just made confetti happen in our Matrix chat room.

98
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:09,400
So to get on there, you can go to, well, first, just go get the Element chat client if you

99
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,880
don't have it yet, element.io slash personal.

100
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,040
You can also get Element on Flathub if you've got the Linux desktop, which I hope you do.

101
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,160
And then you can get set up and go in pretty quick.

102
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,400
And you want to search for, I mean, I'm trying to think of the best way to walk people through

103
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,600
this, but you want to look for our Jupyter broadcasting server.

104
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,520
So here's what I'd like people to do is start getting set up and we'll start taking questions

105
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,520
on how to do this.

106
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,200
The IRC room is still being monitored, so if you want to pop in the embedded chat and

107
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:39,500
ask your question before you get into Matrix, I'm going to keep an eye on that.

108
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:47,320
But what I would do is I would go to element.io slash personal, and then create an account

109
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:51,560
on matrix.org, and then connect to the Jupyter broadcasting.com server.

110
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,720
And we have a JB chat room over there.

111
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,160
Now that's a lot.

112
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:59,080
So we're going to chat about a few things while you guys get that going, and then we'll

113
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,420
check back in and see how everybody's doing.

114
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,320
So I thought maybe we'd cover.

115
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,840
Maybe worth just saying, too, if you don't, you know, whatever, you don't feel quite ready

116
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,520
to invest in the whole Element client.

117
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,800
Like there's also the Element web client, which works pretty darn well.

118
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,400
So it's like an app.element.io, I think.

119
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,020
Great point, Wes Payne.

120
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:19,120
That is a great point, Wes Payne.

121
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,120
That is a great point.

122
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,120
I use that all the time.

123
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,200
It's basically the same thing, right?

124
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,080
It is app.element.io.

125
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:32,960
And then you can actually connect to colony.jupyterbroadcasting.com and create an account if you'd like to do that.

126
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,960
But I would actually recommend a matrix.org account.

127
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:40,320
So that way, if we ever screw up our matrix server, I think you know what I'm saying.

128
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,640
I think you know what I'm saying.

129
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:47,240
So before we get to that, Brentley, why don't you share with the class some of the various

130
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:52,180
things you've been working on on GitHub for Jupyter Broadcasting, you know, for like issue

131
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,680
tracking and whatnot.

132
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:59,860
Yeah, we decided to, I guess, get the community and ourselves more involved in tracking down

133
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:02,720
a bunch of bugs in our various systems.

134
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,160
But that also includes just organizing our time.

135
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:10,620
And Wes had a great idea of trying this on GitHub, which I'm not that familiar with.

136
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:15,080
So it was also a great opportunity for me to kind of sink my teeth into GitHub.

137
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:19,200
And I gotta say, I've been sort of playing around with it that you guys must have noticed

138
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,200
for the last few days.

139
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,580
And there's some cool stuff happening there.

140
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:29,000
So for our Nix challenge, NixOS challenge, there's a bunch of discussions happening there

141
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,480
and screenshots being shared and stuff, which is great.

142
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:38,440
But for other parts of JB, we have put in some issue trackers.

143
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:45,200
I don't think we quite switched them to public just yet, mostly because I wanted the you

144
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:49,720
both gentlemen to look over it before before we do that, make sure I didn't really screw

145
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,720
something up.

146
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,600
And I imagine we'll have a little bit of both, right?

147
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:56,360
Some stuff that's public, some stuff is just like internal tracking stuff for us.

148
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,640
Yeah, which is which is really great.

149
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,240
And it's great for us because it's all in the same place with the same interface, which

150
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,680
I've been really enjoying.

151
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:07,080
I think the key thing is we need to put like really incendiary things in our private stuff.

152
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,680
So that way, if we ever accidentally flip it public, it's super embarrassing.

153
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,760
Yeah, passwords in there and everything.

154
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,760
Right?

155
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,960
Yeah, that's a pressure to keep it secret.

156
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,120
You're never gonna manage to.

157
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,120
Right.

158
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,120
That's right.

159
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,640
You got to make I want to be like waking up at 3am worrying about the state of the public.

160
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,640
Yeah, right.

161
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,640
Yep.

162
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,960
You both sound like experts.

163
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,320
So I think, yeah, we'll probably flick that public.

164
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,920
I don't know, maybe even today, maybe tomorrow.

165
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:37,560
And I'm hoping that we can get a bunch of stuff happening there, a lot of buzz going

166
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,760
on and hopefully help us fix a bunch of problems.

167
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:45,160
I know, Chris, you're excited about maybe having some listeners and community members

168
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:51,240
help us tackle certain issues that we're having, where they might have some expertise.

169
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:55,400
Definitely that or even just maybe they observe something that we don't notice because, you

170
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,880
know, we're kind of close to the sun as it is.

171
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:02,040
So we we have our own list, boy, do we have a list.

172
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,660
But you know, we're not on the outside.

173
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:08,320
So it's like we don't interface with it externally, the way the audience does.

174
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,120
So they may catch something from their perspective that we haven't considered.

175
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:16,800
Yeah, we do get quite a bit of feedback about these kind of things when they happen.

176
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,360
I know there's been one around memberships and the boosts that has been mentioned a few

177
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,840
times that we still have to figure out.

178
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:30,560
But I think that's actually a really nice place to send people to to, I guess, key us

179
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:35,480
in to little bugs that are happening for them or like jblive.fm.

180
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,480
Did we get that running again?

181
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,480
I don't know.

182
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,480
Actually, I said I put a ticket in.

183
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,960
Probably not.

184
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,960
Probably not.

185
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,960
Yeah.

186
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,880
So that's probably BSD now.

187
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:52,520
I put an issue in our bug tracker and I tagged Wes because I figure he can fix it and Wes

188
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,520
fix it.

189
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,520
Fix it.

190
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,520
All right.

191
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:59,080
So I think some people may be having problems joining Matrix, which I expected.

192
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,320
That's why we're taking our time with this.

193
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,880
We're not in a rush.

194
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:07,920
So probably if you'd be willing to join the mumble room and help us diagnose, that'd probably

195
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,740
be the most effective approach.

196
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:15,280
So again, linuxunplug.com slash mumble for that information.

197
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:19,560
And also if you're just like a total noob to Matrix and you're kind of curious about

198
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:24,640
like what's the difference between running your own server versus using a matrix.org

199
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:29,280
account or how do you join other rooms or all that or why even use Matrix over something

200
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:35,040
like Telegram, if you've been wondering about that stuff, go to joinmatrix.org.

201
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:40,280
It's a kind of recent website that's pretty concise and it kind of walks you through that

202
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:45,120
basic kind of stuff that I think is pretty reasonable to ask.

203
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,480
They call it a platform for the people, by the people.

204
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:53,600
They say, imagine a place where you are welcome to be yourself, where you have control of

205
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:59,320
your data and where you can talk more privately while also allowing you to socialize with

206
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,960
others.

207
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:08,000
And that's really kind of key, right, because you have these public rooms that are unencrypted

208
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,040
and then you have these private rooms that are encrypted right next to each other in

209
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,920
one interface.

210
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,920
It's really great.

211
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:19,280
I've been using Matrix more and more the last few weeks just because it's really grown.

212
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:24,120
I think we have nearly 2,000 users, not necessarily all with accounts on our server.

213
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:28,280
I think it's probably less than half the people that have accounts on our server.

214
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:34,020
We haven't gotten the numbers yet, but I would guess 30% maybe create accounts on our server,

215
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,760
maybe less.

216
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,740
And then there's a real high mix of people that have a matrix.org account or they have

217
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:46,600
created a home server that they just use for themselves.

218
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:50,880
We were doing some troubleshooting and upgrading and maintenance and all manner of things to

219
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,880
the server.

220
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:56,240
And as part of that in the logs, we got to see a partial list of all the various names

221
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,440
of the home servers connected in.

222
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:04,120
It's an amazing, diverse, hilarious, clever list of host names that the audience has.

223
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,120
Yeah.

224
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,880
Yeah, we had a good chuckle at a lot of them.

225
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,560
It's really funny, too, because I didn't realize it kept a list, but what were we looking at?

226
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,800
We were looking at my login session.

227
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,440
We were watching my login session sink down, so it's like people who have PMed me.

228
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:20,800
It's not the contents of the message, but it's the domain name of their matrix server.

229
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,040
There's a lot of really good ones in there.

230
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,400
A lot of people, I think, are just experimenting and trying this.

231
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,600
We've been looking at ways of adding capacity.

232
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,600
We're trying to quickly.

233
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,960
Wes, you've been digging into workers and all of that kind of stuff.

234
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:38,880
What do you feel like is the last big change you did recently that's probably getting us

235
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,680
the most bang for the buck?

236
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:47,240
Well, for the moment, we've turned off use presence on the home server, and then we also

237
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,120
set up a generic worker.

238
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,520
So we've got the main Synapse process, and then we've also got a secondary worker, so

239
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,520
they can kind of split the load.

240
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:57,280
And the worker can do a bunch of the client and federation things, and Synapse can do

241
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,280
basically everything else.

242
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,280
Yeah.

243
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,280
That's so sweet.

244
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,280
That is so sweet.

245
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,800
Now, if you're chatting, I see people are chatting on YouTube.

246
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,280
Hello everybody, and on Twitch.

247
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,280
Okay.

248
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,280
All right.

249
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,280
Good.

250
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,560
We're going to get some people joining us in the Mumble Room in a little bit.

251
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:15,120
We're not actively monitoring the chats on Twitch and YouTube, because we're trying to

252
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,060
use the matrix chat as an experiment today.

253
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:21,540
So what you see up on stream plus the IRC is what I'm monitoring.

254
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:26,280
But you know, we still guide you here, even if you're not one of those chat rooms.

255
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:30,120
I'll try to check in on the other chat rooms from time to time.

256
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,120
Yeah.

257
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,120
Wes has been working hard.

258
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:40,360
We're working on our plans to basically fix the fact that we set this matrix server up

259
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:46,160
mostly as a science experiment for Linux Unplugged to learn about matrix and to experiment with

260
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,000
building a matrix server and get insights to what that's like.

261
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:56,120
And well, basically, it's turned into something that's actually used in production.

262
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:01,120
And yeah, so now we need to take it a little more seriously is basically where we're at.

263
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,960
And we're going to now look at redesigning this thing and making a more production grade

264
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,960
setup out of it.

265
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:10,000
And I think we're going to chat a little bit more about that in Linux Unplugged this Sunday,

266
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
so because we'll have a better idea by then.

267
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,560
So we'll get it figured out.

268
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,520
So just as a reminder, if you're just joining us, join our matrix system.

269
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:22,520
Probably the most straightforward way would be to go to app.element.io and then create

270
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:28,620
an account on matrix.org and then join the colony.jupyterbroadcasting matrix server.

271
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:32,500
You can also create an account on colony.jupyterbroadcasting.com.

272
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:37,480
It's just not guaranteed to be around forever.

273
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:45,000
So what I started working on this week is the 2022 JB road trip plan.

274
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
What?

275
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,640
This sounds very exciting.

276
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,640
I am very excited.

277
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,640
Tell us more.

278
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:53,280
You know, I don't know exactly where to go.

279
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,280
So it'll be just...

280
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,280
Oh, I have one.

281
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,480
It'll be a little bit after the East Coast meetups.

282
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:01,320
We'll have just been to the East Coast because that's coming up, but what do you think, Brent?

283
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:05,680
Well, we've been toying around with the idea of going to see JPL for the last six months

284
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,680
or so.

285
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,680
Would that be...

286
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,120
Could I put a vote in for that?

287
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:17,160
You know, my instinct, despite the cost of gasoline and RV parks in California, I was

288
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:22,000
kind of thinking California because it's been a couple of years, we'll have just been on

289
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:28,320
the East Coast, there's JPL, and we could possibly time it around scale.

290
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,320
That would be exciting.

291
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,320
I've never been.

292
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,320
That might make the most sense.

293
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,000
It's like a JB road trip to scale.

294
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,680
Oh, right.

295
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,920
It's sort of us coming back to conferences in person, you know?

296
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,920
Yeah.

297
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,920
Yeah.

298
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,920
And I think it would be after...

299
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,920
Is scale...

300
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:43,920
It's like in September, maybe?

301
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,960
I think it could be after peak heat, but I can't recall exactly.

302
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,960
That's what I care about.

303
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,000
Did you write yourself notes about peak heat last year?

304
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Well, I just really don't want to make that mistake again.

305
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,840
You were traveling in September and it was pretty bad.

306
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,840
Yeah.

307
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,040
Yeah, it was record breaking hot.

308
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,040
It was...

309
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,560
Rubik Man says, how about going to Canada?

310
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,680
I'd love to go to Alaska, but I think I need a different rig for that.

311
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,680
That's what I'd love to do.

312
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,680
July.

313
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,680
So...

314
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,680
Oh, okay.

315
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,680
So maybe...

316
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,680
Do we not have this...

317
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,680
Is this room not open?

318
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,680
No.

319
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,680
This room should be open.

320
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,680
Our JB chat room should be open to folks that aren't on...

321
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,640
There's tons of people in there that aren't from our server.

322
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,640
But people are...

323
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:25,640
Yeah, just someone scrolled by there.

324
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:31,040
Some peeps be saying that they are getting like the, nah, you can't come in here, air

325
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,040
messages.

326
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,240
Nah, you can't come in here, air messages.

327
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:39,400
But I don't see nothing in here that says nothing about nothing in regards to that.

328
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:43,040
But you know, this is an experiment, as they say.

329
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,840
I don't know.

330
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,480
What I appreciate about this is that we're learning just as much as they are.

331
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,480
Oh, geez.

332
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:55,000
I know I'm learning more about workers than I ever wanted to, I'll tell you what.

333
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,960
Yeah, you're going to be a Python expert soon.

334
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,680
Oh, come on now.

335
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,680
Who can read history?

336
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,700
All right, I'm going to say anyone.

337
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,180
Maybe that's what the issue is, is people haven't...

338
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,180
Maybe it's they need...

339
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:09,820
All right, so I'm changing that to anyone can read history.

340
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,440
And perhaps that will change it.

341
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,380
All right, continue to try it, my friends.

342
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,380
We shall see.

343
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:15,380
Uh-oh.

344
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:19,000
People are now trying to just sign up to our server to try to solve their problem.

345
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,280
We got more and more people in the old Mumble room there.

346
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,280
Hello, Mumble room.

347
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,280
Good to see people coming in.

348
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,280
Hello, hello.

349
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:27,600
I was just connecting to Elements again.

350
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,600
It takes ages.

351
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,600
Yeah.

352
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,600
So to connect to JB...

353
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,600
It does.

354
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,600
Oh, it's horrible.

355
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,600
Yeah, it's horrible.

356
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,920
So you have to boost that server a little bit.

357
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:41,440
And there is that company called Linode, you know that one?

358
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,440
I guess that...

359
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:46,720
Yeah, that's partly why we're recommending that people sign up with matrix.org.

360
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,080
It might speed that up, right?

361
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,080
It is.

362
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,440
Yeah, it's just...

363
00:17:52,440 --> 00:18:00,860
So the short version is Synapse, the back end of Matrix, is pretty single threaded.

364
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:05,660
So you can have, in our case, a six-core rig, but it's only used in one core.

365
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:09,600
And then what they've done in the last few releases is they have developed this thing

366
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,560
called Workers.

367
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:14,360
And there's a lot of different workers.

368
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:23,160
And each worker, there's like maybe a category for these workers, a federation syncing, all

369
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,440
kinds of different stuff, all the things that Matrix is responsible for.

370
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,000
And some of them have like...

371
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,640
Maybe there's like six or seven workers you could configure for federation syncing and

372
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,140
federation communications.

373
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:39,400
And each one of those workers requires its own set of configurations.

374
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:44,720
You look at it and it is very possible to split this thing up into a multi-threaded

375
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:52,760
beast of performance, but you're kind of doing all of the plumbing yourself and you can mess

376
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:56,360
that up on a production system and break it.

377
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:03,800
But what Wes did last night, late into the night, was do some basic plumbing.

378
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,800
And what?

379
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,740
Do we have two workers now, Wes, or three workers?

380
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:10,760
I should probably let you talk about the details, but now we have some workers in there taking

381
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,280
the load off of the main thread.

382
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:17,920
Yeah, we did kind of just start in the plumbing direction, so it's kind of like, okay, can

383
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:24,080
we get from entirely just basically running a database in Synapse to having this more

384
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,240
split out architecture?

385
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,240
So we have not gone all the way down the path that we probably will end up going.

386
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:34,200
So right now, yeah, it's the one sort of original main process that we started with.

387
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:41,160
And then for a bunch of URLs that match regexes that the Synapse project provides, those get

388
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:46,880
filtered out and sent to our, quote, generic worker worker, which can do a whole bunch

389
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,000
of the various things that, as you said, that Synapse has to do to sort of implement the

390
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
matrix protocol.

391
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,040
And then one of the other things we could do is we could start doing more like specific

392
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:07,280
workers to improve sync time and NGINX reverse proxies to take the HTTP load off of the main

393
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,280
thread.

394
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:13,200
I still think like the bulk of the work is probably being done by the main thread, though,

395
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,200
but it's way better.

396
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:20,160
Yeah, and I think, you know, as we can, as you said, you know, we've got some good number

397
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,960
of processors in this box, so I think there's still some room to go in that direction.

398
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:29,520
And we haven't really, you know, gotten as deep into the areas of understanding the actual

399
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,200
performance levels of Synapse as well, like they do, you know, there's a lot of logs that

400
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,200
come out of that thing.

401
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:38,200
They've also got some Prometheus metrics that you can hook into.

402
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,160
There's an admin UI that we want to play with.

403
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,160
So there's like a lot of those things.

404
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:45,400
So we're pretty early in the journal of understanding, like, how does this thing actually behave now

405
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,720
that we have so many people?

406
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:51,120
When there's so much conversation, you know, it's, you can kind of like, you have to just

407
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,440
grep through a lot of stuff to even get to the point of like, can I see myself logging

408
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,440
in over here?

409
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,440
Yeah.

410
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:59,000
Yeah, there's a lot.

411
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,660
And so we're looking into it.

412
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:03,680
And we're also going to look into like hardware changes we could do.

413
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:08,000
Nav suggests that I come to Ohio Linux Fest and tempts me by saying that I could swing

414
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,360
by and we could do some work on JOOPS.

415
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,160
That sounds pretty tempting.

416
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:19,600
Eric says that scale is July 28.

417
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,600
That's going to be hot.

418
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,600
That sounds hot.

419
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,600
Sounds really hot.

420
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:26,080
You could always get a passport and come here.

421
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,080
Hey, hello.

422
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,080
What can I bring?

423
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,960
Hey, can I bring Lady JOOPS?

424
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,960
Does she fly?

425
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,960
I don't know.

426
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,960
Yeah, it's not a real...

427
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:34,960
Stick some floats on it.

428
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,960
Are you out walking right now?

429
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,600
Can you paint a picture for us?

430
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,200
Yeah, of course.

431
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,840
I'm out walking, looking for the foxes.

432
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,840
Haven't seen any yet.

433
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,800
It's midnight over there.

434
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,800
So I hear sirens.

435
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,240
I hear some sounds of London.

436
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,720
Downtown London live.

437
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,960
That's awesome.

438
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,960
That's great.

439
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,960
All right.

440
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,960
I think we're getting more people in here.

441
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,960
Holy crap.

442
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:56,960
Look at all this.

443
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,960
All right.

444
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:58,960
Anybody in the mumble room having problems getting connected right now?

445
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,480
I see we've had some people pile in there.

446
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,080
Oh, good.

447
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,080
Good.

448
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,080
All right.

449
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,080
Very good.

450
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,080
Well, that's awesome.

451
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,360
Thanks, everybody.

452
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:14,480
So Eric says that he can now see the history with the Matrix account, but he can't actually

453
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,440
get into the group and chat.

454
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,680
Oh, we got to get in there and chat.

455
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,680
He's very curious.

456
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:21,200
I'm going to need your lightning address to send you sats, so you got to be able to get

457
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,200
in there.

458
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,200
Yes.

459
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,200
I wonder what the issue is.

460
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:29,880
Just for a note, I have a lot of new first-timers here in the honor room, and most of them are

461
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:33,920
in fact connected to Matrix.

462
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:38,360
So when it comes to Chris Last's space, mum have a good eye on Matrix.

463
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,360
Oh, yeah.

464
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,360
Right.

465
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,360
Very good.

466
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,360
All right.

467
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,360
So we do have...

468
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,360
So, okay.

469
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,360
Yeah, look.

470
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,360
Okay.

471
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,360
I'm going through here.

472
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,360
I'm looking at the math.

473
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,360
And like, here's Murph in here.

474
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,360
Murph's connected from the Matrix.org home server.

475
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,600
I'm looking at Austin here.

476
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,920
Austin is like connected to some custom server.

477
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,200
He just logged off.

478
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,200
But you know what I'm saying?

479
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,200
Like he wasn't...

480
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,320
Now I'm looking at Green Moth there.

481
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,120
Green Moth, he's on Matrix.org.

482
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,520
There's propaganda out there that you can't come in.

483
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,760
There's propaganda.

484
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,240
That's not even real.

485
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,360
It may be we have some permission wrong.

486
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:17,280
If any of us are an element expert, anybody an element expert that knows the UI, my problem

487
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,960
is the damn UI.

488
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,520
Here's the thing about Matrix, and I've got to be totally upfront about this.

489
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,400
It is still rough around the edges.

490
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,560
There are multiple clients in the works.

491
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:31,220
Some of them are like native GTK or Qt.

492
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:35,400
Some of them are Electron as well.

493
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,040
It's not fully polished.

494
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:41,480
Element is probably the most functional with the biggest team behind it.

495
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:47,640
But as I have started using it more and more over the last few weeks, I've really come

496
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,120
to appreciate the interconnected of it.

497
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:53,080
I'm chatting with people on their own home servers.

498
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:56,600
I'm in a chat with some Red Hatters.

499
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,760
There's a Red Hat Matrix now.

500
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,040
A lot of open source projects have come on.

501
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:03,360
The GNOME developers are all on Matrix now.

502
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,840
It's getting more and more popular in the free software community.

503
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,460
It's also getting more popular in our community.

504
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:14,720
And it's at that stage that, remember how Google Plus was like this for a really long

505
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:20,960
time where it was like Linus Torvalds and Greg KH and really great contributors to your

506
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,060
Google Plus feed and it was way better than Twitter once the normals got there?

507
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:26,920
That's where Matrix is right now.

508
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:32,560
Or it's like Twitter was back in the early days before the normals got there.

509
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:35,520
It's just nerdy stuff.

510
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:39,520
And it's nice too because while Telegram is really great for like mobile communication

511
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:45,680
and it has served us super well and we have a Telegram group still going at jupiterbroadcasting.com

512
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:52,120
slash telegram, the nice thing that Matrix can do is that Discord style or that Slack

513
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,480
style individual channels.

514
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:59,760
So like, you know, all of the Coder chat is in the Coder radio room and all of the Linux

515
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:03,920
unplugged chat is in the feedback room and all the Bitcoin stuff's in the Bitcoin room

516
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:08,320
and all the Nix stuff because we're doing the Nix challenge right now is in the Nix

517
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:12,760
room and that's why we sent people to the Nix room and not Telegram because what we

518
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:18,160
find is when we have a topic on a show, we're sitting there yucking on a show about something

519
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:21,840
and then everybody just comes in and they blast the Telegram group, which fine, we'd

520
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,760
like to hear from them, but people in the Telegram group don't necessarily like it just

521
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:27,340
totally dominating the conversation.

522
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:28,880
So here we can split it off.

523
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,920
But because it's decentralized, you can have your own home server, you could be on matrix.org,

524
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:36,960
you could create an account on ours and when one of them goes offline, your experience

525
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,800
continues to go and there's not anybody that's going to shut us down or anything like that.

526
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,920
It's just going to be us, if anything.

527
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:47,320
So yeah, it's still rough.

528
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:50,840
It's not great, but neither was the early internet.

529
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:54,600
You know, back in my day, the best thing about the early internet was that Netscape had little

530
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:58,700
stars shooting over the end and the rest of it was total junk, right?

531
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:03,480
I'm telling you, like it gets better from here and they've made steady progress on element

532
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:07,160
and the fact that they have the web app too, I don't know, I find that makes it really

533
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,160
compelling.

534
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,960
I think it makes it really nice because then you can open it up in a tab like I have today

535
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,780
and I can just throw it up on the live stream or something.

536
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:20,140
So if you can get that set up, but I'll tell you what, if it doesn't end up working, we

537
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:22,120
also have the IRC's fallback.

538
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:25,520
So don't worry, you'll still get some stats if you want to participate, but we are trying

539
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,880
to do it in the matrix room because we want to experiment with that.

540
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:33,280
Plus we're, honestly, I'm just curious how far we can push this thing because man is

541
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,960
it on the edge right now.

542
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:42,120
So let's see what happens when a live stream jumps on there and really bangs on this thing.

543
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:48,280
And if I know one, I know one issue we've had in the past was with latency and I don't

544
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,480
know if I'm seeing that now.

545
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,340
So some of West's magic must have helped that it helped.

546
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:54,340
It definitely helped.

547
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:58,280
I know we have more work to do, but it definitely helped.

548
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:05,480
I think it's one of those problems and I bet you tell me what you think West, but it feels

549
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:09,920
like one of those problems where there's a couple of low-hanging fruit things you could

550
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:14,680
do, but the net performance gain is going to be in finding nearly all the optimizations

551
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,680
we can take reasonably.

552
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:24,200
Yeah, you know, we just have, there's so much to learn and matrix and synapse have moved

553
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:29,760
so fast in just the past few releases, the past year or two since we started deploying

554
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,760
it.

555
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:34,000
You know, workers coming online, a lot of the docs changing or practices changing or

556
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
APIs.

557
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,120
And we also really need to get familiar with like more of the database schema so we can

558
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:47,960
get our database maintenance on point and figure out stuff like retention policies and

559
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,760
what settings need to be tuned, none of which we've really explored.

560
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:55,840
I mean, you know, little pieces here or there, but there's a lot of knobs to turn.

561
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,640
As we started looking more and more into it, I was like, you know what this feels like?

562
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:04,680
It feels like it's as complex as Exchange was, it's like learning Exchange 5.5 and Exchange

563
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,680
2003.

564
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:10,480
It feels like running an Exchange server, which is not necessarily a good thing.

565
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,880
I don't know, I should probably just mention that we have the April 9th meetup just around

566
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,880
the corner.

567
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:20,460
I've actually got my bags to start packing.

568
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:24,440
So that is just around the corner if you are in that neck of the woods, April 9th.

569
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,760
Now, okay, here's the giveaway details.

570
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,760
Here's what you need to know.

571
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:33,480
You need to get in our matrix room, we have the JB chat, the general chat room.

572
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:37,840
You can grab our mumble details at linuxunplug.com slash mumble if you've got any questions about

573
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,840
that.

574
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,980
And here's the other critical piece.

575
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:43,180
You need a new podcasting app.

576
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:45,840
You need a podcasting 2.0 app that has the Lightning Wallet.

577
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:52,040
So you can go to newpodcastingapps.com, that's newpodcastingapps.com, and you get yourself

578
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,520
a new podcast app.

579
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:58,600
I really like Fountain FM because it has an Android client and an iOS client.

580
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:06,600
But if you're just on iOS, Cast-O-Matic is great, it has CarPlay and it's iOS specific.

581
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,320
I've been enjoying Fountain FM.

582
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:15,280
It has a unique UI where they surface clipped podcasts, they really focus on the clips.

583
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,780
And I've actually discovered a couple of new podcasts that way.

584
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:20,000
So that's what I've been enjoying about Fountain.

585
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,540
You'll get one of these apps and then you'll have a Lightning Wallet in there.

586
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:29,160
In Cast-O-Matic, you have to subscribe to a podcast and you have to actually bring up

587
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:34,400
the play page and in the little boost area, there's a gear icon to get your wallet.

588
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,400
On Fountain FM, the wallet's pretty obvious.

589
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,920
But here's what I'd like you to do is go get one of these apps, pick the one that works

590
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:39,920
best for you.

591
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:43,560
There's some web apps as well at newpodcastapps.com.

592
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:47,880
Locate your Lightning payment address because you're gonna invoice me and I'm gonna send

593
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,760
you a thousand sats.

594
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:55,180
So you gotta get this invoicing thing figured out and then you send me it and I will pay

595
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:59,360
it and that'll get your wallet set up with a thousand sats so you can start boosting

596
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:03,120
podcasts that support value for value and get you going out there.

597
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,660
So either one of those apps or the web apps can do this for you.

598
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:09,560
So go get that now, newpodcastapps.com.

599
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:12,040
Fountain FM is the one I've been recommending.

600
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:15,480
And while you guys get that set up and you get in the matrix room, I kind of have a nice

601
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:19,280
treat for us.

602
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:23,600
One of those opportunities, something just kind of clicked and I got to sit down with

603
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:45,440
the developer of Fountain FM, Oscar Mary, who's also in London and he joins us now.

604
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,520
So I gotta start with what is probably the number one question on my mind.

605
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:53,300
I think Fountain is one of the more exciting apps in a while.

606
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:58,240
And when I started going through it, I realized this is actually a pretty complicated app

607
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,680
that has a lot of screens, that does a lot of things.

608
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:05,600
This is a huge project and I bet a lot of people who use a podcast app kind of think

609
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,600
it's a simple thing.

610
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,600
Oh, it's no big deal.

611
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,960
It just pulls down the RSS feeds and plays an MP3 file, how hard could that be?

612
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:16,000
Why did you want to take on a crazy project like this when there's a pretty good handful

613
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,560
of podcast apps out there now?

614
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,360
Yeah, it's a great question.

615
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:26,440
So I think I'm a massive fan of podcasts and one of the things that I have a strong belief

616
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:33,840
in is that there's incredible insight and wisdom that's locked away in podcast content.

617
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:40,280
And there's a few issues with the format in the sense that number one, most people that

618
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:46,320
are really into podcasts just have too many in their feed to even listen to.

619
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:52,800
So I probably have about eight to 10 hours of podcast content that shows up in my feed

620
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:57,700
every single day and I'm never going to be able to get to that content.

621
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:01,720
But there's probably incredible stuff in there that I'd love to listen to.

622
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:09,160
So one of the things we're trying to do with Fountain is actually make it easy for listeners

623
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:15,920
to actually surface the best moments in the episodes and share those moments with their

624
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:19,240
friends, family, or just people that they know.

625
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:26,080
So what we've done is we've given the listener the ability to create and share clips within

626
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:31,880
Fountain and we've done this by using the actual word by word transcripts such that

627
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:36,540
you don't have to mess around editing an audio wave on your mobile device where there's not

628
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:37,540
much screen.

629
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:41,880
You can actually just select the text of the transcript that you want and that makes it

630
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:45,120
much, much easier to actually create a clip.

631
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:50,480
We also have social features on Fountain, which means that if you follow me on Fountain

632
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:55,640
and I create a clip, you'll see that appear on your home screen the next time you open

633
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,920
the app.

634
00:32:56,920 --> 00:33:01,240
So yeah, we're really just trying to solve the problem of allowing people to surface

635
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:06,580
the best moments from podcasts just because we believe that, yeah, there's so much great

636
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:08,480
content out there.

637
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,360
Another example of this is the back catalog, right?

638
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:19,400
If you discover a new show, a lot of shows have hundreds of episodes in the back catalog.

639
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:23,360
How are you supposed to go back through that and figure out what a good episode might be?

640
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:27,200
Well, what we also have on Fountain is clip playlists.

641
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:32,160
So you can actually take clips that either you've created or someone else has created,

642
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:36,200
stick them in a playlist and then people can go and browse those.

643
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:39,560
If they find a clip that they like, which might be a minute long, they can then go and

644
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:42,720
click through to the episode and listen to the full episode.

645
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:48,280
So yeah, we're trying to make it easier to discover and share great moments from podcasts.

646
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,240
Oh, I love that.

647
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:56,840
Obviously, as a longtime podcaster, I felt like the shareability of YouTube videos really,

648
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:00,760
really showed us where podcasting was lacking in a feature.

649
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:05,040
And I think what you guys have done with the share feature, the clip feature is it's nice,

650
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:10,120
it has the album art on there, it has waveform on there, it looks presentable like you could

651
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:13,920
actually share it on social media or YouTube, or you could just listen to it in the app

652
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:14,920
and I like that.

653
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:18,400
But you said something in there that I wanted to ask you further about.

654
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,880
You mentioned that you're enabling this with transcripts.

655
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:23,400
So is the app doing transcript on device?

656
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,720
Is that happening in the cloud?

657
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:28,360
Is that part of the new podcasting 2.0 spec?

658
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,720
How is that being done?

659
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:32,920
Because this is one of those out there early features that Fountain has.

660
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,880
It seems like all apps are going to want to have this one day.

661
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,680
Yeah, 100%.

662
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:42,240
So right now we are actually using a commercial transcription service.

663
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,920
We're doing that in the cloud.

664
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:48,200
And the reason we're doing that is because we need a special format of transcript that

665
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:52,280
actually has the word by word timestamps.

666
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:57,240
And that's what allows us to give the listener the ability to just select the bits of text

667
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,240
they want.

668
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:02,900
You can even edit out sentences if you want to make a more succinct clip, which we think

669
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,200
is really important.

670
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:11,080
Because again, if you have a two hour long podcast episode, when somebody is saying something,

671
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:16,740
they're assuming that the person hearing what they're saying has heard the previous thing.

672
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:19,000
So sometimes it's useful to cut up the clip a little bit.

673
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,840
So yeah, we're using a commercial transcription service.

674
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:25,800
It does cost us and that's why if you create a clip on Fountain, you will see that there's

675
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,700
a slight delay as we process that transcription.

676
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:37,280
We do hope to get the word by word timestamp format in the actual open standards such that

677
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:42,200
podcast hosts can actually add that and then yeah, any app will be able to use it.

678
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,920
Yeah, that was my next thought.

679
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:48,400
If that became a universal thing and more podcast apps took advantage of that, I would

680
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:53,240
start feeling compelled as a podcaster to start coming up with a way to automate transcriptions.

681
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:57,400
It's something we've talked about as a group for a long time, but there's just never really

682
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,080
been the right technology.

683
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:04,460
So I love the clips and I think it was a bold choice for the app to open up to the Discover

684
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:07,000
page that shows clips right away.

685
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,840
Because I have to say as a new user at first, I was like, oh, I don't want this.

686
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,800
I want my podcast.

687
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:17,920
Until the day I actually discovered a new podcast from the clips and I was like, oh,

688
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:18,920
I get it.

689
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:19,920
I get it.

690
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:23,680
But that's still like that's a you're really putting this clip feature and this social

691
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,580
aspect of it pretty front and forward.

692
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:27,580
What are your thoughts on that?

693
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:30,960
Yeah, it's definitely a lot of users have asked.

694
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:36,080
I would love to have the podcast tab as the first as the default tab.

695
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:42,120
I think the way we think about it is over time as we build up the social graph a little

696
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:46,460
bit right now, if you're a brand new user, you're not going to be following anyone.

697
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:50,000
And you're just going to get popular clips which may not interest you.

698
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:56,560
But I do think over time, it's actually fascinating to get that window into someone else's podcast.

699
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:02,560
Listening because podcast listening is actually quite a you know, it's quite an individual

700
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,560
thing.

701
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:08,560
You listen to podcasts normally on your own and even your closest friends and family,

702
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:13,240
you won't necessarily know what they're listening to or what they've listened to this week or

703
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,240
anything like that.

704
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:18,560
And it's actually fascinating to just get that window into what other people have found

705
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:22,000
interesting that week and what they've clicked.

706
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Yeah.

707
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,720
And there is there is just so many podcasts out there.

708
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:28,760
It really makes discovering a new podcast difficult.

709
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:33,400
And the best way is the best signal is when somebody you know or somebody you follow says,

710
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,640
hey, this is worth a listen.

711
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:39,320
Like that's that's the most valuable kind of endorsement in podcasting there is in it.

712
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,140
So it's cool to see it baked in.

713
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:47,440
One thing is that right now, in every single podcast app, really, the only way that you

714
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:51,320
can listen to an episode is if you follow the show.

715
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:56,360
And there's a lot of shows out there that I'm just not going to be interested enough

716
00:37:56,360 --> 00:38:00,560
in that topic to actually follow and want to see every episode that comes through the

717
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,560
feed.

718
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:06,120
But that doesn't mean that, you know, if there's one particular episode that's incredible and

719
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:10,040
is about a story that actually does interest me, that doesn't mean I don't want to listen

720
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,620
to that one episode, maybe.

721
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:16,300
And by seeing the signal from somebody that you follow, but they've created a clip or

722
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:21,560
maybe, you know, maybe they've boosted it a certain amount, that's a great signal for

723
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:25,120
me to go and look at that episode and maybe add it to my feed just individually.

724
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:27,520
Yeah, it's a whole new kind of metric.

725
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:31,840
And it's way more valuable than anything else I've ever had for discovering podcasts.

726
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:34,240
At first, I was sort of resistant to the whole social aspect of it.

727
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,560
I'm like, no, this is a private thing.

728
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:38,300
And I initially I just use the app that way.

729
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:42,040
But then when I started telling the audience about it, and they started following me, I

730
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:45,700
started realizing, oh, they might actually be interested in some of the clips I want

731
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:46,700
to share and stuff like that.

732
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,760
And so it kind of really opened my eyes to it.

733
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,060
But you said something there I want to talk about now.

734
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:55,840
The other really cutting edge feature you're doing here is value for value support with

735
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:59,140
boost-a-grams and lightning payments.

736
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:03,340
That actually, I think, is maybe one of the biggest leading features of Fountain because

737
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:06,880
it creates a real incentive for people to start sharing the app.

738
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:11,120
So did you get into Fountain with the idea to implement lightning from the very get-go

739
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:13,960
or did that come along as you were looking at compelling features?

740
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:17,880
Yeah, so we didn't actually have that idea at the start.

741
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:22,920
We started with the problem of how do we surface the best moments from podcasts that I've already

742
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:23,920
talked about.

743
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:29,760
But one of the interesting things was I've been a massive believer in Bitcoin for many,

744
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,700
many years, and I've followed it very closely.

745
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:39,720
And so when we started following what Adam and Dave were doing with podcasting 2.0, as

746
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:46,280
soon as we saw the value for value spec in there and saw what was happening with the

747
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:51,560
lightning network, especially with the adoption that we've seen over the past couple of years,

748
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:56,120
it was an absolute no-brainer for us and we made a decision very quickly to double down

749
00:39:56,120 --> 00:40:02,740
on it and make it like a key feature of Fountain because, yeah, we think that, I mean, personally,

750
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:09,060
we believe it's the future of the world's monetary network and we've seen in the past

751
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,060
six months.

752
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:16,840
Cash App have rolled it out to all of their US users, so this thing is growing every month

753
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:22,240
and I think it's something that apps, not just in podcasting, but many more apps that

754
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:26,460
are on your phone are going to have some kind of lightning aspect to them in the future.

755
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:32,740
If I were starting Jupyter broadcasting today, I absolutely would be really focused on this

756
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:36,680
because one of the things you can do with the spec is you can do splits.

757
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:40,880
So I could have a little bit of each boost go to my co-host, I could have it go to my

758
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:44,360
editor, I could have it go to my hosting provider, I can have it go to the index, I can have

759
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,720
it go to you.

760
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:52,900
It's such a, A, essentially automatic system, B, fully transparent because it's all documented

761
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:58,040
right there by the host, by the audience, the contract is the code, and it means that

762
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:05,480
we can incentivize hosts to really spend time, like take hours out of their week to work

763
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,480
on this over time.

764
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,880
And I think it's going to be huge for future shows.

765
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:15,180
And I wondered, have you really, Oscar, have you grasped the depth of enablement this could

766
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:16,500
be for the medium?

767
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:19,160
This I think is maybe bigger even than podcasting.

768
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:21,120
Yeah, 100%.

769
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:26,760
It's incredibly exciting and I think the splits is one of the most powerful features of the

770
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:33,600
value block and it hasn't even, especially the episode level splits, haven't even really

771
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:41,180
been adopted that much at this point because this is all very new, you know, to your average

772
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:47,000
podcaster that maybe doesn't know much about Bitcoin or Lightning, maybe doesn't know much

773
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:53,840
about tech, it's already a big ask to try and convince them to, you know, Lightning

774
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:58,280
enable their show, create a podcaster wallet, like that's the first step.

775
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:03,400
And then to start talking about, okay, episode level splits and, you know, different Lightning

776
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:09,240
node pub keys in the splits for different guests and producers, you know, there's a

777
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:15,560
lot in here, but 100%, I agree with you, over time, there's so much creative, there's so

778
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:18,040
many creative things we can actually do with the splits.

779
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:23,760
So for example, one of the things that I think about a lot is if you're interviewing someone

780
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:28,920
on your show that has an amazing cause or an amazing open source project or whatever

781
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:34,760
it is, you can actually say to your audience who you've built up all of this trust with

782
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:39,080
over the years as a podcast host, you can say to them, hey guys, if you want to support

783
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:44,200
this cause, you don't have to do anything different to what you already do.

784
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:49,960
Just send a boost and, you know, 50%, 60% or 100% will go to that guest and support

785
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:50,960
that cause.

786
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,640
So I think there's so much we can do there.

787
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:59,320
Yeah, that is, that's my dream is I believe that, and I think a lot of people who are

788
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:03,440
involved in podcasting 2.0 probably see this as well, I think the podcasting landscape

789
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:09,480
is shifting for independent content, 50% of weekly listeners are now consolidated into

790
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,840
just four or five podcast apps.

791
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:17,280
It's getting really, it's getting really thick out there and then you combine like some censorship

792
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:20,840
issues that can crop up because things change over time.

793
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:24,360
And this value for value model solves all of that.

794
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:30,040
And the lightning payment system is the missing piece that I think was always kind of necessary.

795
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:34,520
I have, you know, I've seen a lot of resistance to PayPal and other systems like that.

796
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:37,720
So that's really exciting, but, and I think it's huge and I think it could be ginormous

797
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:42,560
for free software because you imagine if the JB audience over time, you know, we get two

798
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:49,520
or 3000, four or 5000 people or more on the lightning network and then the VLC app comes

799
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:52,320
online or OBS comes onto the lightning network.

800
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:54,400
Like they're going to immediately have support.

801
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,480
It's going to be huge.

802
00:43:55,480 --> 00:44:00,840
The network effect is going to be valuable, but it seems like the tricky part is getting

803
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:02,380
people on board right now.

804
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:06,200
This is the number one thing that is tricky because if you've never bought Bitcoin, if

805
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:10,880
you've never got into this ecosystem at all, but now you feel compelled to support, how

806
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:14,140
do you even solve this problem for most people, Oscar?

807
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:18,360
Because it's very complicated, it involves multiple apps and identifying yourself to

808
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:23,200
some financial services in some cases, it's a thick, tricky process right now.

809
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,200
Yeah.

810
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:28,160
100% is definitely the biggest problem now that's limiting adoption.

811
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:29,720
And yeah, it's a struggle.

812
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:35,840
I think a couple of things, so I'll explain how we recommend you get started in a second.

813
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:41,040
But first I'll just say that what gives me optimism around this problem is that it's

814
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:43,080
not just fountain.

815
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,560
It's not even just podcasting 2.0.

816
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:49,960
It's not even just podcasting that's going to be trying to solve this problem.

817
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:53,020
Every single app is adopting Lightning.

818
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:58,760
And so yeah, Cash App just onboarded 65 million people in the US who now have access to Lightning

819
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:01,860
on their main payment app.

820
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:06,720
So these onboarding challenges are being solved not even by us.

821
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,240
Every month a new company will add an integration.

822
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:14,600
And so eventually we'll get to the point where someone will see a Lightning invoice in an

823
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:18,000
app and they'll just instantly know, yeah, okay, I know how to do that.

824
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,320
And the app to app integrations will start being offered as well.

825
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:25,200
So you don't even have to copy the Lightning invoice across.

826
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:29,680
You can just say pay with Lightning and it will just open up Cash App, give you a confirmation

827
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:30,680
and you're done.

828
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:33,120
And the thing I think to stress there too is it's an open network.

829
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:37,360
So if you buy something, if you buy Bitcoin in the Cash App, you can move it to the Fountain

830
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:40,940
App or if you want to take some money out of your Fountain App, you could move it back

831
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:44,000
to another app because it's all an open protocol and an open network.

832
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Exactly.

833
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,520
Which is the amazing thing about it, which, you know, it drives competition.

834
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:52,760
It means that at the end of the day, the consumer's going to have a better experience because

835
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:56,680
they can always just move their funds to any app.

836
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:59,080
So it's so easy to switch between services.

837
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:00,080
Yes.

838
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:01,080
Oh, finally.

839
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:04,560
So now how are you recommending people get on board right now?

840
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:07,440
Like what has been the smoothest process that you've seen?

841
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:08,440
Yeah.

842
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:13,360
So right now what we recommend is so you've downloaded the Fountain App and you want to

843
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:18,400
get some Bitcoin, some SATs in Fountain for the first time.

844
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:24,600
What we recommend is using an app called Blue Wallet, which is available internationally.

845
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:29,360
And on Blue Wallet, you can actually buy Bitcoin with Apple Pay.

846
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:32,880
So that's like the easiest way to do it.

847
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:38,600
Download Blue Wallet, buy Bitcoin on the Lightning Network with Apple Pay, and then you can transfer

848
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:40,480
it back into Fountain.

849
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:46,760
Again, it's still quite a convoluted process and we're hoping to at some point have the

850
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:51,400
ability to actually, you know, what I'd love is the ability to buy Bitcoin within Fountain.

851
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:56,040
But once we offer that, we go down a path of, you know, financial regulations and all

852
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:58,720
of that, which at the end of the day, we are a podcast app.

853
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,920
So I don't think we want to be doing that.

854
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:04,280
Yeah, that can get pretty tricky pretty quick.

855
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:08,200
And you know, the great thing about it is people could go the traditional route.

856
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,480
You know, like you said, they could go Blue Wallet.

857
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:14,080
In the U.S., I've been telling people Strike is a really easy way to do it.

858
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:15,760
Those are traditional financial apps.

859
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,680
Yeah, Strike's great in the U.S.

860
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:18,680
Yeah.

861
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:22,520
But you could go the route of like meet a guy in an alley and, you know, sell them some

862
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:23,880
straight some cash for Bitcoin.

863
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:28,240
Like there's the whole spectrum of options for ways people could go.

864
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:33,360
But I personally think it would be incredible to do like either a Google Pay or an Apple

865
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,920
Pay in the Fountain app to charge up the wallet.

866
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:39,360
But I totally get, you know, maybe why you'd want to avoid that.

867
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:43,840
The other thing, too, is I kind of consider a lightning wallet like a checking account.

868
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:45,880
Like I don't keep very much in there.

869
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:49,360
I keep like a spending amount of money in a lightning wallet.

870
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:54,480
And Blue Wallet is a fantastic app because if later on you want to go to the self-hosting

871
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:58,320
side of Bitcoin, maybe deploy like Umbral or something like that, it's real easy to

872
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:02,240
connect that Blue Wallet app up to a self-hosted Umbral box, too.

873
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:04,400
So I love it for that kind of stuff.

874
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:05,400
All right.

875
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:08,360
So we've talked about the clips and we've talked about the transcription that's in the

876
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:11,360
clips and we've talked about boostagrams.

877
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:15,160
Can we just kind of spend a minute on comments because these just recently rolled out in

878
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:16,160
the app?

879
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:19,880
And this is also kind of like an area of a lot of debate right now in podcasting 2.0

880
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:23,640
is should we use lightning for comments or Activity Pub or whatever?

881
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:27,720
And Fountain has pushed ahead and gone right to lightning comments.

882
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:32,040
So now when someone sends a boost, unless they choose it to be private, that boost will

883
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:35,520
actually show up in the podcast when you're listening.

884
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:37,800
You can see other people's boost now.

885
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:43,880
And I think this has the potential to kind of create like a new cross app comments platform.

886
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:44,880
Yeah.

887
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:54,640
So for me, I have a very strong belief that making boosts public, obviously with the user's

888
00:48:54,640 --> 00:49:01,880
consent, adds so much to the podcast listening experience for a few reasons.

889
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:07,580
First off, I talked earlier about how we're enabling listeners to create clips so that

890
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:14,160
you as a listener get a signal about which episodes are actually valuable to go and listen

891
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,160
to.

892
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:21,960
Well, viewing somebody else's boost is an even better signal potentially, because not

893
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:28,480
only does it have a comment, probably thanking the host for the episode or, you know, asking

894
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:34,640
a question or clarifying something, that's a signal about how good that episode was.

895
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:40,880
But because there's a financial value attached to that comment, that's an incredibly even

896
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:42,320
higher signal.

897
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:49,200
So for example, if I follow you on Fountain, and I know that your average boost is around

898
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:56,920
2000 sats, and then one day, I see you pull out a 50,000 sat boost on an episode, I'm

899
00:49:56,920 --> 00:50:01,600
going to think to myself, hold on a minute, and a really long comment saying, Oh, my God,

900
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:02,600
thank you so much.

901
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:03,600
This episode was incredible.

902
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:04,600
I learned so much.

903
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:08,320
I'm going to think to myself, okay, hold on a minute, this is an episode that I need to

904
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:09,720
go and pay attention to.

905
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:12,240
So maybe I'll click through to the episode screen.

906
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,040
Maybe I'll read some of the other boosts.

907
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:18,680
And that at the end of the day, is just going to drive discovery for the podcaster and a

908
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:21,480
better listening experience for the listener.

909
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:28,480
So that's why we believe that having boost public and allowing interaction through lightning

910
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:31,280
is, yeah, that's why we think it's so good.

911
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:37,000
I know there is some contention around, you know, which is the right protocol to use for

912
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,440
cross app comments.

913
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:43,960
And I would also say that we're open to, you know, trying out different things and combining

914
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:44,960
protocols.

915
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:50,200
I think the reason we went ahead and just, you know, put this out there was just to test

916
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:51,200
it.

917
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:54,160
We were testing it for a few weeks in beta and people were loving it.

918
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:59,320
So yeah, I personally, I think it just makes the listener experience better and also drives

919
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:03,260
discovery for the podcaster and helps them get paid more as well.

920
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:07,440
Because if you go onto the episode screen and you see that the top boost is for 50,000

921
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:12,120
sats, are you going to boost 500 or are you going to boost closer to 50,000?

922
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:16,480
So at the end of the day, podcasters, if you publicize the top boost, you're going to get

923
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:17,480
paid more.

924
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:18,480
Yeah, I suppose so.

925
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:19,480
I suppose so.

926
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:21,320
All right, I've been I've switched over.

927
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:23,220
It is now my primary app.

928
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:28,020
And so now I got to do the thing where I asked for that one specific feature that I want.

929
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:31,600
But I actually have heard from a couple of members in the audience to how far off or

930
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:35,480
even likely is something like CarPlay support Android Auto for Fountain?

931
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:39,420
Yeah, so CarPlay is actually our number one requested feature.

932
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:41,320
And so it will be coming soon.

933
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:44,240
We've actually done a little bit of work on it.

934
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:51,840
But what we found was, what was it, yeah, I'll just say it's coming very soon.

935
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:57,840
And yeah, I would also say if anyone's listening who, you know, has tried out Fountain and,

936
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:01,820
you know, want something or want something changed, like we're really open to just we're

937
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:03,920
going to build whatever people want, basically.

938
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:05,180
So please do.

939
00:52:05,180 --> 00:52:08,800
We have a built in feedback tool in the app so you can use that.

940
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:13,120
Or you can just send me an email oscaratfountain.fm and yeah, we've got a lot coming.

941
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:17,160
But CarPlay is definitely on the roadmap and should be available soon.

942
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:18,160
That's exciting.

943
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:19,640
I was hoping that would be the answer.

944
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:22,680
Well, Oscar, thank you so much for the hard work.

945
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:23,680
Thank you.

946
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:24,680
Anyone else who's involved?

947
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:27,040
I'm not sure if it's a big team or not or a small team.

948
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:29,000
But thank you regardless.

949
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,880
It's been a long time since I've had a podcast app I'm this excited about.

950
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:34,640
So keep up the great work and we'll be sending people to Fountain.

951
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:43,600
It's great.

952
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:44,600
All right.

953
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:45,600
I see people getting in that matrix room.

954
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:47,680
Look at everybody showing up.

955
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:48,680
Excellent.

956
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:49,680
Very good.

957
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:50,680
All right.

958
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:51,680
So get your app.

959
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:54,500
I also I also have to say I really like Cast-O-Matic too.

960
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:57,820
If you go to newpodcastapps.com and you filter on the boost, you'll see there's even some

961
00:52:57,820 --> 00:53:03,800
decent web apps, which I never really considered using to listen to podcasts.

962
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:04,800
First.

963
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:05,800
Oh, that's an idea.

964
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:06,800
Yeah.

965
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:07,800
But you know what?

966
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:11,480
Like a part of it, I think I want my podcast app to have web playback because sometimes

967
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:15,080
I want to finish it up at my desk, you know, that's a nice feature.

968
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:16,080
Yeah, definitely.

969
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:20,360
So maybe the web podcast apps do make some sense and people have been sending us boosts

970
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:21,360
from the web app.

971
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:22,360
So people are using them.

972
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:27,080
So all the apps are listed at newpodcastapps.com but it was really nice of Oscar to take a

973
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:31,600
minute to join me because it was just sort of a last minute random idea.

974
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:36,520
And I did get a little scoop that CarPlay is in the works for Fountain FM.

975
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:41,560
So that is coming soon to Fountain FM and I think Android Auto as well.

976
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:43,560
That's the nice thing about Fountain is cross-platform.

977
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:49,020
The nice thing about Cast-O-Matic, it's iOS only, but it also does things like iCloud

978
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:55,840
sync and it'll import from several other podcast apps and it'll import an OPML feed too.

979
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:56,840
Which Fountain does not do.

980
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:57,840
Fountain does not do.

981
00:53:57,840 --> 00:53:58,840
Aww.

982
00:53:58,840 --> 00:53:59,840
I better make a request.

983
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:00,840
Yeah.

984
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:04,600
So Oscar is very open to ideas and like one of the things they just recently rolled out

985
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:06,720
which you heard us talking about there at the end is the comments.

986
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:12,760
So now the people who boost and use Fountain, you all can see your comments.

987
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:16,680
If like you go look and look, there's like you know a half a dozen or a dozen boosted

988
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:18,160
comments in there.

989
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:21,800
So let's kick this thing off and if you'd like to join me because these are going to

990
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:24,720
be up on the screen, they're going to be in the matrix chat.

991
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:29,720
If you're feeling generous and you want to boost along with us, you know match my boost,

992
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:30,960
go for it.

993
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:33,260
So here's what I'm asking everybody to do.

994
00:54:33,260 --> 00:54:39,560
Go either into Fountain or into Cast-O-Matic or whatever your new podcast app is and generate

995
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:43,800
me a lightning invoice and then Brent's going to keep track of them.

996
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:49,360
Don't paste the graphic because I'm not using a phone here.

997
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:52,040
I'm using what's called a personal computer.

998
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:53,560
I'm using a desktop computer.

999
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:54,560
With a mouse?

1000
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:55,560
Yeah.

1001
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:56,560
And a keyboard?

1002
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:59,040
And I want to highlight the lightning address and I can tell if it's a lightning address

1003
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:00,040
or not.

1004
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:02,760
I want to highlight the lightning address and I want to paste it into my thing and I

1005
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:04,640
want to send you some sats.

1006
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:08,720
So if you want to get my sats, I don't want the picture, I want the lightning address.

1007
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:12,280
What we're going to do is Brent's going to collect them all and we'll go through and

1008
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:14,320
we'll give them away until I'm out.

1009
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:19,200
I got a few hundred dollars worth of sats that I'm giving away and we'll just keep going.

1010
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:25,280
Generate a 2,000 or 1,000, either way, I'll pay it, depends, we'll see how far it goes.

1011
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:28,960
But I'm hoping other people might want to generate a few payments from home too.

1012
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:29,960
We'll see.

1013
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:30,960
I don't know.

1014
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:31,960
Maybe they won't.

1015
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:37,960
But remember, in some apps, you have to actually have the podcast up to get that boost button

1016
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:39,440
and get that payment information.

1017
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:43,720
So it's the best way to do it would be to subscribe to one of our podcasts because they

1018
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:47,880
all support lightning, except for the all shows feed, does not yet, but it will.

1019
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:50,400
And then you'll get the button.

1020
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:55,440
And you can then send us a lightning one, put it in the matrix in the JB General chat,

1021
00:55:55,440 --> 00:56:00,160
give us the text version so that way Brent can collect it and we'll start sending them

1022
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:01,160
out.

1023
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:04,080
And while you're getting that figured out, we'll just sort of chat and hang out because

1024
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:05,080
we're not in a rush today.

1025
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:08,240
That's why we did a live stream and not a show.

1026
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:14,320
So you're also welcome to send us questions, join the mumble room, ask us things there.

1027
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:17,160
Looks like people who are having trouble though connecting were able to get in.

1028
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:20,960
That's kind of what the logic was with that interview, was to give everybody a moment

1029
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:24,680
to get it all set up.

1030
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:29,120
Give it a moment, give our server a moment, you know, we're just trying to take it slow

1031
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:30,120
today.

1032
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:31,120
Right.

1033
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:32,120
Right.

1034
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:33,120
Right.

1035
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:34,120
I'm reading the feedback coming in.

1036
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:38,320
We got a live boost as I'm reading this.

1037
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:42,240
The new podcasting apps are working on live streaming, audio live streaming in the podcast

1038
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:45,520
app, which is really cool.

1039
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:48,080
Not there yet, but it's getting there.

1040
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:49,080
How are you doing, Brent?

1041
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:52,160
Are you over there collecting lightning addresses like a madman?

1042
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:53,160
There's a lot of stuff coming in.

1043
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:58,240
I just want to put out there, if I somehow miss your address, please get in contact with

1044
00:56:58,240 --> 00:56:59,240
me.

1045
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:04,440
Um, I don't know how that's going to work, but for some reason you don't see any.

1046
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:09,080
So I'm seeing them come in, but I know our server, you know, is missing some messages

1047
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:10,080
here and there.

1048
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:12,440
So I'm going to try my best to get everyone out, but if for some reason you feel like

1049
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:15,120
I might've missed you, just, uh, just DM me or something.

1050
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:16,120
Not now.

1051
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:17,120
Wait, wait a few hours.

1052
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:19,080
But you know what I'm going to do?

1053
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:23,860
I'm going to send, uh, I'm going to send some sats to Rubicamon right there, or however

1054
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:24,860
you say it.

1055
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:27,360
I have no idea how they actually say it, but there we go.

1056
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:30,280
We now have, I've just given away the sats so you think you get to choose how to say

1057
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:31,280
it.

1058
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:36,280
Oh, oh, oh, I like that.

1059
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:37,280
That's great, Wes.

1060
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:38,280
Man.

1061
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:39,280
I like it.

1062
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:40,280
I like the way you think.

1063
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:41,280
All right.

1064
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:42,280
So then this next one, I'm also going to butcher.

1065
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:44,700
I'm going to butcher this one because these are rough guys.

1066
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:45,700
These are rough.

1067
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:49,200
I'm going to send in 2000 sats to Alkarnie.

1068
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:50,200
That's right.

1069
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:51,200
I'm going to do it.

1070
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:52,200
I'm going to do it.

1071
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:53,200
There we go.

1072
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:54,200
I was thinking Alkarnie.

1073
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:55,200
Alkarnie.

1074
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:56,200
Yeah.

1075
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:57,200
Okay.

1076
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:58,200
Oh, now this is nice.

1077
00:57:58,200 --> 00:57:59,200
Look at this.

1078
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:00,200
How about this one?

1079
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:01,200
Very simple.

1080
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:02,200
Very straightforward.

1081
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:03,200
I appreciate this.

1082
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:04,200
You know what I'm going to do?

1083
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:05,200
I'm going to send some sats to Jody.

1084
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:06,200
This is fun.

1085
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:07,200
I could do this all day.

1086
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:09,360
I'm going to send 2000 sats to Jody.

1087
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:10,920
There you go, Jody.

1088
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:12,640
You just got boosted.

1089
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:16,240
Now somebody in there is calling themselves Joe.

1090
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:18,960
Hopefully it's the actual Joe, but it could be somebody trying to get on my good side,

1091
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:20,640
just calling themselves Joe.

1092
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:22,720
But either way, you know what?

1093
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:24,480
I'm going to send them 2000 sats.

1094
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:25,480
That's what I'm going to do.

1095
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:26,480
Done.

1096
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:27,480
I'm done.

1097
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:28,480
Oh, boy.

1098
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:29,480
This is a lot of fun.

1099
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:31,400
Oh, okay.

1100
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:34,640
This next one makes me think about Prospector Chris.

1101
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:35,840
So I like this one too.

1102
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:37,560
It's also very pronounceable.

1103
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:42,320
The next person that I'm giving away some sats to is Yosemite Sam.

1104
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:50,440
Yosemite Sam, you're going to get 2000 sats.

1105
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:51,760
This is good.

1106
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:56,000
I need like a monkey in here clapping or something.

1107
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,000
I need some kind of...

1108
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Here you go, everybody.

1109
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,000
That's a lot of monkeys.

1110
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
That's a lot of monkeys.

1111
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:05,880
We are the Oprah of crypto nonsense, Chris.

1112
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:09,360
You get a sat and you get a sat.

1113
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:14,040
They were under your seat the whole time.

1114
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:15,040
I like it.

1115
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:16,040
All right.

1116
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:17,040
You know what I'm going to do?

1117
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:18,040
Persistent.

1118
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:19,040
If that's how you say it.

1119
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:20,040
Probably not.

1120
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:21,040
You get 2000 sats.

1121
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:22,040
There you go.

1122
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:23,800
Brent, you're doing great.

1123
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:24,800
You're doing really good.

1124
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:25,640
You're keeping up pretty good.

1125
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:28,920
So we're just keeping an eye on the Matrix room.

1126
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:31,440
I can't top while keying in here.

1127
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:32,440
We're seeing a lot of action.

1128
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:33,440
I love it.

1129
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:34,440
Yeah.

1130
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:35,440
Oh, good.

1131
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:36,440
NorCalDad's here.

1132
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:39,160
NorCalDad, I'm tempted to come down to California.

1133
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:43,920
I wish I could do I wanted to be able to do a hell Linux fest and scale.

1134
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:48,600
I don't know about that problem with Ohio.

1135
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:53,360
I see in the chat Durban, you you've sent some looks like a part of an address, but

1136
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:54,360
not the whole thing.

1137
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:56,280
So if you want to send it again, we're looking for lightning addresses.

1138
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:57,280
I don't know.

1139
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:58,280
Maybe that's it says BC.

1140
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:01,240
So it might be a Bitcoin address.

1141
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:03,080
It's totally the cool thing.

1142
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:07,480
The cool thing about the lightning network is that it's actually being routed right to

1143
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:08,720
the studio direct.

1144
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:10,120
Yeah.

1145
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:15,000
And so let's send some to NorCalDad.

1146
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:18,000
NorCalDad gets a thousand stats.

1147
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,000
That's awesome.

1148
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Yeah.

1149
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,000
So get your whole lot.

1150
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,000
They're long.

1151
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:25,500
And you know, they're a lightning address because it starts with LN.

1152
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:28,200
And that's how you know, LNB.

1153
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:32,280
And if it starts with anything other than that, it's not a lightning address.

1154
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:38,600
You know, while we were doing the interview, I saw somebody say, oh, I think it was Austin.

1155
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:43,520
Austin reminded us in the matrix room that matrix is the protocol.

1156
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:46,560
Matrix is like HTTP, right?

1157
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:47,960
Synapse is the server.

1158
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:49,620
That's the back end that we use.

1159
01:00:49,620 --> 01:00:51,640
And element is the client.

1160
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:52,680
So it's like the web browser.

1161
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:54,360
That's your Firefox.

1162
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:58,680
And we just kind of casually say matrix server.

1163
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:01,400
It's you know, because I think that's just what everybody kind of refers to.

1164
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:02,960
You know, I don't know.

1165
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:03,960
Our bad, I guess.

1166
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:08,480
But so just to make that clear, there is like a there's like three layers there.

1167
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:12,120
The nice thing is, is that you can have different matrix back ends.

1168
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:16,400
So dendrite is another one that's being developed that solves some of the problems that synapse

1169
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:17,600
has.

1170
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:19,960
You can have different matrix front ends as well.

1171
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:23,720
And then you can have applications that plug into the matrix network.

1172
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:24,720
It's nice.

1173
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:25,720
All right.

1174
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:27,000
Let's do some let's do another set giveaway.

1175
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,640
So I'm going to give GX some sets.

1176
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:29,640
What do you say?

1177
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:30,720
Let's give GX.

1178
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:32,720
Let's give GX 1000 sets.

1179
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:35,040
There you go, GX.

1180
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:39,720
Computer guy, computer guy, not to be confused with computer kid.

1181
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:40,720
It's a race.

1182
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:41,720
I might boost computer guy right now.

1183
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:42,720
Oh, are you boosting too?

1184
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:43,720
I'm sneaking in with the boosts.

1185
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:44,720
Wes is doing some generous boosts.

1186
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:45,720
Very nice.

1187
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:46,720
Nice.

1188
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:47,720
Look at you, Wes.

1189
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:48,720
Look at you.

1190
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:49,720
Some double boosting going on.

1191
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:50,720
All right.

1192
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:51,720
Computer guy gets 2000 sets.

1193
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:52,720
Uh oh.

1194
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:53,720
Hold on.

1195
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:54,720
Computer guy says it doesn't like.

1196
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:55,720
Oh, it says.

1197
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:56,720
Oh, we've already paid that one.

1198
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:57,720
Oh, maybe we can only pay one invoice at a time.

1199
01:01:57,720 --> 01:01:58,720
Oh, that might be it.

1200
01:01:58,720 --> 01:01:59,720
I guess so.

1201
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:00,720
Yeah, that might be it.

1202
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:01,720
That might be it.

1203
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:06,720
Now, KPVoc already got some, but did he generate a new one?

1204
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:09,720
If he generated a new one, Wes, you ought to try...

1205
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:10,720
Oh, that's just...

1206
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:11,720
That might just be dirty.

1207
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:12,720
No, let him.

1208
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:13,720
No.

1209
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:14,720
It's fair.

1210
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:15,720
It's fair, I think.

1211
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:16,720
We just have to be careful.

1212
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:17,720
We just got to watch it.

1213
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:18,720
I'm like...

1214
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:22,040
Now, because I have to say the names out loud, I'm memorizing them as I go.

1215
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:24,440
And you have them here in the doc, so we can just review them.

1216
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:25,440
That's right.

1217
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:27,180
We're keeping track of you.

1218
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:28,180
We're keeping track.

1219
01:02:28,180 --> 01:02:29,180
All right.

1220
01:02:29,180 --> 01:02:30,180
Linux tweaks.

1221
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:31,180
Okay.

1222
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:32,180
All right.

1223
01:02:32,180 --> 01:02:33,180
Okay.

1224
01:02:33,180 --> 01:02:34,180
Linux.

1225
01:02:34,180 --> 01:02:36,440
Now, is that like tweaks in the sense of like you like to mess with Linux or is that tweaks

1226
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:40,320
in the sense of like you're tweaking out while you're messing with Linux?

1227
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:41,760
Either way, you're getting a thousand sats.

1228
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:42,760
That's right.

1229
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:43,760
I thought it was like...

1230
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:47,080
I first read Linux twerks, which is a little different.

1231
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:48,080
Yeah.

1232
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:49,080
Although probably also interesting.

1233
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:51,280
Ah, my new screen name.

1234
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:52,280
Excellent.

1235
01:02:52,280 --> 01:02:55,060
There's probably a YouTuber out there doing that.

1236
01:02:55,060 --> 01:02:57,800
You know, you can picture the stills already.

1237
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:59,520
The stills make themselves for that one.

1238
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:04,440
We got 20 people hanging out in the quiet listening right now, getting the low latency.

1239
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:05,440
Or 20 maybe total.

1240
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:06,440
Oh, geez.

1241
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:07,440
Maybe it's not actually...

1242
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:08,440
I'm starting to get blisters.

1243
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:09,440
Maybe 16.

1244
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:10,440
Is that what it is?

1245
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:11,440
Are you?

1246
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:12,440
Uh-oh.

1247
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:13,440
Oh, yeah.

1248
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:14,440
This is great.

1249
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:15,440
Keep it coming.

1250
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:16,440
I'll just put some, I don't know, therapeutic gloves on or something.

1251
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:17,440
Yeah.

1252
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:20,240
You know, we could have made like a whole millionaire thing out of this.

1253
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:25,840
We could have done the whole bit, playing up like game show music and seeing, you know...

1254
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:26,840
Yeah.

1255
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:31,000
It could be like a programmatic millionaire, you know, and then set up to just automatically

1256
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,000
send payments immediately.

1257
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,480
You don't have to wait to the end.

1258
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:35,880
It's like pays you sats as you go through the level.

1259
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:37,480
You know, there's some command line clients.

1260
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:38,840
You could probably make that work.

1261
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:40,840
You could probably just do it all with a nice bash script.

1262
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:41,840
You know what I'm saying?

1263
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:42,840
You could probably do that.

1264
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:43,840
Yeah.

1265
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:44,840
Yeah.

1266
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:45,840
All right.

1267
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:46,840
So I'm going to give Friar Tech.

1268
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:47,840
Friar Tech.

1269
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:48,840
Oh, Friar Tech.

1270
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:49,840
Oh, that's good.

1271
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:50,840
Friar, that's good.

1272
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:51,840
All right.

1273
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:52,840
You're getting a thousand sats.

1274
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:53,840
I like that.

1275
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:54,840
You got it.

1276
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:55,840
All right.

1277
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:56,840
Tim, you know what?

1278
01:03:56,840 --> 01:04:01,600
A nice, easy to say, not going to mess that one up username.

1279
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:03,640
I can appreciate that.

1280
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:05,160
So boy, you know what I could do?

1281
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:06,640
I could send you some sats for that.

1282
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:07,640
Thanks, Tim.

1283
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:09,160
You're getting a thousand sats.

1284
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:11,360
Oh, looks like Wes already got to them.

1285
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:12,360
It's a race, Wes.

1286
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:13,360
No, it's good.

1287
01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:14,360
You and I are in a race now.

1288
01:04:14,360 --> 01:04:15,360
I like it.

1289
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:16,360
This is awesome.

1290
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:17,360
I mean, it makes the sats go further, right?

1291
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:18,360
So this is a good thing.

1292
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:19,360
True.

1293
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:20,360
All right.

1294
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:21,360
So I'm coming in now on...

1295
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:22,360
What do you think?

1296
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:23,360
Ian?

1297
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:24,360
Ian?

1298
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:25,360
Oh, you already got that one too.

1299
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:26,360
All right.

1300
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:27,360
All right.

1301
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:28,360
I'm going for Durban.

1302
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:29,360
See if I can beat Wes Payne to Durban.

1303
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:30,360
Okay.

1304
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:31,360
How are you doing this so fast?

1305
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:32,360
What are you doing?

1306
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:34,960
Oh, I think I was going from the bottom for a moment.

1307
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:35,960
Oh, okay.

1308
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:36,960
All right.

1309
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:37,960
Okay.

1310
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:38,960
Great.

1311
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:39,960
All right.

1312
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:40,960
Well, Durban, you're getting 2,000 sats.

1313
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:41,960
How about that?

1314
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:42,960
Pow.

1315
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:43,960
How about that?

1316
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:44,960
You like them sats?

1317
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:45,960
And pew.

1318
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:46,960
There you go.

1319
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:47,960
Uh-oh.

1320
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:48,960
Moving too fast.

1321
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:49,960
I'm seeing...

1322
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:50,960
Yep.

1323
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:51,960
Redisk.

1324
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:52,960
Redisk, I think it is.

1325
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:56,080
I don't think that's a legit address if you compare yours to everybody else.

1326
01:04:56,080 --> 01:04:57,080
I don't know what's going on there.

1327
01:04:57,080 --> 01:04:59,440
There's no BC before it or anything.

1328
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:00,560
So give it another shot.

1329
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:03,040
We're looking for a lightning address.

1330
01:05:03,040 --> 01:05:04,040
You know what?

1331
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:05,040
Toad rocks boat.

1332
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:06,240
You're getting some sats.

1333
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:07,240
You're getting some sats.

1334
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:08,240
Pew.

1335
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:09,240
There you go.

1336
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:10,240
Eric, JB2.

1337
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:11,240
Keep rocking that boat.

1338
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:13,040
Now, what's with the JB2?

1339
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:15,500
What happened to your JB1?

1340
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:16,920
Why does it have a number at all?

1341
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:18,200
Did the first one have a number?

1342
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:21,720
No, that's just smart naming because you got to make break and changes sometimes.

1343
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:24,480
But if the first one didn't have a number, wouldn't this be one?

1344
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:26,160
Anyways, you're getting a thousand sats.

1345
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:27,160
Pew.

1346
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:28,160
However you want to do it, you're getting sats.

1347
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:29,840
It's implicit zero, Chris Zero.

1348
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:30,840
So what are you doing over there?

1349
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:31,920
Are you doing strike over there?

1350
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:32,920
Is that what you're doing?

1351
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:33,920
Yeah.

1352
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:37,020
Are you doing strike on the computer or are you doing strike on the mobile?

1353
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:38,560
Strike on the phone like a madman.

1354
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:39,560
Oh, yeah.

1355
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:41,880
You know, they do have a Chrome extension.

1356
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:42,880
Do they?

1357
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:43,880
Okay.

1358
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:44,880
Maybe I should try that.

1359
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:48,280
Uh, I'm a T-Link.

1360
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:49,280
Well Wes got you.

1361
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:50,280
So you're good.

1362
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:51,280
You got boosted.

1363
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:52,280
Okay.

1364
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:57,080
So by the way, if you're listening after the fact and Nev's in there again, if you're listening

1365
01:05:57,080 --> 01:06:01,680
after the fact and you want to just get yourself some sats the easy way, strike is a great

1366
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:03,240
way to do it if you're in the US.

1367
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:06,600
And outside the US, I really like Blue Wallet.

1368
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:11,220
It can be a little weird because the thing is, say Blue Wallet, for example, they use

1369
01:06:11,220 --> 01:06:13,660
moon pay and that sounds like a weird name.

1370
01:06:13,660 --> 01:06:18,320
And because they're regulated, they're going to ask for your ID because that's the law

1371
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:20,520
for the US terrorism and money laundering laws.

1372
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:25,460
So there is that DPG boom, you're getting 2000 sats.

1373
01:06:25,460 --> 01:06:26,460
That's right.

1374
01:06:26,460 --> 01:06:27,460
Pow.

1375
01:06:27,460 --> 01:06:28,460
How do you like that?

1376
01:06:28,460 --> 01:06:29,460
I'm coming for you next.

1377
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:30,460
J Moon.

1378
01:06:30,460 --> 01:06:32,580
Unless West gets there first coming in.

1379
01:06:32,580 --> 01:06:34,300
It's as fast as the extension can load.

1380
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:35,420
You know, is it fast?

1381
01:06:35,420 --> 01:06:36,420
Not that fast.

1382
01:06:36,420 --> 01:06:37,420
But is it faster than West's phone?

1383
01:06:37,420 --> 01:06:40,920
Yeah, so now I'm playing with the extension, so you got me distracted.

1384
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:41,920
Yeah.

1385
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:42,920
It syncs up your accounts.

1386
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:43,920
All right.

1387
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:44,920
J Moon.

1388
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:45,920
Guess what?

1389
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:46,920
You just got 2000 sats from Westpain over there.

1390
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:47,920
All right.

1391
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:48,920
Look at Westpain getting in fast.

1392
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:49,920
All right.

1393
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:50,920
You already got boosted.

1394
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:51,920
He's going again, isn't he?

1395
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:52,920
All right.

1396
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:53,920
I'm going to try it.

1397
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:54,920
I'm going to try it.

1398
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:55,920
I'm going to see if I can beat West to it.

1399
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:56,920
Now it's a matter of pride.

1400
01:06:56,920 --> 01:06:57,920
All right.

1401
01:06:57,920 --> 01:06:58,920
Let's see.

1402
01:06:58,920 --> 01:06:59,920
Can I get there before...

1403
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:00,920
Oh, West already got it.

1404
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:01,920
Damn it, West.

1405
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:02,920
You're fast.

1406
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:03,920
All right.

1407
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:04,920
Fred Warren.

1408
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:07,400
I'm coming in for you next.

1409
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:08,400
Let's see here.

1410
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:09,400
I'm going to boost you.

1411
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:11,400
I shouldn't say it out loud.

1412
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:12,400
My wrists are cramping up.

1413
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:13,400
This is great.

1414
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:14,400
You're doing great, Brent.

1415
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:15,400
All right.

1416
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:18,520
Fred, you just got boosted 1000 sats.

1417
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:19,520
There you go.

1418
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:20,520
All right.

1419
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:22,800
Sage is asking, how do you create an invoice on Fountain?

1420
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:26,040
You go to the wallet section on the bottom, you go to the wallet section, and then you

1421
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:29,640
can somehow ask for an invoice.

1422
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:31,280
And I think it's like receive payment or something.

1423
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:32,280
Yeah.

1424
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:34,480
Well, when you go into the wallet, that's a great...

1425
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:35,480
You know what?

1426
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:36,480
We should probably walk through this real quick.

1427
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:39,640
When you go into the Fountain app, you go to the wallet section.

1428
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:44,520
And then if you do the hamburger menu next to the wallet entry up top, it'll bring up

1429
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:46,880
a little thing where you say, add funds.

1430
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:49,920
And then from there, you generate us an invoice.

1431
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:54,800
And it's like, you know, it suffers from the hamburger menu problem.

1432
01:07:54,800 --> 01:08:01,460
But like I said with my chat with Oscar, it is stupid surprising how complex a podcast

1433
01:08:01,460 --> 01:08:06,120
app becomes when you start thinking about every screen and every aspect.

1434
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:09,160
And especially the stuff they're trying to add with transcript and live streaming and

1435
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:12,180
boosts and comments and clips.

1436
01:08:12,180 --> 01:08:16,240
But being able to edit the clips by text, how cool is that?

1437
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:17,240
That is...

1438
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:20,640
And I've now discovered two separate podcasts that I've listened to that I'd never even

1439
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:22,840
heard of before.

1440
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:25,120
So I like that.

1441
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:26,120
I like that.

1442
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:27,440
So is it slowing down, Brent?

1443
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:30,820
Because I still got more stats to give away.

1444
01:08:30,820 --> 01:08:32,080
People just got to get in that their...

1445
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:33,080
Yeah, it is slowing down.

1446
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:34,240
I think people are figuring it out.

1447
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:39,600
I'm, you know, twisting my wrist to try to get the blood flowing again.

1448
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:41,080
So keep it coming.

1449
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:43,400
We didn't get you back up hands, did we?

1450
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:45,000
Oh, hey, guess what?

1451
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,000
No.

1452
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,000
We got a new boost.

1453
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,000
Somebody just sent...

1454
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,720
Somebody just boosted us from the reverse.

1455
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:51,720
You get some stats.

1456
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:54,440
Comes in from 412 Linux.

1457
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:56,880
Nine minutes ago from Turquoise Fox.

1458
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:59,080
I could ask for some stats, but I'll pew you instead.

1459
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:03,480
Let's get this party going, 2,000 stats from Turquoise Fox.

1460
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:04,680
That's great.

1461
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:05,840
Thank you.

1462
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:10,640
Then five hours ago, we got a bunch of boosts for Linux Action News this week.

1463
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:13,760
So that's nice to see.

1464
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:18,520
User 6485 said, thank you for your diligence on keeping us up to date with Linux adjacent

1465
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:19,520
news.

1466
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:22,960
I'm not able to boost from the all shows feed, so I switched over here so I could boost you.

1467
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:24,120
James from the East Coast.

1468
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:25,520
Yeah, we're going to get that working.

1469
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:26,520
We are.

1470
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:29,000
Oh, and just look, another boost just came in.

1471
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,740
Not even related to the live stream.

1472
01:09:30,740 --> 01:09:31,740
We just got from...

1473
01:09:31,740 --> 01:09:32,740
Oh, no, Friar Tech.

1474
01:09:32,740 --> 01:09:33,740
Friar Tech is listening.

1475
01:09:33,740 --> 01:09:36,680
So Friar Tech just boosted us from self-hosted 66.

1476
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:39,120
Mmm, pie.

1477
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:40,120
That's awesome.

1478
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:41,840
So yeah, if you want to try boosting this, you can see if it works.

1479
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:44,000
Although the intention wasn't for you to necessarily send it back to us.

1480
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,240
You can send it to any podcast.

1481
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:50,100
But while you're listening, you'll see in one of these apps, you'll see that the button's

1482
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:53,240
there to boost, and that means that podcast is supported.

1483
01:09:53,240 --> 01:09:57,200
Now my thought is, oh, do we have a new one there?

1484
01:09:57,200 --> 01:09:58,200
We do.

1485
01:09:58,200 --> 01:09:59,200
Sage.

1486
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:02,480
Sage of Fredondo.

1487
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:05,720
What I just realized is I could possibly front run.

1488
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:07,200
That's what you're doing.

1489
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:08,200
You're front running me.

1490
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:09,200
You're front running me the matrix.

1491
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:10,200
Dirty, dirty dog.

1492
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:11,200
That's what you're doing.

1493
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:15,760
Oh, I'm waiting for the dog, and you're front running me.

1494
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:16,760
I see what you're doing.

1495
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:18,160
Why am I even doing the doc then?

1496
01:10:18,160 --> 01:10:19,360
No, you're doing great.

1497
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:20,360
You're doing great.

1498
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:21,360
All right, all right.

1499
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:22,360
I'll keep doing mine.

1500
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:23,360
I don't know if it's just me either.

1501
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:24,360
I didn't do that one.

1502
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:25,360
Oh, okay.

1503
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:27,040
Sage, you just got 2,000 sats.

1504
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:28,040
There you go.

1505
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:29,040
There you go.

1506
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:31,360
I see Kelz is in there too.

1507
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:32,360
Coming in now.

1508
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:33,360
There we go.

1509
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:34,860
Sage just got some sats.

1510
01:10:34,860 --> 01:10:35,860
Very nice.

1511
01:10:35,860 --> 01:10:36,860
What was I...

1512
01:10:36,860 --> 01:10:40,760
Oh, here's my thought with these new podcast apps.

1513
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:44,420
I don't know if I could say maybe there is feature complete as something like AntennaPod

1514
01:10:44,420 --> 01:10:51,200
or Overcast or maybe even Pocket Cast for some, especially because Pocket Cast has such

1515
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:59,280
a nice web UI, but my thinking is that if these other podcast apps start seeing people

1516
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:03,760
leave before these features, they're going to be compelled to build these features in,

1517
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:06,600
and then our favorite apps will get them.

1518
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:07,600
We can ask for them.

1519
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:10,040
We can vote with our feet.

1520
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:11,680
It's a part of a process, I think.

1521
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:12,680
All right.

1522
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:13,680
Let's see.

1523
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:14,680
Let's do...

1524
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:15,680
Oh, Optimus Gray coming in.

1525
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:16,680
Optimus Gray coming in.

1526
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:17,680
Yeah, all right.

1527
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:18,680
I'll let you have that one.

1528
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:19,680
Yeah, you know.

1529
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:20,680
Optimus Gray, you should do another one.

1530
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:21,680
You guys go way back.

1531
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:22,680
Optimus should do two.

1532
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:23,680
Do two, Optimus.

1533
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:24,680
Yeah, true.

1534
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:25,680
Do two.

1535
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:26,680
All right.

1536
01:11:26,680 --> 01:11:27,680
Optimus Gray, you're coming in right now.

1537
01:11:27,680 --> 01:11:32,560
Get ready for some sats in your face because I am sending you 2,000 sats right now.

1538
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:33,840
And it's great.

1539
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:38,560
It happens they get the sats before they even hear me tell them on the stream they're getting

1540
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:39,560
the sats, right?

1541
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:40,560
The Lightning Network is...

1542
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:41,560
Yeah, it's pretty great.

1543
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:44,280
It's faster than the stream.

1544
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:45,280
That's great.

1545
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:46,280
And way faster than our matrix.

1546
01:11:46,280 --> 01:11:49,400
Yeah, totally true.

1547
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:50,400
Totally true.

1548
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:51,400
All right.

1549
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:52,400
So, Brent, are you thumbs it up?

1550
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:53,600
Oh, I see.

1551
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:54,600
Good thinking, Brent.

1552
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:56,300
You're on top of this s.

1553
01:11:56,300 --> 01:11:58,320
That was an audience suggestion.

1554
01:11:58,320 --> 01:11:59,320
Thank you.

1555
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:00,320
All right.

1556
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:01,320
So...

1557
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:02,320
I forget who mentioned that, but that was a great idea.

1558
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:03,320
I did that one.

1559
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:04,320
I'm putting a little w there.

1560
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:05,320
Oh, I see.

1561
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:06,320
All right.

1562
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:07,320
So, K-pop round two, huh?

1563
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:08,320
All right.

1564
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:09,320
You know what?

1565
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:10,320
Let's do it.

1566
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:14,360
Round two for KP because, you know what?

1567
01:12:14,360 --> 01:12:15,360
He took the time tonight.

1568
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:16,360
Here you go.

1569
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:17,360
Here's 1,000 sats.

1570
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:22,480
I'ma to link, I'ma to link number two.

1571
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:24,400
Second round for I'ma to link.

1572
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:26,280
Let's get this going here.

1573
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:27,880
Let's get some money in these people's pocket.

1574
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:29,880
Let's support some content creators.

1575
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:32,600
Keep an eye out because this Lightning wallet, you don't have to just use it for podcasts

1576
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:33,600
too.

1577
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:34,600
It's anything on the Lightning Network.

1578
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:37,920
Merchants, I'm not sending you $45 in sats though, my friend.

1579
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:38,920
Nice try.

1580
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:39,920
Nice try.

1581
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:40,920
But I'm checking these.

1582
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:41,920
I'm checking these.

1583
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:47,480
So, you know, the whole idea here is you almost got it, but I'm checking them.

1584
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:48,480
True.

1585
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:52,800
So, the thing is, is you can send these to anybody on the Lightning Network.

1586
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:55,800
So that's not just the podcasters.

1587
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:59,680
That's anybody like a developer.

1588
01:12:59,680 --> 01:13:02,480
There's a new app that just launched in the App Store today.

1589
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:05,320
It's from the Bitcoin company, if you want to search for it.

1590
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:11,160
And it converts Lightning sats into gift cards for hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of

1591
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:12,640
different businesses and whatnot.

1592
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:13,640
That's cool.

1593
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:14,640
All right.

1594
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:17,120
So, I'm going to send a thousand sats right now to True Grits.

1595
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:19,520
A thousand sats coming to your face, True Grits.

1596
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:20,520
Here we go.

1597
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:21,520
Pew!

1598
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:22,520
There you go.

1599
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:23,840
GX round two.

1600
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:24,840
Is that US?

1601
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:25,840
Yeah.

1602
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:26,840
I'm on it.

1603
01:13:26,840 --> 01:13:27,840
All right.

1604
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:28,840
GX, you're getting your round two of sats.

1605
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:29,840
Very nice.

1606
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:30,840
Very good.

1607
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:32,920
All right.

1608
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:34,180
Half a pint.

1609
01:13:34,180 --> 01:13:35,440
You're going to get some sats.

1610
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:38,460
You want some sats half a pint, you're going to get some damn sats.

1611
01:13:38,460 --> 01:13:39,460
He wants some sats.

1612
01:13:39,460 --> 01:13:40,460
He's going to get some sats.

1613
01:13:40,460 --> 01:13:41,460
That's what I'm going to do right now.

1614
01:13:41,460 --> 01:13:43,000
I'm sending them over to you.

1615
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,000
Here we go.

1616
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,000
Two thousand sats.

1617
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Pew!

1618
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,000
There you go, half pint.

1619
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Speculation.

1620
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,360
I think your method is telling us the sats.

1621
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:51,240
I just get the USD amount.

1622
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:52,240
Oh, I'm doing the math.

1623
01:13:52,240 --> 01:13:53,240
I'm doing the math.

1624
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:54,240
You're doing the math.

1625
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:55,240
You're doing the math.

1626
01:13:55,240 --> 01:13:57,640
That's why it's taking you so long.

1627
01:13:57,640 --> 01:14:04,160
I see here there's speculation that half pint is Joe Rez stacking some sats over there.

1628
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:05,160
Could be.

1629
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:06,160
I like it.

1630
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:07,160
I like it.

1631
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:09,720
He's secretly stacking sats while we do this over there.

1632
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:12,720
Hey, Tim is asking, he says he didn't get his 1k.

1633
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:14,720
How dare you accuse me of such nonsense?

1634
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:15,720
Uh oh.

1635
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:16,720
I think it's true.

1636
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:21,320
What were you saying, Brent?

1637
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:24,240
Tim says that he hasn't received your 1k that you mentioned.

1638
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:25,240
Uh oh.

1639
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:27,920
His invoice was for 2k, so he's wondering what's going on.

1640
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:28,920
Tim, Tim, let's see.

1641
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:29,920
You got to check on Tim.

1642
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:30,920
I will check on Tim.

1643
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:32,880
Tim, that was a while ago too.

1644
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:34,640
So yeah, you totes-ma-goats should have it.

1645
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:35,640
Yeah, maybe.

1646
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:36,640
Should we get...

1647
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:37,640
Is it still on the dock or do we need to repost?

1648
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:38,640
Yeah, I'm going to go.

1649
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:39,640
I can check.

1650
01:14:39,640 --> 01:14:41,560
So the cool thing about the invoice is I can always just double check that.

1651
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:44,560
And of course, he could always just send us another one too, but let's double see.

1652
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:45,560
You're right.

1653
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:47,440
Oh no, it says it has been paid.

1654
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:48,440
Uh oh, Tim.

1655
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:49,720
What app are you using?

1656
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:50,720
Fountain?

1657
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:52,100
Give us another invoice, Tim.

1658
01:14:52,100 --> 01:14:53,160
Let's give it a go.

1659
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:54,160
Let's see it.

1660
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:56,320
Let's see if we can't give it a go over there.

1661
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:58,920
In the meantime, I think I'm going to go get Skin86.

1662
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:01,560
I think I'm getting there before you, Wes, but I'm not sure.

1663
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:02,560
Yeah.

1664
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:03,560
Now that you're not...

1665
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:05,240
You see, you're not front running me as much now.

1666
01:15:05,240 --> 01:15:06,240
I'm beating you now.

1667
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:07,240
I see.

1668
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:08,240
I see how it is.

1669
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:09,240
I see.

1670
01:15:09,240 --> 01:15:10,240
Oh shit, Skin.

1671
01:15:10,240 --> 01:15:11,240
Shit.

1672
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:15,560
I'm not going to say how much that is, but there you go.

1673
01:15:15,560 --> 01:15:16,560
I'm not doing that for any...

1674
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:17,560
I'm just...

1675
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:18,560
Wow.

1676
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:19,560
Wow.

1677
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:20,560
All right.

1678
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:21,560
Mac, you want round two?

1679
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:22,560
We'll give you round two.

1680
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:23,560
Give us...

1681
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:24,560
Now for these round twos, you know...

1682
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:25,560
I'm getting Mac.

1683
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:26,560
Okay.

1684
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:27,560
Mac, you got...

1685
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:28,560
Oh, this is fun.

1686
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:29,560
This is like...

1687
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:30,560
Okay.

1688
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:31,560
Rube.

1689
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:33,960
I'm going to do round two for Rube, but that's cool.

1690
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:34,960
Let's do it.

1691
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:37,480
I'm going to do round two for Rube here.

1692
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:39,480
I effing love the Lightning Network.

1693
01:15:39,480 --> 01:15:40,480
I love this.

1694
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:42,240
I love that I can tell if you guys already paid.

1695
01:15:42,240 --> 01:15:43,840
I love how fast it is.

1696
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:44,840
Pew.

1697
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:45,840
Bow.

1698
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:46,840
There you go, Rube.

1699
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:47,840
There you go.

1700
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:48,840
Enjoy that.

1701
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:49,840
Oh.

1702
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:50,840
Okay.

1703
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:54,360
So John Tux or Jonathan Tux, it was at...

1704
01:15:54,360 --> 01:15:55,360
Joan Tux?

1705
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:56,360
How would you say that?

1706
01:15:56,360 --> 01:15:59,560
Why is that screwing with me so much?

1707
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:00,560
I'd say Johan Tux.

1708
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:01,560
Ah, that might be what he means.

1709
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:02,560
That's just crazy.

1710
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:03,560
No?

1711
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:04,560
I like Johan.

1712
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:05,560
That's what we're going with.

1713
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:06,560
Remember?

1714
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:07,560
Johan.

1715
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:08,560
Two thousand sats for your face, my friend.

1716
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:09,560
Pew.

1717
01:16:09,560 --> 01:16:10,560
What if you don't want them in your face?

1718
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:11,560
Nev.

1719
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:12,560
How many times is Nev going to invite us?

1720
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:13,840
No, Nev says he hasn't actually gotten them.

1721
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:16,720
He says he still hasn't gotten any sats, and he included that address.

1722
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:19,000
So maybe it's a previous address.

1723
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,000
I'll try.

1724
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,000
Yeah.

1725
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,000
Give it a...

1726
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,000
That's your territory.

1727
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,000
Give it all Booster Roo there, Wes.

1728
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,000
Let's see.

1729
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,000
Pew.

1730
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:29,000
Oh, we just got 50 sats from KVoc.

1731
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,040
First boost from my favorite podcast.

1732
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:32,040
May it never go away again.

1733
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:33,040
Koda Radio.

1734
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:34,040
There you go.

1735
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:35,040
Thank you, sir.

1736
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:36,040
Thank you.

1737
01:16:36,040 --> 01:16:37,040
It's nice.

1738
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:38,040
It's nice.

1739
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:39,040
Well, okay.

1740
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:40,040
Wow.

1741
01:16:40,040 --> 01:16:42,480
Look at that.

1742
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:47,940
So now here's the thing is hang out in our matrix, chat with us, you know.

1743
01:16:47,940 --> 01:16:50,880
Don't be a stranger because you're going to have this now.

1744
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:51,880
All right.

1745
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:52,880
Fryer Tech, you ready for round two?

1746
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:53,880
You ready?

1747
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:54,880
What do you say?

1748
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:59,200
I feel like I still, again, this is such an opportunity for like a millionaire theme,

1749
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:03,720
but you know, it'd be a lot because we're sending a lot of sats out.

1750
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:04,720
I'm already peeing a lot.

1751
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:05,720
All right.

1752
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:06,720
2,000 sats for round two.

1753
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:09,240
That's a total of 4,000 sats for Fryer Tech.

1754
01:17:09,240 --> 01:17:10,240
Pew.

1755
01:17:10,240 --> 01:17:12,240
And then we already determined the term was Satotionaire.

1756
01:17:12,240 --> 01:17:13,240
Yeah, you're right.

1757
01:17:13,240 --> 01:17:14,240
You're right.

1758
01:17:14,240 --> 01:17:15,240
It is Satotionaire.

1759
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:18,760
I'm going to link again with this.

1760
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:19,760
Come on.

1761
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:20,760
I got that.

1762
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:21,760
Boom.

1763
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:22,760
Booster.

1764
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:23,760
Okay.

1765
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:24,760
All right.

1766
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:25,760
That's what this is going for.

1767
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:27,280
Very nice, Wes.

1768
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:29,640
It's for people who like to mess with computers.

1769
01:17:29,640 --> 01:17:30,640
That's us.

1770
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:31,640
All right.

1771
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:32,640
Dro's going for...

1772
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:33,640
What do you think?

1773
01:17:33,640 --> 01:17:34,640
Oh, no.

1774
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:35,640
Dr. Zo.

1775
01:17:35,640 --> 01:17:36,640
That's Dr. Zo for sure.

1776
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:37,640
I'm sorry.

1777
01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:38,640
I just spot read.

1778
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:39,640
Could be Zoey, but who's counting?

1779
01:17:39,640 --> 01:17:40,640
Could be.

1780
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:41,640
Could be Dr. Zoey too.

1781
01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:44,920
I'm a spot reader, so I just suck at this kind of stuff, but you're getting 2,000 sats.

1782
01:17:44,920 --> 01:17:46,400
So that probably makes it better, right?

1783
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:47,400
There you go.

1784
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:49,440
2,000 sats for you.

1785
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:55,080
Well, I thought maybe Linus Torvalds would stop by tonight.

1786
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:56,560
I mean, I don't know.

1787
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:57,560
I just thought maybe.

1788
01:17:57,560 --> 01:17:58,560
It seems like a long time.

1789
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:01,080
You send him an invite for every one of the streams.

1790
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:02,080
Yep.

1791
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:05,400
Yosemite Sam, because I liked your nick so much, you know what I'm going to do?

1792
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:06,960
I'm going to send you some more sats.

1793
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:10,040
How do you like that?

1794
01:18:10,040 --> 01:18:11,480
I just like that damn username.

1795
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:12,480
I think it's easy.

1796
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:14,920
So it was the first easy username of the night.

1797
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:15,920
So you're getting 2,000 more sats.

1798
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:16,920
Here you go.

1799
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:17,920
So desperate for an easy username.

1800
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:24,560
I'm going to incentivize easy usernames.

1801
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:26,640
What if the username includes its own phonetic pronunciation?

1802
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:28,960
Can it be more difficult then?

1803
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:31,720
So BeerDetect did that with his GitHub.

1804
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:37,600
If you go to his fever site, he does the phonetic pronunciation in the GitHub.

1805
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:39,760
Thinking about the podcasters are going to have to try to say it.

1806
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:40,760
It was great.

1807
01:18:40,760 --> 01:18:41,760
I appreciate that.

1808
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:45,400
It was like one of the first times I've ever opened it up, and I was like, oh, God bless

1809
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:46,400
you.

1810
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:47,520
Thank you so much for that.

1811
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:48,520
Yeah.

1812
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:49,520
All right.

1813
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:52,960
I think we're winding down, so these last few minutes, and then I think we're going

1814
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:54,440
to wrap it up here.

1815
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:55,440
Uh-oh.

1816
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:57,000
We want more.

1817
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:01,160
Toad Rocks the Boat for number two for Toad Rocks the Boat.

1818
01:19:01,160 --> 01:19:04,440
Going to bring it in for some sats for Mr. Rocks the Boat over there.

1819
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:05,440
A missus.

1820
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:06,440
Could be a missus, actually.

1821
01:19:06,440 --> 01:19:08,080
They are going to get 1,000 sats.

1822
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:10,080
Here you go, Toad.

1823
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:11,080
Enjoy.

1824
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:12,080
Enjoy.

1825
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:15,360
I see persistence coming back to the well again.

1826
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:16,360
Very good.

1827
01:19:16,360 --> 01:19:17,360
Very good.

1828
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:18,360
Very nice.

1829
01:19:18,360 --> 01:19:19,360
Bring it in.

1830
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:20,360
Bring it in.

1831
01:19:20,360 --> 01:19:21,360
We'll let Brent catch up.

1832
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:22,360
Sorry.

1833
01:19:22,360 --> 01:19:23,360
I was trying to...

1834
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:24,360
Someone mentioned IRC.

1835
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:25,360
I switched over there to look.

1836
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:26,360
Didn't see an address.

1837
01:19:26,360 --> 01:19:27,360
You're doing great.

1838
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:28,360
No.

1839
01:19:28,360 --> 01:19:30,080
People have been really awesome about being able to get in the matrix.

1840
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:31,560
It's not the easiest thing.

1841
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:32,880
We have the best audience.

1842
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:34,440
They are so great about that kind of stuff.

1843
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:39,520
You know, part of it, too, it's like I think you guys get that if we don't use this stuff,

1844
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:42,880
who is going to use this stuff, right?

1845
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:45,720
If we can't make it work, nobody can, right?

1846
01:19:45,720 --> 01:19:47,800
Because we are the early adopters.

1847
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:50,840
We are the people that love open source software and all that kind of stuff.

1848
01:19:50,840 --> 01:19:51,840
All right.

1849
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:52,840
Persistent.

1850
01:19:52,840 --> 01:19:53,840
I'm going to send you some more sats.

1851
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:54,840
What do you say?

1852
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:55,840
Because you've been so persistent.

1853
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:58,280
I'm sorry.

1854
01:19:58,280 --> 01:20:00,800
So you're getting 2,000 sats for putting up with my bad joke.

1855
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:01,800
Oh, Wes already got it.

1856
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:02,800
Oh, did I?

1857
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:03,800
Oh, maybe not.

1858
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:04,800
It says it's already paid.

1859
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:05,800
Okay.

1860
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:09,440
Well, I can't argue with the lightning network.

1861
01:20:09,440 --> 01:20:10,440
Somebody paid it.

1862
01:20:10,440 --> 01:20:11,440
I mean, I'll try again.

1863
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:12,440
But it did say...

1864
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:15,400
Here, maybe if I hit this button that says send all of my sats.

1865
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:16,400
Maybe then it'll go.

1866
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:17,400
Yeah.

1867
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:18,400
Nope.

1868
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:19,400
It says it got paid.

1869
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:20,400
Maybe they need to generate another invoice.

1870
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:21,400
Hmm.

1871
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:22,400
Another invoice.

1872
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:23,400
Hey, Nev finally got some.

1873
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:24,400
Good.

1874
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:25,400
I was worried about that.

1875
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:26,400
Good.

1876
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:27,920
Bearded Tech taking the extra time tonight to stop by.

1877
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:32,640
So Bearded Tech is going to get some sats coming your way in your face, Beard.

1878
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:33,640
Standby.

1879
01:20:33,640 --> 01:20:35,520
And great work on fever, by the way.

1880
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:36,520
Here's 1,000 sats.

1881
01:20:36,520 --> 01:20:37,520
There you go.

1882
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:38,520
Well, thank you, Chris.

1883
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:39,520
I appreciate it.

1884
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:44,920
Was that your phone buzzing getting the sats right there?

1885
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:45,920
That's great.

1886
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:46,920
VBO.

1887
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:47,920
How about some sats?

1888
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:48,920
Good.

1889
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:49,920
I'm glad you got in here.

1890
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:50,920
Vabotnik.

1891
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:51,920
Oh.

1892
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:53,960
Wes, you ought to take a shot at more of these.

1893
01:20:53,960 --> 01:20:54,960
That was good.

1894
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:55,960
All right.

1895
01:20:55,960 --> 01:20:56,960
There you go.

1896
01:20:56,960 --> 01:20:59,280
1,000 sats for your face.

1897
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:05,520
Sage is asking, who do we recommend that is a good other podcast that's participating

1898
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:08,000
in the lightning network that they can send sats to?

1899
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:12,040
So I mean, you know, each one of these apps actually will let you...

1900
01:21:12,040 --> 01:21:16,600
So this is another advantage to podcasts getting on board with this is the podcast apps that

1901
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:22,060
support the boosts and the value for value in their discover areas are featuring the

1902
01:21:22,060 --> 01:21:24,000
value for value podcast sections.

1903
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:28,640
So a lot of them have like podcasts that are on lightning or podcasts that support value

1904
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:30,480
value, and it's a much shorter list.

1905
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:31,600
So a lot of them just have it all built in.

1906
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:34,600
I would check that out.

1907
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:39,820
And of course, you can go to the podcast index, too, and you can search over there as well,

1908
01:21:39,820 --> 01:21:40,820
as well.

1909
01:21:40,820 --> 01:21:41,820
Oh, guess what, guys?

1910
01:21:41,820 --> 01:21:43,400
I just got a boost.

1911
01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:50,480
This one came in from user 4007 using Fountain, next OS on my desktop, my laptop, and I'm

1912
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:52,560
now working on deploying it on my server.

1913
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:53,560
Nicely done.

1914
01:21:53,560 --> 01:21:54,560
What?

1915
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:55,560
The laptop, huh?

1916
01:21:55,560 --> 01:21:56,560
All right.

1917
01:21:56,560 --> 01:21:57,560
I'm getting prescient again.

1918
01:21:57,560 --> 01:21:58,560
All right.

1919
01:21:58,560 --> 01:21:59,560
You're gonna get persistent.

1920
01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:00,560
Very good.

1921
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:01,560
Yep.

1922
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:02,560
Very good.

1923
01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:03,560
Thank you.

1924
01:22:03,560 --> 01:22:04,560
Dude, I got it.

1925
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:05,560
Xamarin, Xamarin.

1926
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:06,560
Who knows, right?

1927
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:07,560
You can't.

1928
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:08,560
Who knows?

1929
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:09,560
You can't tell these things.

1930
01:22:09,560 --> 01:22:11,840
Is it the open source Nvidia driver?

1931
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:12,840
The Navu driver?

1932
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:13,840
The Navu driver?

1933
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:14,840
The...

1934
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:15,840
Perfect.

1935
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:21,040
Barely works, I think is how I say it.

1936
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:22,840
I think that's how I say it.

1937
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:23,840
Novo.

1938
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:24,840
Yeah, thank you.

1939
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:25,840
Thank you.

1940
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:26,840
You know, that's what we need, Joe.

1941
01:22:26,840 --> 01:22:29,840
We need a record recording of that just on the sound.

1942
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:33,640
No, we just need Joe on mumble for these things, really.

1943
01:22:33,640 --> 01:22:34,640
Let's be honest.

1944
01:22:34,640 --> 01:22:35,640
You can just pronounce them.

1945
01:22:35,640 --> 01:22:36,640
All right.

1946
01:22:36,640 --> 01:22:37,640
So Linux tweaks is gonna top off.

1947
01:22:37,640 --> 01:22:38,640
And I think that's a good idea.

1948
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:40,560
Who doesn't want to top off?

1949
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:41,840
Let's top Linux tweaks off.

1950
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:43,400
There you go.

1951
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:44,400
Here we go.

1952
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:45,400
Here we go.

1953
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:47,360
Gonna send you some sats, Linux tweets.

1954
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:49,120
Thank you for joining us today.

1955
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:50,800
There you go.

1956
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:52,240
You're gonna get some damn sats.

1957
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:53,640
There you go.

1958
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:54,640
Just topped them off.

1959
01:22:54,640 --> 01:22:57,400
Rounded them up to 2,000 bucks right there, 2,000 sats.

1960
01:22:57,400 --> 01:22:59,520
Maybe 2,000 bucks one day.

1961
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:01,280
Hey, you do have at least one kernel to that.

1962
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:02,280
Well, that's awesome.

1963
01:23:02,280 --> 01:23:03,280
Thank you for being here.

1964
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:04,280
Hello.

1965
01:23:04,280 --> 01:23:10,720
You know, it might sound insane, but I think I would really want my app that I'm using

1966
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:12,560
to make the pew noise every time.

1967
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:14,680
It like feels a little empty without it.

1968
01:23:14,680 --> 01:23:17,040
A couple of them do confetti and stuff like that.

1969
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:21,200
A couple of them do kind of like, you know, really do turn it up.

1970
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:22,960
Oh, we just got another boost.

1971
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:28,400
Another boost came back into us, 500 sats from Rubikuman.

1972
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:29,400
Love the show, guys.

1973
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:30,400
Keep it up.

1974
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:31,400
Sent from Linux Unplugged 451.

1975
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:32,400
Well, thank you.

1976
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:34,920
How are you doing over there, Brent?

1977
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:35,920
You holding up?

1978
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:38,720
Hey, that was our first sat receiver of the day too.

1979
01:23:38,720 --> 01:23:39,720
Nice.

1980
01:23:39,720 --> 01:23:40,720
I'm in the flow.

1981
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:41,720
Don't bother me while I'm in the flow.

1982
01:23:41,720 --> 01:23:42,720
Sorry.

1983
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:43,720
Sorry.

1984
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:44,720
Sorry.

1985
01:23:44,720 --> 01:23:45,720
Sorry.

1986
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:46,720
You're right.

1987
01:23:46,720 --> 01:23:47,720
You're right.

1988
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:48,720
No, you're right.

1989
01:23:48,720 --> 01:23:49,720
You're right.

1990
01:23:49,720 --> 01:23:50,720
All right.

1991
01:23:50,720 --> 01:23:51,720
All right.

1992
01:23:51,720 --> 01:23:52,720
I think you know what we should do.

1993
01:23:52,720 --> 01:23:53,720
I think it's time for the last round.

1994
01:23:53,720 --> 01:23:59,480
So I'm going to get DPG for the second time because nice, simple username again.

1995
01:23:59,480 --> 01:24:02,680
I think that always deserves some sats.

1996
01:24:02,680 --> 01:24:03,680
You going to get Skinner?

1997
01:24:03,680 --> 01:24:04,680
All right.

1998
01:24:04,680 --> 01:24:05,680
Skinner.

1999
01:24:05,680 --> 01:24:06,680
All right.

2000
01:24:06,680 --> 01:24:11,680
We're going to send out 1,000 sats to DPG.

2001
01:24:11,680 --> 01:24:14,280
Skinner, you're getting some sats from Wes.

2002
01:24:14,280 --> 01:24:15,280
There you go.

2003
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:17,280
Sats coming your way.

2004
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:21,720
Hey, Preshant says he's going to set up a Numbril server he's excited to work with soon.

2005
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:22,720
Oh, that's great.

2006
01:24:22,720 --> 01:24:23,720
So this is an intro to that.

2007
01:24:23,720 --> 01:24:24,720
Neat.

2008
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:25,720
All right.

2009
01:24:25,720 --> 01:24:26,720
And Nev, I think you know what?

2010
01:24:26,720 --> 01:24:27,720
All right, Brent.

2011
01:24:27,720 --> 01:24:29,840
You tell us when you want to pick the last one.

2012
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:30,840
I think we're there though.

2013
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:34,800
I think we're real close because I've seen a lot of number round twos and stuff now.

2014
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:35,800
So I feel like-

2015
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:37,880
True Grits just came in and he was looking to double dip.

2016
01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:39,880
So I think that's a good place to go.

2017
01:24:39,880 --> 01:24:40,880
All right.

2018
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:42,320
Let's do a little double dip there.

2019
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:45,200
Little dirty double dip.

2020
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:47,440
And Nev, I'm going to give you some there.

2021
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:48,440
There you go.

2022
01:24:48,440 --> 01:24:49,760
Enjoy that.

2023
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:53,960
Here's what I'm thinking is if somebody is listening to this after the fact or they couldn't

2024
01:24:53,960 --> 01:24:57,440
get it set up today because of some technical challenge, let me know on Sunday.

2025
01:24:57,440 --> 01:25:02,260
We could do a few more giveaways during the Linux Unplugged stream after the show.

2026
01:25:02,260 --> 01:25:05,760
And I think that would probably, you know, maybe we can catch a few people that either

2027
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:11,520
couldn't make it tonight because it's a work night or it's a weird hour or whatever.

2028
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:12,520
Literally midnight.

2029
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:13,520
Yeah.

2030
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:14,520
So we'll do this.

2031
01:25:14,520 --> 01:25:15,520
We do Linux Unplugged.

2032
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:18,500
We'll do this again for a few at least on Sunday.

2033
01:25:18,500 --> 01:25:20,120
And that starts at noon Pacific.

2034
01:25:20,120 --> 01:25:24,440
But remember, you can always get it converted to your local time at jupiterbroadcasting.com

2035
01:25:24,440 --> 01:25:25,440
slash calendar.

2036
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:27,680
Did you get true grits there, Wes?

2037
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:28,680
I sure did.

2038
01:25:28,680 --> 01:25:29,680
There you go.

2039
01:25:29,680 --> 01:25:30,680
True grits.

2040
01:25:30,680 --> 01:25:32,360
There you have it.

2041
01:25:32,360 --> 01:25:34,040
Someone mentioned that logic.

2042
01:25:34,040 --> 01:25:35,040
Didn't get any.

2043
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:36,040
I'm not sure.

2044
01:25:36,040 --> 01:25:40,440
So I think someone's helping out trying to get it to me.

2045
01:25:40,440 --> 01:25:41,440
So we'll see what we can do.

2046
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:42,440
OK.

2047
01:25:42,440 --> 01:25:43,440
All right.

2048
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:45,280
You keep me posted on that because we do have a couple of questions.

2049
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:48,200
We do want to do a little AMA stuff before we get out of here.

2050
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:50,920
We don't have a ton of these, but we do have some.

2051
01:25:50,920 --> 01:25:52,760
So let's keep an eye on there and keep an eye on there.

2052
01:25:52,760 --> 01:25:53,760
Let me know if there's any.

2053
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:54,760
Wow.

2054
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:55,760
That's a lot.

2055
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:56,760
That's a lot.

2056
01:25:56,760 --> 01:25:57,760
Damn.

2057
01:25:57,760 --> 01:25:59,920
We destroyed our duck.

2058
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:00,920
That's great.

2059
01:26:00,920 --> 01:26:01,920
Yeah.

2060
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:02,920
No, that's great.

2061
01:26:02,920 --> 01:26:03,920
OK.

2062
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:06,080
So I just I do want to I just want to address one thing.

2063
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:10,200
And that is I know some people probably nobody listening to this stream have enjoyed the

2064
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:12,200
crypto content as it's been called.

2065
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:13,840
I don't really consider it that.

2066
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:14,840
The boosts are new.

2067
01:26:14,840 --> 01:26:15,840
Right.

2068
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:17,920
So we've been talking about it a lot right now because the boost just kind of became

2069
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:18,920
a thing.

2070
01:26:18,920 --> 01:26:20,840
Podcasting 2.0 is just becoming a thing.

2071
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:23,000
The podcast industry is getting crushed.

2072
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,040
Like all those things are happening at once.

2073
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:27,280
So it's been a real trendy topic in the show.

2074
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:29,200
So we do have some people that have some questions about that.

2075
01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:31,120
So I wanted to get to a couple of those.

2076
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:32,120
Number one came in.

2077
01:26:32,120 --> 01:26:36,640
This has been asked a few times is if you are a member of the Jupiter Party subscription

2078
01:26:36,640 --> 01:26:41,480
or any of the individual show subscriptions, the boost options.

2079
01:26:41,480 --> 01:26:47,840
Don't show up for our members because those are custom feeds for each member that's generated

2080
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:52,640
by a back end service and they don't support inserting the value for value tag.

2081
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:57,000
Now, I didn't really expect people who were members would then want to turn around and

2082
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:00,960
boost a bunch, but it has definitely become a thing.

2083
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:02,600
So it's something we're thinking about.

2084
01:27:02,600 --> 01:27:06,360
We are definitely thinking about ways to accommodate that, but it's not immediately addressable.

2085
01:27:06,360 --> 01:27:12,120
It probably involves something big on the back end to change.

2086
01:27:12,120 --> 01:27:14,680
There was also a question about Linux boost apps.

2087
01:27:14,680 --> 01:27:17,720
That's probably best done with web apps.

2088
01:27:17,720 --> 01:27:21,800
We're also looking at ways to like embed links in the web pages and the websites or something

2089
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:22,800
like that.

2090
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:28,420
There are some command line alternatives too if you want to get real nerdy about it.

2091
01:27:28,420 --> 01:27:33,800
We do get a handful of boosts on the regular from people that are using a command line

2092
01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:36,000
boost client, Boost CLI.

2093
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:41,840
And you can go grab Boost CLI on GitHub and then you don't need a podcast app or anything.

2094
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:43,680
You just send it from the command line.

2095
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:44,680
And then we'll try to-

2096
01:27:44,680 --> 01:27:46,880
Internet connection, your bash terminal, good to go.

2097
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:49,920
Put it in your Guake drop down terminal, right?

2098
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:50,920
I mean, come on.

2099
01:27:50,920 --> 01:27:51,920
Yeah.

2100
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:54,240
Does that mean the wallet is a CLI app too?

2101
01:27:54,240 --> 01:27:55,240
I guess so.

2102
01:27:55,240 --> 01:27:57,480
You've got to play with that.

2103
01:27:57,480 --> 01:27:58,480
I guess so.

2104
01:27:58,480 --> 01:28:02,480
Yeah, I guess it would must generate an address that you just send the lightning sats to.

2105
01:28:02,480 --> 01:28:04,320
Probably should play with it.

2106
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:09,280
Okay, so I found Logix invoice and Lord of Bytes snuck one in there.

2107
01:28:09,280 --> 01:28:10,280
Okay.

2108
01:28:10,280 --> 01:28:11,280
If you guys get around to that.

2109
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:12,280
Are they at the bottom of the dock there?

2110
01:28:12,280 --> 01:28:13,280
Oh, yeah.

2111
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:14,280
The very bottom.

2112
01:28:14,280 --> 01:28:15,280
Scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll.

2113
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:16,280
Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.

2114
01:28:16,280 --> 01:28:17,280
All right.

2115
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:18,280
You get Lord of Bytes there, Wes.

2116
01:28:18,280 --> 01:28:19,280
What do you say?

2117
01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:20,280
And I'll get Logix.

2118
01:28:20,280 --> 01:28:21,280
All right.

2119
01:28:21,280 --> 01:28:22,280
All right, Logix.

2120
01:28:22,280 --> 01:28:28,040
We're going to send you some damn sats and Lord of Bytes, you're going to get some sats.

2121
01:28:28,040 --> 01:28:29,040
Okay.

2122
01:28:29,040 --> 01:28:30,040
Here.

2123
01:28:30,040 --> 01:28:31,040
Oh, oh, oh.

2124
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:32,040
All right.

2125
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:33,040
Here you go.

2126
01:28:33,040 --> 01:28:38,480
I'm not going to say how much that was.

2127
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:40,280
And Lord of Bytes, your sats.

2128
01:28:40,280 --> 01:28:42,400
There you go.

2129
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:46,680
Pryor also mentioned that he stayed late at work to participate in this and that someone

2130
01:28:46,680 --> 01:28:51,960
should call his wife, too.

2131
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:52,960
She has a wallet.

2132
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:55,840
You know, if she's got a lightning wallet, we can send her some sats to try and pick

2133
01:28:55,840 --> 01:28:56,840
up.

2134
01:28:56,840 --> 01:28:57,840
Totally, right?

2135
01:28:57,840 --> 01:29:03,560
By the way, I really like if you want a lightning wallet that isn't a podcast app, BlueWallet

2136
01:29:03,560 --> 01:29:04,560
is a great app.

2137
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:05,560
What a sentence that is.

2138
01:29:05,560 --> 01:29:06,560
I know, right?

2139
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:09,600
It's a funny thing, but it's going to become more and more of a thing.

2140
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:13,320
So we're also working on getting the value for value tag added to the all shows feed.

2141
01:29:13,320 --> 01:29:16,920
So that'll be coming soon because people are bailing off the all shows feed to subscribe

2142
01:29:16,920 --> 01:29:18,080
to the individual show feed.

2143
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:19,200
So that way they can boost us.

2144
01:29:19,200 --> 01:29:21,200
That's not necessarily what we want.

2145
01:29:21,200 --> 01:29:24,360
So we're going to be working on that soon.

2146
01:29:24,360 --> 01:29:27,880
And yes, and then the idea is to really not really talk about it as much in the shows

2147
01:29:27,880 --> 01:29:28,880
anymore.

2148
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:31,060
That's just something that's just sort of been organically happening as boosts have

2149
01:29:31,060 --> 01:29:32,760
been new.

2150
01:29:32,760 --> 01:29:33,760
And here's the tricky thing.

2151
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:35,920
Because we get excited about it and play with it.

2152
01:29:35,920 --> 01:29:36,920
True.

2153
01:29:36,920 --> 01:29:37,920
True.

2154
01:29:37,920 --> 01:29:39,680
And there is genuinely, as you can tell from tonight, there is genuine interest in the

2155
01:29:39,680 --> 01:29:44,840
audience because the goal here, right, is to create another leg for the podcast industry

2156
01:29:44,840 --> 01:29:47,000
so we can remain independent.

2157
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:52,000
And when you have this issue of centralization that's crushing us and then something that

2158
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:58,640
comes along that is peer to peer and completely decentralized and completely self-hostable

2159
01:29:58,640 --> 01:30:05,940
and completely free software, if I genuinely felt after 15 years that my industry was facing

2160
01:30:05,940 --> 01:30:09,920
an existential crisis, how could I not talk about it?

2161
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:11,740
So there's a little bit of that, too.

2162
01:30:11,740 --> 01:30:13,160
That does play a factor.

2163
01:30:13,160 --> 01:30:17,620
But I think we're going to just transition now into this is just sort of a standard practice.

2164
01:30:17,620 --> 01:30:23,020
We're going to try to feature the most compelling boosts in the shows as a thank you, as a return

2165
01:30:23,020 --> 01:30:24,340
of value for there.

2166
01:30:24,340 --> 01:30:29,120
And the other thing to really consider here is there's other ways to participate, and

2167
01:30:29,120 --> 01:30:34,080
it's for all podcasts that you really love, that demonstrate value that is not necessarily

2168
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:38,760
sats, you know, like Minimax shows up at all kinds of different crazy hours to help us

2169
01:30:38,760 --> 01:30:42,040
manage the mumble room and help people check their microphones.

2170
01:30:42,040 --> 01:30:46,400
And that makes a huge difference for our mumble room, for how it runs and the quality of what

2171
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:47,400
we get on air.

2172
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:48,400
It's huge, right?

2173
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:49,400
No kidding.

2174
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:52,320
That's more valuable than sats.

2175
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:53,960
It's different ways of doing things.

2176
01:30:53,960 --> 01:30:57,480
So the whole idea, it's talent, time, or treasure.

2177
01:30:57,480 --> 01:31:02,800
And for a lot of us who are busy, the treasure is the most reasonable and quickest accessible

2178
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:03,800
way.

2179
01:31:03,800 --> 01:31:09,360
And you say, well, OK, well, why sats over, say, just some fiat by becoming a member or

2180
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:10,760
some other kind of thing?

2181
01:31:10,760 --> 01:31:14,320
To that, I would say it really depends on what you are the most comfortable with.

2182
01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:16,880
Whatever you prefer, we're great with.

2183
01:31:16,880 --> 01:31:21,960
What we like about the Lightning Network and sats is that, A, it can be less than a dollar

2184
01:31:21,960 --> 01:31:23,320
if you choose.

2185
01:31:23,320 --> 01:31:28,240
That wouldn't be viable with any financial system, any bank system that JB could work

2186
01:31:28,240 --> 01:31:29,240
with.

2187
01:31:29,240 --> 01:31:31,480
The fees alone would be more than that $1, right?

2188
01:31:31,480 --> 01:31:38,160
So it kind of needs to be like $3 or $5 or $20, right, because there's a chunk that all

2189
01:31:38,160 --> 01:31:42,320
the people, Stripe takes or whoever it is, the bank takes, Visa takes, everybody gets

2190
01:31:42,320 --> 01:31:43,320
a cut with that.

2191
01:31:43,320 --> 01:31:47,920
But with the Lightning Network, it's stupid low fees, especially people participating

2192
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:49,540
in the podcast index network.

2193
01:31:49,540 --> 01:31:50,960
The channel fees are really low.

2194
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:54,980
So people can send us a few cents, or people can send us $50.

2195
01:31:54,980 --> 01:31:58,200
And that $50 is something that we would probably sit on, because I'm not really intending to

2196
01:31:58,200 --> 01:31:59,920
spend any of this Bitcoin.

2197
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:04,680
And we would sit on there and use that as an asset that adds value to not only our balance

2198
01:32:04,680 --> 01:32:08,560
sheet, but is potentially going to grow in value over time.

2199
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:15,640
So your $50 that you sent us maybe today could be worth $100 in a year or two.

2200
01:32:15,640 --> 01:32:21,400
And okay, yeah, you lost out on 50 bucks plus the gains, but also your one-time $50 donation

2201
01:32:21,400 --> 01:32:26,860
continued to work for multiple years for the podcast network that you like.

2202
01:32:26,860 --> 01:32:29,440
And so there's multiple motivations.

2203
01:32:29,440 --> 01:32:31,540
It could be for really cheap reasons.

2204
01:32:31,540 --> 01:32:35,720
It can be for strategic investment reasons, but it doesn't have to be SaaS.

2205
01:32:35,720 --> 01:32:37,080
It could be time.

2206
01:32:37,080 --> 01:32:38,560
It could be talent.

2207
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:40,080
It could also be memberships.

2208
01:32:40,080 --> 01:32:42,080
It could be using our sponsors.

2209
01:32:42,080 --> 01:32:46,520
It could be sharing our shows with people, all of that stuff.

2210
01:32:46,520 --> 01:32:49,400
And I think that's where we're going to kind of move the conversation in the future.

2211
01:32:49,400 --> 01:32:53,680
So I appreciate everybody's patience as we got this.

2212
01:32:53,680 --> 01:32:54,920
I boosted about Nyx OS.

2213
01:32:54,920 --> 01:32:55,920
Oh, okay.

2214
01:32:55,920 --> 01:32:56,920
That was your boost.

2215
01:32:56,920 --> 01:33:01,040
So for the record, Nev's boost about Nyx OS on the laptop, desktop, and now on the servers,

2216
01:33:01,040 --> 01:33:03,720
that was Nev.

2217
01:33:03,720 --> 01:33:09,200
Keep us posted on how that goes because I am thinking it could make some nice workstation

2218
01:33:09,200 --> 01:33:11,920
type machines.

2219
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:15,360
We had a tax question in here, so let's talk about that really quick because this is something

2220
01:33:15,360 --> 01:33:19,040
that doesn't come up a lot, and I think this is something everybody needs to think about.

2221
01:33:19,040 --> 01:33:20,040
So I don't-

2222
01:33:20,040 --> 01:33:21,920
As you know, we are tax experts.

2223
01:33:21,920 --> 01:33:23,160
Yeah, yeah.

2224
01:33:23,160 --> 01:33:26,780
This is 100% always financial advice, and you should do everything that I say.

2225
01:33:26,780 --> 01:33:27,780
And I am a tax...

2226
01:33:27,780 --> 01:33:28,780
No, I'm not.

2227
01:33:28,780 --> 01:33:29,780
No, of course not.

2228
01:33:29,780 --> 01:33:31,560
That's why we turn to our Canadian friend, Brent, with an expert in our American tax

2229
01:33:31,560 --> 01:33:32,560
system.

2230
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:33,560
Right.

2231
01:33:33,560 --> 01:33:36,440
Yeah, my advice is seek advice.

2232
01:33:36,440 --> 01:33:38,720
Nice, dude.

2233
01:33:38,720 --> 01:33:40,960
Okay, so the tax implications.

2234
01:33:40,960 --> 01:33:45,380
So Bitcoin is a property.

2235
01:33:45,380 --> 01:33:46,380
It's considered by the...

2236
01:33:46,380 --> 01:33:49,000
I know this is going to be different everywhere you're at, but it's considered by the IRS

2237
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:50,000
property.

2238
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:55,280
So there is implications if you buy Bitcoin, and then you sit on that Bitcoin, and that

2239
01:33:55,280 --> 01:33:59,400
Bitcoin goes up in value.

2240
01:33:59,400 --> 01:34:03,640
You have some tax ramifications there, just like if you bought anything else that's an

2241
01:34:03,640 --> 01:34:06,240
asset that goes up in value.

2242
01:34:06,240 --> 01:34:11,480
Now I think that exposure is pretty low when it's a couple of bucks, and then you spend

2243
01:34:11,480 --> 01:34:12,840
it immediately, so there's that.

2244
01:34:12,840 --> 01:34:16,200
Now I don't know for sure, but I think that means it's pretty much a pretty low exposure

2245
01:34:16,200 --> 01:34:21,380
because you're selling it and buying at exactly the same price.

2246
01:34:21,380 --> 01:34:27,320
So there's a whole range of questions and answers that we're all going to start getting

2247
01:34:27,320 --> 01:34:29,640
over the next couple of years about this.

2248
01:34:29,640 --> 01:34:34,820
Literally every major Western government is working on regulations and figuring out tax

2249
01:34:34,820 --> 01:34:37,040
policies right now.

2250
01:34:37,040 --> 01:34:38,500
So this is all getting sorted out.

2251
01:34:38,500 --> 01:34:43,960
We are definitely early adopters in this area, but as somebody who has been experimenting

2252
01:34:43,960 --> 01:34:50,420
with this for about 12 years, what I have found is it's basically quite simple.

2253
01:34:50,420 --> 01:34:54,720
You hold the Bitcoin, and if you're going to spend the Bitcoin, you buy and spend the

2254
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:56,320
Bitcoin kind of immediately.

2255
01:34:56,320 --> 01:34:59,440
And that's kind of where I think Lightning is sort of great, because you can with Strike,

2256
01:34:59,440 --> 01:35:05,180
for example, you could buy it with USD right away, it immediately on the back end converts

2257
01:35:05,180 --> 01:35:08,880
it to Lightning, so it's exactly at the moment of sale, and it's sent off as Lightning and

2258
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:09,880
it's done.

2259
01:35:09,880 --> 01:35:12,500
So they convert it instantaneously.

2260
01:35:12,500 --> 01:35:16,720
And I think that is probably what is going to be adopted going forward.

2261
01:35:16,720 --> 01:35:21,840
And additionally, and when I say adopted, I mean like that kind of instant buy and spend

2262
01:35:21,840 --> 01:35:25,560
where you're not sitting on the Bitcoin for a year before you spend it, so there wasn't

2263
01:35:25,560 --> 01:35:26,560
like a gain there.

2264
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:28,380
I think that's going to become more common.

2265
01:35:28,380 --> 01:35:31,840
But then the other thing that's also going to possibly develop, we don't know if the

2266
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:35,060
dollar amount is going to be yet, but again, this is US specific because that's the jurisdiction

2267
01:35:35,060 --> 01:35:40,320
I know, is there's presently a bill in the Senate that would eliminate all capital gains

2268
01:35:40,320 --> 01:35:46,040
tax on $600 or below, any transaction $600 or below.

2269
01:35:46,040 --> 01:35:50,320
The number, the dollar amount is going to get screwed with, I would not be surprised

2270
01:35:50,320 --> 01:35:53,480
if they cut it in half, so it's like $300 or something like that.

2271
01:35:53,480 --> 01:35:57,620
But that is also something that's been, and the nice thing about that bill is it seems

2272
01:35:57,620 --> 01:36:02,800
to be, I'd have to double check, but it seems to be there's bipartisan support behind that

2273
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:03,800
one.

2274
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:11,960
So, and last but not least, you could also, if you're not comfortable with that aspect,

2275
01:36:11,960 --> 01:36:15,680
you could always just join a membership program like jupyter.party, and you get access to

2276
01:36:15,680 --> 01:36:16,680
that stuff.

2277
01:36:16,680 --> 01:36:21,440
Ultimately, ultimately, I want to get access to this kind of stuff, I want to try to figure

2278
01:36:21,440 --> 01:36:24,840
out a system that's really integrated, but it's all new, it's all early.

2279
01:36:24,840 --> 01:36:29,820
It's sort of like a year ago with Matrix, we weren't really sure if this was a wild

2280
01:36:29,820 --> 01:36:34,480
science experiment, or if this was the future of how we're going to do communication.

2281
01:36:34,480 --> 01:36:36,720
And now we're starting to lean towards the latter.

2282
01:36:36,720 --> 01:36:41,840
And with boost and value for value, I'm starting to really think, okay, how do I want this

2283
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:44,320
to work for the next 15 years?

2284
01:36:44,320 --> 01:36:47,640
So I'm beginning a 15-year journey now.

2285
01:36:47,640 --> 01:36:51,160
You're all witnessing the beginning of the next 15 years of JB, it's something I think

2286
01:36:51,160 --> 01:36:52,440
about a lot recently.

2287
01:36:52,440 --> 01:36:56,200
I think in part just because I hit 40, and in part because we kind of hit the two-year

2288
01:36:56,200 --> 01:37:01,280
mark of being independent, and also because the ad industry is changing, and also because

2289
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:05,160
the whole macro economy is a total shit show.

2290
01:37:05,160 --> 01:37:12,760
So all of these things really are on my mind, and I can see a lot of similarities here.

2291
01:37:12,760 --> 01:37:19,520
Bitcoin and the Lightning Network are about at 1997 right now.

2292
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:20,520
That's where they're at.

2293
01:37:20,520 --> 01:37:28,600
You know, you're on AOL or CompuServe or whatever, and you're getting connected to old chat rooms.

2294
01:37:28,600 --> 01:37:30,800
That's where we're at right now with Bitcoin.

2295
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:36,040
And if you actually overlay the Bitcoin adoption chart with the internet adoption chart, it's

2296
01:37:36,040 --> 01:37:38,760
incredible how they sync up.

2297
01:37:38,760 --> 01:37:43,000
The Bitcoin has the advantage of the entire network is already there.

2298
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:46,200
TCPIP is already in every home and every business.

2299
01:37:46,200 --> 01:37:49,260
The internet didn't have that advantage, it had to build that out.

2300
01:37:49,260 --> 01:37:51,080
So it's going to go even faster.

2301
01:37:51,080 --> 01:37:56,200
But we're about at 1997, and we're starting to get things like Strike, we're starting

2302
01:37:56,200 --> 01:38:00,580
to get things like the Cash App, we're going to start seeing Apple Pay support and things

2303
01:38:00,580 --> 01:38:01,580
like Strike.

2304
01:38:01,580 --> 01:38:06,800
It's going to get easier and easier as time goes on, but we're still in that early adopter

2305
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:08,100
phase right now.

2306
01:38:08,100 --> 01:38:13,280
And so that's why I'm getting on board, because I was an early adopter on Linux.

2307
01:38:13,280 --> 01:38:23,440
You know, I spent so much of my career advocating and convincing people that Linux and free

2308
01:38:23,440 --> 01:38:26,240
software wasn't a scam.

2309
01:38:26,240 --> 01:38:33,440
And I regret in some ways that I got out of the industry before I got to enjoy just it

2310
01:38:33,440 --> 01:38:36,640
being the default and assumed.

2311
01:38:36,640 --> 01:38:39,760
I never stuck around long enough to see that, because I switched over to podcasting full

2312
01:38:39,760 --> 01:38:40,760
time.

2313
01:38:40,760 --> 01:38:45,800
But when I switched over to podcasting full time, that was also really new, right?

2314
01:38:45,800 --> 01:38:50,400
It was really not something that anybody in our space was doing full time.

2315
01:38:50,400 --> 01:38:53,460
Not really any podcasters were doing it full time when I started doing it.

2316
01:38:53,460 --> 01:38:57,960
Maybe Leo Leport by then, maybe.

2317
01:38:57,960 --> 01:39:02,040
Maybe Adam Curry, I would assume, I mean, like just a handful of folks, right?

2318
01:39:02,040 --> 01:39:08,200
It was really early and I think some of my very close family members still don't understand

2319
01:39:08,200 --> 01:39:09,200
what I'm doing.

2320
01:39:09,200 --> 01:39:10,200
And they think I'm crazy.

2321
01:39:10,200 --> 01:39:11,200
They think I'm ridiculous.

2322
01:39:11,200 --> 01:39:12,200
Right?

2323
01:39:12,200 --> 01:39:13,200
It's just sort of been that way.

2324
01:39:13,200 --> 01:39:16,000
And I think there's some of our, I think some of our audience or some of our audience out

2325
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,880
there that kind of has a little bit of an early adopter streak in them.

2326
01:39:18,880 --> 01:39:21,240
Not all of them, but I think some, right?

2327
01:39:21,240 --> 01:39:22,240
It's fun.

2328
01:39:22,240 --> 01:39:23,880
It's fun to help pioneer some of this stuff.

2329
01:39:23,880 --> 01:39:27,880
Yeah, you get to be on the ground floor to see what things work and obviously not everything

2330
01:39:27,880 --> 01:39:28,880
does right?

2331
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:33,480
There's the latest new open source tech project that is really excited for two years and then

2332
01:39:33,480 --> 01:39:35,640
the founders move on or the project gets bought or whatever, right?

2333
01:39:35,640 --> 01:39:38,920
And it's going to be totally the same in a lot of the spaces that we get excited about

2334
01:39:38,920 --> 01:39:39,920
with technology.

2335
01:39:39,920 --> 01:39:40,920
Yep.

2336
01:39:40,920 --> 01:39:41,920
Yeah.

2337
01:39:41,920 --> 01:39:44,960
We're going to watch sort of a dot com boom and bust kind of all over again.

2338
01:39:44,960 --> 01:39:46,000
That's pretty neat.

2339
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:49,560
And so now hopefully you've been armed.

2340
01:39:49,560 --> 01:39:52,720
So we have a couple that haven't been, that haven't gotten their Bitcoins.

2341
01:39:52,720 --> 01:39:55,100
It looks like people, a couple of people didn't get their SATs.

2342
01:39:55,100 --> 01:39:57,180
So we'll make good on those and I think we're going to wrap it up.

2343
01:39:57,180 --> 01:39:58,180
So Brent, where are those ones?

2344
01:39:58,180 --> 01:39:59,440
Are they at the bottom of the dock?

2345
01:39:59,440 --> 01:40:04,640
Yeah, I kind of separated where you guys sort of stopped talking about them at the late

2346
01:40:04,640 --> 01:40:05,880
boost it says.

2347
01:40:05,880 --> 01:40:09,720
So a few, a few folks there we've sent some to already, but a few folks are new.

2348
01:40:09,720 --> 01:40:10,720
Late boost.

2349
01:40:10,720 --> 01:40:11,720
Jupiter.

2350
01:40:11,720 --> 01:40:12,720
How do you say that one?

2351
01:40:12,720 --> 01:40:16,400
Do you think Brent Jupiter Barrera Barrera?

2352
01:40:16,400 --> 01:40:17,400
Yeah.

2353
01:40:17,400 --> 01:40:19,840
I mean, that's, that's, I mean, that's a great name.

2354
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:20,840
That's rad.

2355
01:40:20,840 --> 01:40:21,840
That's really rad.

2356
01:40:21,840 --> 01:40:22,840
Yep.

2357
01:40:22,840 --> 01:40:23,840
Yep.

2358
01:40:23,840 --> 01:40:24,840
All right.

2359
01:40:24,840 --> 01:40:25,840
And Tuck's getting an error with fountain.

2360
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:26,840
Interesting.

2361
01:40:26,840 --> 01:40:27,840
I haven't seen that one.

2362
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:28,840
But did you already get Barrera?

2363
01:40:28,840 --> 01:40:29,840
Cause Barrera has already been GAT.

2364
01:40:29,840 --> 01:40:30,840
I don't know.

2365
01:40:30,840 --> 01:40:35,160
I've gotten a couple, but I, that, that name doesn't look familiar.

2366
01:40:35,160 --> 01:40:37,840
Now, Elliot, what client is Elliot using?

2367
01:40:37,840 --> 01:40:41,760
Because look how Elliot's address is formatted differently than everybody else's.

2368
01:40:41,760 --> 01:40:42,760
You seeing that?

2369
01:40:42,760 --> 01:40:44,080
It's just slightly different.

2370
01:40:44,080 --> 01:40:45,080
It's all uppercase.

2371
01:40:45,080 --> 01:40:46,080
Huh.

2372
01:40:46,080 --> 01:40:48,080
I wonder what client that is.

2373
01:40:48,080 --> 01:40:51,440
Elliot, do you, do you want to share with the class?

2374
01:40:51,440 --> 01:40:53,680
You're getting a, you're getting a boost though.

2375
01:40:53,680 --> 01:40:54,680
There you go.

2376
01:40:54,680 --> 01:40:59,600
I also noticed that some addresses are longer than others, so I'm curious about how that

2377
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:00,600
all works.

2378
01:41:00,600 --> 01:41:01,600
Hmm.

2379
01:41:01,600 --> 01:41:02,600
Hmm.

2380
01:41:02,600 --> 01:41:03,600
Should we give Tim some umbral love?

2381
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:04,600
What do you say?

2382
01:41:04,600 --> 01:41:05,600
Give it a shot.

2383
01:41:05,600 --> 01:41:06,600
I might've got that one.

2384
01:41:06,600 --> 01:41:07,600
You might've?

2385
01:41:07,600 --> 01:41:08,600
All right.

2386
01:41:08,600 --> 01:41:09,600
I'll see.

2387
01:41:09,600 --> 01:41:10,600
I'll see.

2388
01:41:10,600 --> 01:41:11,600
I'll check.

2389
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:12,600
I'll check.

2390
01:41:12,600 --> 01:41:13,600
Cause if you didn't, I'll get it.

2391
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:14,600
Cause that's the nice thing is it'll tell me if you got it.

2392
01:41:14,600 --> 01:41:15,600
Nope.

2393
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:16,600
2000 stats going to you, Tim.

2394
01:41:16,600 --> 01:41:18,520
There you go.

2395
01:41:18,520 --> 01:41:19,520
There you go.

2396
01:41:19,520 --> 01:41:23,320
I've lost track of how many times some of these people, we're not even in the double

2397
01:41:23,320 --> 01:41:25,000
dip territory anymore.

2398
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:26,000
I don't think.

2399
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,240
Oh, unable to find the payment route.

2400
01:41:28,240 --> 01:41:29,240
Okay.

2401
01:41:29,240 --> 01:41:33,680
So, so if you just got your umbral box set up, you probably need to open up some inbound

2402
01:41:33,680 --> 01:41:35,140
channels.

2403
01:41:35,140 --> 01:41:37,160
What an adventure you're about to go on.

2404
01:41:37,160 --> 01:41:38,160
Yeah, really.

2405
01:41:38,160 --> 01:41:39,160
We had fun with that.

2406
01:41:39,160 --> 01:41:41,960
I remember we said this was early adopter stuff.

2407
01:41:41,960 --> 01:41:45,680
So what you want is there are a couple of different places where you can give them like

2408
01:41:45,680 --> 01:41:50,680
some, some Bitcoin dust basically, and they'll open up an inbound channel to you.

2409
01:41:50,680 --> 01:41:52,040
That's what you need.

2410
01:41:52,040 --> 01:41:55,720
You need an inbound channel cause it's a, it is a peer to peer network.

2411
01:41:55,720 --> 01:42:01,080
Now there are tools in umbral if I've never done this, but if you want to, there is an

2412
01:42:01,080 --> 01:42:02,080
app.

2413
01:42:02,080 --> 01:42:05,720
You can install the number that lets you bid on channels and you can buy and sell channel

2414
01:42:05,720 --> 01:42:09,340
access and it's a little way to make a little extra money on the side.

2415
01:42:09,340 --> 01:42:12,520
But I figured I don't need to mess with any of that.

2416
01:42:12,520 --> 01:42:13,520
So all right.

2417
01:42:13,520 --> 01:42:14,520
Yeah.

2418
01:42:14,520 --> 01:42:15,520
Okay.

2419
01:42:15,520 --> 01:42:16,520
Did you get connected to Chris?

2420
01:42:16,520 --> 01:42:17,880
I know there's, well, podcasting 2.0, right?

2421
01:42:17,880 --> 01:42:24,560
Yeah, and I also, I took advantage of like a send us, send us like a cup, a little dust

2422
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:29,680
and we'll open up a channel to you and then some listeners and I have opened up some channels.

2423
01:42:29,680 --> 01:42:33,340
So I think I got like six channels now to our six or seven channels that come into our

2424
01:42:33,340 --> 01:42:35,920
node now, like a bus.

2425
01:42:35,920 --> 01:42:39,620
And I, if I, if I was really thinking ahead, I probably would be posting our node address

2426
01:42:39,620 --> 01:42:42,960
more so we could have more channels because the more channels you're connected to the

2427
01:42:42,960 --> 01:42:47,120
different routes, the lightning network can find and it'll, you know, always try to find

2428
01:42:47,120 --> 01:42:49,120
the most efficient route.

2429
01:42:49,120 --> 01:42:51,360
And then it's, you know, all set up and ready to go.

2430
01:42:51,360 --> 01:42:52,360
It's a cool thing.

2431
01:42:52,360 --> 01:42:53,360
It's a pretty neat thing.

2432
01:42:53,360 --> 01:42:57,160
It is complicated, but it is also a lot of fun.

2433
01:42:57,160 --> 01:43:00,960
Uh oh, we got one more boost before we get out of here.

2434
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:01,960
What?

2435
01:43:01,960 --> 01:43:02,960
Secret last boost?

2436
01:43:02,960 --> 01:43:03,960
Oh, we got two.

2437
01:43:03,960 --> 01:43:04,960
We just got another boost too.

2438
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:11,440
Just as I, so a couple of minutes ago from a sir lurks a lot, I guess, from a self hosted

2439
01:43:11,440 --> 01:43:14,200
67, the no container theory episode.

2440
01:43:14,200 --> 01:43:16,440
This is my first boost, Tim from the AMA.

2441
01:43:16,440 --> 01:43:17,440
Thanks.

2442
01:43:17,440 --> 01:43:18,440
Well, there you go, Tim.

2443
01:43:18,440 --> 01:43:19,440
You're welcome.

2444
01:43:19,440 --> 01:43:23,480
And then, uh, John, that's the best username so far, I think Jonah tucks, I think is what

2445
01:43:23,480 --> 01:43:24,480
we went with.

2446
01:43:24,480 --> 01:43:28,680
Jonah tucks, uh, just boosted us 500 sats for the next SOS challenge.

2447
01:43:28,680 --> 01:43:34,320
Uh, and then a turquoise Fox just sent one in, uh, says I managed to send you two payments

2448
01:43:34,320 --> 01:43:35,640
with the same question.

2449
01:43:35,640 --> 01:43:37,200
So enjoy the extra sats.

2450
01:43:37,200 --> 01:43:42,680
And then I think, uh, I'm not sure if Bitcoin social is actually watching live.

2451
01:43:42,680 --> 01:43:44,240
I think he just sent us a boost for coder.

2452
01:43:44,240 --> 01:43:50,320
He's watching live, but, uh, he says Chris Rock can say whatever he wants.

2453
01:43:50,320 --> 01:43:52,120
I have no idea what he's referring to.

2454
01:43:52,120 --> 01:43:53,120
No, no idea.

2455
01:43:53,120 --> 01:43:56,400
Uh, and then, oh, we got a question that came in via boost.

2456
01:43:56,400 --> 01:43:57,400
I'm sorry guys.

2457
01:43:57,400 --> 01:43:59,080
I, we just got another one.

2458
01:43:59,080 --> 01:44:03,680
Uh, so turquoise Fox wants to know if the Jupiter Jupiter membership will ever be available

2459
01:44:03,680 --> 01:44:06,560
via sats, uh, because I don't like the credit card requirement.

2460
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:07,560
Yeah.

2461
01:44:07,560 --> 01:44:09,480
That is probably something we're going to work on eventually.

2462
01:44:09,480 --> 01:44:10,480
That's a great question.

2463
01:44:10,480 --> 01:44:11,480
Yeah.

2464
01:44:11,480 --> 01:44:12,480
Yeah.

2465
01:44:12,480 --> 01:44:13,480
Yeah.

2466
01:44:13,480 --> 01:44:14,480
That's a great question.

2467
01:44:14,480 --> 01:44:22,480
500 sats just came in from user 78 0 0 6 6 4 2 8 1 1 3 0 7 0.

2468
01:44:22,480 --> 01:44:24,920
Love the show and all you do for the community.

2469
01:44:24,920 --> 01:44:26,720
This is a great way to get us on the network.

2470
01:44:26,720 --> 01:44:28,200
Well, thank you.

2471
01:44:28,200 --> 01:44:29,200
Thank you.

2472
01:44:29,200 --> 01:44:30,200
Oh yeah.

2473
01:44:30,200 --> 01:44:32,480
I will totally plug Bitcoin dad pod.

2474
01:44:32,480 --> 01:44:37,360
It's a what's I'm doing a weekly Bitcoin podcast with the Bitcoin dad.

2475
01:44:37,360 --> 01:44:42,920
So you can get that at Bitcoin dad pod dot fireside dot FM.

2476
01:44:42,920 --> 01:44:47,720
Rocks just boosted us said thanks for the content, the challenge and the channel.

2477
01:44:47,720 --> 01:44:48,720
Awesome.

2478
01:44:48,720 --> 01:44:49,720
Another boost just came in.

2479
01:44:49,720 --> 01:44:50,720
Wow.

2480
01:44:50,720 --> 01:44:51,760
You guys love the show.

2481
01:44:51,760 --> 01:44:52,760
Thank you.

2482
01:44:52,760 --> 01:44:53,760
Thank you.

2483
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:54,760
All right.

2484
01:44:54,760 --> 01:44:55,760
We got to wrap it up though.

2485
01:44:55,760 --> 01:44:57,520
Uh, but yeah, keep sending them boosts on the boosts.

2486
01:44:57,520 --> 01:44:58,520
Yeah.

2487
01:44:58,520 --> 01:44:59,520
Keep boosting.

2488
01:44:59,520 --> 01:45:02,000
Can you send some to a, can you send a little love to Mac?

2489
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
I think he just finally got shirt setups.

2490
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:05,000
Totally.

2491
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:06,000
Good, good, good, good job back.

2492
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:07,000
I'm glad.

2493
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,120
I'm glad we were able to take our time with this cause I know some of this is a bit of

2494
01:45:09,120 --> 01:45:12,880
a process and kind of being here with you guys while we do this.

2495
01:45:12,880 --> 01:45:15,760
Gives us an idea of where the sticky spots are.

2496
01:45:15,760 --> 01:45:17,760
So there you go, Mac.

2497
01:45:17,760 --> 01:45:20,680
You just got some sets.

2498
01:45:20,680 --> 01:45:22,200
Thank you for making it work.

2499
01:45:22,200 --> 01:45:26,520
Well, maybe, maybe it's trying unable to find the payment route.

2500
01:45:26,520 --> 01:45:27,560
So Mac, you might be on it.

2501
01:45:27,560 --> 01:45:32,880
So you could tell who's on a self hosted instance because it's not working.

2502
01:45:32,880 --> 01:45:35,320
I'll try again, but it may not work Mac.

2503
01:45:35,320 --> 01:45:40,560
You may need some inbound liquidity or you may need to set it up in a, uh, it could also

2504
01:45:40,560 --> 01:45:47,640
be, oh, you know, I wonder if we just used up the inbound liquidity for LN pay that which

2505
01:45:47,640 --> 01:45:49,160
fountain uses.

2506
01:45:49,160 --> 01:45:54,320
I wonder if we just, yeah, we might've just, cause we've been, we've been going for a while

2507
01:45:54,320 --> 01:45:55,780
sending a lot of stats.

2508
01:45:55,780 --> 01:45:59,440
So, um, that could totally be a thing, which is, oh, that's okay.

2509
01:45:59,440 --> 01:46:01,360
We're going to do this again on Sunday, Mac.

2510
01:46:01,360 --> 01:46:06,280
So if you'd like to stop by on Sunday, remind me and, uh, we'll get you taken care of.

2511
01:46:06,280 --> 01:46:07,280
That's true for anybody.

2512
01:46:07,280 --> 01:46:10,040
Cause it looks like we've literally, oh yeah.

2513
01:46:10,040 --> 01:46:11,040
I'm here.

2514
01:46:11,040 --> 01:46:12,040
Yeah.

2515
01:46:12,040 --> 01:46:13,040
We've worn out our welcome.

2516
01:46:13,040 --> 01:46:14,280
We have worn out our welcome on that one.

2517
01:46:14,280 --> 01:46:15,280
Just in time.

2518
01:46:15,280 --> 01:46:16,280
Yeah.

2519
01:46:16,280 --> 01:46:17,280
You know what?

2520
01:46:17,280 --> 01:46:18,920
I got to say, um, I want to do a shout out to Elliot.

2521
01:46:18,920 --> 01:46:21,480
He says he's paying some stats for other people.

2522
01:46:21,480 --> 01:46:24,040
So, oh, thanks Elliot.

2523
01:46:24,040 --> 01:46:25,040
Yeah.

2524
01:46:25,040 --> 01:46:26,040
Pretty great.

2525
01:46:26,040 --> 01:46:29,320
I was going to say too, is that sometimes other people could get the route depending

2526
01:46:29,320 --> 01:46:31,320
on your channels and all of that.

2527
01:46:31,320 --> 01:46:36,120
Um, something that I'll probably learn more about as it becomes more serious, but you

2528
01:46:36,120 --> 01:46:38,360
can also be strategic about your channels.

2529
01:46:38,360 --> 01:46:44,080
There's some people who, uh, also are like really, really clever about who they open

2530
01:46:44,080 --> 01:46:45,840
up channels to and how they set the fees.

2531
01:46:45,840 --> 01:46:50,440
Uh, the Kraken exchange just started accepting lightning as a way to get Bitcoin on and off

2532
01:46:50,440 --> 01:46:51,440
Kraken.

2533
01:46:51,440 --> 01:46:52,440
Is that right?

2534
01:46:52,440 --> 01:46:55,600
And that seems like one of the bigger things, you know, like the more places that really

2535
01:46:55,600 --> 01:46:59,680
integrate into this, you know, the more liquidity in the system, that's when it could really

2536
01:46:59,680 --> 01:47:03,120
get, you know, from like something we have to put kind of play around with this as a

2537
01:47:03,120 --> 01:47:05,800
half toy to something that's really just useful.

2538
01:47:05,800 --> 01:47:09,320
I think they put like 13 Bitcoin of liquidity on there too.

2539
01:47:09,320 --> 01:47:10,320
Nice.

2540
01:47:10,320 --> 01:47:14,680
Yeah, there's some people though, they're like connecting their channels and they're

2541
01:47:14,680 --> 01:47:18,240
like cranking up the fees, but all that will get sorted out, you know, cause it's early

2542
01:47:18,240 --> 01:47:19,240
days.

2543
01:47:19,240 --> 01:47:20,240
So, all right.

2544
01:47:20,240 --> 01:47:22,720
Well, thank you guys for being here to help us kick off the next 15 years.

2545
01:47:22,720 --> 01:47:27,320
Don't forget if you'd like to do more of this, one way to definitely make this possible

2546
01:47:27,320 --> 01:47:32,840
is by thanking Linode by visiting linode.com slash Jupiter, you get a hundred dollar credit

2547
01:47:32,840 --> 01:47:33,840
on a new account.

2548
01:47:33,840 --> 01:47:36,720
And it's a way to say thanks for supporting the live stream because they're kind of taking

2549
01:47:36,720 --> 01:47:38,760
a gamble on this sort of thing.

2550
01:47:38,760 --> 01:47:40,400
So it's always appreciated.

2551
01:47:40,400 --> 01:47:45,080
And join us on Sunday where we'll do this and some Linux Unplugged, maybe that Linux

2552
01:47:45,080 --> 01:47:46,080
podcast too.

2553
01:47:46,080 --> 01:47:47,640
All right.

2554
01:47:47,640 --> 01:47:48,640
Thanks guys.

2555
01:47:48,640 --> 01:47:49,640
Appreciate you.

2556
01:47:49,640 --> 01:47:50,640
Thank you.

2557
01:47:50,640 --> 01:47:51,640
Bye everyone.

2558
01:47:51,640 --> 01:47:52,640
Thank you.

2559
01:47:52,640 --> 01:47:53,640
Bumble room.

2560
01:47:53,640 --> 01:47:54,640
Thank you.

2561
01:47:54,640 --> 01:47:55,640
Chat room.

2562
01:47:55,640 --> 01:47:56,640
Come hang out in the other Matrix rooms.

2563
01:47:56,640 --> 01:48:00,280
If you just joined the Matrix, don't forget, we've got a bunch of other channels in there.

2564
01:48:00,280 --> 01:48:04,740
All kinds of stuff, including the Nyx nerds room for our Nyx challenge.

2565
01:48:04,740 --> 01:48:05,740
That's in there as well.

2566
01:48:05,740 --> 01:48:08,360
So love to see you in there.

2567
01:48:08,360 --> 01:48:09,480
All right.

2568
01:48:09,480 --> 01:48:10,480
That's it.

2569
01:48:10,480 --> 01:48:11,480
Thanks everybody.

2570
01:48:11,480 --> 01:48:12,480
Let's do it again soon.

2571
01:48:12,480 --> 01:48:36,200
Thanks for watching.

2572
01:49:06,200 --> 01:49:08,200
