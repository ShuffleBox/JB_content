00:00.000 --> 00:14.240
Hello, everyone. It's Brunch with Brent. Again, I'm so pleased to be joined by Jason Spizak.

00:14.240 --> 00:15.240
How are you?

00:15.240 --> 00:21.560
I am fantastic. That was the world's shortest intro. I was expecting you to go on and be

00:21.560 --> 00:28.080
like, I'm the man of myth, the legend. And you may have heard him on some TV shows and

00:28.080 --> 00:31.520
video games. And I was just kind of glad you didn't do any of that, because it's always

00:31.520 --> 00:35.360
weird and embarrassing to hear what you've done before, like, you talk. And it's kind

00:35.360 --> 00:36.360
of weird.

00:36.360 --> 00:38.520
I find it way more fun to have you do that, actually.

00:38.520 --> 00:45.560
Yeah, I've done nothing. Go to IMDb.com. There it is. I just, whatever tickles your fancy.

00:45.560 --> 00:50.760
We should give those listeners who might not know you a little bit of a background. Of

00:50.760 --> 00:54.960
course, we will dive into some of that during our conversation, so I won't give too much.

00:54.960 --> 00:59.800
What do you mean they don't know me? How could they not know me? I'm so offended. I'm leaving

00:59.800 --> 01:01.560
this conversation right now.

01:01.560 --> 01:08.480
So if anyone has picked up yet, Jason may be a professional voice actor, would you say?

01:08.480 --> 01:12.880
You know, what's so funny is I have a t-shirt that says that I may be a professional voice

01:12.880 --> 01:20.080
actor someday. Yeah, I mean, I started out doing Linux, I mean, even before, almost at

01:20.080 --> 01:22.960
the same time I started out doing voiceover, but I've been doing voiceover professionally

01:22.960 --> 01:30.880
for 22 years, and my first experience with Linux was in 1997. So I think they are exactly

01:30.880 --> 01:32.800
about the same time, pretty much.

01:32.800 --> 01:36.240
That's amazing that you kind of fell into two great things all at once and that they're

01:36.240 --> 01:39.520
still with you. Like, 20 years is not a short period of time, right?

01:39.520 --> 01:43.920
Yeah, because I couldn't get any jobs in voiceover when I started. Yeah, that's why. And then

01:43.920 --> 01:47.560
I was like, I need something to do to make me busy. Oh, Linux, hey, that's really hard.

01:47.560 --> 01:51.240
And so give us a little bit of background of that Linux scuff, because you've been involved

01:51.240 --> 01:55.800
in a few projects. And what were those like? What were they?

01:55.800 --> 02:02.920
Yeah, I think you mean to say a few failures. I very first got involved with Joseph Cheek.

02:02.920 --> 02:08.360
He was the guy who founded Redmond Linux. And this was about the time that Windows XP

02:08.360 --> 02:23.000
had come out. And Linux had a GUI. It had X Windows and KDE 1.2 or something around

02:23.000 --> 02:30.120
that time. And Caldera Linux was still around. And Joseph had worked for Microsoft for a

02:30.120 --> 02:36.440
little while as a tester and then had worked for Caldera for a while and then decided he

02:36.440 --> 02:40.240
wanted to do his own Linux distribution. And I saw it on the internets and was like, that's

02:40.240 --> 02:44.640
cool. It's going to look like Windows and try to get Windows users away from Windows.

02:44.640 --> 02:49.800
And it's going to mimic XP. It's going to have like a My Computer and that whole thing

02:49.800 --> 02:55.720
so that they will be sweet talked away and be using Linux.

02:55.720 --> 03:02.440
Wow, was I young and naive. Boy, just saying that out loud.

03:02.440 --> 03:06.440
You know what, Daddy? We're going to build our own operating system and it's going to

03:06.440 --> 03:10.440
be better than Windows and they're going to just use ours instead. I don't care if there's

03:10.440 --> 03:13.960
no software. It's just better.

03:13.960 --> 03:20.000
So Joseph and I, you know, I was co-founder, I guess, of Redmond Linux. He was the coder

03:20.000 --> 03:24.560
and I did a bunch of the icons, graphic design and a bunch of user interface suggestions

03:24.560 --> 03:33.000
for him and some sales advice. The name of Redmond Linux we changed to Lycoris Linux,

03:33.000 --> 03:39.800
which was probably my singular most singularly largest marketing failure of my entire life.

03:39.800 --> 03:47.480
Lycoris is a flower. L-Y-C-O-R-I-S. And what an odd name for a product. It was about that

03:47.480 --> 03:56.560
time Windows was coming out. Windows was basically a Linux distribution that was one letter different

03:56.560 --> 04:00.840
than Windows just because the guy who started it wanted to get sued.

04:00.840 --> 04:01.840
And did.

04:01.840 --> 04:08.320
Yeah, and did. And it was on the Walmart $199 PC. And so we changed our name to Lycoris

04:08.320 --> 04:12.640
just so we could be a little, not get sued, like maybe that was part of it I think at

04:12.640 --> 04:18.840
the time and changed our branding a little bit so we thought it would be much cooler.

04:18.840 --> 04:21.240
Because you felt like Redmond was a bit like...

04:21.240 --> 04:22.240
On the nose?

04:22.240 --> 04:25.440
A bit challenging, like it was looking for some problems basically.

04:25.440 --> 04:30.120
Yeah, or difficult to spell because apparently Lycoris is so easy to spell. I really don't

04:30.120 --> 04:39.200
know what we were thinking. I have no clue. It had less letters. I got no clue. And we

04:39.200 --> 04:46.920
wanted to get on the Walmart $199 PC too as well. I actually went to see a guy named Rich

04:46.920 --> 04:56.280
who was in charge of the OEM that was making the Walmart $199 PC at the time. He's in California.

04:56.280 --> 05:03.040
And I went there and basically tried to get him to put us on the machine too because Windows

05:03.040 --> 05:07.000
was selling at Walmart, Walmart.com, and we were not. And we're like, come on, we can

05:07.000 --> 05:13.480
do this, we can get on here too. They gave us $1 per license to put Lycoris on those

05:13.480 --> 05:14.480
PCs.

05:14.480 --> 05:15.480
Wow.

05:15.480 --> 05:19.600
And we got, I thought it was, it's an okay deal. It's an okay deal. We got this. We're

05:19.600 --> 05:24.040
going to be on Walmart.com. We're going to be fine. And it's like, I was such an idiot.

05:24.040 --> 05:25.440
It's slightly more than zero.

05:25.440 --> 05:29.600
Yeah, it's only slightly more than zero. And we were hand printing the license cards because

05:29.600 --> 05:34.320
Joseph had the idea that licensing Linux was the way to make revenue. And while I didn't

05:34.320 --> 05:41.600
necessarily wholeheartedly agree, I was like, I don't really have another idea. So, we did.

05:41.600 --> 05:46.840
And we hand printed cards on cardstock, license cards, and then printed out labels as license

05:46.840 --> 05:50.280
keys because he came from Microsoft where it was all about license keys and everything.

05:50.280 --> 05:53.880
And I didn't really love that part of it, but I thought, well, what else am I going

05:53.880 --> 05:57.960
to charge Rich for? I mean, what do I tell him? If there's no license key in the box,

05:57.960 --> 06:01.840
how do I charge for this operating system? We couldn't really come up with another way.

06:01.840 --> 06:06.680
And that was the way that Rich and everybody else who was an OEM for Microsoft knew and

06:06.680 --> 06:11.520
understood how things go. License keys. I mean, they got it, right?

06:11.520 --> 06:17.680
Well, I have a question about that, though, because that was based on Linux. Does that

06:17.680 --> 06:20.080
conflict with the open source license then?

06:20.080 --> 06:23.480
No, because we had the source code available for download all the time, anytime.

06:23.480 --> 06:28.080
I see. So, you can license the actual product but still have the, ah, interesting.

06:28.080 --> 06:34.560
And the license was the license key for your install of Lycoris Linux with the icons and

06:34.560 --> 06:38.400
the rest. I mean, kind of like RHEL does it now, right? Where they charge you for their

06:38.400 --> 06:44.520
icons and their brand and access to certain repositories and things like that. So, yeah,

06:44.520 --> 06:50.760
that was back in, I think, 2001 was the time we made that deal. And we were like, yeah,

06:50.760 --> 06:54.560
they could download it for free. I think we also let people download the OS for free to

06:54.560 --> 07:00.520
test it and everything, just the way it was. What we didn't want was people just reproducing

07:00.520 --> 07:08.920
the CD on LinuxCD.com. And we did worry about that, but only from a branding perspective

07:08.920 --> 07:13.240
that if you don't protect your trademark, you lose it. And then what do you have, right?

07:13.240 --> 07:16.840
So, again, this is a bit of an antiquated way of thinking. I'm not saying I think this

07:16.840 --> 07:21.440
way now, of course, but I'm trying to get into the mindset of the decisions we were

07:21.440 --> 07:26.680
making at the time. And it was the wrong way to do it. And it didn't succeed, really. I

07:26.680 --> 07:30.040
mean, we sold, I don't know, like a couple hundred licenses. You made a couple hundred

07:30.040 --> 07:36.520
bucks. Woo! And how many hours does this take you to build these, you know, RPMs and everything?

07:36.520 --> 07:41.080
And eventually, you know, that operating system went by the wayside. There's just no way to

07:41.080 --> 07:47.280
maintain it and build a company off of that kind of business model. It didn't work. Then

07:47.280 --> 07:54.480
I monkeyed around with a tablet PC OS for a little while and then got involved on the

07:54.480 --> 08:00.000
side with Symphony OS because I had done this thing called the Mezzo Desktop, M-E-Z-Z-O.

08:00.000 --> 08:04.880
And it was the idea that the four corners of the desktop were hot corners and you could

08:04.880 --> 08:09.680
go into them and you'd get your files in one corner, your apps in another corner. And this

08:09.680 --> 08:12.920
is long before Noam Schell had that thing where you could go up to the corner to get

08:12.920 --> 08:14.720
your activities and this is years before that.

08:14.720 --> 08:19.840
Yeah, I mean, you see that today in KDE, like I use that every once in a while. And on Mac

08:19.840 --> 08:21.760
OS, actually, I used to use it all the time, right?

08:21.760 --> 08:23.320
Well, you're welcome.

08:23.320 --> 08:27.800
Thank you. But that's the interesting thing about Linux that I've noticed in the last,

08:27.800 --> 08:33.000
you know, X number of decades is that often some of these ideas come to Linux first and

08:33.000 --> 08:35.560
then they kind of get ripped off from there, right?

08:35.560 --> 08:39.680
It wasn't a new idea. When I went through the treatise of the Mezzo Desktop and the

08:39.680 --> 08:46.160
principles of desktop usability, I was riffing off of other people's white papers or academia

08:46.160 --> 08:51.280
about what the usefulness areas of the desktop are. But I was putting them into practice

08:51.280 --> 08:57.920
with a user interface that was eventually rolled into Symphony OS because it was like

08:57.920 --> 09:03.360
a web-based OS prior to Chrome OS. You know, it was this web-based OS, Symphony OS was.

09:03.360 --> 09:06.160
You're just arriving way too early, that's all.

09:06.160 --> 09:14.960
Yes, I appreciate your verbiage. So, we were building that out of, I can't remember what

09:14.960 --> 09:20.440
toolkit that Symphony OS was built out of, but on my own machine, I had built a precursor

09:20.440 --> 09:24.880
to Chrome OS which launched all of the web apps that Google had at the time, Google Calendar

09:24.880 --> 09:32.240
and everything, using FVWM2. So, it kind of works like Chrome OS did before they went

09:32.240 --> 09:36.000
with the central dock icon bar when it looked a little bit more like Windows when the Chrome

09:36.000 --> 09:42.800
OS icons were at the bottom. I was doing that years before Chrome OS came out. I have screenshots

09:42.800 --> 09:48.160
of it and everything where I had an OS because I was like, everything should be web-based.

09:48.160 --> 09:53.000
In 2001 or 2002, I built a web app out of Zope, which was a Python-based database to

09:53.000 --> 10:01.520
run a technical recruiting firm like Dice.com. I built it, which became Plone, but it's Zope

10:01.520 --> 10:07.320
at the time. It was basically an entire web application and it ran off of a Red Hat 5.2,

10:07.320 --> 10:13.880
not RHEL 5.2, but Red Hat 5.2 server and it was using terminal servers to all get to that

10:13.880 --> 10:19.040
box and then it was just using a web browser. At the time, that was just like unheard of.

10:19.040 --> 10:26.000
I think Sun was doing their Java thin client at the time in real apps, not web apps. So,

10:26.000 --> 10:33.040
I was just really early on the, hey, web apps are going to be huge curve. That's the kind

10:33.040 --> 10:38.000
of work I did on that and ended up getting rolled into Symphony OS and that was also

10:38.000 --> 10:43.700
a huge failure. Then I got really busy in VoiceOver and just use Linux on my own machines

10:43.700 --> 10:50.440
forever and have used KDE since 1.2 with the Kotlin icons.

10:50.440 --> 10:57.360
Tell me the Cole's Notes version of how you ever got to Linux in the first place. Obviously,

10:57.360 --> 11:03.380
you have this deep appreciation for it and desire to forward it, but where did that ever

11:03.380 --> 11:04.380
come from?

11:04.380 --> 11:10.240
I always loved to build things. I was hugely into Legos when I was a kid and I always loved

11:10.240 --> 11:17.480
to just create things, very much a builder. When I came in contact with Linux for the

11:17.480 --> 11:25.320
first time, it was a Red Hat CD in either the back of a book or a magazine. I can't

11:25.320 --> 11:30.760
remember. It wasn't Linux format because it wasn't around then, but like that. It might

11:30.760 --> 11:36.080
have been Linux Journal. It's possible. I was like, what is this? It looks like Windows.

11:36.080 --> 11:41.160
I think it was on the magazine at the time. I can't remember. It might have been before

11:41.160 --> 11:47.320
that. I swear it would have been a book. Anyway, I'm like, this is interesting. What's this

11:47.320 --> 11:52.480
about? I had a PC at the time that I had built myself to play MechWarrior. That's the only

11:52.480 --> 11:55.400
reason you build PCs. Let's be perfectly honest.

11:55.400 --> 11:56.400
You need some motivation, right?

11:56.400 --> 12:03.820
I had it put up to my Sound Blaster and my giant 32-inch tube television. I would play

12:03.820 --> 12:13.600
it in my living room and it would shake the neighbors. Oh, yeah. I popped the CD in. Yes,

12:13.600 --> 12:20.440
it was a CD at the time. I had to have a boot floppy, but it was a CD at the time. I was

12:20.440 --> 12:26.120
just so enamored with the fact that there could be something else as an operating system

12:26.120 --> 12:27.460
that wasn't Windows.

12:27.460 --> 12:29.760
I love that feeling.

12:29.760 --> 12:34.320
It opened up a passageway in my brain that went, oh, you haven't been walking on the

12:34.320 --> 12:42.280
sidewalk. You've been walking on the platform above the sidewalk. You are an idiot. It really

12:42.280 --> 12:47.600
opened my eyes as opposed to just building the hardware with my hands, which is one layer

12:47.600 --> 12:55.600
of building, that the idea that the operating system and software was its own universe inside

12:55.600 --> 13:00.020
this machine doing its thing and there became the idea that this universe could be free

13:00.020 --> 13:02.320
and open.

13:02.320 --> 13:10.760
And shortly after that, I was really interested in what Linux was, that it came out of Minix

13:10.760 --> 13:15.200
and that it was Linus Torvalds' side project that he decided to build. And I'm reading

13:15.200 --> 13:20.320
this and I'm like, and then what happened? He gave the code out on the internets and

13:20.320 --> 13:24.520
people all worked together. What?

13:24.520 --> 13:27.560
Which is so completely the opposite of the paradigm at the time.

13:27.560 --> 13:34.720
Completely opposite. And it blew me away because it was the beginning of what I now call digital

13:34.720 --> 13:41.000
independence. It was the beginning of the idea for me, obviously open source start software

13:41.000 --> 13:49.160
with GNU foundation, everything that didn't start with Linux per se. But it was my first

13:49.160 --> 13:55.240
experience with the idea that you have all the source code. You're not beholden to a

13:55.240 --> 14:01.920
corporate entity to run your computer, to license the software. And if you make a change

14:01.920 --> 14:05.960
and you improve the software, if you have an idea, it can be contributed back to the

14:05.960 --> 14:13.380
greater whole for everybody. So to me, it was a micro example of human knowledge. Patents

14:13.380 --> 14:19.880
are not, they're not what happens to human knowledge for millennia, thousands of centuries.

14:19.880 --> 14:23.680
When a human gets an idea, he shares it with another human and then she shares it with

14:23.680 --> 14:28.040
somebody else. And then she gives it to her kids and then he shares it to his kids. And

14:28.040 --> 14:36.840
then you basically have the volume of human knowledge accelerated our ability to enforce

14:36.840 --> 14:43.760
our will upon nature at such a pace because of the interconnections and sharing. That's

14:43.760 --> 14:48.680
why we are the dominant species on the planet, not just luck, but our ability to communicate

14:48.680 --> 14:55.200
and share ideas and then share knowledge because of that allows us to solve problems that there's

14:55.200 --> 15:00.920
just no way you could solve them if your knowledge died with the last person that knew a certain

15:00.920 --> 15:08.320
thing. You know, fast forward centuries into the future and here we are. So that's why

15:08.320 --> 15:15.960
Linux has such a snowball rolling downhill effect when it comes to software for computer

15:15.960 --> 15:21.320
and then the ecosystem around it is because it's basically a representation of what happens

15:21.320 --> 15:25.200
with human knowledge without any restrictions. If you don't have patents and if you don't

15:25.200 --> 15:31.000
have arbitrary lines between, you know, boundaries between countries or whatever, you know, we

15:31.000 --> 15:37.080
share ideas with each other and just to make the sum total of that knowledge better for

15:37.080 --> 15:41.160
everyone. Well, that's why it works. That's why it works. And that bit me in the leg.

15:41.160 --> 15:46.560
I'm like, okay, this is awesome. So it's the embodiment of what human knowledge and sharing

15:46.560 --> 15:52.640
is normally in software, which part of this point hadn't been. And it was digital freedom

15:52.640 --> 15:58.780
or what I call digital independence. And that's huge because I could see the future developing

15:58.780 --> 16:02.520
around me that the internet would soon be everything. Fax machines were just on their

16:02.520 --> 16:08.520
way out. And I was like, okay, if everything happens inside the computer and wires that

16:08.520 --> 16:13.200
connect us, he who controls the wires and the computer controls everything will control

16:13.200 --> 16:19.200
the knowledge of the world. So we can't let that be a company, especially not Microsoft.

16:19.200 --> 16:23.520
They were awful, awful from a business practice perspective, not just a convicted monopolist,

16:23.520 --> 16:31.840
but good night. It was just so rude, just so rude. And that's what kept me coming back

16:31.840 --> 16:37.760
after failure, after failure, after failure was it's incumbent upon me as a member of

16:37.760 --> 16:43.880
the human society to get this into the hands of as many humans as possible because armed

16:43.880 --> 16:50.720
with this, we can be bolstered against a future of oligarchy and digital oppression. It's

16:50.720 --> 16:57.160
the only weapon we're going to have. And I just knew early on that if I could contribute

16:57.160 --> 17:05.820
to that in some way, my children and their children would have the silent weaponry with

17:05.820 --> 17:11.060
which to arm themselves to win that battle against digital oppression. And everything

17:11.060 --> 17:13.000
else is tangential to that.

17:13.000 --> 17:17.520
Did you feel at the time when you were first coming to these ideas that there were people

17:17.520 --> 17:21.560
around you that felt the same? Or did you feel kind of alone in those ideas?

17:21.560 --> 17:28.040
Yeah, I felt alone. I didn't go to lugs a lot. The reason was because I always just

17:28.040 --> 17:33.880
was on the internet and connected with somebody else, like Joseph or whoever I was working

17:33.880 --> 17:39.360
with on a project. At the time, there was always someone like minded out there on the

17:39.360 --> 17:44.360
internet. I mean, you know, everybody's connected to it. So that's what it's for. Right. That's

17:44.360 --> 17:49.920
his job. So it was not hard for me to find like minded people and, and then work with

17:49.920 --> 17:53.840
them like within minutes of meeting them. I'm like, here's what we need to do. We need

17:53.840 --> 17:59.440
to have a web based OS. So like, okay, slow down, Jay.

17:59.440 --> 18:04.480
But it sounds like some of those ideas were sort of visionary. And so it sounds like,

18:04.480 --> 18:08.800
I don't know if I'd go that far. Maybe that's over generous, but we'll use it. I mean, that

18:08.800 --> 18:12.440
icons on the Linux desktop need to be pretty. Yeah, maybe I was like one of the earlier

18:12.440 --> 18:16.000
guys to figure that out.

18:16.000 --> 18:22.320
But also a necessary thing to adopt, you know, for the greater population, you know, is just

18:22.320 --> 18:29.200
making things simpler. And yeah, but to me, that seems so obvious that perhaps, you know,

18:29.200 --> 18:34.040
I wouldn't call it visionary, I would just say, these are the pieces in front of us.

18:34.040 --> 18:38.120
And maybe I'm not good at creating pieces, but connecting the pieces. I'm pretty good

18:38.120 --> 18:41.680
at that, seeing those type of pathways. I just think the human brain is really good

18:41.680 --> 18:47.960
at doing that anyway, but I could just kind of see where things were going. And, you know,

18:47.960 --> 18:51.880
but I think a lot of people see where they're going, and they don't do anything about it.

18:51.880 --> 18:56.320
It's not that this is a major leap in any way. It's just the follow on of a conclusion.

18:56.320 --> 18:59.160
There's a lot of science fiction writers who knew it way before I knew it. I mean, they

18:59.160 --> 19:05.440
probably knew it before I even saw the things in front of me, you know, but the idea that

19:05.440 --> 19:10.280
you would then be spurred to action, which is one of the things that makes the open source

19:10.280 --> 19:16.920
community so great, is like Home Assistant, for example, or even WireGuard. These are

19:16.920 --> 19:24.600
modern examples of, and Linux has this nomenclature of scratching an itch, right, that the developer

19:24.600 --> 19:30.520
is like, I don't want to use Alexa. I don't want to have Google in my house, Amazon, Google,

19:30.520 --> 19:34.920
whoever, and I just, you know, going to build this thing so that my gadgets can talk to

19:34.920 --> 19:40.360
each other and I can live a modern, you know, would you like me to do that for you, Mr.

19:40.360 --> 19:47.320
Stock? Like, everybody wants that. So, let's, I want that. Let's do that. But how quickly

19:47.320 --> 19:53.640
it can become useful is because everybody else shares, and it's like actionable. Code

19:53.640 --> 19:54.640
is actionable.

19:54.640 --> 19:59.320
Well, one thing about, you know, you mentioned Home Assistant. Well, you mentioned two things.

19:59.320 --> 20:03.880
You mentioned Home Assistant and WireGuard. So, I just dove into my first WireGuard project

20:03.880 --> 20:12.160
this week, actually, and it has gone so amazingly well that I was like, oh, everybody needs

20:12.160 --> 20:17.640
this. You know, like, even the commercial platforms are like far worse. It's like, what

20:17.640 --> 20:18.640
a gift, right?

20:18.640 --> 20:22.280
It's crazy. I did not, until I heard it on your show, I had never heard about it until

20:22.280 --> 20:28.400
I heard it on Linux Unplugged. And it changed my life. I was helping my dad, putting up

20:28.400 --> 20:33.400
some Home Assistant stuff in his place. And I went, like, you know, he's like, how am

20:33.400 --> 20:38.480
I going to know if the door is open when I'm not home, you know, or something. And I said,

20:38.480 --> 20:43.240
well, I could give you access to this interface and it can pop up notifications on your phone

20:43.240 --> 20:49.560
and all this cool stuff. But that means that I have to open your house up to the internet.

20:49.560 --> 20:52.880
You know, like, and there was this thing, well, then that means we need a VPN or that

20:52.880 --> 20:56.000
means whatever, we need to get an SSL certificate. And even then, you know, it's going to be

20:56.000 --> 21:00.200
attacked from the outside world because that port is open. And then I just stopped for

21:00.200 --> 21:05.320
a second and I went, Linux Unplugged told me about this thing called WireGuard. Excuse

21:05.320 --> 21:15.400
me for one second. And like 30 minutes less than that later, I'm on my cell phone on LTE,

21:15.400 --> 21:19.760
connecting that app to the Home Assistant server that you can't get to any other way,

21:19.760 --> 21:22.000
unless I have it on my phone.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
Isn't that incredible?

21:23.000 --> 21:27.280
Are you kidding me? Are you kidding? Are you joking, people?

21:27.280 --> 21:28.280
It's so unbelievable.

21:28.280 --> 21:29.280
Oh, your gosh.

21:29.280 --> 21:34.840
See, and that's what I find important is like, you're still giddy like that first moment

21:34.840 --> 21:39.560
you discovered Linux, right? It's like, it just continues. It's such a beautiful thing.

21:39.560 --> 21:46.560
Every time. It's like a present that's on a day that's not my birthday. Every time.

21:46.560 --> 21:50.880
And then in the back of my head when I say that, having been a developer of like a project

21:50.880 --> 21:55.400
that's trying to make money or in order to stay afloat, not make money to line your pockets,

21:55.400 --> 22:04.720
but to make money so that a project can continue, how difficult that is in a world where the

22:04.720 --> 22:11.160
most ideals are so prevalent with patents and neoliberalism, capitalism not having anything

22:11.160 --> 22:16.360
to do with the political liberalism, but having to do with the guys that are around in the

22:16.360 --> 22:25.880
70s who were like, free market economies are everything, neoliberal economics, that we

22:25.880 --> 22:32.200
struggle to find a reason to pay for something that's free or struggle as people who provide

22:32.200 --> 22:38.080
open source code to say, this is how much this is worth and there's a social contract

22:38.080 --> 22:45.840
here that you use this and your dad can access his house now, but did you PayPal the WireGuard

22:45.840 --> 22:54.120
guy? Did you sign up to his Patreon? Did you what? And that's why I really appreciate what

22:54.120 --> 23:03.120
Daniel and friends are doing at elementary, trying to put a store in the OS that says,

23:03.120 --> 23:07.560
would you like to pay for this? Because it's an option and make it super, super easy not

23:07.560 --> 23:12.880
to guilt people into doing it, which is the wrong methodology, but to say it's worth something

23:12.880 --> 23:17.720
to me and for you to have the ability to say that it's worth something to me. And the internet

23:17.720 --> 23:22.840
tip jar software, there's a bunch of them out there, but nobody's quite gotten it to

23:22.840 --> 23:29.560
the point where it's pennies, it's 25 cents, it's whatever from a billion people and I

23:29.560 --> 23:33.800
can do my job. Credit card companies still stand in the way of that a lot because of

23:33.800 --> 23:34.800
the fees for transactions.

23:34.800 --> 23:35.800
Of course.

23:35.800 --> 23:40.720
But once we get there, that gateway is one of the things that open source needs because

23:40.720 --> 23:45.160
I don't think anybody wants to go to work. I don't think any software developer really,

23:45.160 --> 23:49.840
unless they really love their job, wants to deal with a boss that is like, yeah, your

23:49.840 --> 23:56.480
open source project is cool, but this, I need you to do this now because of my company that

23:56.480 --> 23:59.920
you may not agree with its mission completely because you're not saving the world, but it

23:59.920 --> 24:07.600
pays your bills. And I think it would be lovely to have these super talented people not have

24:07.600 --> 24:13.360
to have this be their side hustle because I think that, and maybe that's not true. It's

24:13.360 --> 24:17.480
possible that some people love their side hustle so much because they hate their job.

24:17.480 --> 24:23.520
I'm an actor and so I understand human nature really, really pretty darn well and it's possible

24:23.520 --> 24:28.640
that if you turn this, once you turn open source projects into someone's job, it loses

24:28.640 --> 24:33.000
the magic for them the same way as if your hobby became your small business. That doesn't

24:33.000 --> 24:39.560
work for everybody. And it could be a gift to the open source community that these things

24:39.560 --> 24:46.720
are people's side hustles. Not going to overlook that, but it would be nice to make sure that

24:46.720 --> 24:50.520
people who put their time and effort into something are compensated because when you

24:50.520 --> 24:56.360
work really hard and you deal with open source communities, they can be a little unruly and

24:56.360 --> 25:01.440
a little demanding. Just ask Mancero, you know, what do you mean we're going to put

25:01.440 --> 25:07.120
in a different office suite? I'm going to kill you. And you're like, but you're my community.

25:07.120 --> 25:13.000
Well they care. That's why they're being so difficult to handle and work with. It would

25:13.000 --> 25:20.360
be nice to know that remuneration is available. It would be very nice. And that's why I feel

25:20.360 --> 25:26.440
like the elementary project is pushing the envelope in the right direction in that they're

25:26.440 --> 25:30.960
not forcing anyone. They're just providing an option that's very easy. Just make the

25:30.960 --> 25:36.800
title bars like windows. I think you'll be okay. So to bring it back a little bit, because

25:36.800 --> 25:43.200
I did, I took you on a little bit of a sidebar there. Tell me a little bit then about how

25:43.200 --> 25:48.760
you brought all of that into the Simple PC because that's a bit of a different project

25:48.760 --> 25:49.760
from the others.

25:49.760 --> 25:53.400
I didn't. Just kidding. It's gone.

25:53.400 --> 25:54.400
Totally different.

25:54.400 --> 25:59.360
Yeah. There was a person who lived across the street where their office was across the

25:59.360 --> 26:05.120
street from a place that I had an office and she, her name is Barbara. She's an amazing

26:05.120 --> 26:12.160
person and she had taken over a PC recycling company that would take people's old PCs and

26:12.160 --> 26:21.520
recycle them. Either part them out or sell the parts on eBay. There's a couple of vendor

26:21.520 --> 26:28.080
type online sites that also sell to Windows integrators where they need a piece for a

26:28.080 --> 26:32.160
PC and they need to replace that because they can't just buy a new PC because the software

26:32.160 --> 26:36.320
on it won't run on the most recent OS and so they like to make sure they keep older

26:36.320 --> 26:42.320
PCs running with parts. So there's a market for that. And she had taken it over from her

26:42.320 --> 26:47.920
son who got off way more than he could chew. And I just went in there one day and I was

26:47.920 --> 26:56.200
looking around and I'm like, you have shelves upon shelves of old computer parts. First

26:56.200 --> 27:01.160
of all, as a guy who used to build computers, this is so cool.

27:01.160 --> 27:07.960
But as a guy who has a bit of a business mind, albeit obviously a failed one, I thought,

27:07.960 --> 27:14.320
this could be a business model. Why don't we just create a case that's universal because

27:14.320 --> 27:20.000
a lot of these things are not MATXs. They're specialty type motherboards. Why don't we

27:20.000 --> 27:25.720
make something where we've got blocks where the screws might go because they might be

27:25.720 --> 27:30.320
in slightly different places depending upon the motherboard pattern. And we make it so

27:30.320 --> 27:35.600
that it could fit any one of these size motherboards from any one of these things. And I just went

27:35.600 --> 27:40.880
around with a measuring tape and I got what the largest size would need to be to accommodate

27:40.880 --> 27:48.120
anything from that down lower and then designed the space for the power supply and then made

27:48.120 --> 27:52.680
it out of recycled plastic because I really wanted to do the right thing for the environment

27:52.680 --> 28:01.180
because keeping PC parts out of landfills or anywhere is the only way that we're going

28:01.180 --> 28:08.280
to be able to live on a healthy planet because we keep generating e-waste nonstop. And the

28:08.280 --> 28:15.680
more lives you can give a CPU, the more lives you can give a motherboard, nine lives, you're

28:15.680 --> 28:20.600
doing the right thing for your children's children and those you love.

28:20.600 --> 28:26.100
So I took this design and I made it out of recycled plastic. I actually had a prototype

28:26.100 --> 28:31.440
built out of cardboard. Very cool pictures. I could finally maybe I'll send one to you.

28:31.440 --> 28:39.100
And I did some of the thermal dynamics in the case to make sure that it could pull enough

28:39.100 --> 28:45.560
air through the front to shoot it out the back and then this thing wouldn't boil. Because

28:45.560 --> 28:52.640
plastic is notoriously heat cloistering, meaning it doesn't really like to let the heat out.

28:52.640 --> 28:55.840
It's slow. If you build the whole thing out of aluminum, it will radiate the heat out.

28:55.840 --> 29:01.080
But this is an all plastic case with no metal to transmit the heat anywhere.

29:01.080 --> 29:06.640
So I was like, okay, I'll take this, see if I can get this idea going and then we need

29:06.640 --> 29:14.380
the business piece. So what if you could keep this PC for a year and have a year warranty.

29:14.380 --> 29:20.040
So if it breaks down anytime during the year, you send us back the whole computer and we

29:20.040 --> 29:25.120
send you out a whole new one. We're not responsible for your data. The disclaimer on the warranty

29:25.120 --> 29:29.500
is back your stuff up because you're sending us the whole thing and we're just giving doing

29:29.500 --> 29:33.760
full on replacement. And then we can always take it apart, take the parts that work and

29:33.760 --> 29:39.800
put them into a new one. Well, so it's recycled parts to begin with. So there's no difference

29:39.800 --> 29:40.800
there.

29:40.800 --> 29:43.760
And you just continue that cycle, right? It's like recycle, recycle, recycle. Yeah.

29:43.760 --> 29:46.680
And you just continue that cycle literally forever and ever and ever and ever. And you

29:46.680 --> 29:48.560
only take out the parts that don't work.

29:48.560 --> 29:53.800
Correct. Right. And if the case is fine, we just reuse the case. And after the one year

29:53.800 --> 30:00.060
warranty is up, you can still send it back to us to get a discount of X dollars towards

30:00.060 --> 30:07.760
your new one. So it's always good for a turn in. It's always good for an exchange. Basically,

30:07.760 --> 30:12.340
because I'm figuring these cases, I probably won't change the look of these cases because

30:12.340 --> 30:17.720
motherboards are fairly standard. They don't change dramatically in shape too often. And

30:17.720 --> 30:22.960
we'll just get the parts that will fit. And that's a pretty good business model and we'll

30:22.960 --> 30:28.080
charge 99 bucks because there's just enough money in 99 bucks for me to make money off

30:28.080 --> 30:33.240
of these units after the assembly, after everything else. We'll still make them pay for shipping

30:33.240 --> 30:36.320
because they could ask for one on the other side of the country and like the margins so

30:36.320 --> 30:43.620
thin, forget it. And put regular Ubuntu on this because Ubuntu itself, there's plenty

30:43.620 --> 30:47.160
of support out there in the world through forums and everything else that we will not

30:47.160 --> 30:53.920
offer software support because the hardware is so cheap. You just get that from the community.

30:53.920 --> 31:00.280
And out of that money, we will give a percentage of it divided up to all the open source projects

31:00.280 --> 31:04.380
that went into making the simple PC. So we would give money to Ubuntu, we would give

31:04.380 --> 31:12.000
money to Debian, we would give money, a portion of that to, there's a foundation under which

31:12.000 --> 31:16.560
LibreOffice and a bunch of others can take disbursement. That's where they get some of

31:16.560 --> 31:19.960
their funds. And I think LibreOffice is on its own, but there's another umbrella foundation

31:19.960 --> 31:25.720
that multiple projects fall under. I can't remember the name of it, but it's a nonprofit.

31:25.720 --> 31:30.880
And we're making that donation on their behalf, on the user's behalf. So I don't have to depend

31:30.880 --> 31:35.640
on the user to start up elementary or whatever it is and then take money out of their wallet.

31:35.640 --> 31:41.280
I'm making that when they buy. That's at least something. It's not the continual source of

31:41.280 --> 31:47.840
revenue that people need in order to live, but it's something. And we make that donation

31:47.840 --> 31:51.740
as a business. That's a charitable donation. In most instances, it's actually a tax write-off.

31:51.740 --> 31:54.440
So this works for everybody. It's great.

31:54.440 --> 31:57.760
The Raspberry Pi I saw coming out at that time.

31:57.760 --> 31:58.760
Oh, no.

31:58.760 --> 32:03.240
And I was like, everybody was asking, like, can your PC have wireless? And I'm like, well,

32:03.240 --> 32:09.160
you can plug a USB wireless in the back. These are old PCs. They're like Pentiums, you know.

32:09.160 --> 32:13.120
And I'm like, they're not nearly as energy efficient as a Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry

32:13.120 --> 32:17.960
Pi is going to have built-in wireless coming around the corner. Okay. This doesn't make

32:17.960 --> 32:22.600
any sense. So I did simple for a while. One of my biggest markets I was trying to push

32:22.600 --> 32:26.040
is for like computer classrooms and places where they need the PCs to all look nice instead

32:26.040 --> 32:31.440
of just getting crappy recycled PCs. And then they get that back-end support and that warranty

32:31.440 --> 32:38.000
so they feel good about it. That never really took off. And maybe because Microsoft and

32:38.000 --> 32:43.560
Dell are dumping free PCs on schools. I don't know. So I didn't have those big buyer numbers.

32:43.560 --> 32:47.120
And I also saw the Raspberry Pi coming around the corner and thought this takes way less

32:47.120 --> 32:52.520
wattage. It's going to be wireless. It's going to be as fast as this thing is soon. You know,

32:52.520 --> 32:58.200
because these are old computers, although not technically, you know, because Intel Pentium

32:58.200 --> 33:03.400
can crush things a lot quicker and everything. But it's, you know, it's the trade-offs. So

33:03.400 --> 33:08.120
I decided to shut it off, shut Simple down. We honored anybody who sent us a warranty

33:08.120 --> 33:10.600
machine and nobody really did actually.

33:10.600 --> 33:14.560
That's a good thing. That's a nice one.

33:14.560 --> 33:20.040
One person sent us a warranty machine the whole time because they used to make PCs better

33:20.040 --> 33:27.200
and that was it. So I haven't given up loving on Linux or starting a business doing Linux.

33:27.200 --> 33:33.480
It's just I've never really made any of them self-sustaining, which to me would be the

33:33.480 --> 33:40.840
goal. And every time it doesn't work out, I think to myself, maybe it's the way I'm

33:40.840 --> 33:45.960
approaching this. Maybe I'm still too stuck in the neoliberalist mindset and a capitalist

33:45.960 --> 33:55.560
mindset. Maybe there's another human knowledge aggregate community way to do this. And anytime

33:55.560 --> 34:01.400
I see something like the Pine64 guys who are like, this phone's not perfect, but here,

34:01.400 --> 34:06.880
let's make it the best phone it can be. Or, hey, this laptop is not perfect. I'm not Dell.

34:06.880 --> 34:12.120
It's inexpensive. Let's make this the best it can be. I get heartened by that because

34:12.120 --> 34:19.720
I think it's somewhere close to that, that it may find its legs or it may never. And

34:19.720 --> 34:25.720
the only place that Linux can really work out well is if you build your own stuff and

34:25.720 --> 34:32.760
buy recycled stuff and that's its super sweet spot. What's wrong with that? And to be fair,

34:32.760 --> 34:37.640
System76, which ships great stuff, they're going to start making their own laptop cases

34:37.640 --> 34:45.800
and they're going to start moving away from ODM boxes they did with Thelio. And maybe

34:45.800 --> 34:51.320
there is a room for an Apple-like Linux company that makes its own OS. I don't know. It just

34:51.320 --> 34:54.880
seems like there's a lot of expense there. They're saved a lot of expense because they

34:54.880 --> 34:58.000
don't have to build the OS. There's a lot of it they don't have to do.

34:58.000 --> 35:02.800
Yeah, and it fits for some people, right? But there's so many of these ideas that you've

35:02.800 --> 35:09.320
shared that hit me in a really deep place because they're ideas that I've thought of

35:09.320 --> 35:15.480
for a really long time. I'm talking to you right now in an X220 and the only reason I'm

35:15.480 --> 35:24.840
on an X220 is because it's a wonderful computer from eons ago if you look at some of the modern

35:24.840 --> 35:25.840
stuff coming out.

35:25.840 --> 35:30.000
I mean, imagine how cool it would be to take the guts of that X220 out and just put a new

35:30.000 --> 35:33.000
screen in it that's, you know, an IPS display real nice.

35:33.000 --> 35:39.320
Well, you know, what's interesting is Alex from self-hosted, he just helped me take an

35:39.320 --> 35:47.860
X250 and replace the screen in it with an IPS that's 1080p and replace the keyboard

35:47.860 --> 35:54.040
and stuff like this. So, you know, that's the beauty of some of these, the computers

35:54.040 --> 35:58.680
with some of the old mindset of like being well built.

35:58.680 --> 36:01.160
You mean not the throwaway mindset? Yeah.

36:01.160 --> 36:06.640
Exactly. Right. And also being modular. I feel like that if we can, you know, if we

36:06.640 --> 36:14.640
can continue back to that place and have these laptops just continuously perpetuate, what

36:14.640 --> 36:18.560
a beautiful thing. And like, okay, maybe it doesn't fit for me anymore because the photos

36:18.560 --> 36:24.920
that I produce in my photography camera can't deal with this laptop. But there is like about,

36:24.920 --> 36:28.840
you know, 70% of the population who's doing computing and they're just browsing the web

36:28.840 --> 36:31.080
and looking at email and stuff in this X220.

36:31.080 --> 36:35.700
Well, that's where the Chromebook stole your thunder because the Chromebook was literally

36:35.700 --> 36:40.720
that that's the market share. And it's sliding into enterprise a little bit now, which is

36:40.720 --> 36:45.040
interesting to see. But after Microsoft was just like, well, we'll give up. We just like

36:45.040 --> 36:50.840
the cloud. But it feels like the Chromebook is the perfect Linux laptop. At least it is

36:50.840 --> 36:57.480
for me because I just, I don't know, a week ago I gave Matt, who is the Mr. Chromebox,

36:57.480 --> 37:01.840
the gentleman who makes the firmware, the core boot firmware for Chromebooks. I sent

37:01.840 --> 37:08.160
him a new Chromebook so that he could put the firmware on there and then get a few models

37:08.160 --> 37:15.200
checked off the list. I run a Chromebook with a core boot, you know, from Matt's firmware.

37:15.200 --> 37:20.800
And that's Mr. Chromebox, if you're listening and you want to run a great laptop for any

37:20.800 --> 37:26.800
expensive. And a lot of the firm, like, but my particular laptop, there are no issues

37:26.800 --> 37:32.600
with suspend, resume, sound, literally nothing. He works pretty tightly with the gallium project,

37:32.600 --> 37:38.200
I think, to get gallium on there. But I just run KDE neon and I don't have any trouble.

37:38.200 --> 37:43.340
This thing is three years old. It is humming right along. It's got a 15 inch IPS display.

37:43.340 --> 37:49.280
I love it to death. My eyes aren't good enough for the high def displays anymore. I'm like,

37:49.280 --> 37:53.920
what do you mean? No, I can totally see that. Is that, oh, no, that's an F, not an M. Oh,

37:53.920 --> 37:58.520
I'm totally screwed. Oh, I just sent that email and I told somebody to F you instead

37:58.520 --> 38:06.200
of M you. That's not very good. It's going to cost me money. And I figured, well, why

38:06.200 --> 38:12.520
not go this route? Just take the firmware screws out. And it had an actually an M2 SST,

38:12.520 --> 38:15.840
thankfully, which is why, probably why it's so quick and nice. And I just upgraded that

38:15.840 --> 38:21.200
to a 128. It was a 32. But a lot of them come with 64 now. And if you have your own home

38:21.200 --> 38:26.440
server and you're just syncing files back and forth, or you're connecting via SFTP,

38:26.440 --> 38:30.840
you don't need a lot of storage on your machine. You just don't because you're going to run

38:30.840 --> 38:35.800
out anyway. You should put it in the closet somewhere.

38:35.800 --> 38:39.760
We just end up hoarding data anyways, right? So you may as well hoard it in the right place.

38:39.760 --> 38:44.960
Yeah. Hoard it with your coats. We know that you own a lot of coats. I know because your

38:44.960 --> 38:48.300
closets so big. Are those coats hiding data?

38:48.300 --> 38:53.480
But why the Chromebook and not like one of the old like Lenovo laptops? Is it the size?

38:53.480 --> 38:57.480
Is it like, what is it about supporting a big business like that? Because it feels

38:57.480 --> 39:02.440
It's not the size. It was actually, well, a little bit of the size.

39:02.440 --> 39:03.440
It always is, right?

39:03.440 --> 39:11.560
It is. That's what I've been told. It's always the size. I like the simplicity of it. Inside,

39:11.560 --> 39:17.920
there's just this little board. I don't even think there's a fan. It's fairly light for

39:17.920 --> 39:23.600
the size. It's a 15-inch and it's just super simple. It was also really expensive. I think

39:23.600 --> 39:31.000
it was like just over 200 bucks. It was pretty new at the time. I bought it refurbished,

39:31.000 --> 39:34.240
but it was pretty darn new at the time because people buy Chromebooks and they don't like

39:34.240 --> 39:37.960
them and then they send them back or whatever.

39:37.960 --> 39:42.520
I get like tons of battery life in this thing because they're engineered for long battery

39:42.520 --> 39:48.320
life and it doesn't have more power than I need, hence giving up the battery life. Also,

39:48.320 --> 39:52.520
I had never done it and I was like, oh, I need to flash one of these Chromebooks with

39:52.520 --> 39:56.680
core boot because right now I need to do the world a favor. There needs to be more core

39:56.680 --> 40:03.360
boot out there. Lockdown firmware is not okay. It was partly an experiment for me. Once this

40:03.360 --> 40:08.040
thing gets long in the tooth, I'm seriously considering possibly System76 something, but

40:08.040 --> 40:15.520
I need something that's quiet, like no fan and super thin. I don't know. Sometimes maybe

40:15.520 --> 40:21.360
my standards get in the way of the right choice, but I don't know.

40:21.360 --> 40:26.160
That hits exactly one of the challenges that I see in the world these days is like, okay,

40:26.160 --> 40:32.080
we have things that are worth supporting like Linux and all of those kinds of things, but

40:32.080 --> 40:39.400
so often butts heads with the big sort of corporate giant out there, right?

40:39.400 --> 40:44.960
Also, you can't be talked into spending more than you think something is worth. It's very

40:44.960 --> 40:48.360
difficult to do and the only things that are cheap are the ones that are controlled by

40:48.360 --> 40:49.360
those corporate giants.

40:49.360 --> 40:52.640
Yeah, because of external, some of the cost is externalized.

40:52.640 --> 40:56.560
Right. If you had a comparable priced laptop to the XPS 13 and you knew you were going

40:56.560 --> 41:01.880
to have that support and you knew that you were going to have all that stuff, which again,

41:01.880 --> 41:06.480
System76 gets close to this. So, like I said, they might be, you know, but prior to that,

41:06.480 --> 41:10.600
you'd look at your Linux laptop choices and be like, what am I doing spending that on

41:10.600 --> 41:16.520
that? You know, for what? You know, and it's funny how much that seems to be top of the

41:16.520 --> 41:22.800
list for some people, a lot of people. I'm not saying everyone because there's plenty

41:22.800 --> 41:27.360
of people who don't care. They just want to be, you know, have the freedom.

41:27.360 --> 41:32.040
And that comes back to the question of why do we want Linux to be mainstream? You and

41:32.040 --> 41:39.440
I talked about this before. What is it that makes me want to not proselytize, but share

41:39.440 --> 41:46.160
this with someone because I know it's good. Digital independence is good. And I likened

41:46.160 --> 41:50.960
it to like, it's a constitution. The GPL is like the way that we would run our country,

41:50.960 --> 41:55.320
right? In theory, it's the set of rules by which we run our digital country. And we're

41:55.320 --> 42:01.400
thinking, okay, these are the rules. And if I can just, everybody plays by these rules,

42:01.400 --> 42:06.000
then everybody benefits. So I've got this really cool piece of software and I'm sharing

42:06.000 --> 42:09.680
it with you, not because it's cheap, not because it's free, but because it's going to give

42:09.680 --> 42:16.080
you a little digital independence. And if you're digitally independent and I'm digitally

42:16.080 --> 42:21.000
independent, the more of us that we are, we all benefit. It's not just because it's free.

42:21.000 --> 42:25.480
So it's not just money, it's not just the reason I know we share open source projects

42:25.480 --> 42:32.840
with each other. So that's what I was alluding to when I said that you feel like compelled

42:32.840 --> 42:39.660
to share this with people. And what's the reason for this compulsion for all these years?

42:39.660 --> 42:43.680
And it's the ability to give someone else digital independence because you love them

42:43.680 --> 42:47.400
and you care about them and you care about the outcome for them and the rest of your

42:47.400 --> 42:52.240
fellow human beings. That's why you're doing it. It's not because it's free.

42:52.240 --> 43:00.840
I'm not sure that's in the business model of some of these more capitalistic style endeavors.

43:00.840 --> 43:08.080
Well, you have a lot of people who will say, capitalism inherently is not bad. It's the

43:08.080 --> 43:13.600
abuse of it that's bad. Meaning the idea that we all have jobs and we can pay for our mortgages

43:13.600 --> 43:18.920
and our house and our car and send our kid to school because that's paid for partly with

43:18.920 --> 43:23.560
these commercial entities donating these beautiful computers to the schools. I mean, the capitalism

43:23.560 --> 43:27.280
has its way of giving back to you too.

43:27.280 --> 43:33.840
But one of the things that open source software does and the constitution of open source land

43:33.840 --> 43:40.800
allows us to have is a check on greed. And that is a very unpopular thing to say that

43:40.800 --> 43:45.280
I'm not socialist. I'm not capitalist. I'm not free market. I'm not anything. I think

43:45.280 --> 43:50.800
capitalism is great. It gives us innovation when there are laws against greed, when there

43:50.800 --> 43:57.480
are social contracts against greed because there have to be limits. There are limits

43:57.480 --> 44:03.240
to the earth's resources. There are limits to how much land a single human being needs.

44:03.240 --> 44:06.840
There are limits to how much water and how much electricity and there are limits. And

44:06.840 --> 44:13.440
when you say, nope, our economy has no limits, you're just lying to yourself because it does

44:13.440 --> 44:16.960
have a limit. You're going to hit it and a lot of people are going to suffer and there

44:16.960 --> 44:20.760
will be a lot of suffering while you aren't because you're greedy. And that's not the

44:20.760 --> 44:25.760
kind of world I want to live in or my kids either. So I feel like that's one of the things

44:25.760 --> 44:31.460
that these open source licenses give us, a check on greed. And that's one of the reasons

44:31.460 --> 44:34.640
why I think we all like them because as soon as you start to be an abusive, greedy turd

44:34.640 --> 44:41.080
nogget, we can take the code and do something not greedy with it. Or there's only so much

44:41.080 --> 44:47.040
you can charge before you realize that you can't because anybody has the code. So that's

44:47.040 --> 44:53.420
all you need. You just need a check on greed. And patents ensure that that can't happen

44:53.420 --> 44:59.000
because you can be as greedy as you want for your EpiPen because no one else can make one.

44:59.000 --> 45:03.000
And we're past the point where patents are useful regardless of software or anything

45:03.000 --> 45:07.440
because to get us out of the challenges of climate change, we need to have a moratorium

45:07.440 --> 45:15.040
on all patents in building replacements for Portland cement, replacements for new energy.

45:15.040 --> 45:21.880
But we have this stupid mindset that patenting it will make people rush to make it. No, you're

45:21.880 --> 45:25.360
going to rush to make it because otherwise your kids are dead. Your kids' kids are going

45:25.360 --> 45:28.840
to be suffering majorly. That's why you're going to make it. You're going to make it

45:28.840 --> 45:33.320
because it's going to make the world a better place and save some lives and everything.

45:33.320 --> 45:39.200
But you're hampered. The speed of human knowledge sharing is hampered by the monopoly on that

45:39.200 --> 45:43.440
idea. We're past. The internet made the patents useless, basically is what I'm trying to say

45:43.440 --> 45:44.440
out loud.

45:44.440 --> 45:51.400
Which is a good thing. And so how do you instill like massive innovation? Is it in that patent

45:51.400 --> 45:55.720
system or is it in the open source system? And I think we can all agree that...

45:55.720 --> 46:01.800
No, you have it. Well, open source generally doesn't have patents operating inside it.

46:01.800 --> 46:04.800
We join the open invention network. We do everything we can just to make the patent

46:04.800 --> 46:09.700
rules go away so we can build, so we can do things. Has open source come up with anything

46:09.700 --> 46:15.440
cool that commercial software hasn't? Well, I think the answer to that is yes. So what

46:15.440 --> 46:19.600
was the impetus for that then? To get your patent pay off? Did you need everybody to

46:19.600 --> 46:24.040
not build it while you were building it so that you could build it? Well, then how was

46:24.040 --> 46:29.440
it possible? It was possible because that's what human endeavor is. It's discovering the

46:29.440 --> 46:34.480
unknown. It's creating what hasn't yet been created. It's building a better mousetrap.

46:34.480 --> 46:38.760
It's saying, I did this more efficiently. Hey, see here, Brent, I actually have this

46:38.760 --> 46:42.160
on my house and it's super efficient. And then you go back to your house and you make

46:42.160 --> 46:47.040
your plumbing that way. That's what humanity has been doing for millennia and patents are

46:47.040 --> 46:51.360
just in the way now because anybody anywhere can share their knowledge. And you don't need

46:51.360 --> 46:55.720
a capital impetus to do that. You don't. You just need to want to save your child's life

46:55.720 --> 47:00.720
if you're a doctor to make up a new medicine or care about someone else besides yourself.

47:00.720 --> 47:05.500
You know, I read a very unfortunate stat recently of, you know, it's one of those stats just

47:05.500 --> 47:13.200
gets worse every year of something insane like the 24 richest people in the world have

47:13.200 --> 47:18.300
more than like the lower three and a half billion or something like that. It's like,

47:18.300 --> 47:23.560
how did we even get here? And how is this serving anyone? It's not. It's not serving

47:23.560 --> 47:32.240
anyone but 24 people. Well, serving 28 people. But it's easy. There's just no limit to greed.

47:32.240 --> 47:36.920
And greed sounds like, you know, I'm not a religious person. I'm not at all. I'm an atheist.

47:36.920 --> 47:40.360
I made a documentary called The Unbelievers with Richard Dawkins and Lawrence Krauss.

47:40.360 --> 47:47.100
I was the producer. It's not greed in the classical sense. It's just literally having

47:47.100 --> 47:51.960
more than you need. And not just more than you need, but multiple, multiple millions

47:51.960 --> 47:57.560
of times more than any human needs. And like, I'm okay with things that would normally be

47:57.560 --> 48:02.960
greedy. Like if we just closed our eyes right now and said, anyone in the world can make

48:02.960 --> 48:10.760
$500,000 a year, but no more. There's a whole bunch of people for which they'd be like,

48:10.760 --> 48:15.280
that is plenty of money. Oh, man. What could I do with $500,000 a year if I don't live

48:15.280 --> 48:19.640
in San Francisco? There's a whole bunch of people who are like, that's just not enough.

48:19.640 --> 48:25.240
Well, those are the people that we have a problem. We have some kind of problem. And

48:25.240 --> 48:29.960
if I pegged that number to inflation, and it just wrote out, you know, for the rest

48:29.960 --> 48:34.920
of the year, what would we do with all that extra money? You know, we'd have a great society.

48:34.920 --> 48:38.880
Why do you need that much more? Well, I need another house. I need ski trips. I need all

48:38.880 --> 48:45.040
this. Well, the reason that you need that is probably because you got the money to blow

48:45.040 --> 48:50.680
maybe, or you're not feeling very philanthropic because you didn't really give anything away.

48:50.680 --> 48:57.680
I mean, you can live a great life for, I mean, what? $750,000 then. We'll up it to that.

48:57.680 --> 49:01.560
A million dollars. That's the most you can make, $1 million a year. Everybody listening

49:01.560 --> 49:05.600
to this right now, that's the most you can make. I put a cap at $1 million. Are you going

49:05.600 --> 49:08.840
to be okay making a million dollars a year? Is anybody listening to this not going to

49:08.840 --> 49:14.640
be okay with that? If you are, you're in the incredible freaking minority. You are. And

49:14.640 --> 49:20.040
if I paid everybody listening to this a million dollars a year, we could do that with the

49:20.040 --> 49:22.480
amount of wealth that's squirreled away.

49:22.480 --> 49:25.000
Yeah. And still have extra.

49:25.000 --> 49:28.040
We'll have extra because your schools would be amazing then. Where else would the rest

49:28.040 --> 49:34.040
of the money in the economy go? Wouldn't disappear. It'd still be there. We'd have amazing schools.

49:34.040 --> 49:41.800
You'd have plenty of money left over because there'd be no reason to keep it.

49:41.800 --> 50:00.480
Well, listeners, we're going to take a tiny break here for now, so stay tuned for part

50:00.480 --> 50:04.400
two coming this Friday. That's only three days away from more of my great conversation

50:04.400 --> 50:18.720
with Jason Spizak. We'll see you on the other side.
