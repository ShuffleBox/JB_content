00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,360
Hello, everyone. This is another episode of Brunch with Brent. I'm joined today by Rocco.

2
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,360
How are you doing, Rocco?

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,840
I am doing excellent, Brent. How are you?

4
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,600
I'm actually doing really well. I think you can tell I'm very excited to be chatting with

5
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:28,880
you. I wanted to mention that you are involved in a whole bunch of really cool stuff, but

6
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,320
you're going to supplement what I have to say. So where I know you the most is from

7
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:40,600
Linux Spotlight, where you interview a whole bunch of great people in our Linux community,

8
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:46,560
and some know you as part of the Big Daddy Linux network as well. I mean, those two are

9
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:51,820
pretty deep rabbit holes of great community stuff, right?

10
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:59,260
We have a really good community with the Big Daddy Linux live show. It's something that

11
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:04,400
you can't get anywhere else, where you can get a bunch of people together that talk about

12
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,480
the same stuff that you talk about every day.

13
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:12,900
For those who have never experienced it, can you give us a little run-through of what happens

14
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,840
every week and who joins and this kind of thing?

15
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:23,800
Every Saturday at 8 p.m. Eastern, we do a live stream on YouTube and Twitch, where we

16
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:32,040
just open up a Zoom room and anybody and everybody can join this room. The first hour, we talk

17
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,920
about a Distro challenge that we've been doing for sometimes it's a week, sometimes it's

18
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:43,920
two weeks. Then the second hour is open to pretty much any other Linux topic that you

19
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:50,360
can think of, and we get into so much stuff. I mean, we can go really deep into technical

20
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:57,440
stuff and then just into superficial stuff. We have users that are very technical, some

21
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:02,160
developers, and there's a lot of names that people would know, and then there's a lot

22
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:08,400
of people from just normal everyday users from the community that join, and it's such

23
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,360
a mishmash of people, and it's awesome. I love it.

24
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:17,200
Yeah, well, there's all this synergy that happens between those groups of people, right?

25
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,480
When you have someone from a whole bunch of different backgrounds, you never really know

26
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,600
the conversations that you'll get into, right?

27
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:29,040
You don't know the conversations, and to be honest with you, you don't know the people

28
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:36,160
until you learn about them more from the Linux spotlight. There have been people in, and

29
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:43,120
I'll just highlight Barbara. She is a Biddle community member. She has been on Biddle for,

30
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,920
I don't know, over a year or so, and you get to talk to her. I mean, she'll say things,

31
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:54,600
she'll interject, and yet it wasn't until Linux spotlight, her episode, that you get

32
00:02:54,600 --> 00:03:00,120
to meet her, learn about her history, learn about all the things that she's done, and

33
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,940
she's an amazing person, and you don't get that in the couple minutes of Biddle, so it's

34
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:07,680
kind of like goes hand in hand. It's awesome.

35
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:13,720
It's almost like on Biddle, you get a tiny taste of the person, and then Linux spotlight

36
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:18,580
is a beautiful place where you can just do deep dives on one person specifically, right?

37
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:22,800
It's not perfected. You know, Biddle itself is not perfected because you're in a group

38
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:29,160
of people, and the setting is basically like if you went to a Linux user group or you went

39
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:35,400
to a, I don't know, a pub somewhere, and you were all sitting around talking about Linux,

40
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,480
so there are times where people get interrupted or whatever, because you're in such a big

41
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:44,720
conversation with, we get up to 30 people sometimes in the same room.

42
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,360
Yeah, to moderate, right?

43
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:51,640
That's hard to moderate. It's hard for people to listen to sometimes because along with

44
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:56,460
that whole idea of having 30 people, there are connection issues sometimes. People will

45
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:01,360
have a slower connection, so they will hear a delay, so they'll start talking when other

46
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:08,560
people talk, so that's challenging, but it's so much fun, and I think you should do it

47
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,080
too.

48
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:16,800
As you know, I haven't experienced it yet, mostly because I would say I tend towards

49
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:23,220
being quite introverted, maybe to some people's surprise, and so that, I'm definitely going

50
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:29,160
to come and join, but it's like, okay, I need to sort of from the outside just kind of watch

51
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:33,160
a little bit for a while and see how it all works, and then I'm going to jump right in,

52
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,560
so I accept your challenge completely.

53
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,680
I would have to call you on that being introverted.

54
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,380
Oh, bring it on.

55
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:46,680
I have went back and listened to all of the Brunch with Brents, and you make people feel

56
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:53,480
comfortable when they're talking to you, and that is a special talent that you have, so

57
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:57,340
I don't believe you're introverted at all.

58
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,920
Maybe I'm just putting on a really good performance.

59
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,920
There you go.

60
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:07,040
You know, I've explained, I think, before how my main profession is being a photographer,

61
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:13,500
and in photography, one of the biggest skills that I was handed from a few of my mentors

62
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:19,420
was the skill of becoming friends with someone in five minutes, because if you're doing a

63
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:25,080
portrait of someone, you know, I've done a lot of portraits of high-tech executives,

64
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:31,800
for instance, and people at the Bank of Canada and all that kind of stuff, and so it's someone

65
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:38,440
you've never met before, but it's really important to make them feel as much at ease as you possibly

66
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:43,580
can because otherwise you're just not going to get a good photograph, right?

67
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:47,240
And as you know, podcasting is much the same.

68
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:54,200
It may not be a photograph, but it's a conversation or some audio, and so I never expected it,

69
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:59,040
but those skills kind of translate in a really beautiful way, so thank you for picking up

70
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,040
on that.

71
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,040
That's really great.

72
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:05,360
Those skills do translate into podcasting more than people think because you're a lot

73
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:13,400
of times interviewing people that you've never spoken to before, never saw before, and that

74
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:21,680
conversation can start out very rough, and in order to get a good conversation, a good

75
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,240
natural flowing conversation, you need that.

76
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,160
You need what you give people, and that's to feel comfortable.

77
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,160
Well, thanks.

78
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,160
Yeah.

79
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,720
I mean, you have had the same experience.

80
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:38,920
You know, you were just describing you get to know someone in the Biddle Weekly, but

81
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:43,520
then when you have them one-on-one, it's kind of a whole different ballgame, isn't it, right?

82
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:51,600
Like you, especially as the host, there's this way that you need to guide the conversation

83
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:57,720
in a way, and of course we want it to be authentic and really smooth, but there are those moments

84
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,320
when it's up to you to kind of like keep the air going, right?

85
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,320
Yes.

86
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,200
Some conversations are easier than others.

87
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:10,360
There are people who talk very well and enjoy talking, and there are other people who just

88
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:17,560
give you sometimes just like a one-line answer, and if you don't moderate it the right way,

89
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:22,400
that episode will probably be like 10 minutes long.

90
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,640
Some people only want 10-minute episodes.

91
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:31,200
So that brings me to a question then, which is you've been doing Linux Spotlight I think

92
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:37,200
for about like as we record 24 or so episodes now.

93
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:41,440
What made you want to dive in and have those conversations in the first place?

94
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,440
To be honest with you, it was the Biddle community.

95
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:48,600
We were discussing one day on Biddle people's history.

96
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:52,600
Like somebody had brought up, you know, how did you find Linux?

97
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:58,240
Well, we started talking and we went down the row individually of how this person started

98
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:03,040
in Linux, and we got like two or three people in, and then the episode would end, and then

99
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,600
we would continue it in the next week.

100
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:12,520
But I said, man, wouldn't it be cool if there was like one place you could go and find everybody's

101
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,080
history in Linux?

102
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:19,360
Like if you want to know this person's history or that person's history, I can go to Linux

103
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,280
Spotlight, or at that time it wasn't even born yet, but I can go to this place and find

104
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,880
it and hear about it.

105
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,600
And that's where it all started.

106
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:36,320
And I ended up doing my friend Zebedee Boss as the first episode, and it just took off

107
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:44,400
from there of doing community members and other members of the wider Linux community

108
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,200
and then grew into all kinds of people.

109
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,200
Yeah.

110
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:54,480
I mean, what a great insight that you had to create something like that, because I think

111
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,480
you totally nailed it.

112
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:59,200
There's a real thirst for getting to know people in our community, and that's sort of

113
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,520
the same taste that you get when you go to some conferences, right?

114
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:08,920
You get to talk to people one-on-one, if you're lucky, and you have kind of brought that to

115
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,840
a greater audience in a way.

116
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:14,520
So kudos to you for taking on that initiative.

117
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:20,120
Like it feels to me like it has so much potential in the sense that our community is huge, and

118
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:27,520
it's filled with amazing people, and the community that you have surrounding you is slightly

119
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:31,160
different than the community that I might have surrounding me.

120
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:38,040
And so it's been fascinating to watch how all of these different people exist out there

121
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:42,480
that I may have never heard of but are fascinating people, like you were saying, right?

122
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:48,920
Your first episode is a bit of a leap because it's the first time you try it, but of course

123
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:52,600
all this magic happens when two great, you know, interesting people get in a room and

124
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,600
just have a chat.

125
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,560
Well, I knew there were awesome people in the community.

126
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:04,320
I knew that from meeting half these people on Biddle and everywhere else, being on Destination

127
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,520
Linux.

128
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:12,580
So I met a lot of awesome people, but you don't realize until, well, okay, so I didn't

129
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:19,040
realize how awesome our community is until you start doing the Linux spotlight and you

130
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,280
see this person, and wow, man, it can't get any better than this, and then the next person

131
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:27,800
comes along and has a completely different outlook on things, and man, that was such

132
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,540
an awesome conversation.

133
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:35,280
And then it just keeps building and getting better and better, and it's a gift to me to

134
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,880
be able to talk to so many awesome people out there.

135
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,880
And then a gift right back to the community for you to make those conversations available

136
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,880
to them, right?

137
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:48,140
Because you get to know these people in a really lovely way, and then at the same time

138
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:51,760
so does everyone else, which is super amazing.

139
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:58,720
Well, another side effect to this is, you know, you had mentioned about, you know, our

140
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:05,520
community and then the community that you're in, and it combines all of them to where all

141
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:11,440
of the communities can come together and see a little bit of this and a little bit of that,

142
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,640
and we all end up coming together in one place, and that's another great side effect of it.

143
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,200
I will echo that completely.

144
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:25,760
I believe you've heard the chat that I did with Martin Wimpress, with Wimpy, and his

145
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:32,080
big ask at the end of our conversation was, he was speaking a little bit more about distributions,

146
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:36,480
but more so just around these little groups that we form in the Linux community, you know,

147
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,400
oh, I love this distribution, so I'm part of the arch, you know, community or whatever.

148
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:48,860
And he his big ask was, let's be really kind to each other in the opposite, you know, we

149
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,640
see it as the opposite community.

150
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:56,920
But the reality is, we are all Linux users, and we all in the real depths of our hearts

151
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,320
believe in the same stuff, right?

152
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:03,480
So if you have a community somewhere, and there's a community just near you that believes

153
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:07,680
almost the same stuff, go in there and dive in, like, chances are, they're amazing people

154
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,960
too.

155
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:13,120
And if we can increase those communities and increase the links that happen between them

156
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,280
all, I feel like that's where the real nuggets are.

157
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:19,960
And I feel like in many ways, you're, you're making those links happen.

158
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,800
And that's hugely valuable.

159
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:26,640
So a thank you from the community for what what you're doing, really.

160
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:32,640
Well, I think it's really important and I don't want to base, I don't want to say the

161
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:39,580
same thing that Martin said, but I will say that it's a great thing to see different communities

162
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:45,300
because there was always this and there wasn't there wasn't any walls.

163
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:50,280
But there was always this is the this community and this is that community and they're, they

164
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:56,320
all run Linux, but they're all separate kind of, and they all stick to the same community.

165
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:02,800
And I think that's the one thing that we need to break down is that we are all Linux users.

166
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:10,040
And we all are not just Linux users, but we all have the same type of direction that we're

167
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:16,200
going in, because of and surrounding Linux, but it's all let's, let's go forward with

168
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,200
it.

169
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:22,840
Yeah, like shared goals, almost right is like, we all want to advance whatever we love a

170
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,840
little bit more.

171
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:28,040
But the reality is, we all kind of love the same thing.

172
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,760
So why shouldn't we?

173
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,760
We know each other.

174
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:37,440
Yeah, I feel like that's the real gift, right is you're you're helping to expose not only

175
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:43,000
the individual person that you're chatting with on a regular basis, but also the type

176
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:49,140
of person like, okay, I might be a certain type of person in our Linux community.

177
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:55,000
And surely there's other people in this entire world that are similar to me in that way.

178
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,880
And so I think really, the gift is breaking down the unknown.

179
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:05,400
Maybe that that's what it was like, in the in all these different communities, unless

180
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:11,240
you have some relationship to the other community, then you got nothing to go on, right?

181
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:19,200
I feel like with Big Daddy Linux weekly that you're doing, with all those people involved,

182
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,420
it helps bridge those differences.

183
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:25,000
But then yeah, these spotlights have been really amazing.

184
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,680
Like the spotlight you did with Jill was so much fun with with Jill Brian Reinecker.

185
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:34,000
And it was like, just this infectious energy.

186
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,840
I know she's like, infectious as it is.

187
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:43,200
But but even just the the topics you guys dove into, I just I mentioned it on the chat

188
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,140
her and I did, but it was super awesome.

189
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:51,840
So I really hope you keep doing these chats for a very long time.

190
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,320
It's been super fun to watch them all.

191
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,280
Do you have a little taste of maybe where you see it going?

192
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:06,440
Well, I don't have a ultimate goal for Linux spotlight except for cataloging and highlighting

193
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:14,920
the Linux users in the community because there are some people that will never get that chance,

194
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,720
unless something like that happens.

195
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:25,680
So you know, nobody would maybe hear about this person, unless you make a video on them

196
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,720
or you make a podcast on them.

197
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:35,520
And Brent, I have seen so many people that don't say a whole lot.

198
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:40,880
But then when you talk to them individually, they are such awesome people and and the thing

199
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:46,880
is, sometimes they don't think they are like they don't think they have a lot of anything

200
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:53,600
to give to the community and they do everybody has something to give to the community.

201
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,800
Everybody has something to offer, they just may not realize it.

202
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:02,840
And Linux spotlight highlights that fact that those people, regardless of who they are,

203
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:08,320
if they're a developer for a major operating system, or they're just a regular everyday

204
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,560
user, everybody has something to give.

205
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:16,980
It feels like to me you bring a really big part of your heart to those conversations

206
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:21,540
because it feels like there's a whole lot of empathy there of saying that you can learn

207
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:24,480
something from every single person, right?

208
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,620
If you only give them the chance.

209
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:32,900
If you give them that opportunity to talk and you give it in a setting that is comfortable,

210
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:36,800
they will shine and they will show you what they have to offer.

211
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,440
And all I got to do is hit record.

212
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:42,300
You have it easy.

213
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:47,600
Is there a conversation that sort of sticks out for you in in that scene?

214
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,900
Now I ask a lot of different questions on Linux spotlight, but I'm most interested in

215
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:55,640
how people found Linux.

216
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,640
When did you hear about it?

217
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:01,800
How did you hear about this Linux operating system?

218
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,040
And there are so many different answers.

219
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,360
Nobody has the same story.

220
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:11,140
It may be similar, but everybody has that little thing about their story that you just

221
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:14,380
don't get in somebody else's story.

222
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:20,860
And I won't say that any one conversation has stuck out, but I will say that there are

223
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:26,580
some regular stories like, Hey, I was working here and some guy mentioned it.

224
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:33,380
But when you hear people like Jill talk about how she got into Linux and she got into just

225
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:38,020
developing at an early age, her history was so rich.

226
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:41,220
It was absolutely fabulous.

227
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:46,840
I mean that conversation, you just sit there and you know, I'm just sitting there smiling

228
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:51,840
through the whole conversation because you know, not only is she a awesome person to

229
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:59,100
talk to because she just has this way about her and her laugh and, but the actual meat

230
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,940
of the conversation, it was fantastic.

231
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:02,940
Yeah.

232
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:07,020
Well it, it echoed for me exactly what you just said earlier, which is you get to know

233
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:10,700
so much more about a person in that context, right?

234
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:15,180
Like I think you and I knew Jill before we had our conversations with her, but there

235
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:19,860
was so much I learned about her during your chat with her that I was like, I just know

236
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:24,500
this person as someone who's really great, who seems to know stuff about Linux and maybe

237
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,760
does a bit of animation.

238
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:30,340
But then once I listened to your conversation, it's like, Oh wait, she has so much depth.

239
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,340
Yes.

240
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:37,260
And you're suggesting, and I totally support it that everyone has that same depth, right?

241
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:40,000
You just have to give it an opportunity to shine.

242
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,060
You have to give them that opportunity, but I would like to go back to something you said

243
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:49,100
about your, your conversation and our, and my conversation with her.

244
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:56,540
I think that the two conversations are different and yet the same, and you can learn about

245
00:18:56,540 --> 00:19:01,660
Jill things that you didn't know in Linux spotlight, and you can also learn about Jill

246
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:07,140
things you didn't know about her in your chat with her on your show.

247
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:10,340
And there's no way I would miss either one of them.

248
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:17,340
So I agree completely and I connected with Jill, I think a few weeks before your conversation

249
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:20,480
and for various reasons, we just didn't get a chance to record.

250
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,440
And so when I saw your conversation come out, I was like, Oh, this is really interesting.

251
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,220
Like I'm going to totally listen to it.

252
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:31,540
And I was floored by just how much of a fun discussion it was.

253
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:35,240
And then I thought, I don't want to step on your toes for what you did because you guys

254
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:40,880
had such a great conversation that was like totally great quality.

255
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,820
So I thought there's no way I want to like redo that.

256
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:44,900
That doesn't make any sense.

257
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:49,780
And in the spirit of being community, I thought I'm going to take the great conversation you

258
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:52,440
guys did and just supplement it.

259
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:56,580
And then it could be like two communities coming together exactly like you were saying,

260
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:57,580
right?

261
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:02,620
And so it was so important to me to mention that discussion of yours right on the outset

262
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:07,260
so that people had context for where we are going next.

263
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:12,560
And so I really hope that everyone who listened to the conversation, the brunt that I did

264
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:17,460
with her took in your discussion too, because there was so much brilliance in there.

265
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:25,080
And and and it also I will say Rocco, it feels really nice that you and I can complement

266
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,180
each other.

267
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:31,580
Like I think in some contexts, it could easily be seen as like, Oh, two people trying to

268
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:34,820
accomplish the same thing, but in a rivalry setting.

269
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:37,140
And I don't think that's the right approach at all.

270
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:43,540
I think that that's exactly what we need to break down in the Linux community is this

271
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:49,460
whole rivalry, whether it be about my desktop environment against your desktop environment

272
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,540
or your community against my community.

273
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,940
We are all one community.

274
00:20:53,940 --> 00:21:03,460
And I, I am so happy listening to your episodes on your show, I never think about, Hey, you're

275
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:06,620
doing this person and I should be doing this person or you're doing this person.

276
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:08,060
And well, now I can't.

277
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,180
That's ridiculous.

278
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,620
That is absolutely ridiculous.

279
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:11,680
It's totally ridiculous.

280
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:16,380
I'm sure in the future, we're going to do the same thing we're going to do similar people.

281
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,780
That's just because we're in the same communities.

282
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:24,220
Well, and what's been really interesting is, is that some of the people I've chatted with,

283
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:30,780
I didn't, I either didn't realize that they've already chatted with you, or that they have

284
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:33,140
since come and had a chat with you.

285
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:34,980
And you learn all sorts of new things, right?

286
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:40,660
Like I think you recently released an episode with with cheese bacon.

287
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:46,700
And you did a chat with L and those are all some Jupiter broadcasting crew members.

288
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:51,740
And I've seen so much of your community say like, Oh yeah, these are great people.

289
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:55,540
And so both of our communities are growing together and it's such an awesome gift.

290
00:21:55,540 --> 00:22:00,560
And it's, it's really cool from my position and from the seat you're sitting in to watch

291
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:03,080
that happen in real time.

292
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:07,580
You know, I've, I've got this giant smile on my face because I've just thinking of like,

293
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:11,700
okay, in six months, where is that energy that you and I are putting into these discussions

294
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,700
going to take us and going to take our community?

295
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:19,260
It feels like in many ways so cool to have, you know, a partner in a way that's trying

296
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:20,260
to accomplish the same thing.

297
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:28,980
So so kudos to you for for bringing that same energy to all of this, it feels like a real

298
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:32,540
treat to have like, someone who's trying to accomplish the same thing.

299
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:33,820
So thanks for that.

300
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:39,380
I think that this is, like I said before, just as much as the gift to me than it is

301
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:41,980
that it is to the community itself.

302
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:44,100
I enjoy these conversations so much.

303
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,380
And that's why I do it.

304
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:48,820
Because I, I do enjoy talking to these people.

305
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:55,100
And again, some of these people, you, you don't even realize how much they had to offer

306
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,700
until you get to talk to them.

307
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:06,680
I thought it might be kind of fun to ask you a few questions, Linux spotlight way.

308
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:10,820
Because sometimes, you know, as as hosts of some of these conversations, you may pick

309
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:13,140
up a few little nuggets here and there.

310
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:15,220
So I will bounce one of your questions right back to you.

311
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,220
How did you?

312
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:21,060
How did you first get into Linux and what grabbed you about it?

313
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:26,060
There have been people that have asked when my spotlight is going to be and I keep telling

314
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:31,540
them that after everybody else is done, that will be when you know what I have had the

315
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:35,020
exact same question repeatedly.

316
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:41,780
And and I have a twin brother, and so I am often my quick response as well, I'll just

317
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:42,780
interview my twin brother.

318
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:45,700
And that'll kind of be the quasi discussion, right?

319
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:51,640
But there's this humbling quality that I pick up in us like, No, no, I'm not the important

320
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,640
one.

321
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,640
Let's concentrate on the other person.

322
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,340
But I wonder if some people might be interested in that kind of stuff as well to get to know

323
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,340
you a little bit better.

324
00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:01,380
Well, I mean, they may be interested, but there's many other more interesting people

325
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,560
out there than I am.

326
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:06,460
So but where did I start Linux?

327
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:12,980
Years ago, I had had many computers, Windows, I was into tweaking it.

328
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:21,340
I had become an expert at reformatting Windows, because of how many times I messed it up.

329
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:26,340
I read all kinds of tech magazines and websites and whatnot.

330
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:34,140
So I ended up trying Ubuntu the first time, and somehow, I don't know exactly how I did

331
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:37,780
it, but I ended up messing up my Windows partition.

332
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:38,780
That's easy to do.

333
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:41,820
That's super easy to do, especially back then.

334
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:44,380
Yeah, I didn't like it.

335
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:49,140
So I reported, I put Windows back on, and I just put Linux to the side.

336
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:56,560
And then later, a few years, goodbye, and then there was the will-be installer.

337
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:03,620
So that would put Linux aside of your Windows partition, which was perfect for me.

338
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:10,600
And I tried it, and I booted into the desktop, and it was great, except I had no idea how

339
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,580
to get to my files.

340
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:19,080
So I would open the file manager, but it wouldn't recognize the drive that I had my files on.

341
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,260
And I was completely unfamiliar with Linux.

342
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:26,940
So as much as it was exciting, I just decided, you know what?

343
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:31,140
It's great, but if I can't get to my files and I can't do anything, then it's kind of

344
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:32,140
not for me.

345
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:37,940
A few years go down, and then I end up trying it again.

346
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:39,980
And that time, it worked.

347
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:45,820
And I don't remember what distribution I started with, to be honest with you.

348
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:52,740
But I ended up on KDE, and KDE 3.5 days were awesome.

349
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:56,300
It was like a tweaker's dream to have that.

350
00:25:56,300 --> 00:26:02,160
I mean, you could tweak every single setting possible, and I loved it.

351
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:08,940
The reason that I created my YouTube channel was because at that time, there was no videos

352
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:09,940
on KDE.

353
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:12,060
I mean, there were no tutorials on the settings.

354
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:18,500
It was like you were in this huge land of settings, and you had no idea what half of

355
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,500
them did.

356
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:24,340
And I said to myself, you know, I could create a video to tell people about the settings,

357
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:27,220
but I don't really know all of the settings.

358
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:30,960
I felt like you needed to know every setting in order to start.

359
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:36,460
So it was actually my dad who said to me, well, you just tell them what you know.

360
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,460
Wise words.

361
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:38,460
Okay.

362
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:43,260
And I just started making videos on customizing KDE.

363
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:49,120
And if you look at my YouTube channel in the very beginning, it was nothing but KDE customization

364
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,460
tutorials and settings and stuff.

365
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:55,460
So yeah, that's basically my Linux history in a nutshell.

366
00:26:55,460 --> 00:27:00,220
Yeah, it sounds like you were, with the videos, scratching your own itch in many ways, right?

367
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:04,700
And sometimes they say that's the best indication of something that you should do is when you

368
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,380
really desire it, but it doesn't exist.

369
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:10,260
Like, okay, I guess I'll make it.

370
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:12,300
And look where that's led you now, right?

371
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,300
Yep.

372
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:18,740
So I had the channel and I was doing, you know, different videos.

373
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:21,060
I started to do distributed reviews.

374
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:24,520
It became a headache at some point.

375
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,520
In what way?

376
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:32,420
In a way of you felt like, or I felt like I needed to keep up with every distribution

377
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,420
that came out.

378
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:37,380
Like, so every distribution that came out, I needed to do a video on it.

379
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:41,460
And it was like, that was too much basically.

380
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:47,260
So I kind of, I don't know, took a break from doing videos as far as distribution videos

381
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,980
were concerned.

382
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:54,900
And then I met a guy named Rob Collins who had a Linux YouTube channel and he asked me

383
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:58,940
to come on his show to talk about stuff, talk about Linux.

384
00:27:58,940 --> 00:27:59,940
And I was like, sure.

385
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:04,060
He had a lot, he just made a live stream and we just started talking, we hit it off.

386
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:08,740
And then that's when the Destination Linux podcast was born.

387
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:10,620
And how did he find you?

388
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:18,060
Well, I was watching his videos and he had a way about him that was, he wouldn't, you

389
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:21,340
know, dive deep into tutorials.

390
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:29,140
He wouldn't dive deep into deep technology, but he would give you overviews in a way that

391
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:32,540
was very friendly and very casual.

392
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:34,740
And that I enjoyed.

393
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:40,060
And I just started watching his videos and was on his, he had a live stream the one time

394
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:45,100
I was in chat and was saying hi to him and talking to him and slowly but surely he said,

395
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,100
Hey, you want to come on?

396
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,100
Sure.

397
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:50,780
It's funny how that progression is so important, right?

398
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:57,140
Like I always say the best thing you can do as a community member, if you enjoy a show

399
00:28:57,140 --> 00:29:01,020
like that or something is just show up in some way where you can start making connections,

400
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:02,020
right?

401
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:05,820
And sometimes that's just being in an IRC or a chat on YouTube or something like that.

402
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:10,380
And that's where it starts and you start to get like tastes of that community.

403
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:16,060
And then you start maybe providing your own perspective and then it grows and grows from

404
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:17,060
there.

405
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:20,900
And then, Oh, all of a sudden maybe you get invited to share your perspective with audio

406
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:21,900
or something like that.

407
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:22,900
And then it grows and grows.

408
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:25,580
And I mean, that's how it happened for me.

409
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:27,860
That's how it happened for you.

410
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:35,180
And I hear that story so often is somebody shows up for a few weeks in a row and all

411
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:39,700
of a sudden they get to become friends with people they never expected.

412
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:43,300
And that leads to all sorts of opportunities that you could never even imagine.

413
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,300
Right?

414
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:47,860
Well, there are many stories just like what you're talking about.

415
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:53,660
And then there are the stories of Eric Adams who has his own YouTube channel, helped me

416
00:29:53,660 --> 00:30:01,780
out with the Biddle community, making a website, a proper website and a discourse forums.

417
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:08,300
And from this discourse forums, you see people join and they say, yeah, I've been watching

418
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:11,020
Biddle for a year and a half.

419
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:13,180
I just figured I'd say hi.

420
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:16,380
Never heard of that person, never saw their name come up.

421
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:18,700
And that is awesome to me.

422
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,340
That's the people I want to talk to.

423
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:24,620
That's the people, you know, the people that are just watching in the background, not even

424
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:31,100
involved in the YouTube chat, but they're there and they have a story to tell too.

425
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:36,380
I love hearing and seeing those posts come in when they're like, yeah, this is my first

426
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:37,740
time I've been watching for a long time.

427
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:39,900
I've been trolling or, you know, in the background.

428
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:43,580
Well, cause we can empathize because that was us at one point.

429
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:44,580
Right?

430
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:45,580
Yep.

431
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:51,580
So how do you take that initial hello and make it blossom in some way?

432
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:54,900
That's exactly how Biddle started.

433
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:58,580
I just decided one day I was just going to do a live stream and I was going to check

434
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:03,020
out a distribution and I called it Friday Night Live.

435
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,980
I just pulled up a distribution.

436
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:08,940
I don't even remember which one it was and there were these people that showed up and

437
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:13,300
eventually I said, Hey, you know, do you want to come on and talk?

438
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:16,100
And two or three people joined that night.

439
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:20,220
And from there it just started, well, why don't we do it again next week?

440
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:25,100
And from there, there were many iterations of, I switched times trying to find the perfect

441
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,660
time, which there is no perfect time for everybody.

442
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:28,660
It's so true.

443
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:29,660
Right.

444
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:31,100
Especially when you start to reach globally.

445
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,380
I hate time zones, dude.

446
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:33,380
I hate them.

447
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:36,880
Blame the sun.

448
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:42,180
But uh, you know, it went from Friday Night Live and then it turned into what it is today,

449
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:46,460
which is Big Daddy Linux Live, which we don't really, that's too long of a name to call

450
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:47,460
it.

451
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:50,460
So we just call it Biddle.

452
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:53,300
And it's of course going to continue evolving, right?

453
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,340
That's just kind of the nature of it.

454
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:57,740
We will change things from time to time.

455
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:00,700
Like, uh, we didn't always have a district challenge.

456
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:05,780
It was just, we would get on for two hours and talk, but it just was a kind of a natural

457
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:10,460
progression to change with that to say, you know, well, you know, we were all talking

458
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:13,820
about trying the new, say, Ubuntu that came out.

459
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:17,300
Well, why don't we all try it and talk about it?

460
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:20,020
And that's how that ended up coming about.

461
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:25,180
And um, there are times where we'll do a two week challenge, uh, but we've been doing one

462
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:30,940
week challenges lately because when you try the Ubuntus and we want to try them, but when

463
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:34,980
they release every six months and you got six or eight to try, you can't do a two week

464
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:38,820
challenge or you'd be doing nothing but them.

465
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:44,300
So, uh, so for that, like right now we're at a one week challenge for each Ubuntu flavor

466
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:49,020
and then we'll, after that's done, we'll continue on with community suggestions for distros

467
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:50,020
and everything.

468
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:54,460
Well, and what's so cool about that is that you're getting perspectives from a whole bunch

469
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:59,020
of different types of users just from the nature of that, of the people that show up,

470
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:00,020
right?

471
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:02,140
And I don't know if you can get that anywhere else.

472
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:07,700
I think one thing about it is that I, what I don't want people to think is that you have

473
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:12,300
to try the distro challenge in order to join a lot.

474
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:15,760
I get that a lot where why didn't try the distro challenge for I'm not joining this

475
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:20,340
week or I'm, I, you know, if it's somebody new, why didn't try it?

476
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:22,020
That's not a necessity.

477
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:25,060
If you want to, you can, and if you don't, that's great.

478
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:28,500
If anybody's listening and they want to join, they don't have to do the distro challenge.

479
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,500
That's an important nugget, right?

480
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:34,480
It's like, even if you join and say nothing, you're still there and that presence is felt.

481
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:41,260
And we have people that join, uh, there's a guy on there, Paul, and he comes in and

482
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:43,460
he rarely says anything.

483
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:48,900
He loves being there and he'll throw in one thing here or one thing there at the very

484
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:52,300
end, but he continually comes every week and I love it.

485
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:53,300
Yeah.

486
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:57,460
You know, that reminds me a lot of, of Linux unplugged that we do with Jupiter broadcasting,

487
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,460
which is audio only.

488
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:00,180
Um, but it's very similar.

489
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:05,740
Like we do a mumble room and, and anybody can join and lots of people just show up and

490
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:10,460
you don't necessarily hear from them unless you're, you know, before the show or after

491
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:11,700
the show.

492
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:17,180
And yet it's still so nice to see those familiar, well, I was going to say familiar faces, but

493
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:22,300
to see those familiar usernames or whatever it might be, um, just being there, right?

494
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:25,220
It feels like we're all in the same room, which is such a nice thing.

495
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:26,220
Yep.

496
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:28,500
Everybody, again, everybody has something to give.

497
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,900
And just being there is giving something.

498
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:31,900
Yeah.

499
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:36,540
It's giving like a vote of confidence that what's happening here is important, right?

500
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:37,540
Yep.

501
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:44,440
I wanted to ask you a little bit more about, um, you were, you were explaining how maybe

502
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:49,020
it'd be kind of fun to have me on Linux spotlight as well, right?

503
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,020
Yes.

504
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:54,820
You know, I think in the same way as you just described when I asked you about your beginnings

505
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:58,300
with Linux, I'm like fidgeting in my chair because it makes me uncomfortable in a strange

506
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:05,260
kind of way to have that, to have that, well, the spotlight turned, turned the other direction,

507
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:06,260
right?

508
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:12,940
And so it's such an interesting thing to me is that we can be on the microphone regularly

509
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:17,900
and yet all of a sudden when it's turned in a different light, it, it, it changes things.

510
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:22,580
Changes things completely for me because a lot of times I won't even know what to say

511
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:28,020
sometimes, you know, it's like you get asked questions like maybe you forget or, you know,

512
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:29,200
and maybe that's with my age.

513
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,200
I don't know.

514
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,200
But

515
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:35,280
well, I think there's a certain like performance that's happening, right?

516
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,100
And so there's all the regular stuff like performance anxieties.

517
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:44,220
I mean, if anybody's ever stood on a stage and tried to give a talk, it's, it's not dissimilar.

518
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:51,660
Uh, it may happen through the internet most of the time, but there's, there's all this

519
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:56,060
emotional stuff that comes with it, which you can't ignore and your body reacts in ways,

520
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:57,060
right?

521
00:35:57,060 --> 00:36:00,060
It reacts in ways you don't want it to, yes.

522
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:05,180
That you sometimes can't predict.

523
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:10,100
Tell me about like some of the favorite questions that you get to ask people that, that you're

524
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:11,460
getting to know.

525
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:17,740
Well, like I said before, I really enjoy hearing about the history, but there's one particular

526
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:24,820
question that I, I get to ask and it's one of those questions where you think, ah, here

527
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:25,820
we go.

528
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:32,140
But it's so interesting to see the different answers and how people think about it differently.

529
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:39,300
So one of the questions that I get to ask is, um, what do you think of when I ask you

530
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:42,500
about the year of the Linux desktop?

531
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:47,180
And that brings on so many different opinions about what it is.

532
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:54,060
Some people think it's like a serious question of how we get to a point where Linux is king

533
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,660
on the desktop.

534
00:36:55,660 --> 00:37:01,900
Some people approach it like, uh, the year of the Linux desktop, my favorite answer was

535
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:09,540
from cubicle Nate and he said, the year of the Linux desktop is the year that you found

536
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:10,540
Linux.

537
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:13,260
Oh, that is lovely.

538
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:15,580
It was absolutely awesome.

539
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:19,020
And I loved it because, you know, like I said, there are people who will, and there's nothing

540
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:25,020
wrong with approaching it from a normal standpoint of a thought, but it, he was thinking so out

541
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:29,780
of the box and I, and that is exactly my answer.

542
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:33,460
The year of the Linux desktop is the year that you found Linux and you were introduced

543
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:41,020
to it and you had that feeling in you that you were so excited to try this distribution

544
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:45,640
out or try this operating system out that you were just like dancing.

545
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,240
I remember doing that.

546
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:50,700
And it seems like everybody else has that same experience.

547
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:54,340
At one point in time, they were super excited to try it out.

548
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:56,660
Yeah, that was the best answer ever.

549
00:37:56,660 --> 00:38:01,820
I love the insight into that because, um, it's so true.

550
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:06,620
That's the thing that connects all of us is when it came into our lives and it grabbed

551
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:08,500
us and never let go.

552
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:12,180
And for you, that took a few goes at it.

553
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:14,020
And that story is not dissimilar to mine.

554
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:17,580
It's like investigating it and it's, oh, it's not quite the right time.

555
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:22,140
And then checking it out a few years later and, and, and diving in maybe a little deeper,

556
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:23,140
right?

557
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:26,580
But then eventually it just grabs hold and it doesn't let go.

558
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:31,380
When I was messing around with KDE in the very beginning, that is exactly the feeling

559
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:32,440
I had.

560
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:38,600
You had this sense of freedom that you never had with windows and you could just change

561
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,600
anything.

562
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,600
Wow.

563
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:46,220
And there were programs on windows that you could buy to change things like window blinds

564
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:50,180
was a program years ago that you could buy to change windows around.

565
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:56,600
I never bought it, um, but, but when you're trying Linux and you're in, in this setting

566
00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:02,500
land of settings of KDE and you have, and you can just change everything, it is such

567
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:05,980
an amazing feeling to be alive.

568
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:06,980
That's all I can say.

569
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:07,980
Yeah.

570
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:13,720
You mentioned the word freedom and you know, that has of course a bunch of connotations,

571
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:19,180
but to have that feeling of freedom when you're using, you know, what some people could see

572
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:21,820
as just a tool to get work done.

573
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:26,700
But there's this amazing thing that happens when you start admiring the tool and what

574
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,740
it gives you in return, right?

575
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:32,540
It's kind of like this symbiotic relationship that happens.

576
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:39,100
You know, I imagine everyone listening has had that experience of being so jazzed about

577
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:44,620
the tool that's in your hands, uh, that you just kind of get giddy.

578
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:45,620
Yep.

579
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:54,100
Well, I just recently tried, uh, Kubuntu for the Distro challenge and I boot into this

580
00:39:54,100 --> 00:40:00,800
and it was like all of these memories flash back in your head of trying KDE and I was

581
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,780
honestly like a kid in the candy store, just, oh my gosh, I can do this again.

582
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:06,380
Oh my gosh, I can do this again.

583
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:09,340
I can switch this around certain other operating systems.

584
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:13,740
You can switch or certain other districts, you can switch things around, but you can't

585
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:19,780
as easily or maybe you can't do it to the extent you can do it with KDE.

586
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:26,780
And again, I was just that kid in the candy store checking everything out and you know,

587
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:31,260
I don't know if you have hopped around on distros, but I hopped.

588
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:35,260
Certainly have done some hopping.

589
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:42,660
I have hopped for, well, since I started Linux and recently I've got to the point where I

590
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:47,580
own a main stable machine in which I run Pop OS and that's my main stable machine and that

591
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:50,300
hasn't changed and probably won't change.

592
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:55,180
But in trying these distros, you get that, I don't know, that feeling inside of trying

593
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:58,300
that excitement of trying a new distro out.

594
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:01,300
It's almost like Christmas every time you decide to do that, right?

595
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:02,300
Yeah.

596
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:10,520
It's an amazing thing that we get to do that on the backs of everybody in the development

597
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:14,420
community that has put their hard work and effort in it.

598
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:21,980
They don't get near enough credit for all of the time and you know, time is like the

599
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:30,140
most valuable thing we have and they give it freely to everybody to try.

600
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:36,620
And that's why I tell people when we try distribution, I want you to be honest with your take on

601
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:37,620
the distribution.

602
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:38,900
If it's not for you, you say it's not for you.

603
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:43,620
If these things went wrong, you say they went, I want it to be honest, but I also don't want

604
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:50,260
to go in and trash a distro because you didn't like this particular aspect of it.

605
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:55,100
It has to be constructive criticism because there is so much effort put into this, so

606
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:59,980
much work behind the scenes that people, they realize it, but they don't realize it.

607
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:04,380
They would only realize it if they had, if they were to put that amount of time and effort

608
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:11,440
into it and I am just grateful to all of the developers that give us this opportunity to

609
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:17,020
just to do it and I get that excitement out of it and it's awesome.

610
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:19,860
Yeah, it's such a huge gift to all of us, right?

611
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:26,300
And I feel like you even saying those words of like, thank you is even just a small way

612
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:32,500
of giving back in a way it's like, yes, we so appreciate the work that you're doing.

613
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:37,300
Please continue to do it and we'll support you in any way we can.

614
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:44,380
That's super huge and I have felt one thing I've kind of come to learn is that distributions

615
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:52,400
and software and all of that is, you can almost see it as they have personalities and a piece

616
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:57,620
of software or a distribution or something like that may not fit for you.

617
00:42:57,620 --> 00:43:02,940
That doesn't necessarily mean that it's not really valuable because it may really fit

618
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:05,220
for someone else, right?

619
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:10,780
And bringing that perspective to the conversation feels like a really inclusive way to do it

620
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:12,980
and less sort of black and white.

621
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:15,260
This one's good, this one isn't, right?

622
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:19,060
That's what we need to continue doing is like, oh, these features in this distribution over

623
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:24,680
here, like you were mentioning, KDE is really customizable and that's for me and maybe this

624
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:29,180
other one over here is a little bit more simplistic, but that's gonna be for somebody else, right?

625
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:35,180
I have seen so many, and not just me, I'm sure you have too, but over the years, so

626
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:42,580
many people behind the scenes, developers and whatnot have walked away from being burnout,

627
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:47,740
from taking heat from the community, for not doing it the way they wanted it done.

628
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:54,260
And I think it's just a total shame that it has to be that way, that we need to be behind

629
00:43:54,260 --> 00:44:00,860
the developers that are here, because again, their time is valuable, it's just as valuable

630
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:04,220
as your time, and it's just as valuable as my time.

631
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:06,500
Arguably perhaps more valuable.

632
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:07,500
Arguably more valuable, right.

633
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:09,940
Because of the number of users who benefit, you know?

634
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:15,580
I would like to say, and I don't know how to say that, but I would like to say thank

635
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:18,100
you to each and every developer out there.

636
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:23,080
Yeah, you know, I guess in some ways you are, because you're also giving to the community

637
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:28,660
in some way, and so you're not maybe giving directly to them, but if we can all give a

638
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:35,580
little piece of us to make this entire environment a little bit better, then maybe we all win.

639
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:37,340
Everybody has something to give.

640
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:38,340
Everybody.

641
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:39,340
Yeah.

642
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:42,780
You've said that repeatedly in this conversation, and I think it's worth repeating, right?

643
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:46,460
It's like, every single person has something, so if you're someone who doesn't believe

644
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:51,220
that you do, come chat with us, we'll find a way.

645
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:53,740
Yep.

646
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:58,020
Is there like maybe an ask of the community that you would like to put out there?

647
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:01,720
And I feel like maybe there's been nuggets of that in our discussion, but something you'd

648
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:07,940
like them to try or go check out or do or participate in, something like that?

649
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:17,540
I would like everybody who's listening to somehow in some way thank a developer for

650
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:19,620
what they do.

651
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:22,500
It doesn't matter if it's a simple thank you.

652
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:27,580
It doesn't matter if it's an email to somebody.

653
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:33,100
Any way that you can donate, and I don't mean monetarily, that's fine, but any way

654
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:39,880
you can donate to the community is going to benefit every single one of us.

655
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:45,520
It takes each and every one of us to make this community, and you may be that person

656
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:54,300
that is in conversation and upfront with everything, like say on Biddle, again, we have many people.

657
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:57,620
Some people talk a lot, some people talk a little, and some people don't talk much

658
00:45:57,620 --> 00:45:58,800
at all.

659
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:03,200
Each and every one of you can give back to the community in your own way.

660
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:08,260
You don't have to have a specific talent in something, you don't have to have a lot

661
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:09,260
of money.

662
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:16,020
You can just find a way to give back, and that can be as simple as a thank you.

663
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:22,100
It's amazing what a simple thank you can do for someone's energy.

664
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:27,700
I would say Twitter is a fabulous way to connect with people really quickly to say, yeah, I

665
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:29,740
value what you're doing.

666
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:36,860
It's akin to receiving a postcard or something from someone.

667
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:41,820
It's very simple, and yet it carries this weight that is amazing.

668
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:48,620
Well, you get to a point where you get, say you're a developer and you're doing all

669
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:55,380
of this for the community, and you hear all of this feedback.

670
00:46:55,380 --> 00:47:01,500
At some point, it has to be frustrating when you put your heart and soul into everything

671
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:07,740
that you do, and yet sometimes it seems like it's not good enough.

672
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:08,740
Let's just take a distro.

673
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:14,500
There are so many people that try out a distro, and most of the time, the ones you hear are

674
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:15,980
the negative ones.

675
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:21,880
The ones that like it and the ones that it just works for, they don't really say anything.

676
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:24,180
You may not even hear from them at all.

677
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:29,420
And that's what I'm asking people to do is, if you like something, say it.

678
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:32,620
Say that you like it to whoever it needs to go to.

679
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:35,220
Yeah, that feels super powerful.

680
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:40,340
It almost feels like we should do that every single time something like a distribution

681
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:46,220
comes out with a new version, because as you know, the amount of people's creativity that

682
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:51,860
goes into a single release of anything is almost unfathomable.

683
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:56,460
Unless you're behind the scenes and see how much work that goes into it, you really don't

684
00:47:56,460 --> 00:48:04,020
realize how much work and testing and time and retesting and time goes into every single

685
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:05,540
release that comes out.

686
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:11,940
And that's whether it's a distro or a program, or it may be down to a simple script.

687
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:17,640
There's a lot of time involved in this stuff, and we benefit from it, so we should be able

688
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:18,640
to say thank you.

689
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:23,020
Well, Rocco, I'm going to say thank you to you for all of the efforts you're putting

690
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:25,220
into everything that you do.

691
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:31,220
I feel like the community really values it, and I hope that energy stays high for you.

692
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:32,220
Appreciate that, man.

693
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:33,220
We're right there behind you, right?

694
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:34,220
Keep it going.

695
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:35,900
Yeah, and you're doing the same thing.

696
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:36,900
So there you go.

697
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:37,900
Well, thank you.

698
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:42,100
And I think that's the beauty of it is that it's reciprocal, and everybody wins, right?

699
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:45,300
If you boost someone up, you're not taking the energy away from someone else.

700
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:49,860
You're just raising them, and they might raise you in turn, and everybody gets raised up.

701
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:52,480
So I think we can keep doing that.

702
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:55,540
We can be a better community when we continually do that.

703
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:58,100
Well, Rocco, thank you so much for chatting with me.

704
00:48:58,100 --> 00:48:59,460
It's been a pleasure.

705
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:00,460
Thanks for having me, Brent.

706
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:01,460
Of course.

707
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:22,980
Thank you so much for having me.
