1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,240
Four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,740
We have ignition and we have liftoff.

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:16,120
We have liftoff of the Titan Centaur carrying the first of two Voyager spacecraft to extend

4
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:20,520
man's senses farther into the solar system than ever before.

5
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:25,160
Reports coming back indicate those twin large solid motors are functioning perfectly, producing

6
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,440
1.2 million pounds of thrust each.

7
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:36,400
Twenty-five seconds into the launch, all continuing to go well.

8
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:44,800
1997, one of humanity's high notes, one of our biggest dreams where we dared really,

9
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,880
really big.

10
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:50,120
And it's still in operation today, Voyager 1 and 2, still in operation today.

11
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:55,940
They're amazing machines and we wanted to take a special moment to reflect on the resilience

12
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:58,880
of the Voyagers and Wes is here with me.

13
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,880
Hello, Wes.

14
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,880
Hello.

15
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,080
And to help make it extra special, for those of you who remember one of my favorite shows

16
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,640
of all time, SciByte, Heather, aka Mars Base, is joining us.

17
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,640
Hello, Heather.

18
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,600
Hello, happy science.

19
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,840
Happy science.

20
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,760
This is something that I immediately thought we got to bring Heather in because this is

21
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,340
something you and I love to talk about in SciByte.

22
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:23,960
And Wes, you noted that there was a bit of news recently that kind of put this on our

23
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,500
radar and we thought, let's start there.

24
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,600
Why we're talking about this now and let's get into the Voyagers.

25
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:36,400
Yeah, if 1977 was quite a year, 2020 hasn't started out so well for the world or for Voyager

26
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,400
2.

27
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,640
You see, back in January, a problem occurred when Voyager 2 missed a spin maneuver it was

28
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,520
using to calibrate its magnetic field instrument.

29
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,600
And that glitch left two power hungry systems on simultaneously.

30
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,180
And as far out as Voyager 2 is, there's not a lot of power to go around.

31
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,720
So luckily, the software recognized the problem.

32
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,900
But that meant it went to a pre-programmed fault mode.

33
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:01,760
And it took a long time to get back online.

34
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,440
Don't worry, Voyager 2 is fine.

35
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,440
It's still out there doing great science.

36
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:13,000
But it really made me think these machines have been alone in space for 42 years.

37
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,600
That takes incredible engineering and we should probably explore that more.

38
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,700
Yeah, that's a great point.

39
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:23,760
So systems that were designed before 1977, because they were launched in 1977, have enough

40
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,920
smarts to have a fail mode, from what you just said, and then report back home.

41
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:34,080
That's the kind of engineering that I think NASA is really, really kind of maybe held

42
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,640
to a certain like high standard for it.

43
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:41,020
Like that's NASA design engineering and Heather, there's been remarkable science that these

44
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,160
machines have produced.

45
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,160
Oh, yeah.

46
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,960
I mean, you get all sorts of data.

47
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:50,000
I mean, as the years go on, we're edging towards the end of their power supply.

48
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,600
We're getting information on the edge of the solar system, interstellar space now.

49
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,680
They are the only instruments we have out there.

50
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:03,480
So the instruments built long before some of your listeners were even born are giving

51
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,960
us scientific data that we have no other source of.

52
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,960
Right.

53
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,520
And they're chugging along now.

54
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,540
But it is getting towards the end of their life.

55
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,120
So it's kind of nice to reflect on them while they're still working, because I'm sure there

56
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,840
will be lots of eulogies written when we declare them as like dead and we've lost contact.

57
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,840
I'm sure there'll be all kinds of stuff, but it's kind of nice to talk about them now.

58
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:29,600
And SciByte, if you want to go back in the archives, episode 22, 32, 51, 102, and of

59
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,260
course 136, talked about the Voyager probes.

60
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,260
We loved them.

61
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,260
Oh, yeah.

62
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:38,520
I mean, every once in a while they come up with, you know, hey, are they edging towards

63
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,520
this?

64
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,520
Oh, my gosh.

65
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:44,280
We just picked up a coronal mass ejection from the sun once it got way out there and

66
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,680
that gives us data and sort of just chug along.

67
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,760
Every once in a while, some giant piece of scientific information comes from them.

68
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,840
Will you start us off with some of the interesting bits about sort of the special moment that

69
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,160
the solar system was in back when these launched?

70
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,160
Sure.

71
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:06,200
I mean, when we were when it first started, they had the idea of just doing just a Jupiter

72
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,760
Saturn flyby.

73
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,640
And up until like six months before they launched, they weren't even called the Voyagers because

74
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,880
that's all they were going to do is Jupiter Saturn.

75
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,880
Wow.

76
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:23,720
But every like 176 years, there is a planetary alignment such that all of these planets were

77
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,440
in line and they said, you know what?

78
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:31,120
With just a little bit of extra tweaking, we can get Uranus and Neptune too.

79
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,200
With that slingshot acceleration, right?

80
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,440
The Planetary Grand Tour.

81
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,080
It's such an opportunity.

82
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,280
I mean, that alignment happens every 176 years.

83
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,840
I heard a story where the director of NASA at the time went to President Nixon and basically

84
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:50,280
said, look, the last time this happened, Jefferson was in your seat and he totally botched it.

85
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,280
Yeah.

86
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:57,560
I mean, talk about being brought a very limited opportunity to create history and wow, six

87
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:02,260
months before they launched, Heather, that's that seems like that doesn't happen.

88
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:07,000
The overall plans were not necessarily changed at that point, but their name was changed

89
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,020
at that point because then by that point they had said, oh, well, we can get all this extra

90
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,960
data and go by these other planets.

91
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:22,320
And Wes, you mentioned earlier the fault protection that went into effect when they had the problem

92
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,700
earlier this year.

93
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:28,640
The Voyagers were the first spacecraft that had that programming built into them.

94
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:35,200
That's become standard now, where if it completely loses its mind for a minute, it knows to go

95
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:40,800
to a low power mode and then wait to hear back from home, essentially.

96
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,360
The engineering that just had to think about these kinds of situations, so there must be

97
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:48,680
redundancy in systems and some modularity in how systems are used and what gets turned

98
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,680
on and turned off.

99
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,440
And those are bits and pieces that I've heard over the years.

100
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:58,000
Do we know roughly how much life these things have left?

101
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:05,160
Roughly five years or so, as these were, they're not solar powered because way out there, there's

102
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,880
not a lot of solar power.

103
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,300
So they did radioisotopes, so that has a half-life.

104
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:15,400
There is going to be a point where you can't keep it warm enough that the whole thing doesn't

105
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,400
freeze.

106
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,320
So slowly over the years, they said, okay, we don't need the cameras anymore.

107
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,320
We are way too far out.

108
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,320
We can't get cameras.

109
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,320
Shut that down.

110
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,320
We don't need to keep them on.

111
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,600
We don't need to keep that part of the space grow for warm.

112
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:31,280
And just slowly but surely, dialing back which instruments to keep on, which instruments

113
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:37,340
to stay warm, so that they can eek as much out of it as they can.

114
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:41,560
You don't have to have thrusters or anything because in space-

115
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,560
You just keep moving.

116
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,560
Yeah.

117
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,480
Physics says unless something stops it, it's just going to go forever.

118
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,480
Right.

119
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,080
If something stopped it, that in itself would be quite the discovery.

120
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,080
Yes.

121
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,080
Very true.

122
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:59,200
I kind of hope in a way, even once it's powered off and they can no longer keep its components

123
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:03,500
warm because that's really, that's one of the major power uses is the camera only gets

124
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,680
turned on from time to time or these things get turned on and off, but it has to keep

125
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,220
components from completely freezing out there.

126
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,320
And that is a significant constant use of power.

127
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:14,160
So eventually, like Heather says, that will run out.

128
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:19,080
But in a way though, it will continue as a monument of humanity.

129
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,560
Oh yeah, and the data we have isn't going anywhere.

130
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,080
When they saw one of the coronal mass ejections and they said, oh, you know, this is, we can

131
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:31,600
sort of translate this to sound and hey, we see this two big things coming here and they

132
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,600
follow a slope.

133
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,160
Let's keep following the slope back.

134
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:39,360
Oh wait, there was a smaller something that happened along that line four years ago that

135
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,980
we just didn't take note of.

136
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:47,520
So we can continue to pull data out of this for pretty much as long as we come up with

137
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,960
ideas of, is that noise or is that something?

138
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,960
That's great.

139
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,400
So there's discoveries that can happen even years later.

140
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,680
We just keep learning.

141
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:04,760
But there's also the aspect that on this is there's this famous golden record that contains

142
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:08,760
different aspects of our cultures and humanity.

143
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:15,240
And The Verge did a decoding of the record and I have a little sample of what they discovered.

144
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:25,800
Sounds in 55 languages, samples of music from around the world, sounds of earth, such as

145
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:30,680
oceans, birds, thunder, and whales.

146
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:34,280
And on the other side, this.

147
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:38,080
It's that sound that contains all of the image data for the photos and drawings contained

148
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,440
on the golden record.

149
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,320
And using the process described in the last few symbols on the cover, we can render the

150
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,320
images.

151
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,160
It's almost kind of like a modem, like it's, you know, sort of that same kind of idea.

152
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,320
And what's incredible about this golden record and I encourage people to look at pictures

153
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:58,640
online of this is they printed a decoding guide on there and there was there was just

154
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:05,520
incredible thought put into trying to create a language that is based on universal properties

155
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,520
of space.

156
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,520
Well, what a challenge.

157
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:11,320
You don't have much to work with when you might be speaking to a totally unknown alien

158
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,320
civilization.

159
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,320
Right.

160
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:17,480
So I'm going to use a wavelength between two hydrogen atoms or whatever the term would

161
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,480
be.

162
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,480
What would be the term there?

163
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,480
Hydrogen molecules?

164
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,240
Yeah, it's there.

165
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:29,320
That diagram is like, occasionally, those the spin of those molecules flip.

166
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,880
And so they're trying to describe that moment.

167
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:36,740
It's like when it flips, this specific moment is the simplest atom we can think of.

168
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:40,080
There's this distance and this spin and this speed going on.

169
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:46,200
They're like, let's, let's try to talk about this in atoms and molecules so that somebody

170
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,800
that we don't know, that we obviously don't speak their language to, with the best shot

171
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:53,000
of possible of trying to explain to them how to play a record player.

172
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Right.

173
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,760
I mean, you'd think if you managed to get out in space or somehow come in contact with

174
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:01,160
this record, that civilization would probably started investigating the basic physics of,

175
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,160
you know, hydrogen.

176
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,160
Right.

177
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,400
They'd have to, you would think.

178
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,120
So it's a safe assumption to make.

179
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,520
And it's such a brilliant starting space.

180
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,600
So then from there, you get basic measurements.

181
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:15,000
And from there, you can deduce how to decode the imagery that is embedded in those sounds.

182
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Yeah.

183
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
And that's like on the cover.

184
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,520
So it's like the first thing seen is, you know, very basic instructions on how to play

185
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,520
this.

186
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:29,080
One side has all the sounds and the other side has all the image modem sounds.

187
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:33,840
So it's like how to take that from modem sounds to actual images and try to make sense of

188
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,840
that.

189
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:41,080
And then also a diagram of sort of where Earth is and compared to specific type of neutron

190
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:44,200
stars because they have a very specific wavelength that you can identify.

191
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,960
So it's like, here's where this came from.

192
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,800
Here's our return postage information.

193
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,840
And here's how to read our magical disk.

194
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,840
Isn't that incredible?

195
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,560
And here's if you're getting it right, you should see this.

196
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:01,400
And if you see this, keep just using this methodology to decode the rest.

197
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,720
And it's true genius.

198
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,320
And when I think about true genius, I do think about how Carl Sagan was involved with the

199
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,320
project.

200
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,960
Here's a little bit of Carl introducing the golden record.

201
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:16,960
Voyager's passage by Jupiter accelerated it towards a close encounter with the planet

202
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,960
Saturn.

203
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:21,000
Saturn's gravity will propel it on to Uranus.

204
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:27,640
And in this game of cosmic billiards after Uranus, it will plunge on past Neptune, leaving

205
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:34,720
the solar system and becoming an interstellar spacecraft destined to wander forever the

206
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,920
great ocean between the stars.

207
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:44,840
And as Voyager should sometime in its distant future encounter beings from some other civilization

208
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:54,720
in space, it bears a message, a phonograph record, golden, delicate, with instructions

209
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,720
for use.

210
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:01,800
And on this record are a sampling of pictures, sounds, greetings and an hour and a half of

211
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:07,200
exquisite music, the Earth's greatest hits.

212
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,040
You know what's also amazing about that?

213
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,200
The golden record isn't adding anything of scientific value.

214
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,600
It's not helping record measurements.

215
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:19,800
This is in some ways the first of our species really taking seriously the idea there might

216
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:24,440
be someone else out there, at least enough to allocate the weight of the record on the

217
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,440
spacecraft.

218
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,280
In my introduction, it's like, it's really us dreaming as big as it can get.

219
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,280
Yeah.

220
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:35,640
I mean, that idea of that in itself, rode over to some of the instrumentation where

221
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:40,800
NASA sort of told everyone, you know, this will last for four years, design for that.

222
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:46,920
And some groups went, yeah, sure, four years, wink.

223
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:53,400
And just put as much into strengthening this as possible and giving it the best shot it

224
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,800
had at going as long as it might.

225
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,200
Thank goodness they did too.

226
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,200
And what an exercise.

227
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,640
And what if, especially when you're, you know, you're exploring a new territory, how do you

228
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:06,920
plan for that strong magnetic fields and what ever might be outside the solar system?

229
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:11,560
The fact that it had to go through Jupiter and Saturn, there were really strong radio

230
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,780
fields, magnetic fields.

231
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,120
So they had to really strengthen.

232
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:20,240
It was the first time they sort of strengthened all the electronics and the computers enough

233
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,840
to handle that going into space.

234
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:26,520
So that gave it a better shot at surviving long term too.

235
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:29,760
So Heather, from your understanding, what is Carl Sagan's real involvement with the

236
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,760
project?

237
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,800
Because I know he was a consultant since the 1950s.

238
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,800
Was he very involved?

239
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,040
Yeah, some people know him as being involved with the pale blue dot picture.

240
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,960
But he'd been involved with NASA for a really long time.

241
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:45,100
He briefed Apollo astronauts before their flights to the moon.

242
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:53,400
He helped design numerous spacecraft missions to Venus and to Mars and the Voyagers.

243
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:58,480
And when he became a member of the imaging team, I mean, years after it launched, it's

244
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:04,120
been in space for years, that's when he came up with the idea of use the cameras, point

245
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,360
back to Earth, take a picture.

246
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:11,280
They knew it would be an incredibly small pixel out of this giant picture that they

247
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,640
were taking.

248
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:17,740
That was the point of it to say, look back here, all the planets spread out that we can

249
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:22,280
take a picture of and Earth is two thirds of a pixel.

250
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,280
We are tiny.

251
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:26,560
Yeah, that really puts it in perspective.

252
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,400
It's humbling, actually.

253
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:33,320
And I think Carl did a really good job of bringing that point home.

254
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,120
He was such an eloquent speaker.

255
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,880
So he was such a great advocate for this project.

256
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,640
I'll just give you a sample.

257
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,760
I love hearing from Carl.

258
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:47,360
That's here, that's home, that's us.

259
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:54,880
On it, everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being

260
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:59,240
who ever was, lived out their lives.

261
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:06,160
The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic

262
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:13,120
doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer

263
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:21,160
of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father,

264
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:28,720
hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician,

265
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:36,680
every superstar, every supreme leader, every saint and sinner in the history of our species

266
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,100
lived there.

267
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,040
Really puts it in perspective, doesn't it?

268
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,040
Oh yeah.

269
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:46,120
The picture of Earth was the last image taken by Voyager 1.

270
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:49,920
Just a little over half an hour after it took the picture of Earth, power to the cameras

271
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,400
got shut down, never turned on again.

272
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,240
It took them two and a half months to send those pictures back.

273
00:15:55,240 --> 00:16:00,280
I mean, that was the last picture they said, all right, this is the last idea.

274
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,080
We want to try to take a picture of Earth.

275
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,080
We'll see what happens.

276
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:06,360
So they didn't know whether it would actually take.

277
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:11,440
They just aimed, took the picture, hoped they would find something, figured they would be

278
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,400
able to see a little something.

279
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:17,660
And then two and a half months later, they were able to say, now we've got it all together.

280
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,520
Now we have the famous pale blue dot picture.

281
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,720
Could you imagine the anticipation of that?

282
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,720
Oh yeah.

283
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,840
Saying they're waiting for that.

284
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:28,360
I just, I can only imagine because of the transmission rate, there's so much they couldn't

285
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,360
do with this machine.

286
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,880
Well, and the, and the whole, the whole mission was, was like that, you know, because there's

287
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,720
long times in between visiting planets, so you just have weeks of nothing.

288
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,520
And then suddenly you're receiving data 24 seven, I mean, there's stories of people just

289
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,640
sleeping in their cars, not sleeping at all, because you don't want to miss a second of

290
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,640
this.

291
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,640
The job goes from zero to a hundred.

292
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,640
Oh yeah.

293
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:51,320
That's how these, a lot of these space, you know, outer planet spacecraft work.

294
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:54,880
It's 10 years of waiting with the occasional call in.

295
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,880
Still going good.

296
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,880
Okay, good.

297
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,880
Thumbs up.

298
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,880
All right.

299
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,880
Keep on going.

300
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,880
A few months of complete craziness.

301
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,880
I hope you caught up on your sleep because you probably don't want to for about two and

302
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,880
a half months.

303
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,800
So you kind of piqued my interest with the transmission speed.

304
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:11,460
What do we know about the tech in the Voyager probes?

305
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:17,880
They have about just a little under 70 kilobytes of memory total and complete.

306
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,880
Wow.

307
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,880
Ouch.

308
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,880
They work on eight tracks.

309
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,480
I can't believe they've held up this long.

310
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,280
I know my family's didn't.

311
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:32,400
They were designed so that they wouldn't wear out until the tape had moved back and forth

312
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,980
the equivalent of the width of the United States.

313
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:40,440
So that's like a two hour VHS playing once a day for 33 years without failure.

314
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,640
So these are rather expensive eight track tapes, I'm guessing.

315
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,960
Well, now that they've been in space, extra expensive, but.

316
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,160
No kidding.

317
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,400
Could you imagine somebody coming along and just taking those eight tracks?

318
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,400
No.

319
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,240
For the Galactic Museum.

320
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,600
You know, in the future when humanity's reached out into space and it's just a bunch of jerks.

321
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,120
It'd be a nice trophy.

322
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,040
But you mentioned the speed as well.

323
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,840
It's only we're getting the data about 160 bits per second.

324
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:07,840
OK.

325
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,440
Yeah, I can see why that would take a few days to transfer an image.

326
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,440
Yes.

327
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,280
You know, honestly, even that fast seems impressive for how far away it is.

328
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,280
And again, 1977.

329
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:19,960
We didn't even have Internet, so can't make a dial-up joke.

330
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,960
There wasn't dial-up.

331
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,480
That is the first Internet Voyager calling home.

332
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,480
Completely wireless dial-up.

333
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,400
Yeah, there's your wireless Internet for sure.

334
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,400
Wow.

335
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,080
160 bits per second.

336
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:36,080
So they must have to be really, really, really lean with the software.

337
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,040
Are they still sending software code up to this thing?

338
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,040
They did at one point.

339
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:47,000
It was originally in Fortran 5, and then they were able to send an upgrade to get most up

340
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,280
to Fortran 77.

341
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:54,320
Could you imagine the nerves upgrading a spacecraft that is out by Pluto?

342
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,920
They even had to upgrade Voyager 2 right after launch to fix some customization.

343
00:18:58,920 --> 00:18:59,920
Wow.

344
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,920
But it's true.

345
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:06,160
Voyager 2 launched first, and it's on in the rocket.

346
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,720
So as it was launching, it was freaking out.

347
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,280
It's like, wait a minute, why am I shaking?

348
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,840
Why don't I have any control?

349
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,840
What's going on?

350
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,680
And it started freaking out.

351
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:18,760
And it took them a little while before one of the programmers was able to find just the

352
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:22,560
right bit of code to reach out and be like, okay, pause, calm down.

353
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,760
Let us tell you what's happening.

354
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,960
And then they had to upgrade Voyager 1, which launched second.

355
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:31,040
So they upgraded that software really quick so it didn't freak out because it would have

356
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,040
done the same thing.

357
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,040
It would have freaked out.

358
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,040
Sure.

359
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:37,320
I mean, can you imagine these days when you mess up your web app and you just hit deploy

360
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:41,560
on GitHub and a new release rolls out, it's pretty different than patching a spacecraft.

361
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:45,400
Especially at those speeds, that's incredible that they've been able to do that remotely.

362
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:53,280
I mean, I just, again, I'm dumbfounded by the resiliency of these systems, the backups

363
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,520
and also the support team that must have remained on the ground.

364
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:00,640
There must have been people that have to be trained up in this stuff now.

365
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,640
Yes.

366
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:06,120
And actually, Voyager lasted so much longer than originally anticipated.

367
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:10,600
Also changed the way they put together teams for these spacecraft.

368
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:16,960
When the New Horizons spacecraft went to Pluto, they specifically chose a certain percentage

369
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:24,180
of the team to be as young as they could because they realized these things last for a while

370
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:27,960
in one, two, three decades.

371
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,680
You might need to ask somebody on the team what happened.

372
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:35,800
And if all you have is senior engineers that are all going to be retired or not around

373
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:39,560
in three decades, there's nobody to ask questions of.

374
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:43,700
So for these longer missions, they spread out the age range.

375
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:47,720
So as they bring on new people, you still have some of the original team members that

376
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:51,680
knew, oh, yeah, I remember them talking about X, Y, or Z.

377
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:55,960
That's exactly the next level of planning that is just so impressive about this whole

378
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:56,960
program.

379
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,960
Really is.

380
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:01,080
I mean, could you imagine working on a project where that's a consideration?

381
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:06,440
This project must have been really a mind bender for those working on it because they're

382
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:10,440
designing something that's going to go possibly far beyond our solar system.

383
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:17,280
It's taking a message written in a universal language to potentially another society.

384
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,280
And that's just their day to day job.

385
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,940
They're just building this thing and sending it out there and trying to figure out generational

386
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:25,040
project teams and things like that.

387
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,720
It's just an incredible, it's an incredible set of work.

388
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,000
And I'm just so grateful that it happened because now I look at it and I just find it

389
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
inspirational.

390
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,520
You know, I find the whole thing incredibly inspirational.

391
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:38,920
I mean, it's taught us so much about our solar system and our place in the universe.

392
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,520
And what we can accomplish.

393
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,800
And Voyager has a number of firsts under its belt.

394
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:46,520
I mean, I mentioned before they were first to be protected in such the way that it was

395
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:49,760
for electrostatic discharge, for radiation.

396
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:55,080
The first time that we actually had a programmable computer controlled altitude and articulation.

397
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,420
So it could control itself.

398
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:58,800
It wasn't waiting to hear from us.

399
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:04,720
The fault protection, the way we talk to it, the way we bring radio antennas together here

400
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,960
on Earth to be able to listen to it and talk to it.

401
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,960
Oh, wow.

402
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:14,240
And as the timeline went on, then we became, they had became the farthest manmade objects

403
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:18,240
when they hit the edge of the solar system.

404
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:23,160
We knew it was sort of a bubble where the sun is shooting out a whole bunch more than

405
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,300
light.

406
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:27,320
It protects us from the galaxy at large.

407
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:31,520
So we had these ideas of what it was shaped like, what our little bubble going along the

408
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,580
stream of the galaxy is.

409
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:36,200
But as the Voyagers hit, they're going in two different directions.

410
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:40,720
One along the plane of the planets and one going vertical of the plane.

411
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:46,280
And so as they hit those termination bowels and went into interstellar space, we were

412
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:51,240
able to know for sure the possible shape of our bubble.

413
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,860
It's not a circular bubble.

414
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:57,400
It's kind of more teardropped and, you know, what interstellar space is like.

415
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:03,200
It's our first steps into this new world and it's about to be a little more alone.

416
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,920
NASA recently announced that due to some upgrades planned for that giant radio antenna we use

417
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:12,160
to talk to Voyager 2, it's going to be silent for the next 11 months.

418
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:17,480
So we won't know until January 2021 if we can still talk to it.

419
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,480
Wow.

420
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,480
That's a long time.

421
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,760
Just alone in the void.

422
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:24,280
Out there on its own because the groundwork that has to be done, huh?

423
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,800
I guess they must have been putting that off.

424
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,800
Yeah.

425
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:32,020
These antennas are, you know, multiple decades, you know, 30, 40, 50 years old and the actual

426
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:36,480
physical facilities themselves just have to have maintenance.

427
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,760
And in order to do that maintenance, you have to take things down.

428
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,760
Fair enough.

429
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,520
I guess we'll find out in January 2021 how it's doing.

430
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,320
Hopefully it's still out there responding to us.

431
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:49,760
Could you imagine the team that's going to be sitting there waiting to their seats?

432
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,760
Yes.

433
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,760
I'll be waiting too.

434
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,720
Well, Heather, thank you for joining us and going over.

435
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,040
This has been really nice.

436
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,480
Thank you for inviting me.

437
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,480
Now what do you say?

438
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,280
Could we talk you into joining us on a future special extra?

439
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,760
I certainly think that's possible.

440
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,200
A very sciency one.

441
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,200
Yes.

442
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,200
All right.

443
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,200
Thank you too, Wes.

444
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,200
This is a great idea.

445
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,200
I'm glad we did this.

446
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,200
All right, Heather, thank you very much.

447
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,200
Happy science to you.

448
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,200
Happy science.

449
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,200
Happy science.

450
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,200
All right, everyone.

451
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:20,200
Thank you so much for joining us on this special edition of Science Fiction.

452
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:29,200
We'll see you next time.

453
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,200
Bye.

454
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,200
Bye.

455
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:47,200
See you next time.
