00:00.000 --> 00:14.760
Tim, thanks for joining me on season two of Brunch with Brent, really appreciate having

00:14.760 --> 00:15.760
you.

00:15.760 --> 00:16.760
Well, thanks.

00:16.760 --> 00:17.760
It's great to be here.

00:17.760 --> 00:23.560
Tim, for those who don't know, you joined us early last year on Linux Unplugged.

00:23.560 --> 00:28.440
Could you give us a little bit of an introduction of who you are and what you do?

00:28.440 --> 00:35.760
Well, I am a software engineer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California.

00:35.760 --> 00:39.640
And for those who might not know, you have NASA as a whole, but then there are centers

00:39.640 --> 00:43.840
around the country that have various responsibilities.

00:43.840 --> 00:48.840
And the Jet Propulsion Lab, their responsibility has always been robotic spacecraft.

00:48.840 --> 00:51.200
We don't have a pilot, we don't do man launches.

00:51.200 --> 00:56.720
So all these spacecraft you've read about over the years like Voyager and Cassini and

00:56.720 --> 01:03.200
the Mars rovers, those were all built and launched and operated by the Jet Propulsion

01:03.200 --> 01:04.200
Lab.

01:04.200 --> 01:08.880
And so I started there in 1991 coming out of school and I've been there ever since except

01:08.880 --> 01:13.760
for one brief trip out to industry in the mid-90s, but I've been back and doing that

01:13.760 --> 01:15.620
ever since.

01:15.620 --> 01:22.260
And my background is I'm an electrical engineer, but during my studies, I also studied computer

01:22.260 --> 01:25.080
architectures and software.

01:25.080 --> 01:33.040
So much of my career spent living and straddling that world between software and hardware.

01:33.040 --> 01:36.360
And so over the years, I've worked on a number of projects at JPL.

01:36.360 --> 01:39.120
When I first came out of school, I worked in their deep space network.

01:39.120 --> 01:45.160
For those who may not be familiar, JPL has three sites around the globe so that as the

01:45.160 --> 01:50.800
globe rotates, all these deep space spacecraft can be in view of the earth.

01:50.800 --> 01:53.880
So there are these gigantic antennas, one of them is 70 meters across.

01:53.880 --> 01:58.940
If you can imagine an antenna that's most of the width of a football field wide.

01:58.940 --> 02:04.880
So early in my career, I worked writing software to operate those systems.

02:04.880 --> 02:08.360
And then as my career went on, I switched to the flight side, worked on Cassini for

02:08.360 --> 02:14.680
a while, worked on the Curiosity rover, the one that's been on the surface for 10 years

02:14.680 --> 02:15.680
now.

02:15.680 --> 02:19.240
Much of that software was brought forward to the Perseverance rover, so I have software

02:19.240 --> 02:21.280
running on that rover as well.

02:21.280 --> 02:26.920
But obviously, in the last five years or so, I've been working on the Mars helicopter,

02:26.920 --> 02:33.920
which is a small, semi-autonomous helicopter that is a companion to the Perseverance rover.

02:33.920 --> 02:38.960
And so we operate the helicopter via the rover, and it does flights around in the vicinity

02:38.960 --> 02:43.900
of the rover doing scouting, taking pictures, getting a lot of great flight data.

02:43.900 --> 02:46.680
And so that project launched with the rover last year.

02:46.680 --> 02:51.080
We landed in February, so we're almost coming up on a year of the rover being on the surface.

02:51.080 --> 02:55.580
And then during April, we did a series of primary flights to prove the concept of flying

02:55.580 --> 02:56.580
on Mars.

02:56.580 --> 03:01.120
And then they went so well, and we got so many awesome pictures that they decided to

03:01.120 --> 03:02.760
extend our mission.

03:02.760 --> 03:07.800
So we've been doing an extended mission of flying around and doing scouting for the rover

03:07.800 --> 03:08.840
ever since.

03:08.840 --> 03:15.000
So as of January 14th, the helicopter is still operational, and we're doing a series of repositioning

03:15.000 --> 03:20.760
flights back to the north to kind of meet the rover as it traverses around some of the

03:20.760 --> 03:22.240
features on the surface of Mars.

03:22.240 --> 03:23.400
So that's my background.

03:23.400 --> 03:28.720
I was asked to be the software lead, so I led a team of four to five developers to write

03:28.720 --> 03:35.320
the software and the operations tools, meaning the software used once the helicopter is on

03:35.320 --> 03:42.720
Mars, it downlinks a bunch of data, and our team wrote tools to digest that data and do

03:42.720 --> 03:45.280
analysis on that data and so on.

03:45.280 --> 03:50.080
And so I transitioned from the flight software lead to the operations lead.

03:50.080 --> 03:54.000
And I still carry on that role to some extent now.

03:54.000 --> 03:58.600
We've gotten in somewhat a routine that I turned over much of the daily operations to

03:58.600 --> 04:02.760
another very enthusiastic young engineer, and I'm actually consulting on some other

04:02.760 --> 04:07.420
projects at JPL now as well that look to taking advantage of what we learned in helicopter

04:07.420 --> 04:09.560
and putting it forward into future projects.

04:09.560 --> 04:11.360
Oh, that sounds fun.

04:11.360 --> 04:17.320
I was going to say, after a year of the successives you've had, I was going to be curious about

04:17.320 --> 04:20.840
what you're doing now, but it sounds like you've handed that day to day torch over to

04:20.840 --> 04:24.360
someone who's equally as excited about it.

04:24.360 --> 04:31.080
And the things you're working on now, I suppose, is kind of keeping you interested and maybe

04:31.080 --> 04:36.740
even bringing some of your expertise and innovating in new areas, which is keeping you probably

04:36.740 --> 04:39.600
pretty excited about what you're working on, I would imagine.

04:39.600 --> 04:46.280
Yes, very much so, because JPL and NASA are in some way starting to reexamine how they

04:46.280 --> 04:49.400
deploy hardware because of projects like helicopter.

04:49.400 --> 04:56.320
We used a lot of commercial hardware where a typical NASA project will use very, very,

04:56.320 --> 05:01.280
very reliable, but very, very old processing hardware to do their software.

05:01.280 --> 05:08.040
For instance, the rover itself has a processor that was essentially designed in the mid-90s.

05:08.040 --> 05:09.040
But stable, right?

05:09.040 --> 05:13.200
So yeah, but it's designed from the ground up to be radiation tolerant and have wide

05:13.200 --> 05:20.000
thermal ranges, but it's also large and heavy and consumes a lot of power and the compute

05:20.000 --> 05:21.640
power compared to the helicopter.

05:21.640 --> 05:26.040
For instance, our helicopter, the main processor that we have in the helicopter is about 120

05:26.040 --> 05:29.960
times more powerful than the processor on the rover.

05:29.960 --> 05:34.460
And it's in a tiny, compact little size, about the size of one of those mini matchboxes,

05:34.460 --> 05:36.680
if you remember those.

05:36.680 --> 05:41.400
It's not very large at all, but it's enormously powerful for its size.

05:41.400 --> 05:46.040
And so because that miniaturization gives you a lot of power, NASA is taking a longer

05:46.040 --> 05:51.260
look at those and saying, well, how can we take this newer technology and wrap it in

05:51.260 --> 05:55.320
kind of proven ways of fabrication that make it more resistant to the kind of hazards you

05:55.320 --> 06:00.340
have in space, like radiation and the thermal variations that I mentioned?

06:00.340 --> 06:04.520
Because just in space, because there's no atmosphere to mitigate the temperatures, just

06:04.520 --> 06:09.800
a rotating spacecraft can swing through 100 degrees in temperature from one side to the

06:09.800 --> 06:10.800
other.

06:10.800 --> 06:15.560
So you get thermal cycling where things expand and contract and you have to design hardware

06:15.560 --> 06:18.780
so it just doesn't fall apart from the expansion and contraction.

06:18.780 --> 06:22.720
So there's a whole field of how you build this hardware to make it more durable for

06:22.720 --> 06:23.720
space.

06:23.720 --> 06:27.200
So what we're looking at is things like, can we combine these two where we have these methods

06:27.200 --> 06:31.680
of building that are very robust, but then also take advantage of these powerful processors

06:31.680 --> 06:33.480
that industry is producing?

06:33.480 --> 06:38.780
Yeah, because it sounds like in many ways, the processor that you've thrown on the helicopter

06:38.780 --> 06:43.640
has kind of outdone itself in some ways, and not only the processor, but the entire system.

06:43.640 --> 06:48.940
So I wonder if that's informing some of the deep battle tested nature of some of the,

06:48.940 --> 06:51.480
you know, bigger, older hardware that you're using.

06:51.480 --> 06:57.440
So simply by being there for such a long time, you know, it's almost been a year now, that

06:57.440 --> 07:01.400
that's probably informing a lot of future decisions, I would imagine.

07:01.400 --> 07:02.400
Yeah, sure.

07:02.400 --> 07:05.640
And it's I think it's making them look at it a lot more closely, because they see the

07:05.640 --> 07:10.520
advantages of the kind of sheer processing power you can get from these offers.

07:10.520 --> 07:15.080
But you know, we also don't want to throw out all of our experience that we've gained

07:15.080 --> 07:19.200
through years and years of hard lessons in building this really robust hardware.

07:19.200 --> 07:22.240
We don't want to just say, oh, we'll just do everything like helicopter, just buy it

07:22.240 --> 07:26.080
off of a catalog and throw it on there, you know.

07:26.080 --> 07:28.400
It's just a cell phone, right?

07:28.400 --> 07:33.160
And so we want to try to walk this middle ground where we say, okay, let's take advantage

07:33.160 --> 07:39.320
of our experience, but also open up possibilities for incorporating this new technology.

07:39.320 --> 07:44.400
You know, it really reminds me of I don't know if you've heard or listened to it, but

07:44.400 --> 07:49.880
I really got into BBC's 13 minutes to the moon podcast where they explore the Apollo

07:49.880 --> 07:52.560
11 and Apollo 13 missions.

07:52.560 --> 07:57.000
And it really, you know, diving into some of the conversations that you shared on Linux

07:57.000 --> 08:02.160
Unplugged, where you kind of do a deep dive on the technology that has enabled all of

08:02.160 --> 08:03.160
this.

08:03.160 --> 08:11.040
It reminded me of how crazy the technology was back then when, you know, the moon landings

08:11.040 --> 08:12.040
happened.

08:12.040 --> 08:16.680
Because one of the episodes they go into detail about the computer that made all of the guidance

08:16.680 --> 08:18.840
possible.

08:18.840 --> 08:23.720
And when you compare what that computer is like compared to today's standards, it seems

08:23.720 --> 08:24.720
absolutely ridiculous.

08:24.720 --> 08:28.680
But at the same time, what they were able to accomplish with those kind of computers

08:28.680 --> 08:33.640
with very, very dedicated instructions to those computers is kind of amazing.

08:33.640 --> 08:38.560
And it sounds like you're kind of carrying that on, but just with completely new technologies.

08:38.560 --> 08:44.920
Yeah, and I think the term disruptor might be overused a bit, but even the notion of

08:44.920 --> 08:51.200
putting a computer on a spacecraft and trusting it to humans back in the Apollo days was considered

08:51.200 --> 08:52.960
like a major paradigm shift.

08:52.960 --> 08:58.360
Because back then, the thing that people trusted was analog circuitry and mechanical systems

08:58.360 --> 09:00.720
because it was much more tangible.

09:00.720 --> 09:05.160
We're going to put this thing called the computer on a spacecraft and let it do the guidance

09:05.160 --> 09:06.160
instead of the pilots.

09:06.160 --> 09:08.600
So you can imagine the people's reaction to that at the time.

09:08.600 --> 09:13.080
So they had to push through those barriers even to put computers on.

09:13.080 --> 09:17.920
And you know, so you see these similar kind of paradigm shifts going on where, you know,

09:17.920 --> 09:22.200
more and more in the modern space field, much more is going into software.

09:22.200 --> 09:26.140
You know, the hardware is becoming more and more of a shell to contain the software because

09:26.140 --> 09:29.680
people are starting to see the advantages of putting more and more intelligence in the

09:29.680 --> 09:35.300
software and the fact that if you get it wrong, you know, assuming it doesn't kill your mission,

09:35.300 --> 09:37.040
there's always a chance of updating it.

09:37.040 --> 09:42.080
Whereas if you have very complicated hardware that you see some problem develop that you

09:42.080 --> 09:44.960
can't fix, you're kind of stuck.

09:44.960 --> 09:48.760
And Mars or another planet is no place to be stuck, is it?

09:48.760 --> 09:53.240
No, especially when you invested the kind of money and time into developing these projects

09:53.240 --> 09:56.160
to say, well, there's a hardware problem we can't fix.

09:56.160 --> 09:57.160
We're done.

09:57.160 --> 09:58.160
Sorry.

09:58.160 --> 10:01.680
You know, that that is just something that people don't want to have to face down.

10:01.680 --> 10:03.320
Not acceptable, is it?

10:03.320 --> 10:04.320
Yes.

10:04.320 --> 10:08.120
And it sounds like you were in part, let's say in part, but you can you can accept the

10:08.120 --> 10:14.580
whole thing if you like, in part responsible for some of the Linux adoption that went into,

10:14.580 --> 10:19.380
you know, I think this was a deep project where you it's kind of experimental.

10:19.380 --> 10:25.400
And you were telling me earlier how Linux was a natural progression from things like

10:25.400 --> 10:27.040
Solaris back in the day.

10:27.040 --> 10:30.960
How was that transition for you from one to the other?

10:30.960 --> 10:34.440
And why was Linux interesting to you back then?

10:34.440 --> 10:37.120
And why is it interesting to you again today?

10:37.120 --> 10:43.480
Well, coming from the Linux angle, about 15 years ago, when we were when JPL was very

10:43.480 --> 10:50.720
much a Solaris house was, I saw kind of the democratization of the platform as a good

10:50.720 --> 10:52.080
thing.

10:52.080 --> 10:56.000
Because with Solaris, you know, it was this big corporate package, and you bought their

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
hardware with it.

10:57.000 --> 11:02.760
And it was very much a silo, bought the hardware with the software with the services all together.

11:02.760 --> 11:06.600
And they were also extremely expensive to rewind like the internal clock.

11:06.600 --> 11:14.420
You know, back in the 2002 2003 era, you know, one of the one of the standard sun workstations

11:14.420 --> 11:19.280
was anywhere between 15 and $20,000 a pop, they're very expensive.

11:19.280 --> 11:23.840
Back then, that was actually even more money than we think about these days, right?

11:23.840 --> 11:24.840
Exactly.

11:24.840 --> 11:29.920
And as I mentioned, and I think it was this podcast, you know, our previous the Linux

11:29.920 --> 11:35.440
unplugged one was I discovered Linux, and I put together a system out of basic parts

11:35.440 --> 11:40.880
you can buy from Fry's electronics, may it rest in peace, you know,

11:40.880 --> 11:44.400
I was thinking you were gonna say Radio Shack.

11:44.400 --> 11:48.580
But I put together a PC for a couple grand at work and ran Linux on it.

11:48.580 --> 11:53.720
And it compiled our code at the time twice as fast as the sun machine did that cost seven

11:53.720 --> 11:55.620
to eight times more.

11:55.620 --> 12:00.400
But I'm surprised that that experiment hadn't been done before, in a sense, like that the

12:00.400 --> 12:05.840
Solaris guys weren't like, Oh, we kind of really keep track of what else is out there.

12:05.840 --> 12:09.560
And and so what was the incentive for you to even give that a try?

12:09.560 --> 12:14.160
Well, I was trying to, you know, I saw some of these tool environments that I kind of

12:14.160 --> 12:18.280
like that were in Linux, you know, build build environments and things like that, and compilers

12:18.280 --> 12:23.980
and and I saw it as a way to take advantage of them.

12:23.980 --> 12:29.880
And also, just trying to be a good, if you will, a good steward of JPLs money, right,

12:29.880 --> 12:33.140
if we could have a project where we could sometimes the developers would have to share

12:33.140 --> 12:36.600
machines because they were just so expensive.

12:36.600 --> 12:41.680
And you know, the idea that you could, you could have more machines that were more powerful

12:41.680 --> 12:48.560
and more people's desks, just kind of was a multiplier of people's efficiency and a

12:48.560 --> 12:50.520
better use of JPLs money.

12:50.520 --> 12:54.360
And so I that's why I started looking into it for my project.

12:54.360 --> 12:57.160
And we essentially turned on a dime at that point.

12:57.160 --> 12:59.560
And we would switch from Solaris to Linux.

12:59.560 --> 13:05.880
And then when I was hired on to do Curiosity, the rover project, they were still using or

13:05.880 --> 13:09.000
were planning and using sun boxes from the previous project.

13:09.000 --> 13:13.560
And I just said, well, let's try this, you know, let's switch and use these Linux machines

13:13.560 --> 13:16.560
instead because they're much more powerful and they're cheaper.

13:16.560 --> 13:19.640
So we can buy more of them and for more developers.

13:19.640 --> 13:24.640
And you know, they were skeptical at first, but once I made, you know, I showed from my

13:24.640 --> 13:29.280
trade study that we did that it worked better, they pretty much switched to and now it's

13:29.280 --> 13:35.100
very pervasive on the flight side of the house of JPL to use Linux for not only development,

13:35.100 --> 13:39.560
but the ground systems themselves, they run on Linux.

13:39.560 --> 13:44.280
And so back 15 years ago, and I don't want to claim sole credit for this because there's

13:44.280 --> 13:48.320
other people that were advocating for it, I was just in a position where I could actually

13:48.320 --> 13:49.560
do it.

13:49.560 --> 13:54.800
But what's happened in the last five or 10 years is that there's been a big switch to

13:54.800 --> 13:58.160
containerization and cloud tools, right?

13:58.160 --> 14:04.080
So I was able to get us to, we're actually using Linux on physical boxes, which was a

14:04.080 --> 14:05.640
big change.

14:05.640 --> 14:12.020
And then in recent years, they've switched to, you know, running a big giant VMware instances.

14:12.020 --> 14:15.440
Now they're starting to transition to doing everything on the cloud.

14:15.440 --> 14:21.380
So there's like this AWS government cloud where the AWS provides services to run containers.

14:21.380 --> 14:27.160
And so JPL is switching a lot of their infrastructure to use them instead of physical machines.

14:27.160 --> 14:30.480
But it's still all living within a Linux world.

14:30.480 --> 14:32.360
And so I'm glad I played a part in that.

14:32.360 --> 14:37.320
I don't want to overstate my role, but I think it was, it happened at the right time to kind

14:37.320 --> 14:38.320
of catch the trend.

14:38.320 --> 14:42.680
Well, in many ways, it sounds like you're really just taking the attitude that, you

14:42.680 --> 14:46.240
know, new technologies need to be looked at and considered and implemented if they really

14:46.240 --> 14:47.240
make sense.

14:47.240 --> 14:53.640
And that I would imagine at a place like JPL is kind of, it should be the way to go.

14:53.640 --> 14:59.040
And okay, we rely on what we know, but we need to still stay very current because some

14:59.040 --> 15:03.600
of the new technologies allow things like, you know, the Mars helicopter to be as small

15:03.600 --> 15:05.740
as it is and to do some of the things it's doing.

15:05.740 --> 15:10.620
So I would say kudos to you for keeping your thumb on new technologies and not being afraid

15:10.620 --> 15:15.540
to continue to dive in even, you know, even even this far into your experience with with

15:15.540 --> 15:19.600
all that stuff to not stagnate is no small thing, I'd say.

15:19.600 --> 15:25.660
And I don't think it's overt, but it's very likely that JPL getting a lot of institutional

15:25.660 --> 15:30.200
experience with Linux to the point where they trusted it for some of their critical tools,

15:30.200 --> 15:34.000
for the ground systems or for development, and even some of the enterprise tools that

15:34.000 --> 15:36.200
they use, you know, that are business related.

15:36.200 --> 15:43.000
When it came time to proffer up the helicopter as a platform running Linux, you know, they

15:43.000 --> 15:47.720
at least had some institutional comfort with Linux as an idea because back when I was first

15:47.720 --> 15:52.460
doing it, it was kind of viewed as this, how do I put it, like the crazy uncle who's got

15:52.460 --> 15:53.800
everything wired up in his basement.

15:53.800 --> 15:57.000
You know, the people that were pushing Linux were kind of fringe, you know, that's how

15:57.000 --> 16:00.920
they were viewed because they didn't have these enterprise solutions like Sun offered

16:00.920 --> 16:01.920
at the time.

16:01.920 --> 16:06.160
And so if we had come completely out of the cold and just said, hey, we're going to fly

16:06.160 --> 16:10.360
Linux on a helicopter, you know, they there could have been a lot more resistance to it

16:10.360 --> 16:15.360
had we already not made the transition.

16:15.360 --> 16:20.400
Take a moment to go to Jupiter.party to support the entire Jupiter Broadcasting Network.

16:20.400 --> 16:25.560
We include ad-free versions of all the shows, plus bonus features such as the Linux-unplugged

16:25.560 --> 16:31.200
entire live stream, the coderly report where Mike and Chris chat about topics of the quarter,

16:31.200 --> 16:33.040
and the self-hosted post show.

16:33.040 --> 16:37.760
And also in the near future, I will be doing a special mail time with Brent where I read

16:37.760 --> 16:39.280
some feedback from you.

16:39.280 --> 16:43.480
Again, help support the entire network of your favorite shows with a membership by visiting

16:43.480 --> 16:48.560
Jupiter.party.

16:48.560 --> 16:52.720
And so back then, you're a little bit, you know, pushing the envelope a little bit to

16:52.720 --> 16:54.160
try new technologies.

16:54.160 --> 16:58.240
Do you still find yourself these days being as adventurous maybe as you were back then

16:58.240 --> 16:59.240
when you were younger?

16:59.240 --> 17:04.600
Yeah, though, you know, it's been tempered somewhat by my background on a big flight

17:04.600 --> 17:08.800
project, you know, Curiosity, I spent the better part of seven years on that project

17:08.800 --> 17:14.760
in the aughts, as they like to say in the 2000s, and it did give me an appreciation

17:14.760 --> 17:19.400
for the kind of rigor that you have to do to design a flight system.

17:19.400 --> 17:25.640
And JPL has a very good history of just designing these really exotic flight systems that just

17:25.640 --> 17:28.760
work and they're challenging and difficult.

17:28.760 --> 17:34.760
And so I was able to follow that arc of a development on the flight side using kind

17:34.760 --> 17:38.520
of the traditional approach, which is how Curiosity was designed.

17:38.520 --> 17:41.760
We didn't fly Linux, you know, we didn't do anything exotic like that.

17:41.760 --> 17:47.160
We flew VxWorks, which is a Wind River real time operating system that JPL has become

17:47.160 --> 17:49.160
comfortable with over the years.

17:49.160 --> 17:53.380
But not just the software side, but how they designed the hardware to be redundant and

17:53.380 --> 17:56.040
safe and reliable.

17:56.040 --> 18:01.560
Being able to go through that arc as an engineer, it gave me an appreciation that's valuable

18:01.560 --> 18:02.560
too.

18:02.560 --> 18:06.640
So maybe as I was a younger engineer, I was like, hey, just burn it all down and start

18:06.640 --> 18:10.000
over because there's cool stuff, right?

18:10.000 --> 18:16.800
And having had that arc of experience kind of lets me hopefully in a rational way blend

18:16.800 --> 18:21.840
the two approaches where, yes, things like Linux are cool, but still have to show the

18:21.840 --> 18:25.360
kind of care in designing the systems that we did before.

18:25.360 --> 18:30.840
And not just have a rose-colored glass when it comes to Linux, because Linux has its own

18:30.840 --> 18:36.720
personality, its own shortfalls and advantages that you have to have your eyes completely

18:36.720 --> 18:40.520
open when you're deciding to use it on a project.

18:40.520 --> 18:47.360
I would imagine having all of that experience allows you to know when it's reasonable to

18:47.360 --> 18:52.240
try something new and know when it's essential to stick with the proven.

18:52.240 --> 18:56.160
And like you said, blending those two is actually the real strong point, right?

18:56.160 --> 18:57.880
Doesn't make sense to run too far in any direction.

18:57.880 --> 19:01.680
Yeah, that's my hope is that I can successfully blend those.

19:01.680 --> 19:07.400
And yes, so you can go to a new project and say, look at the great experience on helicopter,

19:07.400 --> 19:09.520
but we also understand.

19:09.520 --> 19:14.200
And so let's propose this new project with that kind of experience, giving it weight

19:14.200 --> 19:21.020
rather than just kind of being all gung-ho for the latest technology and maybe showing

19:21.020 --> 19:25.460
poor judgment and how far you let it penetrate your design and then cause some kind of big

19:25.460 --> 19:30.920
public visible failure that would, in the long run, maybe even hurt the implementation

19:30.920 --> 19:37.280
or the incorporation of these new things into the whole space technology culture.

19:37.280 --> 19:42.860
And yet I would imagine in your personal life, you get interested in certain technologies

19:42.860 --> 19:47.860
that may or may not apply at work.

19:47.860 --> 19:52.240
Are there things you're working on these days that excite you and that you could see maybe

19:52.240 --> 19:56.920
would find themselves in your work environment?

19:56.920 --> 20:00.920
Or is there some stuff even that excites you that would never do that?

20:00.920 --> 20:05.920
Well, it's going to shock you, but I'm not as much of a tinkerer as home at home with

20:05.920 --> 20:09.240
all that with doing really wild out there technologies.

20:09.240 --> 20:14.920
I would imagine you get your fix from nine to five or yes, it's in some ways when you're

20:14.920 --> 20:19.840
spending time expending so much, so many brain cycles at work to try to solve some of these

20:19.840 --> 20:23.680
things, sometimes it's fun to come home and just do the brainless stuff like work out

20:23.680 --> 20:27.380
in the garage and fix a sprinkler or something like that.

20:27.380 --> 20:33.400
It's kind of a way to drain off some of that buildup of stress.

20:33.400 --> 20:37.360
And what's ironic for me is I learned this pattern for myself over the years and I actually

20:37.360 --> 20:45.020
highly recommend it for young engineers because sometimes young engineers are like, okay,

20:45.020 --> 20:46.760
we got this technical problem.

20:46.760 --> 20:48.120
I'm struggling with it.

20:48.120 --> 20:52.240
I need to pull an all-nighter and just keep hammering at it, hammering at it, hammering

20:52.240 --> 20:53.600
at it.

20:53.600 --> 20:58.580
And I'm like, you know, sometimes if you just go off and do something completely unrelated,

20:58.580 --> 21:02.560
your brain is processing this in the background.

21:02.560 --> 21:09.480
I've had many, many times over my careers where I'm doing something completely unrelated,

21:09.480 --> 21:15.880
like as I said, in the shop fixing something or in the shower or walking my dog in the

21:15.880 --> 21:20.440
neighborhood when all of a sudden like a soap bubble, soap bubble, it'll pop.

21:20.440 --> 21:24.720
And I will hear in my head, I'll say, wait, that's how we could do it.

21:24.720 --> 21:29.600
And there was several thorny problems during helicopter that we were grappling with.

21:29.600 --> 21:34.240
And I just said, I'm just going to go home and just do something else for a while.

21:34.240 --> 21:36.160
And the solution presented itself.

21:36.160 --> 21:41.000
So I think there's a life balance that sometimes it's good to get away from the technology

21:41.000 --> 21:47.040
and do something else and try to divest yourself with technology for a while.

21:47.040 --> 21:50.240
Because believe it or not, the analog world is kind of cool too.

21:50.240 --> 21:53.280
It turns out.

21:53.280 --> 21:57.400
Sometimes if you get really involved in these big movements, you can neglect your family

21:57.400 --> 22:03.140
and do the kind of things, going on hikes, going to their track matches and things like

22:03.140 --> 22:07.360
that, going to their recitals, you need to achieve that life balance.

22:07.360 --> 22:14.440
And so at home, the kind of things I tinker with is, of course, I've got a whole network

22:14.440 --> 22:20.640
set up with an NAS, Synology NAS that I tinker with packages on there.

22:20.640 --> 22:26.060
And I have a Raspberry Pi that I've played with to do like multimedia kinds of things.

22:26.060 --> 22:28.480
And so I like to set up that thing.

22:28.480 --> 22:33.720
My wife despairs if something ever happened to me that she'd have to call in like a team

22:33.720 --> 22:37.480
of network engineers to figure out all the things that I did.

22:37.480 --> 22:42.440
Well, we're here to help if ever you guys need.

22:42.440 --> 22:49.160
So in some ways, I've intentionally tried to declutter my life a little bit technologically

22:49.160 --> 22:52.160
at home so I can get that balance.

22:52.160 --> 22:55.120
But you know, there's always things that I like to read up on.

22:55.120 --> 23:00.200
One of my fascinations is with automobiles, you know, I'm a big car buff.

23:00.200 --> 23:01.920
I like to read the car magazines.

23:01.920 --> 23:07.240
I think if I could have some ideal other career, I could just make it up and do it for six

23:07.240 --> 23:09.560
months and be like an automotive journalist.

23:09.560 --> 23:15.900
These guys that go out and test cars go out in these big, you know, take it to the track

23:15.900 --> 23:19.720
and try it out or take it through these long canyons.

23:19.720 --> 23:23.320
So things like that and the intersection of technology with cars, I'm very fascinated

23:23.320 --> 23:31.080
with how, you know, the in-car entertainment systems and the in-car autonomy and driver's

23:31.080 --> 23:37.440
aids are getting more and more advanced and so much of that is software.

23:37.440 --> 23:41.080
The car industry, people just get in the car and drive, but they don't realize how much

23:41.080 --> 23:48.920
it's changed in the last 20 years from a largely analog system to completely computerized where

23:48.920 --> 23:54.120
some of these modern automobiles will have 16 or 17 different computers doing some aspect

23:54.120 --> 23:55.800
of operating the car.

23:55.800 --> 24:00.280
So I'm always very fascinated with how they do that, how they build cars and how they

24:00.280 --> 24:05.200
interact with the driver, you know, they have these new augmented reality heads-up displays

24:05.200 --> 24:11.480
that'll superimpose an arrow right on the street so you know exactly where to turn and

24:11.480 --> 24:14.240
some very cool stuff happening in the automotive world.

24:14.240 --> 24:19.880
And ironically, the automotive world has a lot of similarities with space because the

24:19.880 --> 24:26.080
automobile is a very hostile environment for electronics to operate and software has to

24:26.080 --> 24:32.360
be very reliable because you have human lives in your software hand, you know, if some autonomous

24:32.360 --> 24:37.640
system or some driver aid, like an automatic braking system, all these modern cars that

24:37.640 --> 24:43.520
will use their cameras to detect that you're approaching an obstacle and you're not realizing

24:43.520 --> 24:45.800
it's there and so the car will brake for you.

24:45.800 --> 24:49.720
Well, what if that does that in the middle of the freeway at 80 miles an hour?

24:49.720 --> 24:50.720
Not what you're looking for, right?

24:50.720 --> 24:51.720
Yeah.

24:51.720 --> 24:53.320
Yeah, that would be very bad.

24:53.320 --> 25:00.520
And so I'm fascinated, so I read up a lot about that and enjoy that kind of thing as

25:00.520 --> 25:03.040
a hobby to read up on those.

25:03.040 --> 25:08.560
You know, now that you describe it in detail with your sort of fascinated voice, which

25:08.560 --> 25:14.440
I appreciate, the links between the two are quite clear.

25:14.440 --> 25:20.800
Like I would imagine a lot of inspiration for one comes from the other and surely there's

25:20.800 --> 25:26.480
some talent that moves from one space to the other as well because like you said, there's

25:26.480 --> 25:33.640
so many different aspects that are quite similar and maybe an extra challenge in vehicles actually

25:33.640 --> 25:39.360
is that there typically is a human driving, where for you guys, you don't have that, right?

25:39.360 --> 25:43.480
And the averages catch up with you in automobiles because you put out a few million automobiles

25:43.480 --> 25:44.480
a year.

25:44.480 --> 25:50.760
Like JPL may fly a few missions a decade with highly complex software and they may get lucky.

25:50.760 --> 25:55.340
There may be a bug lurking in there, but they don't operate the spacecraft in the way that

25:55.340 --> 25:56.340
exposes it.

25:56.340 --> 26:01.980
But the automotive world, when you have people out driving in every kinds of situations,

26:01.980 --> 26:10.520
every kind of weather, every kind of way that people interact with their cars, eventually

26:10.520 --> 26:12.160
it will expose if there's a problem.

26:12.160 --> 26:15.840
That's why they have recalls and software updates for cars now and they're getting to

26:15.840 --> 26:17.960
the part where they're doing over the air updates.

26:17.960 --> 26:23.160
One of the things that Tesla brags about is that, well, we'll just download over the weekend

26:23.160 --> 26:26.080
that the car will automatically download its update for the software.

26:26.080 --> 26:29.840
You don't have to go to the dealership and have them plug in the car anymore.

26:29.840 --> 26:33.840
We'll just download it over the internet directly to your car.

26:33.840 --> 26:39.960
And so the automotive world is a very good space for proving out technology because people

26:39.960 --> 26:47.360
just hammer their vehicles and not intentionally, but just so many people acting as testers

26:47.360 --> 26:52.120
for the automotive companies, that things will come out and they learn lessons.

26:52.120 --> 26:56.480
And one of the things that the space industry is doing is they were kind of insular for

26:56.480 --> 26:57.480
a while.

26:57.480 --> 26:58.620
Like, okay, we're super smart.

26:58.620 --> 27:03.360
We know exactly how to operate spacecraft and we don't really need to talk to anybody

27:03.360 --> 27:05.080
else.

27:05.080 --> 27:10.000
But they've started to turn their eye towards the automotive world and said, they probably

27:10.000 --> 27:14.440
learned some stuff that we could take advantage of in the way that they structure their control

27:14.440 --> 27:20.280
systems and how they design their hardware, that maybe we could leverage a lot of that.

27:20.280 --> 27:23.240
Because the other thing that works for the automotive world is they have volume.

27:23.240 --> 27:27.120
They can design a very reliable system and make millions of copies of it.

27:27.120 --> 27:32.160
So there's a certain economy of scale there too that the space field can take advantage

27:32.160 --> 27:33.380
of and maybe reduce costs.

27:33.380 --> 27:39.800
So there's all these ways that these two industries can actually interact and maybe learn from

27:39.800 --> 27:40.800
each other.

27:40.800 --> 27:41.800
Fascinating.

27:41.800 --> 27:47.080
I know in the industrial world they have the advantage that they can iterate quite quickly.

27:47.080 --> 27:51.760
One year to the next, they're coming out with a new version of the vehicle where for you

27:51.760 --> 27:56.480
it's kind of, well, you put all your eggs in one basket and send it to a different planet,

27:56.480 --> 27:57.480
right?

27:57.480 --> 27:58.480
That's a little bit of a different cadence.

27:58.480 --> 27:59.480
Yes, absolutely.

27:59.480 --> 28:07.000
The design cycles for space hardware are a lot longer and a lot more expensive because

28:07.000 --> 28:10.520
just from the scale of economies, it's a smaller market.

28:10.520 --> 28:15.760
And so a lot of these manufacturers build space hardware for the prestige, not for making

28:15.760 --> 28:18.880
lots of money.

28:18.880 --> 28:23.520
Have you interacted at all with any of the new mining technology?

28:23.520 --> 28:26.200
Because it kind of touches on this realm too.

28:26.200 --> 28:30.440
I'm from Sudbury, Ontario, which is a mining town in Northern Ontario.

28:30.440 --> 28:35.360
And I know there's a lot of innovation these days, similarly to the automotive market,

28:35.360 --> 28:39.780
but in sort of driverless mining vehicles that have to go through some pretty rigorous

28:39.780 --> 28:41.720
terrain as you could imagine underground.

28:41.720 --> 28:46.080
I wonder if you've had any interest in that field or maybe I'm giving you something to

28:46.080 --> 28:47.640
go have a look at.

28:47.640 --> 28:50.720
Well, I've brushed up against it, I'll put it that way.

28:50.720 --> 28:58.280
One of the panels I was on last summer was there's an Australian Space Consortium.

28:58.280 --> 29:04.240
And in Australia, and I didn't know this, I was educated during this conference and

29:04.240 --> 29:08.080
this panel was that Australia has a very advanced mining field.

29:08.080 --> 29:14.160
I mean, the very advanced mining enterprise where they've, because the outback and places

29:14.160 --> 29:18.600
in Australia are very remote and very hard to get to and very hard to set up places for

29:18.600 --> 29:24.640
people to live near the mining sites, they've actually gotten very good at mining automation.

29:24.640 --> 29:30.920
And so there are a number of talks on how different companies have been able to automate

29:30.920 --> 29:36.320
operations to the point where you can have much of the company's personnel in a city

29:36.320 --> 29:43.120
like Adelaide or Perth, and they can be in a data center there and they just do everything

29:43.120 --> 29:44.120
remotely.

29:44.120 --> 29:47.960
They have a mining facility that might have a half a dozen engineers there to fix stuff,

29:47.960 --> 29:54.160
but the equipment is operated remotely, the vehicles are operated remotely.

29:54.160 --> 29:57.080
And so it was very intriguing, I found it very intriguing.

29:57.080 --> 30:05.000
And the point of the conference was there's a young and growing Australian space industry

30:05.000 --> 30:08.800
or space agency, and they're trying to look to the mining industry to figure out, well,

30:08.800 --> 30:13.000
how can we take advantage of what they've learned?

30:13.000 --> 30:18.840
Because one of the Australia's takes on space, because they are such a big mining economy,

30:18.840 --> 30:23.680
is to figure out, well, how can we do space mining?

30:23.680 --> 30:29.080
Because there's been estimates that the asteroid belt and some of these other free-floating

30:29.080 --> 30:34.720
asteroids have vast amounts of ore and other things that are very difficult to get to on

30:34.720 --> 30:35.720
Earth.

30:35.720 --> 30:40.520
But because there's a lot of big pieces floating around in space, there's a lot of potential

30:40.520 --> 30:41.960
for mining.

30:41.960 --> 30:48.360
And if you've watched The Expanse at all, it's one of my new favorite sci-fi shows,

30:48.360 --> 30:56.240
there's the whole culture of the Belters, this whole kind of loose confederacy of groups

30:56.240 --> 31:00.840
that are out mining the asteroid belt.

31:00.840 --> 31:06.160
So that's something that the intersection of mining and space right there is, how do

31:06.160 --> 31:08.640
we get out of the gravity well?

31:08.640 --> 31:14.260
How do we get to the point where we can, in a cost-effective way, mine in space?

31:14.260 --> 31:18.120
And yes, so there is some interesting intersection there.

31:18.120 --> 31:22.880
I'll freely admit I haven't dug into it since then, but it was a very fascinating topic

31:22.880 --> 31:24.520
when I was listening in on it.

31:24.520 --> 31:32.440
So I have a photography background doing professional photography all over the country of Canada,

31:32.440 --> 31:38.200
and so I had a chance to do a bunch of mining stuff with a friend of mine in past years.

31:38.200 --> 31:46.480
And just going down there, the darkness, it's a very dirty place as well, and yet there's

31:46.480 --> 31:50.320
all this really amazing technology down there.

31:50.320 --> 31:56.400
There's something about it that I think for people like you and I, it's just fascinating

31:56.400 --> 32:03.360
how we can get so much done in these really punishing environments, to put it plainly.

32:03.360 --> 32:09.760
And all of that used to be done just through human effort, but these days, the machines

32:09.760 --> 32:15.520
that are enabling us to do some of that cool stuff is super fascinating.

32:15.520 --> 32:21.160
And when you see how that transition is happening in so many different industries with some

32:21.160 --> 32:25.880
of the same technologies, there's Linux in the automotive sector, there's Linux in the

32:25.880 --> 32:30.360
mining sector, there's Linux on the stuff you're working on.

32:30.360 --> 32:35.520
It's sort of really neat to see those technologies and how they can solve problems in so many

32:35.520 --> 32:36.520
different fields.

32:36.520 --> 32:43.640
One of the things that I've enjoyed about Linux over the years is its adaptability.

32:43.640 --> 32:50.160
And you can see it because on one hand, you have it running giant server farms, on the

32:50.160 --> 32:56.040
other hand, you have it running IoT, and on the third hand, you have it actually acting

32:56.040 --> 33:04.400
as a desktop environment for people who are able to deal with some of the learning curve

33:04.400 --> 33:07.680
of deploying Linux for the desktop, they really enjoy it.

33:07.680 --> 33:11.280
So it's become a very adaptable environment.

33:11.280 --> 33:16.000
That's why it finds its way to all these different environments, because you don't really see

33:16.000 --> 33:19.880
Windows running on embedded platforms.

33:19.880 --> 33:25.600
I know they have this Azure IoT product they're trying to push, but Windows is really primarily

33:25.600 --> 33:29.440
a user-focused environment.

33:29.440 --> 33:34.960
And there's just a lot of different places you can go with Linux, and I think part of

33:34.960 --> 33:40.600
what really fueled that was open source, because you can go and get the kernel and you can

33:40.600 --> 33:44.360
adapt it to your purpose, and you don't have to pay somebody royalties to do it.

33:44.360 --> 33:47.120
You can just get the kernel and use it.

33:47.120 --> 33:53.680
And so if you're going to build a thousand door switches for your alarm system, you can

33:53.680 --> 33:57.400
get a tiny little Linux kernel that just does that, and you can program for it quickly and

33:57.400 --> 34:00.120
deploy it, and you don't have to pay a bunch of licensing.

34:00.120 --> 34:06.440
And so I think part of what's driven all this is Linux as a core product is pretty flexible,

34:06.440 --> 34:12.600
but also the whole open source model has allowed it to just propagate everywhere, and even

34:12.600 --> 34:18.600
act as an undergird, if you will, for commercial products like Android, because I don't know

34:18.600 --> 34:23.360
if a lot of people really realize, I'm sure this crowd does because we're much more up

34:23.360 --> 34:28.320
the curb on Linux, but Android has at its core a Linux kernel.

34:28.320 --> 34:31.320
Yeah, I would think most people don't realize that.

34:31.320 --> 34:34.200
Yeah, they think Android is like iOS or something.

34:34.200 --> 34:37.160
It's a custom operating system.

34:37.160 --> 34:43.880
And so in that sense, Linux has a vast penetration just in handsets that people use.

34:43.880 --> 34:47.640
I wonder how open source has been important at JPL as well.

34:47.640 --> 34:52.480
It sounds like you've dove into it and at least understand for yourself personally how

34:52.480 --> 34:53.480
important it is.

34:53.480 --> 35:00.160
But is there an aspect of the open source ethos that really drives innovation at JPL,

35:00.160 --> 35:01.400
for instance?

35:01.400 --> 35:07.920
I would say that it's quite prevalent in the non-flight area of JPL, because JPL has flight

35:07.920 --> 35:13.160
products which are very carefully designed and managed, and if you want to use the term

35:13.160 --> 35:17.340
configuration managed, like certain specific sets of tools.

35:17.340 --> 35:23.440
But on the ground side, when you're designing ground software to ingest the data, analyze

35:23.440 --> 35:28.800
the data, do planning, it's pretty pervasive.

35:28.800 --> 35:35.120
So I've seen lots of lunchtime talks where some group is doing rover planning, and they'll

35:35.120 --> 35:38.880
find some tool that does what they want.

35:38.880 --> 35:43.760
So they incorporate it, and they link it to another tool, and they get this whole constellation

35:43.760 --> 35:44.760
of tools.

35:44.760 --> 35:50.200
I mean, even for the helicopter, we use Python for all of our ground tools.

35:50.200 --> 35:53.240
That's an open source product.

35:53.240 --> 35:58.600
And as our backend for a database to store all the data from the helicopter, we use Elastic

35:58.600 --> 36:03.840
Search, which is also an open source technology, and it's been great.

36:03.840 --> 36:09.880
And we didn't have to pay for a big Oracle license or something for a database.

36:09.880 --> 36:16.400
We just instantiated Elastic Search, and we use tools like all these open source Python

36:16.400 --> 36:17.400
tools.

36:17.400 --> 36:23.640
There's one called matplotlib that's a plotting tool, a plotting module for Python.

36:23.640 --> 36:27.580
And so when we do all of our downlink of the data from the helicopter and we plot all these

36:27.580 --> 36:33.920
different things like temperatures and battery voltages and flight paths and all this sort

36:33.920 --> 36:39.040
of thing, we use matplotlib, and it's basically you have an open source tool inside of an

36:39.040 --> 36:46.800
open source language like Python, and we use GitHub Enterprise to do all of our activities.

36:46.800 --> 36:52.800
We use GitHub issues to record everything we do when we do the downlink and the uplink.

36:52.800 --> 36:57.960
We have all this automation now that will downlink the data, the tools will process

36:57.960 --> 37:02.600
the data, and then basically generate plots and then push them to a GitHub issue.

37:02.600 --> 37:03.600
It's all automated.

37:03.600 --> 37:06.080
It spits out in like five minutes.

37:06.080 --> 37:10.480
When it used to be, when we first started doing it a year and a half ago to practice,

37:10.480 --> 37:11.480
everything was manual.

37:11.480 --> 37:15.080
It would take us like an hour, hour and a half to do it by hand, right?

37:15.080 --> 37:21.120
And so we use it a lot on the ground, and JPL among many projects around the lab uses

37:21.120 --> 37:29.880
open source because it's an adage that I've learned as an engineer is that if I'm thinking

37:29.880 --> 37:33.240
of something like, hey, why don't they do it this way?

37:33.240 --> 37:37.080
Or how do you solve this particular problem?

37:37.080 --> 37:42.000
I know I'm not that smart that I'm coming up with a problem that nobody else has thought

37:42.000 --> 37:47.680
of, and I could probably execute it perfectly if I wanted to implement a solution.

37:47.680 --> 37:54.440
And so I've really learned over the years that if you're thinking of a problem, somebody

37:54.440 --> 37:57.120
has probably addressed it somewhere.

37:57.120 --> 37:59.400
It's a matter of finding it, and that's where open source comes in.

37:59.400 --> 38:04.840
Okay, so how do we take 1,000 images and convert them from one format to another, right?

38:04.840 --> 38:08.720
Well, I could sit there on the command line and I could open up a program, load it up

38:08.720 --> 38:13.400
and save it as a PNG and do that for 1,000 files, right?

38:13.400 --> 38:19.280
Or you find an open source tool that does the same thing, right?

38:19.280 --> 38:20.280
Batch converts.

38:20.280 --> 38:24.160
Because I'm probably not the first person who thought of something like that.

38:24.160 --> 38:29.020
It's actually kind of hilarious when you think much of what you guys are doing are actually

38:29.020 --> 38:33.800
just repeating what a lot of us are doing on the ground, except you're just putting

38:33.800 --> 38:39.200
it together in a way that allows you to accomplish things that humanity hasn't done yet.

38:39.200 --> 38:41.800
And so that's actually kind of fascinating in a way.

38:41.800 --> 38:46.360
I was giggling the whole time you were talking about if I wasn't the first person to think

38:46.360 --> 38:47.360
about this thing.

38:47.360 --> 38:51.360
I've said that to myself so many times, and then you just kind of open up a browser and

38:51.360 --> 38:55.520
start typing away some keywords and try to find someone else who's solving this issue

38:55.520 --> 38:58.520
more intelligently or longer than you have.

38:58.520 --> 39:00.240
And what a great resource, right?

39:00.240 --> 39:06.460
Yeah, and we're trying to pull the perimeter of open source closer and closer to the flight

39:06.460 --> 39:09.760
world in that we want to take advantage of all these things.

39:09.760 --> 39:18.320
Because if you have a helicopter project like we had or a technology demonstrator, you don't

39:18.320 --> 39:21.600
have a whole army of people to go and invent stuff.

39:21.600 --> 39:23.080
You want to take advantage.

39:23.080 --> 39:26.560
You're always looking for some tool you can use, some environment you can use to make

39:26.560 --> 39:28.680
your life easier.

39:28.680 --> 39:33.060
And so it has a big payoff in that you can concentrate on the stuff that are particular

39:33.060 --> 39:39.840
to your task, like flying a helicopter on Mars, not solving problems of database design

39:39.840 --> 39:49.160
and, you know, and data processing, you know, all these different things, writing code to

39:49.160 --> 39:50.200
do plots.

39:50.200 --> 39:56.520
Why would you spend a couple of months doing that when what you really want to do is design

39:56.520 --> 39:59.840
how to fly a helicopter on Mars, right?

39:59.840 --> 40:05.840
Because almost like 80% of it, if you just put the tooling together in a novel way, is

40:05.840 --> 40:07.840
kind of already done for you.

40:07.840 --> 40:11.960
And you guys really want to concentrate on that last 90% of like, okay, how do we use

40:11.960 --> 40:14.440
all of that back end to do something really innovative?

40:14.440 --> 40:15.440
Right.

40:15.440 --> 40:20.960
And even in the flight world, the software that we use for helicopter, it's an open source

40:20.960 --> 40:24.320
framework called f prime.

40:24.320 --> 40:27.260
You can actually go on GitHub and search for it and find it.

40:27.260 --> 40:33.360
It's something we developed back and started in 2013 or 2014 at JPL, it was part of our

40:33.360 --> 40:39.480
group's work and it was something that I architected, which was, well, how can we do the same thing

40:39.480 --> 40:40.480
on the flight side?

40:40.480 --> 40:45.320
Because there's common things that spacecraft do, right?

40:45.320 --> 40:49.780
They process commands, you know, you want a command to do certain things, it gathers

40:49.780 --> 40:53.880
telemetry and it sends it to the ground, it stores files, it transfers files.

40:53.880 --> 41:01.640
There are these common things that every spacecraft needs to do and every spacecraft kind of wants

41:01.640 --> 41:02.640
a ground system.

41:02.640 --> 41:06.760
So an environment you run on the ground to receive the data and decode it and display

41:06.760 --> 41:10.480
it and allow you to send commands to the spacecraft.

41:10.480 --> 41:16.320
And so if you're a project, you don't want to have to reinvent that every time.

41:16.320 --> 41:20.000
And you want to write the software that's particular to your project, like controlling

41:20.000 --> 41:21.980
a helicopter.

41:21.980 --> 41:28.280
And so this framework that we developed in our group serves that role on the flight side

41:28.280 --> 41:33.440
where a project can take the code and use what we've already developed and then add

41:33.440 --> 41:39.640
their own on top and much more quickly get to the point where they're ready to actually

41:39.640 --> 41:41.600
execute a mission.

41:41.600 --> 41:46.360
And so the helicopter gave that particular framework a lot of visibility.

41:46.360 --> 41:51.200
We actually trended on GitHub for almost a week as the highest visited site on GitHub

41:51.200 --> 41:52.200
because-

41:52.200 --> 41:53.200
Is that right?

41:53.200 --> 41:54.200
Yeah, it was very interesting.

41:54.200 --> 41:55.200
That's cool.

41:55.200 --> 41:58.760
Because I had done this article in the IEEE spectrum, which is probably what led to the

41:58.760 --> 42:03.840
Linux unplugged appearance is what I talked about the fact that the helicopter use Linux

42:03.840 --> 42:07.720
and that kind of got its own life.

42:07.720 --> 42:14.380
And because the software framework is on GitHub, the CEO of GitHub noticed and was tweeting

42:14.380 --> 42:17.220
all about f prime and everything.

42:17.220 --> 42:21.560
And there's a number of projects on JPL who are using this now and some universities,

42:21.560 --> 42:26.900
because when you have a student population, building a spacecraft as a project, you want

42:26.900 --> 42:28.860
to get there as quickly as you can.

42:28.860 --> 42:32.960
And so the same concept is playing out on the software side.

42:32.960 --> 42:36.560
And it's been beneficial because I don't think we could have done it on helicopter if we'd

42:36.560 --> 42:38.880
had to do it completely from scratch.

42:38.880 --> 42:45.840
We were able to take advantage of this framework and get a big boot up on what we had to do.

42:45.840 --> 42:46.840
That sounds amazing.

42:46.840 --> 42:55.160
Does it feel to you in a way, feel nice that you're giving back in a sense like I wondered

42:55.160 --> 43:00.520
if having your open source software be used by others is kind of a nice way to to share

43:00.520 --> 43:02.520
some mentorship in a way?

43:02.520 --> 43:08.160
Yeah, it's, it's been exciting for me personally, because it was my own kind of idea in the

43:08.160 --> 43:09.160
beginning.

43:09.160 --> 43:13.920
And it's taken, it's taken a hold and gathered a lot of momentum.

43:13.920 --> 43:18.240
And you're right about the mentorship, because one of the things that JPL as an institution

43:18.240 --> 43:24.480
likes to do is it likes to recruit from schools where they know that students have had some

43:24.480 --> 43:29.820
kind of a background in doing embedded programming or even better designing a spacecraft.

43:29.820 --> 43:34.620
That's why we love to go to universities that have a CubeSat program, where you've seen

43:34.620 --> 43:41.220
students getting a technical problem, doing trade-offs, finding solutions, working around

43:41.220 --> 43:46.360
problems they encounter, writing code that actually runs in that kind of environment.

43:46.360 --> 43:52.060
JPL likes to see that when they go to recruit graduates.

43:52.060 --> 43:56.800
And so the extra dimension to this is what we've been doing as a group.

43:56.800 --> 44:03.280
Our group at JPL is we will basically form a partnership with the university and then

44:03.280 --> 44:06.760
introduce them to this software framework.

44:06.760 --> 44:09.120
And then we actually have a class that we teach.

44:09.120 --> 44:13.520
It's been a little constrained because of COVID, but before COVID we were making a couple

44:13.520 --> 44:19.120
trips a year to universities and giving classes on how you design flight software, the kind

44:19.120 --> 44:22.280
of principles you have to keep in mind when you're designing flight software that's different

44:22.280 --> 44:26.360
than say a web backend or Microsoft Word or something like that.

44:26.360 --> 44:30.200
There's different priorities and different techniques.

44:30.200 --> 44:35.840
And so it's been an outreach tool as well for us to prepare students so that when they

44:35.840 --> 44:41.200
come out of university, they are ready to go when it comes to working at JPL.

44:41.200 --> 44:48.560
I mean, we have one engineer now on the helicopter team who went to San Luis Obispo, Cal Poly,

44:48.560 --> 44:52.840
and became familiar with F Prime and he popped out literally as a graduate, went right to

44:52.840 --> 44:57.400
work on the helicopter and is doing really well because he had that background already

44:57.400 --> 45:02.280
when he was coming out of school and it was less of a curve for him to come up to understand

45:02.280 --> 45:06.960
the JPL culture and the way you design spacecraft.

45:06.960 --> 45:13.400
So that part is very personally gratifying, but it also helps JPL as an organization recruit

45:13.400 --> 45:17.960
new students because we can do this kind of outreach and kind of pre-train them before

45:17.960 --> 45:18.960
they graduate.

45:18.960 --> 45:21.240
Yeah, it sounds like everyone's winning.

45:21.240 --> 45:27.980
How fun as a student to be using the framework that's actually identical to what's going

45:27.980 --> 45:30.480
on up in space.

45:30.480 --> 45:32.880
I would assume that's pretty fascinating.

45:32.880 --> 45:36.960
One of the things I commonly say to students when I introduce myself and talk to them,

45:36.960 --> 45:43.680
I said, you know, I got to admit I'm very jealous of you because when I came out of

45:43.680 --> 45:47.400
school in 1991, there was nothing like this.

45:47.400 --> 45:52.160
Yeah, and yet you have a similar trajectory to that engineer you were just mentioning

45:52.160 --> 45:58.080
in that out of school, you went almost immediately to JPL in a sense, right?

45:58.080 --> 46:03.200
And it would have benefited me to have had some of that pre-training because the kind

46:03.200 --> 46:09.200
of labs I did in college were not particularly geared towards the space industry, everything.

46:09.200 --> 46:14.360
So I had to learn, you know, I had to learn a lot more than some of the students today

46:14.360 --> 46:18.680
when they're coming out, when they've already been involved in like a project where they

46:18.680 --> 46:23.640
build a CubeSat, they go through a lot of good in the trenches training and school of

46:23.640 --> 46:28.120
hard knocks kind of learning that I wish that I had had because I had to do that kind of

46:28.120 --> 46:29.120
on the job.

46:29.120 --> 46:33.160
Unfortunately, I've come out of the other end with some good experience, but I would

46:33.160 --> 46:34.760
have loved to have had that background too.

46:34.760 --> 46:38.400
So that's why I tell them, I said, I'll say to them, you know, I'm really jealous because

46:38.400 --> 46:41.520
I would have loved to have been in this kind of class as an undergraduate and doing the

46:41.520 --> 46:44.280
kind of projects that you're doing.

46:44.280 --> 46:48.840
And just because number one, it helps prepare me, but number two, they're just cool, just

46:48.840 --> 46:49.840
fun projects.

46:49.840 --> 46:55.360
You can imagine as a sophomore, you know, 19 or 20 year old, you built this little loaf

46:55.360 --> 47:00.240
of bread sized spacecraft that, you know, a year later is in orbit doing measurements

47:00.240 --> 47:02.520
and you know, you put it together.

47:02.520 --> 47:04.520
That's just really cool.

47:04.520 --> 47:10.280
In many ways, we live in kind of a golden age for that kind of accessible innovation.

47:10.280 --> 47:11.920
And I think we need to keep that going.

47:11.920 --> 47:13.320
I totally agree.

47:13.320 --> 47:21.240
And the fact that you can get a little IOT processor with Linux on it that has sensors

47:21.240 --> 47:26.920
and the ability to control devices and you can buy it for about a hundred bucks and have

47:26.920 --> 47:30.920
your own little development environment set up.

47:30.920 --> 47:31.920
That's amazing.

47:31.920 --> 47:35.240
It's just, you couldn't do that 10 and 20 years ago, but now it's so pervasive that

47:35.240 --> 47:39.920
it's very easy for somebody to jump right in and learn that environment without a big

47:39.920 --> 47:46.840
investment in personal expenses or time because you get all these kits, you bring them together

47:46.840 --> 47:51.520
and all of a sudden you have a little robot driving around your living room avoiding chairs

47:51.520 --> 47:54.720
and you know, you're having a great old time.

47:54.720 --> 47:55.720
Yeah.

47:55.720 --> 48:00.440
It feels like something like the Raspberry Pi has also enabled this kind of tinkering

48:00.440 --> 48:05.680
and I think even the F Prime framework can run on it.

48:05.680 --> 48:06.680
Is that right?

48:06.680 --> 48:11.640
Yes, as a matter of fact, if you download from GitHub, there are directions on how to

48:11.640 --> 48:15.480
build for Raspberry Pi and running on Raspberry Pi.

48:15.480 --> 48:20.880
And we actually have our continuous integration server that we run to check the code out every

48:20.880 --> 48:21.880
night and build it.

48:21.880 --> 48:26.700
It actually checks it out, builds it for the Raspberry Pi, copies it over to the Raspberry

48:26.700 --> 48:29.640
Pi and runs a little set of tests on it.

48:29.640 --> 48:30.640
That's very fun.

48:30.640 --> 48:33.980
So yeah, you can take a Raspberry Pi and you can download the code and you'll have a much

48:33.980 --> 48:37.600
of the same code that's on the helicopter.

48:37.600 --> 48:42.080
And then you can take that and you can basically, because it's a framework with a couple of

48:42.080 --> 48:47.220
demonstration pieces of software, you can basically delete that demonstration part and

48:47.220 --> 48:51.320
write your own custom software to do whatever you want on the Raspberry Pi.

48:51.320 --> 48:52.320
So yeah, it is very accessible.

48:52.320 --> 48:58.480
That was one of the points that we wanted to achieve when we deployed F Prime was that

48:58.480 --> 49:03.520
it should be really easy for somebody to download it and just run a quick demo.

49:03.520 --> 49:07.760
And what's happening in the open source aspect of that is there's people outside who are

49:07.760 --> 49:15.760
contributing back configuration files for other build environments, like Arduino and

49:15.760 --> 49:23.280
other embedded Linux boards, other operating systems, because there's a number of different

49:23.280 --> 49:28.880
embedded operating systems out in the industry, so people are writing ports to that.

49:28.880 --> 49:34.380
And so there's a certain amount of momentum growing in people outside of JPL contributing

49:34.380 --> 49:40.240
back to the repository, their own development, which is really cool.

49:40.240 --> 49:43.400
That's kind of what we wanted to see happen.

49:43.400 --> 49:48.720
When you were first designing F Prime, did you think it would be doing this?

49:48.720 --> 49:53.160
I frankly did not know it would grow to the extent it did.

49:53.160 --> 49:56.280
It's very cool, isn't it?

49:56.280 --> 49:58.900
We were kind of a guerrilla team in some ways.

49:58.900 --> 50:05.480
That's G-U-E-R, not G-O-R, although I've been accused of being a guerrilla before, that's

50:05.480 --> 50:06.480
not the spelling.

50:06.480 --> 50:07.480
Fair enough.

50:07.480 --> 50:14.480
Is there a mentor that you got kind of connected to when you were younger that really made

50:14.480 --> 50:15.480
a difference for you?

50:15.480 --> 50:16.480
Oh, absolutely.

50:16.480 --> 50:23.840
I think that's a really important aspect of engineering is finding people who are wise.

50:23.840 --> 50:26.460
Would you consider yourself that now?

50:26.460 --> 50:28.200
Have you heard of the imposter syndrome?

50:28.200 --> 50:29.200
Yes, absolutely.

50:29.200 --> 50:34.160
That's what I frequently feel when people look at me like I'm some sort of a guru or

50:34.160 --> 50:35.160
a mentor.

50:35.160 --> 50:38.680
But that in itself is a lesson, isn't it?

50:38.680 --> 50:42.080
I think there's a lesson to be learned that you should always approach these things with

50:42.080 --> 50:45.060
a high level of humility, right?

50:45.060 --> 50:52.440
And also to take the approach that you're never too experienced to keep learning or

50:52.440 --> 50:58.880
being approachable by somebody who finds a flaw in your approach or your reasoning.

50:58.880 --> 51:07.200
You don't want experience to turn into arrogance, you want experience to turn into a truly open

51:07.200 --> 51:12.760
way of approaching the world and trying to learn from anybody, especially the young people

51:12.760 --> 51:16.360
today who come out and they're wizards at certain technologies.

51:16.360 --> 51:21.220
And I feel like I'm just stumbling along just trying to keep up, right?

51:21.220 --> 51:26.280
And I try to learn from them even though they're younger than I am or earlier in their career,

51:26.280 --> 51:28.640
I still think I can learn from them.

51:28.640 --> 51:33.640
And I think that's what the best engineers are, not to call myself the best engineers,

51:33.640 --> 51:38.120
but they're the ones that are always trying to learn and be open to learning and being

51:38.120 --> 51:42.360
open to learn from somebody else.

51:42.360 --> 51:48.280
And so I did have several of those people in my career who took the time to kind of

51:48.280 --> 51:53.320
teach me the ropes and give me principles about approaching engineering and approaching

51:53.320 --> 51:54.320
flight projects.

51:54.320 --> 51:57.640
You know, there's been two or three of those people through my career who I've really looked

51:57.640 --> 52:02.440
up to that took the time to sit down with me and say, okay, instead of just calling

52:02.440 --> 52:08.120
you stupid, this is how it works and this is the thing that you have to keep in mind

52:08.120 --> 52:10.880
and this is the approach that you can take.

52:10.880 --> 52:13.480
And it really, really helped me in my career.

52:13.480 --> 52:21.960
So when I encounter younger engineers, I try to do that myself and try to teach them that

52:21.960 --> 52:27.320
trying to learn a system, becoming a system engineer, you know, that system engineer in

52:27.320 --> 52:31.080
the classic sense is one who has a grasp on kind of all the operating principles in the

52:31.080 --> 52:36.080
system and knows how they interrelate is that in some sense, every engineer should be a

52:36.080 --> 52:37.080
system engineer.

52:37.080 --> 52:42.480
If you're too compartmentalized, you can become kind of set in your ways or you don't see

52:42.480 --> 52:47.640
the importance of other perspectives or things that are important to make the whole thing

52:47.640 --> 52:49.780
work better.

52:49.780 --> 52:54.360
And so I've tried to do that throughout my career because these people in my past have

52:54.360 --> 52:55.360
taught me that.

52:55.360 --> 52:58.480
It's taught me to look at the whole system and try to understand your place in it.

52:58.480 --> 53:02.040
And you'll just do a better job as an engineer if you do that.

53:02.040 --> 53:06.600
Not to mention taking inspiration from cross industry technologies as well, as we talked

53:06.600 --> 53:07.600
about earlier.

53:07.600 --> 53:08.600
Yes, absolutely.

53:08.600 --> 53:14.680
Well, Tim, is there anything you would like to share with our listeners, something you're

53:14.680 --> 53:19.640
passionate about or some, I don't know, life advice or something that you'd like them to

53:19.640 --> 53:20.640
know?

53:20.640 --> 53:26.720
Well, I guess it's just a reiteration of what we just mentioned is that I think if you're

53:26.720 --> 53:35.680
in any field, if you're technical or anything else, it's this constant desire to keep learning.

53:35.680 --> 53:40.520
And learning outside of your typical world, I joke about the automotive world, but there's

53:40.520 --> 53:41.520
other worlds.

53:41.520 --> 53:43.000
Like you talk about photography, right?

53:43.000 --> 53:44.640
You're a photographer.

53:44.640 --> 53:48.920
That adds another dimension to your life, which gives you richness and gives you another

53:48.920 --> 53:54.040
thing to learn because if I've learned something over the years, it's that when you're coming

53:54.040 --> 53:59.240
into a field for the first time, there's kind of a freshness or a kind of an eager anticipation

53:59.240 --> 54:01.240
of learning about a field.

54:01.240 --> 54:04.600
And if you're in one field for too long, sometimes you can get a little stagnated and you're

54:04.600 --> 54:06.920
a little tired of the same thing.

54:06.920 --> 54:11.760
But if you try to expand your horizons and learn about a number of different areas, not

54:11.760 --> 54:15.840
just technically, but in your own personal life, different topics, different areas of

54:15.840 --> 54:25.880
interest and always remember that there's cool technology, but there's also people and

54:25.880 --> 54:30.200
that you don't want to become so sterile in your life that you're not interacting with

54:30.200 --> 54:31.200
people.

54:31.200 --> 54:36.400
One of the great qualities of all the work from home is that JPL is a very vibrant place.

54:36.400 --> 54:44.760
It's very much like a college campus in many ways with lots of incidental interactions.

54:44.760 --> 54:48.640
And you see somebody, you ask them what they're doing and they tell you about this field and

54:48.640 --> 54:50.640
you're like, wow, that's really cool.

54:50.640 --> 54:53.800
And it just makes your life richer when you learn those things.

54:53.800 --> 54:58.720
And so having that well-rounded life where you're looking into different things and especially

54:58.720 --> 55:04.800
the people behind them, because you're passionate about your photography, I'm passionate about

55:04.800 --> 55:06.120
space exploration.

55:06.120 --> 55:10.840
Somebody else might be passionate about marine biology and they get really excited and talk

55:10.840 --> 55:11.840
about their field.

55:11.840 --> 55:15.260
That's what I think is the richness of the interaction.

55:15.260 --> 55:22.000
And so if you're a young engineer, my advice is always become well-rounded as an engineer,

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
but also become well-rounded as a person.

55:24.000 --> 55:25.720
So that may not be profound.

55:25.720 --> 55:31.180
I'm sure people before me have thought many of the same thoughts, but that would be my

55:31.180 --> 55:35.000
advice and just be humble through it all.

55:35.000 --> 55:40.520
I think it's very wise advice and we can't be reminded of it often enough, for sure.

55:40.520 --> 55:42.640
Well, Tim, thank you for joining me.

55:42.640 --> 55:48.280
This was a lovely conversation and I really appreciate your time and actually look forward

55:48.280 --> 55:49.960
to hearing what else you get into.

55:49.960 --> 55:54.480
It sounds like maybe you're going to push the boundaries for another few decades as

55:54.480 --> 55:56.680
you continue your work, so I'm looking forward to that.

55:56.680 --> 56:00.840
Yeah, well, thanks for having me and I really enjoyed this talk and I've always also enjoyed

56:00.840 --> 56:03.640
the Linux Unplugged podcast.

56:03.640 --> 56:09.440
I've been learning some good tips and tricks and new technologies that I've started to

56:09.440 --> 56:14.840
look into for my own career, my own life from that broadcast too, so you guys keep up the

56:14.840 --> 56:15.840
good work as well.

56:15.840 --> 56:16.840
Nice.

56:16.840 --> 56:17.840
Well, thank you.

56:17.840 --> 56:21.800
Can I ask what might be one or two technologies that you've grabbed from there?

56:21.800 --> 56:29.080
Well, I was very fascinated with the quick EMU package because we grapple a lot with

56:29.080 --> 56:33.440
VMs at work to try to spin up something quickly to try and experiment on a particular flavor

56:33.440 --> 56:36.440
of an OS.

56:36.440 --> 56:40.840
Just the fact that you could bring up on the command line, I thought that was a really

56:40.840 --> 56:43.440
cool utility.

56:43.440 --> 56:47.340
Forgive me if I forget the name of it, but little packages like I have some security

56:47.340 --> 56:50.660
cameras at home and you guys mentioned on your broadcast at one point about a package

56:50.660 --> 56:58.200
that runs on the Raspberry Pi that acts as a DVR, an open-source security video recorder,

56:58.200 --> 57:00.040
and so I've been tinkering with that.

57:00.040 --> 57:05.360
I hear about these little packages, I hear about different versions of the operating

57:05.360 --> 57:11.400
system like Papo as or Debian, which ones work for you guys better, which windowing

57:11.400 --> 57:12.400
systems.

57:12.400 --> 57:17.000
It's one of those things where I'm interested, but it's hard for me to justify the time to

57:17.000 --> 57:21.520
go and just exhaustively explore all these different packages.

57:21.520 --> 57:26.040
When a package pops up on the broadcast, I'll be like, that's pretty cool, save a link to

57:26.040 --> 57:30.040
that, go look at that, and then I don't have to spend as much time surfing that world to

57:30.040 --> 57:31.040
find stuff.

57:31.040 --> 57:32.040
That's been very helpful.

57:32.040 --> 57:33.040
Nice.

57:33.040 --> 57:34.040
Yeah.

57:34.040 --> 57:37.120
It's like a learning shortcut while you're out walking your dog, you could just learn

57:37.120 --> 57:38.120
a new trigger too.

57:38.120 --> 57:41.460
Yeah, and it's actually the truth is that that's typically when I listen to the broadcast

57:41.460 --> 57:44.280
is walking the dog.

57:44.280 --> 57:45.280
Lovely.

57:45.280 --> 57:49.920
Well, thanks for joining me again and thanks so much.

57:49.920 --> 58:16.040
You are quite welcome.
