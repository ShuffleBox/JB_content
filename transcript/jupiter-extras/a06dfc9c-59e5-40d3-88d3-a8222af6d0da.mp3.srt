1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,600
It's Office Hours, with Chris.

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,640
That's me, Office Hours, welcome in.

3
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:17,960
Hey everybody, welcome to a new thing I just made up.

4
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,880
It's called Office Hours with Chris, where I thought I'd answer questions and read emails.

5
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:25,160
And since I never told anybody I was doing this, I just had to pick some random emails

6
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,440
to start with.

7
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:34,080
And that's how, what I'm going to guess is Vekko, Vekko, Vekko, I'm going with Vekko.

8
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,360
That's how Vekko got into the show here.

9
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,560
He writes about the enthusiast trap.

10
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:42,680
And keep in mind the context of a couple of weeks ago as I record this.

11
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:50,440
There was a big hoopla around Mangero bundling free office in place of libre office.

12
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,200
And so that's the context for this email.

13
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,080
And of course I should say, Vekko, welcome, welcome into the office.

14
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,080
I'm glad you're here.

15
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:01,040
Anyways, he writes, I recently heard of a name for the phenomenon that is happening

16
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,560
with the Mangero community.

17
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,320
It's called the enthusiast trap.

18
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:08,160
I first heard about it from a video by LowSpecGamer.

19
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:12,760
I will put a link to that video in the show notes so you can see the whole thing.

20
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:19,480
But the TLDR is the enthusiast market is very small, very demanding, and the least loyal

21
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,480
of them all.

22
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,080
I'm going to pause here for a second.

23
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:27,720
The loyalty thing struck me when I first read this, but then I think about it.

24
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:32,260
One of the number one kind of reactions on the negative side of Mangero bundling free

25
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:36,680
office, one of the number one go to responses was, well, that's it, I'm leaving.

26
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,360
Which distro should I switch to next?

27
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,760
Boom.

28
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,200
All that loyalty gone.

29
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,980
So I actually, at first I read that and I kind of didn't like the way that felt.

30
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,840
But then I thought about it and he's right.

31
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,840
Like the enthusiast markets educated, they're capable of shifting to a different product.

32
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,200
And so they'll take advantage of that capability.

33
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,160
He says, and for a company to grow, it will eventually need to abandon these enthusiasts

34
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:03,400
to appeal to a more mainstream audience.

35
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:09,860
This of course will then upset the enthusiasts who are very aware and they are demanding.

36
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:15,040
And as we can demonstrate non loyal customers, which will jump ship very quickly, the enthusiasts

37
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,960
can't really be blamed for being upset either since they probably did a lot of the free

38
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:26,280
marketing for that company or like in the case of a Linux distribution for that distribution.

39
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:32,280
Even some more demanding work like reporting bugs or fixing bugs and submitting patches

40
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,460
or doing tech support in the community.

41
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:38,360
And they do have a legitimate claim to that time.

42
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:42,120
He goes on to say, in hindsight, this applies to a lot of things that seem to happen in

43
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,280
the Linux community.

44
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,280
Love the shows by the way.

45
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,360
Well, thank you, Vecho.

46
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,680
Hopefully I'm getting somewhere near, well, I guess it doesn't really matter.

47
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,280
That's just how it's going to be pronounced because you're not here to correct me.

48
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,960
You're in my office, but it's my rules.

49
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,600
All right.

50
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,200
I love your, I love your finding here.

51
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:06,280
And it's interesting to watch the LowSpecGamer video, which was really more about why some

52
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:12,120
of the founders of Oculus are leaving and be able to drive sort of insights into your

53
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,440
local community.

54
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,180
And that's actually a pretty powerful tool because humans be humans everywhere.

55
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,800
And there's a lot of that in every group.

56
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,480
And I think we sometimes get really hard on ourselves because we think Linux users are

57
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,580
so bad.

58
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,500
It's enthusiast.

59
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:38,260
It's tribalism, not such a loaded term, but it's people that want to signal what kind

60
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,360
of ideals that they have and hold.

61
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:47,280
And they're looking for other people that hold those same ideas and signals because

62
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,640
it's a way to determine safety.

63
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:54,200
It's a way to determine common values so they're more likely somebody you can trust.

64
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,200
It's instinctual.

65
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,600
It's necessary for human survival.

66
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,920
And without it, we wouldn't be able to have an economy.

67
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,340
You wouldn't be able to have a market system.

68
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:10,520
So it's, I don't know how to solve the problem other than trying to talk about it in a way

69
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:19,600
that is both open and understanding, but doesn't really encourage it.

70
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,960
I've really been trying to take on this mantra of, you know, this type of Linux doesn't work

71
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,240
for me, but that doesn't mean it doesn't work for you.

72
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,400
An example is Gnome Shell.

73
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:34,160
For a long, long time, you know, just Gnome Shell hasn't really worked well for me.

74
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,320
But somehow the project continues on with more and more users all the time.

75
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,200
So what should I take away from that?

76
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:45,320
That Gnome Shell is crap and garbage and should be completely redone?

77
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,920
Or that perhaps it just doesn't work perfectly for me?

78
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:52,440
And that there are tools that work better for me, just like Gnome Shell is a tool that

79
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,440
works better for others.

80
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:58,560
And I think we just have to start encouraging that kind of conversation and it'll catch

81
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,560
on.

82
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,560
That's something we try to do through the shows.

83
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,880
I don't know if it is catching on.

84
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,960
It seems like people are becoming more aware of it.

85
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,880
And it's definitely like by these emails, it seems like the awareness is increasing

86
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,880
in the audience.

87
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,880
And I agree.

88
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,840
The enthusiast trap is a really tricky thing for companies to deal with because you do

89
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:21,460
have to start to appeal to a broader audience if you want to grow beyond a certain niche.

90
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:25,080
Or you have to determine that you can sustain a business in that niche and you're happy

91
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,080
with it.

92
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,320
But that doesn't happen a lot.

93
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,480
I mean, you look at Apple, for example.

94
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:36,000
When the iPhone was exploding, they really had a hard time paying attention to the needs

95
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,040
of their Mac users, especially the professional Mac users.

96
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:44,800
And now, as the iPhone is becoming about 40% of their business and the other elements of

97
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,760
their business are making up the slack, all of a sudden the Mac is becoming more important

98
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,040
again.

99
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,560
And now you're starting to see things like the Mac Pro, the iMac Pro, the refreshed Mac

100
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,040
Mini, and the new rumored MacBook Pro.

101
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:02,400
Plus on top of that though, which I think is even more of a signal from Apple, is their

102
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:10,120
top executives like Craig Federighi and Phil Schiller are going on enthusiast podcasts.

103
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,000
They're going on those guys' shows.

104
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,260
That's like talking directly to the enthusiast market now.

105
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:20,700
They've gone from ignoring the enthusiast market to building hardware for them and going

106
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,440
on platforms in which they tune into.

107
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,240
And I think that is sort of a re... you can see in these last two years.

108
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:32,240
I think it's kind of neat to watch, especially from afar because I got no skin in the game

109
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,800
so I can go, look at this.

110
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,800
They're listening again.

111
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,320
They're putting decent hardware out again.

112
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:43,320
It's unbelievably expensive, but that's a different conversation.

113
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:49,340
And I think you see this realignment in their priorities and companies struggle with this.

114
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,760
They really do struggle with this.

115
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:57,960
And so as they grow to a wider, broader market, listening to that niche audience who can seem

116
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:05,520
extra demanding and pandemic almost can feel like a waste of your time because you have

117
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:11,880
this broader millions of more potentials X of whatever it might be.

118
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:18,800
And but the thing is, you really have to walk a fine line there because your most loyal

119
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,160
fans are really the ones that can help you get the word out.

120
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,040
They can, they'll be the first to try that new product.

121
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,480
Maybe it's the watch or not my case.

122
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,480
Maybe it's a podcast, right?

123
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,420
They'll be the first to try that new thing.

124
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:32,420
So it serves them.

125
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:37,720
It serves the longterm health of the organization or the project to keep the fans happy.

126
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:44,180
And that's why when I cover in love, Mangero's deciding to take out free office, but instead

127
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:49,360
give the user a choice of free office, LibreOffice or no office at the install time is a pretty

128
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,480
reasonable compromise because for those folks that want to still take advantage of the free

129
00:07:53,480 --> 00:08:00,240
office improvements for particularly types of cranky doc format conversions, it's there

130
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,480
for them now.

131
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:06,120
And for those that want to stick with LibreOffice, still available right there front and center.

132
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:12,040
And for those like me now that want no office, that's even better.

133
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,800
So anyways, thank you for the email and I'll go ahead and get out of here, go.

134
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,800
Jack's got to get in here.

135
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,480
So Jack, welcome into my office.

136
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:22,760
And he wrote in about Nextcloud, we've been talking Nextcloud, haven't really said much

137
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,760
about it recently.

138
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:28,040
So I thought this would probably be a pretty good chance right here.

139
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,040
Here's what Jack writes.

140
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:32,520
Hey Chris, I had some tips for Nextcloud features that I didn't hear mentioned that you would

141
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,640
definitely find useful.

142
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,280
I've been using Nextcloud since the own cloud fork.

143
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:42,640
So maybe about three years, and it's become my favorite, most useful self-hosted server

144
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,700
other than my Plex and Jellyfin VM.

145
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:50,180
Number one is external storage, allows you to map a folder in Nextcloud to an external

146
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:57,680
storage provider by either SIF, Samba, Amazon's AWS, OpenStack, SFTP, Dropbox, etc.

147
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,860
And then you can use it natively within Nextcloud's clients and the webpage.

148
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:07,760
It can request credentials on access, store them, or authenticate against LDAP or federate

149
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,240
with other Nextcloud instances.

150
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,860
And then they're shareable with the Nextcloud permissions.

151
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:14,860
That's a really cool thing.

152
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:17,460
I actually am aware of external storage in our Nextcloud server.

153
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:22,040
One of our production Nextcloud servers is, I don't think it's using the formal external

154
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:27,520
storage, but it is doing digital ocean spaces, which is really kind of a cool thing.

155
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,800
So check that out.

156
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,560
So we are aware of external storage.

157
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:35,600
I have had some performance issues with it in the past when I connected it to Google

158
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,360
Drive and to Dropbox, so I haven't been all over it.

159
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,660
But for those of you that aren't aware of it, that's a good one.

160
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:45,280
He goes on to say it's a great way to also provide highly available interface to storage

161
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:50,720
objects that otherwise wouldn't really be accessible outside the LAN or VPN, which leads

162
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,720
him to the next one.

163
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,520
Now this is a big one.

164
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,120
Full text search.

165
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,960
This is a plugin stack that provides an elastic search interface to your Nextcloud files and

166
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,640
servers.

167
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,800
It also has support for OCR.

168
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:09,000
Combined with external storages, you could provide a full, incredibly fast search for

169
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,800
not just file names, but the contents of everything Elasticsearch supports.

170
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,180
Office formats, text, PDF, etc, etc.

171
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:23,280
When my grandfather died, he asked me to make his documents and emails available to the

172
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,280
family.

173
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:27,560
And I used Nextcloud and full text search to do it.

174
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,520
And it's an easy interface.

175
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:33,880
I also used it to provide a text search for my entire home NAS, which is great when you're

176
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:37,960
looking for, say, a tax document that you didn't name all that well and maybe didn't

177
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,880
file in the best place.

178
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,720
Hope you find these useful, Jack.

179
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,560
I do find those useful.

180
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,560
Thank you, Jack.

181
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,560
That's really great.

182
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:49,660
Now if you want to get into my office in the future, there's probably several ways you

183
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,660
can do it.

184
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:55,120
I'm monitoring different show inboxes, so sometimes I'll be picking up some of those

185
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:00,720
questions that slip through the cracks and don't make it into a show, or your best bet,

186
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,220
like if you specifically want to get in here, extras.show.com.

187
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,520
You go over there and I'll be watching that.

188
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,440
We can get something in here just for you and me.

189
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,280
You got a question directly for me or Prospector Chris.

190
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,520
That's who was just talking there for a second.

191
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:19,620
You can go over to extras.show.com and drop it in there and I'll address it on a future

192
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:22,000
office hours whenever that is.

193
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,120
The office is busy, all right?

194
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,500
I don't know when those are.

195
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:30,280
So the best thing to do would be to go to extras.show.com and just get them.

196
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,680
See you next time.

197
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,680
Office hours are closed.

198
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,680
Thanks for visiting.

199
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,680
It's over.

200
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,680
It's all done now.

201
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,680
The office is closed.

202
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:57,160
You got to go.
