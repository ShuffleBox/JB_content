00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Hello, Emma. How are you?

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I'm doing great. How are you, Brent?

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm doing really amazing. Thank you for joining me for a conversation today.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:27,000
For those who don't know you, Emma, you are a part of System76 as a customer happiness manager, which I love that title.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Can you tell us a little bit more about what that's about?

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Well, as a customer happiness manager, I manage our technical support and customer service team, but I also help plan community events and celebrations internally.

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So pretty much just trying to make all the employees happy at the same time as making our customers happy.

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
That's amazing. And I feel like you're the perfect person for that, too.

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,000
In terms of internal happiness, I heard maybe that today might be a birthday for you on the day that we're recording.

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Yes, it is System76's birthday and nobody knows what I had planned. So I feel like really sneaky today.

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Yesterday I had prepared this little, it's called 14 Years of Memories, and it's a box of framed photos.

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
So we don't have any photos of ourselves up here.

13
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:36,000
So I want them to go on the wall at System76, but I put them in a box as a riddle and in consecutive order.

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
So it's like a history of memories at System76.

15
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Oh, that's awesome.

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Yeah, it turned out really cute. So I'm really excited for Carl to open that.

17
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm going to have him open it after this.

18
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And we're going to do a cake, which I have little cake toppers that also show who System76 is.

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
That's amazing.

20
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Yeah, it's crazy to know it's been 14 years.

21
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Wow.

22
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Yeah.

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:12,000
That's a huge milestone, really. And a lot has happened for System76 in the last 14 years, too. That's really amazing.

24
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Yeah, it is. It is really crazy. It's awesome. I just love, I love our whole little community.

25
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Our company culture is so awesome that we're all such a family and we have so much fun inside and outside of work.

26
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You know, that's exactly the feeling I got as well, especially when I first met you.

27
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
But also I met some of the others from System76 and that's the feeling I got over and over.

28
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It was like that everyone is so happy to be a part of that family and that there's an investment there.

29
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Right. If you're part of it, then you really care, which is huge.

30
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Yeah. Happiness is definitely important at System76.

31
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:03,000
And for me, I just love happiness. I just think it is like orange is the new black, happy is the new sad for sure.

32
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's not something people think about spreading.

33
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:18,000
But if you think about like sadness and the trolls online, they spread all of that negativity all day long and it's very toxic.

34
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:31,000
But when you spread happiness, it is super contagious and it just spreads like wildfire and can make so many people's days just by focusing on making other people happy.

35
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Oh, I love that. How did you first decide to take happiness and kind of send it out to other people like that?

36
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Like, was there a moment that kind of made that just seem like a dedication for you?

37
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I don't think there was really a moment. I just I think everyone is looking for happiness.

38
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
And I think like 10 years ago, I started writing on this story called The Happiness Corp.

39
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,000
And I never I never finished it, but I've started to blog about it some more.

40
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:13,000
And I'm just thinking about it, how 10 years ago I was trying to make this role of a happiness manager inside a company.

41
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:23,000
And it's really cool that I've done that. But it just it seemed so far away 10 years ago that it just seemed far fetched and fake.

42
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:31,000
But I just realized that it could be a real thing and that it actually can benefit a business and your personality in your life, really.

43
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Wow, that's huge, especially when you can bring positive energy in all aspects of your life.

44
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Right. From work to home to to your moments doing your own work like that story that you're writing.

45
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:53,000
If you can bring that into all those aspects and also share it, that feels super powerful.

46
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:01,000
And I would say that you're succeeding for sure. Anyone I know who's met you has only really amazing things to say about you.

47
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You and I met first at Linux Fest Northwest. That's two years ago.

48
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And anytime we're in the same room together, we seem to be howling with laughter about a whole bunch of things.

49
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:22,000
So that has felt like a real treat and just makes it easy to be around you and makes everybody feel really great.

50
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:30,000
So you're totally you're totally doing it. Thanks. Working at System 76 is a huge part of my life.

51
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:42,000
But I am really into pinball, which is it's kind of a hobby that I I just did kind of for fun for a little while, like once a month.

52
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,000
But now I've gotten into the habit of going every Tuesday. You're like a professional.

53
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I know. Right. But I'm actually not that good. Well, it doesn't matter. That's the thing.

54
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I'm only good at some of the machines. I thought I was good until I saw this one guy a couple of weeks ago going to town.

55
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:12,000
He had like dance moves like he had his feet were positioned. I mean, his angle of his back, the heart, the how hard he hit the buttons.

56
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I was like, I have nothing on this guy. He is clearly a pro. Oh, wow.

57
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I couldn't I recorded him because I was I was tweeting about it at the time because I was like, man, it is really weird to to record this person and share it.

58
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:40,000
But you guys really have to see this guy's moves in action. Like dude got like a hundred and something thousand on the Wizard of Oz pinball machine, which is is a super low scoring annoy.

59
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's annoyingly low scoring. It doesn't follow any sort of pinball logic for points.

60
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:59,000
So anyway, I can never get past like ten thousand on that one dude that one hundred and twenty five thousand like jumping all over the machine. He actually broke a sweat.

61
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:06,000
And I was like, oh, I I'd never seen a quarter last that long. I just couldn't believe it.

62
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It's a really good investment of a quarter, obviously. I know. Right. I'm like, I mean, like ten dollars later, I'm like, man, I'm only at ten thousand.

63
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,000
But that's awesome. Yeah. So I ended up going through my my phone just trying to clear stuff out.

64
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,000
And I saw that video from two weeks ago and I just laughed out loud because I never shared it with anybody.

65
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:38,000
But I talked about it and I know it's there and I can watch it for research purposes.

66
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:49,000
All right. That's training, perhaps. Yeah. But I am very good at the South Park one, which is right next to the Wizard of Oz at the particular place I go.

67
00:07:49,000 --> 00:08:00,000
That one took me a while to understand how to get more points. But once I figured it out, I am number four on the leaderboard.

68
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Oh, really? That's awesome. I want to be number one, but I don't want to go bankrupt doing it. Well, it takes time.

69
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You know, you kind of dedicate to it and put your time in. Tell me what it is about pinball that really attracts you.

70
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Like what what is what is grabbing you about it? I think it's just a unique game.

71
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:32,000
It has a lot of moving parts and pieces that you have to really think about. It's a it's just an interesting product.

72
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It's got the machines, the sensors, the lights. I like to see how creative people can make it and how many different scoring methods that they can come up with.

73
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:53,000
How many little secret doors and windows and little holes and, you know, getting the multi balls. I just all of it is just so exciting.

74
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
And I just you can't get bored playing around a pinball. You just can't.

75
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:05,000
So I think it's it's just an important little game that people can play that you don't need very much skill for, but you can still enjoy.

76
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Yeah, I I really admire those games where anyone can play, no matter your skill level, like you just mentioned, but also games where you're actually just playing against yourself.

77
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,000
And so the more skill you get, obviously, the better you feel about your performance.

78
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,000
And other people like pinball is super fun to watch if you're watching the right person, obviously, like you just mentioned, right?

79
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Yeah. But but you're not taking anyone else down by winning. It's like everybody has their own chance at doing well for whatever that means for them at that time.

80
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Right. Yeah. Those style of games. I really, really enjoy.

81
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
That's why I was thinking if I should go pro or not, because I'm what does that mean?

82
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I know they they they have like pinball tournaments in Colorado, like a lot of them.

83
00:09:52,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Like it's a huge thing for well, to me, it looks like a huge little community. But I was debating if I should do that.

84
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
But just like like you said, what makes it fun is you're not playing against anyone.

85
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:13,000
So if I I'm really competitive, but also I don't want to take the fun away from pinball.

86
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
So I haven't like competed against anybody.

87
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Have you experienced one of those tournaments before?

88
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I've watched a couple. Yeah. OK, so you know what it's all about.

89
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Yeah. And I know some of their skill levels and I know that I would just get laughed out of there.

90
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
But do you get to play for free? Oh, I don't know.

91
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Like in the sense that you don't just spend the quarter. It might be something.

92
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
No, I think you have. There's no way to override the quarter capabilities of a pinball machine.

93
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
That's how they get you. Yeah.

94
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I hadn't played pinball in a very, very, very long time, like basically since I was a kid, I would say.

95
00:10:52,000 --> 00:11:05,000
And recently at the Jupiter broadcasting sprint that we did in late August, we right across from the hotel that most of us were staying in, there was an arcade like this.

96
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
And you should see everyone at Jupiter broadcasting and how exciting that is.

97
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:16,000
So we did spend some time there and I got to play some pinball and it was such a nostalgic experience.

98
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Of course, I was terrible and I never was any good, but it was still super, super fun.

99
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
And what I really enjoyed was that it's so simple.

100
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
You just have two little paddles, right?

101
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,000
But like you were mentioning, there's a real creativity to it.

102
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:41,000
And this excitement and everybody plays a little bit differently. And, you know, some people have their certain strengths and weaknesses and stuff.

103
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
And so that whole world just became really fascinating to me again.

104
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:54,000
And I had I had no idea you're going to bring that up today, but it brings me right back to that experience so I can kind of connect with why that feels so fun to you.

105
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Well, that's that's where you'll find me on Tuesdays.

106
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:11,000
And I'm usually by myself, so if I'm drinking a beer and tweeting on Tuesday night, that's I'm probably at an arcade because I'm such an adult.

107
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I feel like things that we do on a weekly basis are super powerful.

108
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
There's a quote that I came across recently.

109
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
It's it's on my wall, but it's those kind of things that you forget about for a while and then you see it again.

110
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:32,000
And it's by Jordan Peterson, and he mentions that the things the mundane things that you do in the everyday become your life.

111
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:40,000
And if you expand that just slightly, it's like, well, the things that you manage to squeeze into your week, every week or even your every morning, right?

112
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Are actually super important for your happiness and your your well-being and how you sort of define yourself.

113
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:55,000
So that you go every Tuesday and that you've been going for six years and that it still gives you that much joy, it sounds like a really amazing thing.

114
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
So kudos to you for finding that.

115
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Well, we're actually so we're having I've done a couple of System 76 events at at the barcade, too.

116
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:11,000
But we're actually having our super fan happy hour at one of the barcades downtown.

117
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:18,000
So I'm pretty excited to show off my pinball skills lack thereof to the the super fan group.

118
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
That's awesome. I can imagine a lot of those people are going to be right into that.

119
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Yeah, it's like a week away, dude. I'm so excited.

120
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Have you been practicing to try to, like, shape up your skills, I guess?

121
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Well, I can't because it's at the it's at the barcade downtown.

122
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
And I don't want to drive downtown every Tuesday.

123
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
It's not your usual hang.

124
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
And their knobs are like they don't really clean their buttons as much.

125
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,000
So like some of the pinball machines don't behave as well as the others.

126
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
So I think that's kind of gross. So my score is probably going to be different.

127
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
But that's just excuses for me.

128
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I mean, if you really think about it, right.

129
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I just want to put that out there.

130
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:10,000
But yeah, I'm excited to play like four player Pac-Man with the super fans and loosen up before the the Saturday event.

131
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
It'll be awesome.

132
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I've been hearing from a lot of people, especially cheese.

133
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
He's super excited about the super fans thing.

134
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:26,000
And I would imagine aligns really well with your spreading happiness and getting people involved and just sharing the love.

135
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Right. So when is the date that this is happening?

136
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:37,000
So people are flying in Friday and Friday, the 15th, I want to say.

137
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,000
And then we're I'm going to go meet them somewhere, I think, at the hotel.

138
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I don't really know all the details, like the nitty gritty, but I know I get to go meet everyone and greet them.

139
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:57,000
And then we're going to do a happy hour just to kind of loosen everybody up and get to know each other and play some games.

140
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
So I imagine that's going to be an extremely fun time.

141
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:14,000
And basically what the super fan event is, is we fly 10 10 people out here that have shown us that they do awesome stuff with open source or system 76 or pop OS.

142
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:25,000
And people that really put a lot of time and effort into their projects get flown out here and treated like the nerdy royalty that they deserve for a whole weekend.

143
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I love that. Yeah.

144
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:44,000
And then after the shenanigans of the event, we do a roundtable and the roundtable is giving each fan a voice about what they want to see from our company and our software and our hardware.

145
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Oh, wow. So I think that's something that's really cool because the community has really shaped our company.

146
00:15:52,000 --> 00:16:03,000
And like our super fan, our last super fan, we unveiled those Thaleo prototypes, which that was something I think they didn't really expect.

147
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:11,000
But, you know, those super fans had a lot of impact in shaping how we built this open source computer.

148
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
So I'm excited to see what the roundtable comes up with this year.

149
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:22,000
But there's also a lot of not serious things going on, like Nerf.

150
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:30,000
There's like a box of 20 Nerf guns and a lot of bullets just sitting there just in case.

151
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I mean, I don't I don't really have the whole idea of the event, the Saturday event.

152
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I just know I'm going to be there and I'm going to do whatever they want me to do because marketing is the one that plans everything.

153
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:51,000
OK, but I do know that I there's a lot of Nerf guns and there's some like wiggle trikes and drones and asteroids.

154
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I don't know what a wiggle trick is.

155
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
And I'll send you a picture of it. It's this try to get you.

156
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:03,000
You just turn the handlebars left and right and it has this obnoxious squeaking sound.

157
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:16,000
It's like it goes really slow. But man, is it funny when you put an adult on one of those in a unicorn mask.

158
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:26,000
It is hysterical. So it sounds like the blog post celebrating all the events that happened at the super fans meetup will be quite hilarious.

159
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I feel like. Yeah, we're going to have some good photo ops.

160
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:36,000
And I guess they're they're like transforming the factory.

161
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:49,000
It's going to be like all black and dark like space and stuff and they have to go on secret missions and there's going to be a cool unveiling with have a fog machine to do the last part of it.

162
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
It's going to look so cool like space.

163
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
That sounds unbelievable.

164
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:01,000
It is so nerdy and amazing and I can't wait.

165
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Well, that's one thing I love is like that we get to celebrate our sort of nerdiness and not shy away from it and celebrate it with a bunch of other people who are also loving it just as much.

166
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Right. And it seems like you guys are definitely you definitely know how to have fun with it.

167
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:27,000
So I can't wait to hear all of the things that happen. That sounds really unbelievable.

168
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:33,000
So, Emma, I wanted to ask you about something that might be a little bit sensitive.

169
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I wanted to ask you about your summer and how your experience this summer went.

170
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Oh, so it started off with an accident, a terrible accident.

171
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I'm trying to see I'm prepping for something funny here. That's why it sounds like I'm smiling because I am.

172
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,000
But it was a terrible accident. I broke my ankle and my leg on May 23rd.

173
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,000
You were telling me about this when it first happened and you sounded so like discouraged.

174
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
And I was trying to convince you like, no, no, it'll be OK.

175
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:14,000
It was really, really sad because I was like, wow, I like to run all over the place and I like to go hiking.

176
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,000
There's so many things I do with my ankle and my leg that I need.

177
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
You know, it's like an important body part for most of us. Right.

178
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Yeah. So it was so gross. Like it was facing the other way. And I was just oh, no.

179
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Really? Yeah. And I was screaming and it was it was a crazy day. But what happened afterwards?

180
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,000
So it was so I consider the start of summer like the end of May.

181
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
So you booked a bunch of holidays and stuff like that, I'm sure. Right.

182
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Yeah. I had three vacations booked, one for the twenty fifth, which was a day after or two days after.

183
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Oh, man. So couldn't cancel it or nothing I could do.

184
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,000
So I was like, OK, I guess I'll go. Oh, yeah.

185
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:14,000
And I had my leg was just it was just together with like a splint and ace wrap because, you know, they can they reset the bone.

186
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
So it wasn't facing the other way, but they couldn't do any surgery.

187
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:27,000
So it was it was like really swollen and disgusting and large and I was on crutches and crutches are the worst, the worst.

188
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Oh, man. And so what was this trip, though? It was to Steamboat Springs.

189
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:38,000
So in Colorado, a lot of people do staycations.

190
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:45,000
So you go to just a little mountain town, a little tourist mountain town and pretend to be a tourist, basically.

191
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Well, Colorado is so beautiful. Yeah. And it's all so different.

192
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
So each little mountain town has its own little personality.

193
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:02,000
So this one was Hot Springs. Couldn't get my leg wet, though, because I had all this stuff on it.

194
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
And it's like I can't just let it dangle. So I had to keep the stuff on it.

195
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
It's not like I could take it off for a minute.

196
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:20,000
So I pretty much spent the entire time watching Law and Order reruns on USA in my hotel room with my leg up.

197
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Calling my sister, asking for McDonald's and stuff.

198
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Oh, that's so sad. So it was a pretty that was really boring.

199
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Anything I tried, it just didn't work.

200
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Like, I realized that the handicapped accessible places just don't exist really.

201
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Oh, wow. Like, I think that it really has to be consciously thought about when you're making a business.

202
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,000
And if you don't know someone that's handicapped, that is necessary. It's not something that's thought of.

203
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I think they follow like the laws that they need to follow. But like the bare necessity or whatever.

204
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Yeah, but it's not easy. Like, it is not easy being handicapped. And I feel really bad for people that are.

205
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,000
So it must have changed your perspective completely on just traveling through the world.

206
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Oh, yeah, totally.

207
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:16,000
And I was also supposed to go to CELF, which was a Linux conference.

208
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:22,000
And I had like this whole thing planned where I was going to hand deliver a laptop to Zeb.

209
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:35,000
It was first time in the USA. Wanted to let him like have a proper Linux laptop and review it for the weekend and had to cancel that trip, which was super sad.

210
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:43,000
But after I did that little vacation, I went and had surgery at the beginning of June.

211
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:50,000
And I thought I was getting better for a little while. And then I got an infection on the surgical site.

212
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Oh, no.

213
00:22:51,000 --> 00:23:00,000
It was not fun. So I had to go have two more surgeries and stay in the hospital.

214
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I stayed in the hospital for a while. It wasn't fun. I don't I really didn't like the hospital.

215
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I didn't like the the way the nurses treated me. And it just it was I felt helpless, basically.

216
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
But I found the happy. I found the happy.

217
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
If anyone's going to find it, it might be you. Right. Yeah.

218
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:33,000
So they have these little these little ice cream cups that are Ben and Jerry's. And it was like this little this cute little thing on the menu.

219
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:43,000
It was like a piece of chocolate cake, a piece of pie, a cherry Garcia, Ben and Jerry's mini pint thing is just enough for a couple of bites.

220
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:50,000
But it was the perfect amount. And you could tell like doctors had something to do with that sizing.

221
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I ordered that for breakfast, lunch and dinner. And I don't know, did I send you did I send you the pancake?

222
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I took pictures of my pancakes and ice cream because I had that in the hospital.

223
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:14,000
You know, you didn't. But you certainly taught me a thing or two about brunch when you and I went for breakfast together at this last Linux fest.

224
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
And I want to tell that story a little bit.

225
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:27,000
So we got to go for breakfast in a small little town that Chris from Jupiter Broadcasting, he grew up in.

226
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
And he said, oh, yeah, I used to when I was in high school, I used to go to this cafe all the time.

227
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:37,000
So you and I got the experience of going to this cafe, which was like maybe cafe is the wrong word.

228
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:43,000
It's more of like a really classic diner, which was fun in itself, for sure.

229
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:49,000
And you walked in, it felt like a little tiny bit of a time warp. But so you and I sit down and I have a few allergies.

230
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:55,000
So I had to kind of browse the menu quite carefully. But you seem to know exactly what you wanted.

231
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:02,000
And when they came with your food, I started laughing out loud because, well, what did you have for breakfast?

232
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:15,000
A stack of pancakes with some ice cream on the side, which inevitably ends up on top with cream and whatever other goodies I could put on there.

233
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,000
And that day I learned that you know how to do brunch. So that was pretty amazing.

234
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:26,000
So it sounds like in some ways you found that experience in the hospital, too. And that must have just brightened up your everyday.

235
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Yeah. Yeah. That was how I got through it. And people visiting me like my best girlfriend came and she gave me a manicure and brush my hair and brought me a scrunchie and like just little girly things like that.

236
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Like my sister came and Carl, our owner at System 76, he came and visited with me for a couple hours.

237
00:25:49,000 --> 00:26:04,000
So that helps. So another thing that I wanted to say to people, if you do know someone that wasn't an accident or was hurt and is in the hospital and is going through surgeries, visitors definitely make all the difference.

238
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I know it's no fun being in a hospital, regardless if you're the visitor or the patient.

239
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:24,000
But understand that the person in the bed has it way worse than you. So you can at least give them an hour of your time because it definitely does help the attitude improve for sure.

240
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:31,000
You know, recovery is such an emotional, there's such an emotional piece to it as well.

241
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:37,000
And it feels like if you can brighten someone's day like that just by doing a visit, it totally changes everything for sure.

242
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Yeah, I was starting to feel really helpless and I felt like I was never going to get better.

243
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:52,000
And it was just really defeating to not be able to take a step like a normal human, you know, it's like all those things we take for granted, right?

244
00:26:52,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Yeah. And I had so many plans for the summer that like nothing, nothing panned out because I was literally in the bed the entire summer.

245
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:15,000
But I had my laptop, so that was nice. But my big thing this summer was that I wanted to take my dog out and learn paddleboarding with him on the paddleboard.

246
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Because I have a lake right by my house and it's it's just so beautiful.

247
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
And it's like a thing where people take their dogs on their paddleboard.

248
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:34,000
And I just there's this one chick one time and she just seemed so confident and cool and relaxed and had her little pup there with his bandana.

249
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:40,000
And I was like, I am doing that next year. So I really want to bring my dog to the lake.

250
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
And that still hasn't happened. So. So still a goal for sure.

251
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Yeah. I kept checking in on you every once in a while and you're like, nope, still in the hospital.

252
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Still can't walk around. And I definitely fell for you for sure.

253
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:04,000
But it sounds like now you're you're definitely more mobile and able to do some walks with your dog again and feeling a little bit better, it seems.

254
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Right. So that's great. Yeah. He actually went to go stay with somebody else because it was too overwhelming to take care of him.

255
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,000
So he has a new new family now. I go see him on the weekends.

256
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Oh, that must be hard. Yeah. But my sister got a foster dog.

257
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:29,000
We tell you about her. Her name is Trixie. Oh, gosh, I can just imagine already.

258
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:36,000
My sister and I, we own our house together because we've just we've done everything together our whole lives.

259
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:42,000
So she she got a foster dog, an Anatolian shepherd. This dog is very huge.

260
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:52,000
She's one hundred pounds. She's very loud. You know, her bark is definitely, you know, conducive of her size.

261
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:59,000
She doesn't like noises. So anytime you hear sirens, we back up to a very major street.

262
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Anytime you hear sirens, she just panics and she's barking all over, running back and forth in the house, like waggling her tail while she's barking.

263
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Like she like she just wants to tell us what what's going on. But she does that with the blender, too.

264
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Every morning I make my smoothie lately, she comes in there and just yells at me while I'm in the kitchen.

265
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,000
And I'm like, dude, I know I'm sorry. It's only going to be another minute, another minute.

266
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:36,000
And like with this Cuisinart one, it takes even longer. So she's like barking even louder for longer.

267
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:43,000
And so it's like I can't let her out because it's super early and she's going to go out there and bark at whatever runs across the yard.

268
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:48,000
So I just have to stand there and take it. You need like doggy headphones or something.

269
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Yeah, I just have to stand there and take it and let her yell at me.

270
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:58,000
And I need to find a quieter blender if she's going to be acting up like that.

271
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
She doesn't like the vacuum either. Anything that makes noise, it sounds like.

272
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Yeah. Like, OK, another thing. I love this show, Live Rescue on A&E or something.

273
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Live Rescue and Live PD. Can't even watch it anymore because of the sirens.

274
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Oh, oh, it's like a cop show or something.

275
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Yeah, it's like cops, but without shaky cameras and like all attractive people.

276
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,000
It's all exciting stuff. There's no wasted scenes.

277
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:39,000
But there are so many sirens. And oh, man, the first time I put it on when she was there, I knew that I couldn't watch that show anymore.

278
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:44,000
So I haven't seen an episode in like a month.

279
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Yeah, she's she's a treat. So she she was a foster.

280
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:52,000
I say that she was a foster because she's definitely not going anywhere.

281
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
I can't imagine my life without her.

282
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I just love her. And I knew that fostering dogs would be a bad idea because I think I'll end up with like 10 dogs before next year.

283
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Has that like pet connection been a really nice thing for you?

284
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Yeah, because I I was not a dog lover until it was actually Linux Fest Northwest, I think, like two years ago.

285
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Really? Yeah. I had gotten into some conversations and it was a circle where all of us were talking about our pets.

286
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
And I was talking about my cat. Oh, I have another story about my cat.

287
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
I tell you that I don't have a cat anymore.

288
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:38,000
The story about that. Oh, so we're all just standing there and showing how happy they are talking about their pets.

289
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:44,000
And like the dog people were just so much happier. And I was just so confused.

290
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Oh, that's interesting. Yeah, I could I could tell, though, like they were visibly happier and their pictures were just adorable.

291
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
And dogs do really funny stuff. So I really considered it.

292
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:03,000
I don't know if you remember Levi, too, was running around the parking lot two years ago and he caught one of the drones.

293
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Right. I don't know if you remember that. That was really hilarious. Yeah, he's funny.

294
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:19,000
But I just I realized that I kind of like dogs and I just wanted to test it out, see if I was like super allergic because I know I used to be allergic to my best friend's dog.

295
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:30,000
But he was super furry and fluffy. So I felt like if I were around dogs that weren't like that, then maybe I could keep one.

296
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:43,000
So I ended up getting one and I I didn't think I could be happier, but I was actually I got happier after I got a dog and it was bizarre.

297
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
That's huge. It is.

298
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:54,000
It is a crazy feeling. I mean, every time I left the house, I couldn't wait to get back when I when I wanted to see him.

299
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:04,000
I named him Spaz Dude because he's kind of spazzy and I kept finding myself be like, why are you such a spaz, dude?

300
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Or like he like come sit on me, like on my lap. And he's like 60 pounds.

301
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:16,000
He's like, I'm like, dude, spaz, stop it. So it's a lot of dude and spaz.

302
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:24,000
So that's what he turned out like. But now he's with a friend on a farm, which is happy.

303
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
That's a pretty great life to you, right? Yeah, it is for a dog.

304
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:36,000
I want to dive in a little bit more into that, like you're growing your happiness quotient because it sounds like that's an amazing thing.

305
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,000
And what is it about a dog that really did that for you?

306
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:50,000
They instantly put a smile on your face. So I think if you smile more, you definitely you're happier for sure.

307
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Yeah, you feel it. They just have this like this dog in particular spaz dude has this energy where it's just like, I am so excited to see you.

308
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
I've been waiting all day for you. Tail wagging, right?

309
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Yeah, I can't wait to tell you about all the things I did today, but I can't talk. So I'm not gonna so I'm just going to wag my tail.

310
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:16,000
And it's just like they look at you like they love you. And it's just so cute.

311
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:24,000
It's like cuteness all the time. Every single thing they do is cute. And you can't do that with cats for some reason.

312
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Well, I want to disagree with you. Does everything your cat does. Is that cute?

313
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Well, I have two cats actually. So it's double cuteness. Okay. We didn't have pets when I was growing up. So it was something I had to learn to love, I guess.

314
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:57,000
And so I had a bunch of wild, crazy, amazing experiences with some previous partners of mine, like I've fostered squirrels and guinea pigs and rats and all sorts of things, which I don't think I would have done on my own.

315
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:02,000
But someone helped me kind of, you know, pushed me a little bit to have those experiences.

316
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:15,000
You know, fast forward and now I have two wonderful cats, Cosmo and Emmett, and they entertain me every single day, like, all the time, constantly.

317
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
What do they do?

318
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:31,000
What don't they do? I would say in many ways, some people have described my cats actually like not quite other cats, that they're quite different, which I don't know, I've only ever had two cats.

319
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Some also refer to them as gangsters, but that's a different story.

320
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:58,000
But they are always like, they're extremely affectionate towards me. I work from home, right? So I'm, I'm often home. And so I'll be working on my laptop, and they'll just be with me in a way that, like you said, just increases my well being of myself and my happiness and just makes me feel not quite alone, even though I work alone, you know,

321
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:11,000
it's had a major impact on my overall happiness, I would say even just having someone at home constantly. So you come home and there's this energy that they provide that's like nothing else, right?

322
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:16,000
And with dogs, because I've experienced friends, dogs and partners, dogs and things like that.

323
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Dogs bring that to a whole other level where they're just like, Oh my god, you're home. Oh my god, let's go for a walk.

324
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Like they, they, it's like nothing else. So there's some people who haven't yet had that pet experience, but that really close bond that you build when you actually live with one.

325
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:38,000
And I find that they don't quite get it. But it's something I hope that everybody can experience.

326
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Yeah, I think if you're if you don't have allergies, and you have the energy, if you're trying to increase your happiness, getting a pet is step number one.

327
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I know it's a very big step, but but there's this way that like, they force you to have routine, which I think is really good for all of us.

328
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:10,000
And they also, as you know, force you to get outside, right, even when it's snowing, or even when it's pouring or whatever, you gotta kind of do something for them, which, in turn, increases the benefits for you, right?

329
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:15,000
It's like this wonderful symbiotic relationship. Yeah, everything about having a dog is amazing.

330
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:26,000
So I would imagine you don't ever see yourself not having a dog in your life, then I I probably won't be dogless for a while, especially living on my house with my sister.

331
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:31,000
So I can't really like, just get up and leave. And there's always going to be a pet there no matter what.

332
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Yeah, it's amazing. It sounds like you can both share it too. Oh, but you want to know why there's no cats anymore. Oh, please tell me.

333
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:51,000
I had this little cat Snickers, and she's just so adorable. She's just such an adventurous little cat and thought she could be fine hanging out in the neighborhood, you know, just out outdoors all day.

334
00:37:51,000 --> 00:38:04,000
So her and my sister's husband's cat were outside. And over the period of two days, both of them got snatched by hawks. What? Yeah.

335
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:12,000
And I was looking on there's this app called next door. It's like Facebook, but for neighborhoods and less drama.

336
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:27,000
But it's just neighbors talking about things that have happened. But this woman on next door, when I went to go post that my cat was missing, the first post on there was my little white dog just got dropped by a hawk.

337
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Oh, my goodness. She like went out there screaming after it and it dropped. They dropped the dog.

338
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:40,000
But after I saw that, I was like, I don't even know if I should put up missing posters.

339
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Like, should I even post that the cats are missing because they're clearly dead and they were food. And that is sad.

340
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Oh, man. I decided not to get another cat because I don't like litter boxes anymore. For one, I never liked them to begin with. I just think it's gross.

341
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:06,000
And like, I can't stay on top of it, you know. So I decided not to get another one. And that's that is also another reason the dog came in.

342
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:19,000
But yeah, that was that was pretty sad losing both cats. But I wasn't like shaken about it. I'm like more devastated that my dog is at the farm, even though he's alive.

343
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:26,000
More devastated that he's there, which is sad. But I don't know. They just dogs and cats are different.

344
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
So it sounds like you were a cat person and you're switching a little bit.

345
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Yeah, totally.

346
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:37,000
I always try to say, no, no, you can be both. But you might be proving me wrong here.

347
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Yeah, they're definitely different feelings.

348
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Crazy. For me, it's it's really it's really the emotional connection that makes all the difference.

349
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:54,000
My cats have also saved my life once, which is a story in itself.

350
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Tell me about it.

351
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Okay, here we go. So I first got my cats when I was living in a tiny little sort of a tiny cabin basically on the on the side of Lake Ontario.

352
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:18,000
I was living in a winery on a winery and they had this little cabin, which is kind of an amazing thing.

353
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:30,000
And so I got my cats there. It's just this little tiny place, which is pretty, pretty rustic and but has all the you know, everything you need, like a wood stove and stuff like that.

354
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:36,000
So I had my boys for a few, maybe a month up to that point. And it was November at this time and it gets pretty cold.

355
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:43,000
So this thing wasn't insulated. You could see right through the cracks in the floor and and they love that because they would always like get whatever.

356
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:51,000
I don't know. It was always a game, right? They'd get bugs and stuff. But this was like wood stove season and that was one of the main heating sources in this place.

357
00:40:51,000 --> 00:41:00,000
So so I had just helped them reconstruct this this wood stove. So it was kind of new piping and stuff like that.

358
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:12,000
So I had had many fires in it previously, but this one particular night it was super cold and I was thinking, okay, I'm going to I'm going to really put a lot of wood in this thing and get it going so that it lasts sort of all night.

359
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:19,000
And what ended up happening was put a bunch of wood in like I had done the last like 10 nights, no, no big deal.

360
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:28,000
This time I had put a little bit extra, which seemed fine. And went to bed with my partner and it was like any other day.

361
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:41,000
And then sort of got woken up in what felt like the middle of the night by both of my cats running like crazy circling all around us on our bed like wake up, wake up, wake up.

362
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:48,000
And so I opened my eyes and I'm thinking my first thought is like, geez, what is happening? Like this is such an uncomfortable feeling open my eyes.

363
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:57,000
And I can't see a thing because the entire cabin is filled with smoke. Then clearly it's like panic, right?

364
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:04,000
So we grabbed the cats and we got out of there. Luckily there was a neighbor we can hang out at and made sure everything was safe.

365
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Nothing was on fire, which is great. So that was the first number one thing. But it turned out so I went back the next day to kind of experiment a little bit and see what the heck went wrong basically.

366
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:30,000
And so it turned out that the new stovepipes, I don't know for whatever reason had because I had the temperature really hot in there, the stovepipes, the paint on the outside of them was like, I don't know, curing or something.

367
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:37,000
But the paint on the outside of the stovepipe was smoking. And so it wasn't that smoke was getting in the room from the fire.

368
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:44,000
It's that it was getting so hot that that paint was kind of, I don't know, doing something maybe that it wasn't supposed to.

369
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:51,000
And the crazy thing about that is that so I made this huge fire the next day to figure this out and the smoke alarms went off.

370
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:57,000
And I was like, what the heck? Like, how come the smoke alarms didn't go off the night before when we needed them to?

371
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Yeah, that's crazy. Yeah, it was a crazy situation. And it just made me like, unbelievably grateful for both of my cats.

372
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Well, you could say potentially saving my life. Right. And so ended up fixing that problem. And it was totally fine after that. But kind of a crazy situation.

373
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:29,000
That is crazy. My house burnt down when I was 16. What? No, I was 14, actually. To the ground was crazy.

374
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:39,000
That does not sound good. Yeah, we had to start all over. That was a crazy time. That's like most people's nightmare.

375
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:51,000
What what did that feel like as a you said 14 right 14 year old, I cried a lot. But you realize that stuff when stuff is all you lose.

376
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:59,000
It's not that big of a deal because one insurance and to like some of the photos were salvageable.

377
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:09,000
So I think that's the only the only things that really matter were the people in the photos. So got all that out. So that was good.

378
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:14,000
The people in the memory is right. That's. Yeah, that's such an important perspective, right?

379
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:21,000
It's like all of these things around us are they don't they don't make us and they don't really define us in any way. Right.

380
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:29,000
It's really the people you're with and and those experiences that you create with those people. That's the stuff that really matters. Yeah. Wow.

381
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:40,000
What an experience for you. That's crazy. I wanted to ask you where you would like to send people if they want to get connected with you.

382
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Probably Twitter at social happiness is my handle. That's where I like to spend my time.

383
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Actually wake up to Twitter every single day and watch like a series of cat videos.

384
00:44:53,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Check up on some of my favorite chick developers who say really funny stuff and see what podcasts are out that day.

385
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:10,000
So tell me about some of those developers. Like obviously you wear a lot of pink, which I think you do a because you like it.

386
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:18,000
But also I think because it attracts a lot of attention in a positive way, like in that this is who I am and I'm going to celebrate it.

387
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:27,000
I feel like you're really, really good at that. But what I've also noticed is that like you're a huge proponent of inclusivity for a bunch of people, women especially in tech.

388
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:33,000
And it feels like, OK, if you integrate that into your every morning and your Twitter feed, that must be a really powerful thing.

389
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:42,000
So can you can you tell me a little bit about that? Exactly. So I like fill my mornings with happiness and power. So definitely start with the kitties and stuff.

390
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:51,000
And then like women developers. OK, I'm a fangirl. OK, they don't know me. I've never had like one on one conversations with these chicks.

391
00:45:51,000 --> 00:46:00,000
So this is probably weird, but they'll say something like how they accomplish something that someone told them that they couldn't.

392
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Or some man said something dumb and this is how they got through it. I love hearing those stories because women are so scared to talk about that stuff.

393
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:20,000
But the ones that aren't you can tell are like the successful, powerful, happy ones. And they're not doing it to complain.

394
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:27,000
They're doing it to bring awareness. So I really like filling my day with that.

395
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:38,000
And I I see them as powerful women and that gives me power. And then I get in my car and play Taylor Swift and I feel even more powerful.

396
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:49,000
It's like my day is just starting off with so much happy, so much powerful energy that it just helps me ride out the day with the same kind of energy.

397
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,000
It sounds like a beautiful routine for you. Yeah.

398
00:46:52,000 --> 00:47:00,000
It feels to me like such a shame in many ways that we still have to have this conversation in some ways.

399
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Right. Like what you're saying is is such a beautiful thing. It's like people going and breaking down barriers.

400
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:15,000
But it feels to me like that those barriers still exist is incredibly shameful in many ways for our society.

401
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,000
It is. How have we not figured that out yet?

402
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:41,000
But, you know, I think with I'm probably going to be hated for saying this, but I think with people like Richard Stallman and there's some other like software developers and infosec world who are getting called out or taken out of positions of leadership when they're exhibiting this type of behavior.

403
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:47,000
And I think that that is one thing contributing to why women are speaking up more.

404
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:57,000
I know I'm more comfortable ranting about what some dude said to me last week because it's unacceptable for most people.

405
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:10,000
I think it's a very small percentage left that like goes by the ideals of those people that were in leadership that shared that stuff with the masses that that shouldn't have.

406
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:19,000
They created this subconscious bias in men that women aren't as good as them, which is bullshit. Right. Yeah, it sucks.

407
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:25,000
And you can see that with, you know, pay gaps, the way men talk to women.

408
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:38,000
One of the most common things that men say to show you that they have this subconscious bias is can you ask one of your engineers and then the rest of the question?

409
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Oh, really? Yeah. So women hate this. Absolutely hate it.

410
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Because one, you're assuming the skill level right out the door.

411
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Like, there's there's no reason to preface a question like that. Just ask the damn question.

412
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:01,000
You know, because putting the question like that is only going to make me type really hard.

413
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Slap the desk rant for a little bit to my coworkers and then respond. So you're getting a delayed response.

414
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:15,000
You're getting a half ass response and you're going to get told now.

415
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Now I feel like I can tell you. So the other day this happened. This was in Telegram.

416
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:34,000
So I saw a couple of posts of this this week on Twitter, but it happened to me personally in Telegram earlier this week when someone said, can you ask one of your engineers?

417
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:40,000
And then he asked a question about Corbett. And I knew the answer.

418
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:51,000
I but I got so mad I didn't want to answer. I was like, so I so I just said in the chat room is public chat in the System 76 fan club.

419
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:56,000
I said, you know, just just to note, try to make it a teachable moment.

420
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:04,000
I said, me and maybe every other woman in tech really don't appreciate phrases like, can you ask your engineers this?

421
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:17,000
And it kind of started something that I think was negative. I was trying to, like, show him, you know, I know you didn't intend to, but this is what that phrase does to women.

422
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:21,000
And then another woman chimed in and she she agreed with me.

423
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:34,000
But then he comes back. So he he apologizes a couple of times and he comes back and he says he says, I think the problem is that you assumed I was saying it in a sexist way.

424
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:43,000
And instead of me, instead of him being the problem for saying it, she turned it around to me, assuming that he was sexist.

425
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Well, I think the reality is that it's it's both. And what I mean by that is like that there's these such ingrained sort of sexist ideas in everyone that are subconscious.

426
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:02,000
And so when someone says something like that, they may not think that that was their intention on the forefront.

427
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:06,000
But there's these undertones of it that they're maybe not even picking up themselves when they say something like that.

428
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:15,000
And then so I feel like that's a real opportunity to reflect and say, oh, wait, like maybe I did mean something like that, but not even consciously.

429
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Right. And so it's a moment like you saying it's a teaching moment or a reflection moment to say, like, OK, well, how could I have approached that a little bit differently and not got these people's hairs up?

430
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Right. Because, yeah, it really pays to be empathetic and sensitive for sure.

431
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Yeah. And I wanted the whole thing. I didn't wasn't trying to like start anything. I just really wanted to bring that awareness.

432
00:51:39,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Yeah. So I think I hope people understand that when I speak up about stuff that happens, that that is my only intention is to is to try to make it a teachable moment because I think people just don't know what they say is wrong because they've been surrounded by dudes for the past 20 years.

433
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:15,000
And, you know, they're used to stuff like that. But you do have to watch what you say when you're assuming people's skill levels, when they are women, because we already feel less, you know, less than everybody.

434
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:29,000
And it's not that it's not that positive. So I think just a couple more a couple seconds thinking about how you say things would definitely improve and make women feel a little more inclusive.

435
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:39,000
But that can you ask your engineer's question? Like, I know that that happens to women every day all over the world. So don't do it, dudes.

436
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:52,000
If you're listening, don't ever start a question like that, please. Unless you want me to hit my keyboard and rant about you and then tell you off on the Internet, because I will and I have to.

437
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,000
It's my duty.

438
00:52:55,000 --> 00:53:04,000
That connects to something I put to you. And so I wanted to ask you if you had an ask of the community. And I wonder if maybe it's connected to this.

439
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Yeah, totally. I really think that we have an opportunity now to put leadership into a position where they trickle down positivity and inclusive inclusiveness for minorities and women.

440
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:42,000
So I think it's important if anyone is an influencer or leadership position to make happiness a priority for people that they interact with and to make any woman that they encounter feel comfortable and excited to be part of tech.

441
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Yeah, that's huge. And I feel like so many of us are also quite eccentric in many ways. Right. And sort of like the super fan event that you're doing next week.

442
00:53:52,000 --> 00:54:03,000
It's like to celebrate those things that make us different because everyone's strengths combined together to make a really powerful community for sure. So I love that.

443
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Yeah. Like, don't don't get mad that we're on your team. Get excited on what we can bring to the team.

444
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Yeah, absolutely. And, Emma, if if you had to define happiness, then in that context, how would you how would you put that?

445
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:26,000
That's a tough one. It's really hard to define happiness because I'm still I feel like I'm on a lifelong mission to find it.

446
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:45,000
And I keep thinking that I found it, but then I find something else that makes me even happier. So I think anything that really encourages a positive reaction or smiles from whoever you're interacting with, I think is is a good start.

447
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Just making people feel included, wanted, excited and confident about their work so that they'll keep doing what they want to do.

448
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:00,000
That's amazing. I love that definition. That's pretty good for a happiness expert to share that.

449
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:11,000
So, Emma, thank you so much for chatting with me and for taking the time to sit with me and laugh about all this stuff and share a lot of your thoughts and your pinball experiences.

450
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:18,000
I'm really looking forward to hearing about how the super fans event goes. That sounds pretty amazing.

451
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Yes, I can't I want to come on and tell you stories about it because there's always tons of stories afterwards.

452
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Great. That would be fantastic. Yeah, that would be super great. So once again, thank you so much.

453
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:53,000
This has been such a treat for me and I hope we get to chat again soon.
