1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Well, hello, everyone. Welcome to Brunch with Brent. I'm Brent Gervais and joining me today,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,400
I'm very excited, is Philip Muller. Philip, how are you doing?

3
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,640
I'm fine. How are you?

4
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:25,200
I'm doing really good. Thanks for joining me. Many will know you from your involvement with

5
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:33,200
Manjaro. For those who haven't heard of Manjaro, could you give us a one to two sentence introduction

6
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,200
to it?

7
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,960
Well, Manjaro is a Linux distribution or an OS where you can have a free operating system

8
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:46,840
with a lot of desktops. So we have the standard Xfce, KDE, and GNOME, and many more in our

9
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:54,400
community like Deepin, E3, MATE, and so on.

10
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,040
Sounds like you have all of them.

11
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,240
Mostly, yes, yeah.

12
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:03,760
Which is no small feat either. It feels like, you know, those are some of the community

13
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:09,440
additions you were mentioning there. And it sounds like there is this really large community

14
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:16,360
around Manjaro that is kind of coming together and making a lot of it happen. I would imagine

15
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,440
for you that feels exciting.

16
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:24,680
Yes, it is exciting because a lot of people are there and we created a tool so everybody

17
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:30,840
can use it and create their own Manjaro edition. So all the official versions are just examples

18
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:37,840
and the examples are so good that we got some momentum there and everybody is liking them

19
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:44,100
and try to put out their own version of Manjaro and we don't hinder them to do that.

20
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:50,240
That's kind of the open source spirit, right? Here are the tools we used and do with them

21
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:56,000
what you will. But it sounds like that is kind of exciting for the community as well

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,280
because there's whichever desktop you would like to use is definitely available as one

23
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,280
example.

24
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,560
Yeah, we have a lot of varieties and some niche stuff like only window managers and

25
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:14,000
people put even their own new creation on our platform cause it's easy to create the

26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,800
base system and then put their own operating system or desktop environment on it. The latest

27
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:27,880
what we have is the Jade desktop, just another desktop by Vitor and he is our homepage creator

28
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:34,880
and he said, hey, when I use HTML and web designs, then I create an own version of Manjaro

29
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:41,600
and use only JavaScript and stuff like that. And boom, we have a new, and I think the last

30
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:48,800
version, which is the first alpha version I did just yesterday, loaded up and he posted

31
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,600
me back a YouTube video about the newest version of Manjaro and he laughed at me and asked

32
00:02:54,600 --> 00:03:01,880
why I, well, he used the old version three years ago from back then and didn't review

33
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:06,560
the new one. So I missed it a little bit.

34
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,360
That's funny. And so if someone wanted to go see that, for instance, where could they

35
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,360
go check that out?

36
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:19,480
Well, they can go to our download page and to the OSDN servers and it's in the community

37
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,360
folder and it's called Jade.

38
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,360
Perfect.

39
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:29,360
It's the desktop, but we have it named as WebDat cause Jade is trademarked, so we cannot

40
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,440
use Jade. So for that reason.

41
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:38,400
Got it. Yeah. The joys of trademarks. I did skip over sort of how important you are to

42
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:45,240
the Manjaro project. As far as I understand, you co-founded it with a few others back in,

43
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:50,320
oh, I don't know, like something like eight or so years ago. Was it in 2012, 2011?

44
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:58,160
It was 2011. It was, yes. It was kind of funny cause I was back then in a different project

45
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:04,800
that was called the Chakra project, which was emerged out of the Kadimod project, which

46
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:11,600
was again an addition of just the KDE packages in split version cause back then Arch Linux

47
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:22,720
didn't had, so it's like the KDE in one package and more or whatever applications there are,

48
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:29,040
they always were packed in this huge tarballs and you had always this issue with getting

49
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:35,280
only one application and we said KD mod would be that modification and we created split

50
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:42,440
packages and it was always the Kadimod game chasing Arch cause whenever they updated library,

51
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,080
we had to repack our packages.

52
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:50,160
Oh my goodness. And that's quite a bit of work for seemingly nothing, right? Like that

53
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,280
was sort of the motivation then?

54
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:57,400
To create the Chakra project cause we said, okay, we can back then take the package bills

55
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:02,600
and create our own base system. Only the package is what we need. So we did a semi-rolling

56
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:10,960
version like a solid base system and put only then our Kadimod packages on our top and it

57
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:21,200
worked I think three years and then the project itself split it up. So one of the female developers

58
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:27,960
created the Chaos project, it was Anke and I was a little bit not with the team anymore

59
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:34,240
and looked for something else and then there was Roland Singer and he has this nice installer

60
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:42,440
for Arch called Manjaro and I said, hey, let's meet up cause I like to see what you guys

61
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:48,800
are up to cause I had a project and it's similar and maybe we find something better to do a

62
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:55,340
thing which might be last longer as just installer. And it was really funny cause he lived two

63
00:05:55,340 --> 00:06:00,960
towns away. So I went in my car, drove over to him and had a cup of coffee with him and

64
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:09,080
talked about it and he said, yes, let's do it. And so it started and yeah, there we are.

65
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:14,820
I think most open source projects don't necessarily start over a cup of coffee. So that actually

66
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:20,880
sounds like a really nice way to go about it. And quite clearly, you both seem to have

67
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:27,600
gotten along and it was just the two of you who kind of were there in the beginning or

68
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,760
was there a bit of a community surrounding you as well?

69
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:36,060
No, we had also one who was doing the artists and the theming, creating wallpapers and stuff.

70
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:41,920
And we had a French teacher who was doing the package manager. So we were four people

71
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:48,560
starting it up and I said, okay, let's do it properly. Get one year dark, really dark.

72
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:54,760
Nobody know what we're doing. And we established all the base systems. And then out of that,

73
00:06:54,760 --> 00:07:00,640
we emerged and said, here is the new version of Manjaro, which is not arch. It's not based

74
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:07,600
on arch. It is just using the packages, but we have our own servers and yeah, it's something

75
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,960
new and you can install it easily.

76
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:17,200
And how does it feel like Manjaro has sort of evolved for you from that beginning year,

77
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,800
for instance, and where it is now?

78
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:27,060
In the beginning, we only focused on one desktop environment, which was Xfce. And then we started

79
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:33,680
to see, okay, Roland liked to have the GNOME desktop, so he was keen to use that. So we

80
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:39,920
added that as well. And since I had the past with the KDE, I said, okay, beside Xfce, I

81
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:46,080
would also do KDE and we had the main editions and we kept them maintained a couple years

82
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,200
ago or so.

83
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,880
And it seems like your team has grown as well. You've got quite a few people on the team's

84
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:56,040
page now and I would imagine lots of community contributions.

85
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:02,040
Exactly. So we have 14 people in the core team and many more as forum moderators. So

86
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:10,200
yeah, a lot of people are joined the project and now we have this new thing called Manjaro

87
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:16,600
Company and with that we will establish the security of the operating system itself. And

88
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:23,640
one of the goals is to employ people out of our community and give them an opportunity

89
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:27,000
to do their hobby as the job if they want to.

90
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,240
That sounds really interesting. Can you tell me a little bit more about the motivation

91
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,240
behind that?

92
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:38,640
Well, it was kind of fun. It started with a large donation of some person and the person

93
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:44,640
came over and asked again and said, hey, let's do it properly. I want to meet you. And then

94
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:51,480
we went over and this person was Clemens Tuners and he said, well, what is needed? And we

95
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:59,280
talked about it and then in September 19 we signed the contracts and from there we went

96
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,560
with the company.

97
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:05,400
And so you are currently holding that CEO position. Is that right?

98
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:11,240
Exactly. So I'm one of the CEOs. The second CEO is Bernard Landauer, who is from Austria.

99
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:18,840
I met him also through the community and he was back then the community manager. And there

100
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:25,920
was a nice thing called with the emails. We got a lot of emails, hey, you have momentum

101
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:31,440
created and we want to create a project with you guys with the hardware. And the funny

102
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:40,720
thing was, we got one time with starlabs, which is an UK company. And the second time

103
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,360
with station x. And we went for the second company because the first company didn't have

104
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:53,920
the homepage. And the CEO of station x was Eddie and Eddie said, okay, let's meet up

105
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:59,920
in person. And we said, yes, why not? And Bernard said, okay, let's go to Salzburg.

106
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:06,260
And in Salzburg, he knew someone who owned the Red Bull area with all the airplanes.

107
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:12,080
So we were there on this. And since we did the research and Eddie was in pilot, so he

108
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:21,200
was really keen that we meet on that airplane. And we did a normal tourist tour. And then

109
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,960
we went over on the roll field, which is not part of the tourist tour and went into the

110
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:33,480
garage and then we showed them how the airplanes get fixed. And it was all this old airplanes

111
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:39,280
with the Spitfire and stuff like that. And our research was really good because his laptops

112
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:44,440
also called the Spitfire because he was a fanatic of old airplanes. And this gave us

113
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:53,160
the deal. So we went over to London and he has an office in London in an old building

114
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:57,960
and also Batchelor Park, the second office. And we went there as well and did some YouTube

115
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:02,040
videos like repairing the Spitfire and stuff like that. Doing a little bit of a tourist

116
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:09,680
tour in the Batchelor Park, drinking a lot of pines with him and had really good fun

117
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:17,320
and released the laptop. The laptop was 1k and back in 2007, as it was, it was too high

118
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:26,200
and we didn't sell as many as we thought. So this project died, but we kept the relationship.

119
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:32,680
And yeah, so recently, Eddie telegrammed me and said, Hey, Philip, I need a laptop, which

120
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:39,800
Mancero laptop you recommend to me and said, let me check with our vendors, which of them

121
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,800
best for you.

122
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,560
And check if there's one that's still called the Spitfire, right?

123
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:51,320
No, I didn't call it the Spitfire in Tuxedo laptops, the same laptop called Infinity Book.

124
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:58,280
And then we got the second time written by Starlabs and we had no time because we weren't

125
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:04,000
involved with Tuxedo. And then the third time is a charm. Starlabs is also one of our vendors.

126
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:11,640
So if you are interesting and keep pushing us and we have the right time, then you might

127
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,280
get a partnership with Mancero.

128
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:18,720
Yeah, it sounds to me like hardware has been a really interesting area lately. I know you've

129
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:24,160
joined us on Linux Unplugged quite a few times in the last several weeks, just talking about

130
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:29,200
some of the updates to hardware that's available there. And I would imagine for the project

131
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:34,720
that probably seems really motivating as well, because not only are you creating software,

132
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,520
but hardware that's so nicely paired with it, and you're creating these relationships

133
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:47,080
as well. Does that feel sort of like a nice round way of approaching open source software

134
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,880
and hardware for you in the project?

135
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:55,360
Well, the operating system itself is always free. And if you wanted to gain some revenue

136
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,080
out of it or something like that, you have to create projects around it. And having a

137
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:07,320
hardware project might help you to get some traction out. And based on the sales, the

138
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:12,920
company earns a little bit. And also the other companies gain more customers because our

139
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:21,840
community is really large. And each partner we look up is have to have the same vibe.

140
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:31,640
So Tuxedo, we met up in a trade show in Chemnitz, north of Germany. And we were actually at

141
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:38,040
the same hotel. And one of my colleagues said, hey, there's a Tuxedo car. And he had his

142
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:42,760
magnet stickers. And he plastered the car full of the magnet stickers. We went the next

143
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:48,240
day to our booth, and then some new person is coming over from Tuxedo and said, hey,

144
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,600
what the heck? Why he plastered our car with the stickers? How we can take them off? We

145
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:58,680
said, hey, they're magnet sticks. Easy going. Enjoy the simplicity. And it was so funny.

146
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:07,640
And that's how we met them. And a year before we met Pine64 in Forstam, also a trade show

147
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:13,240
where everybody you meet there and one of them, Lucas, got ill. And we said, hey, we

148
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:19,720
are a lot of people from Manjaro. And we went there, took over the booth and plastered again,

149
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:27,040
the pine books. It was then the classic one with the Manjaro sticker, go to CEO and gave

150
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:32,520
him a sticker on the t-shirt. And he said, hey, it looks good on me. And he put a sticker

151
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:40,640
of him on my t-shirt. So we had the Manjaro pine 64 t-shirts there. From there we go.

152
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:46,000
The power of stickers. Yeah. It sounds like you know how to have a lot of fun around some

153
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,800
of these relationships. And why not? Right? They don't need to be all serious, but they

154
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:54,340
do lead to some really neat collaborations, it sounds like. Yeah, you have to be special

155
00:14:54,340 --> 00:15:00,840
and to be remembered. So with those little tricks we do there and there, it works out

156
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:06,080
just fine. It sounds to me like that's maybe something you learned in some of your sales

157
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:10,940
experience because I know you did sales for quite a while before starting Manjaro. Can

158
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:16,180
you tell us a little bit about that sort of part of your history? Well, I was a sales

159
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:24,360
manager from Conrad Electronics, which is an electronic store in Germany, has many shops

160
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:29,600
around Germany in the north and the south in the middle of Germany. And I was there

161
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:35,920
a team lead for the telephone department and later on, additionally, for the computer department.

162
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:42,160
So I always was with hardware and doing contracts, talking a lot of people and figuring out what

163
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:47,880
they want and always selling them the right things and selling them additional things

164
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:56,880
as well because that was a policy of the shop. And they go from selling lamps to telephone,

165
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:03,560
mobile phones, some picture frames nobody uses after Christmas and everything else around

166
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:11,760
the Fritz boxes, which is routers and computer as far as parts of computers, laptops, monitors

167
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:18,640
and so on and so on. Everything what is electronic was my thing. And I used also Linux and when

168
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:27,240
I got some money for Christmas, they gave us coupons and we had to use them in the shop.

169
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:33,640
So I bought hardware and every year my hardware stack goes up and up and I didn't know what

170
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:41,120
I should put on them. So I choose Linux and did my projects there. So was that your like

171
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:46,000
around that timeline? Was that your first introduction to really using or getting familiar

172
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,760
with Linux? No, it was pretty early because my father has a computer shop. And back in

173
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:57,880
the day, I got the parts and I had to build a computer, install the operating system and

174
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:11,080
do everything. So I had MS-DOS with my games and then Windows 3.1, XP, Millennium, 20,000

175
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:18,680
and so on. And at some point I said, I don't like Windows anymore after I coded my application

176
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:29,520
to rip some DVDs to learn English. And it was really fun because I was coding all the

177
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:36,480
time. And then when my mom was angry and said, Hey, dinner is ready. And it didn't hear the

178
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:46,360
power off. So I had to learn how to do backups. That's one way to learn, isn't it? Thanks mom.

179
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:54,800
And based on that, I always bought the DVDs and I want to have them collected on my media

180
00:17:54,800 --> 00:18:01,960
server. So I had to figure out how to rip them on the hard drive and store them a little

181
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:09,360
bit less compressed, but the same quality. I created a tool which helped me and it was

182
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:15,640
one of those things. I changed also just doing one application when I do the operating system

183
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:20,000
as well. So it sounds like almost a natural progression for you from a relatively young

184
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,040
age sort of playing with hardware and software and that just evolving and evolving and evolving

185
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:32,880
to where you are now, really. Did you ever think you'd be where you are today? No, actually

186
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:40,560
not. I did a lot of things. I did IT support. I did refurbishing, repairing computers and

187
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:48,600
stuff like that. And each station of my area of my life, I learned a little bit something

188
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:54,160
new and all comes together. And now I'm here where I'm doing something totally different

189
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:59,040
than before. It sounds like those evolutions for you these days are really quite exciting

190
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:03,620
because you're getting to sort of meet people from all over the world and collaborate with

191
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:09,580
people from all over. And you know, just our conversation before we hit record here today,

192
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:14,480
you were talking about how you've sort of have your finger on the pulse of some of these

193
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:19,680
sort of hardware companies and the software evolutions that are happening on a daily basis.

194
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:26,360
I would imagine that feels pretty neat and rewarding as well. Yeah, because if you are

195
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:34,200
in the pulse and develop and see what is going on and going with the flow, then you get emails,

196
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:40,480
for example, from Canonical. So Wimpy, Martin Wimpress wrote me, hey, we have this Snapcraft

197
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:48,760
summit in Montreal, and it would be keen to have you there. And I said, Why not? I can

198
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:53,720
ask around in my team if somebody else wants to join as well. And what Wimpy said, Yes,

199
00:19:53,720 --> 00:20:00,320
why not? If you find some, then tell me. And we'll pay everything and we fly you guys over.

200
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:08,280
But no one had time. So I flew over alone. And the goal was to have snaps integrated

201
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:16,600
in Mancharo. And, well, I already had it integrated. And I said, Hey, what about making it full

202
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:24,600
compatible equal to Ubuntu standards. And then I talked with Alan Pope and everybody

203
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:32,120
else there. We had a lot of fun and some pines went around in Montreal, had dinners. And

204
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:38,720
I was one of the persons who had a tuxedo laptop. So I did a little advocating with

205
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:43,580
the hardware we had. And everybody was amazed about the battery life because I was always

206
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:49,760
on. And even when they got their drinks, I was still hacking because I wanted to have

207
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:58,800
the snaps thing done. And in the end, it was integrated and Wimpy and Alan was really off

208
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:05,720
the hook. What only one developer of Mancharo achieved in this week of summit.

209
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:10,480
I'm getting to know some of these really great people around the open source community. Like

210
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:17,880
I did a brunch with Wimpy, with Martin Wimpris. And I also did one with Popey, Alan Pope,

211
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:23,400
as well. And what I'm always amazed with and what I'm hearing from you here is all of these

212
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:30,520
collaborations that are happening amongst projects to really forward everyone's ambitions.

213
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:35,700
And it feels like we are all getting quite far together, especially when those interactions

214
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:41,540
in person are happening. So kudos to you for sort of making that happen and being willing

215
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:45,200
to work with them as well. I think that's super important.

216
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:51,800
I think that the tribal wars, which is still there, is only at the communities and not

217
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:59,440
the companies or projects itself. They are always helping each other. So if you see what's

218
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:05,960
pine 64 community does, there are several groups trying to get the pine phone ready.

219
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:11,680
But everybody else has a telegram chat and everybody is there and help each other. Here's

220
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:18,560
a kernel bug and I fix it already take that patch and then it will also a new distribution.

221
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:25,280
Other guys do the UI and put other stuffs together. So in the end, everybody's helping

222
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:32,680
and this is also seen by canonical and other projects. I already met in person. And also

223
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:41,120
calamari is one of the installer we use on our end. There is Adrian and last foster.

224
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:49,440
I missed him. He was in the same pub, only two desks away. I didn't have time to change

225
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:57,240
desks because it was interesting discussions on my desk. And last foster, which was this

226
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:03,800
year, I met him in person and we connected there as well. And yeah, so it's always good

227
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:11,280
to see a person in person cause if you only see an online, then the connection is not

228
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:18,760
as solid. And if you meet them and drink with them, talk with them, chat with them in person,

229
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:23,800
you make a really strong bond, which is long lasting and everybody understands you better

230
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:28,680
as just texting and writing costs, lost in translation, stuff like that.

231
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:33,100
Of course. And I would imagine with so many different languages, people collaborating

232
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:38,880
in different countries, different continents, that sometimes it's nice to meet in person

233
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:44,400
and to share some of those cultural differences too. I know that's some of what happened the

234
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:50,080
last time I was with wimpy and poppy. We just laugh about all the differences, but that's

235
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:56,920
such a nice way to connect and to then bring those in person relationships to, you know,

236
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:03,200
the next four months of collaborations that you do online and through code and through

237
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:09,880
chat. So that feels, I would imagine, especially important these days, considering many of

238
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:15,720
us can't meet in person, but we will soon. So it sounds like those relationships, those

239
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,640
investments that you've made in the past are really paying off.

240
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:27,240
Yeah, you always have to be keen to keep the connections ongoing cause if you, if you stop

241
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:33,840
them, maybe they will break up. But if you're one of the persons who's always on the buzzer,

242
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:39,520
always following everything, keep in touch with them, then it's good. And they will help

243
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:44,840
you as well and say, Hey, we have this new release. Did you test it already out? Or as

244
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:49,960
we mentioned in the summit, you had these and that problems. We already fixed it. Here's

245
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:54,380
the patch. Can you check it to double check it? And if everything is fine, we will give

246
00:24:54,380 --> 00:25:01,040
it to the new release. So those kinds of corporations only get established if you have meet them

247
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,800
in person or at least did a video chat.

248
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:09,780
Because I know how you're a bit of a person who looks forward. You were mentioning how

249
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:15,140
you, you tend to look to the next five years and be a little bit maybe visionary or at

250
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:19,160
least try to place your mind in the future to see what's possible. And I'm just curious

251
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:25,560
if some of those collaborations help you point in the same direction as some other projects,

252
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:29,280
not in a sort of, uh, well, more in a collaborative way, I suppose.

253
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:34,880
Well, if you not look into the future or what the future might be, you never changed the

254
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:39,920
future cause then why should you change it when everything what is now is perfect for

255
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:47,760
you. And it's always a lack of vision in the future to see what can be done or what might

256
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:55,840
have been done the better way. And we also learn from things we did in the past and maybe

257
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:03,020
stuff will be more simplified as them now. And this is one of our things we do at Mancharo.

258
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:09,480
So keep the tools open, keep them easy so everybody else can use them. And if there's

259
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:14,880
a person said, Hey, why not do this? It's much more easier as the things you did in

260
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:21,760
the past, then we will adopt and take the better things. And in the end, it is what

261
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:27,640
it is. The operating system is there and we want that more people will use it.

262
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:33,200
And are there some things that you have your eye on in the next five years that are kind

263
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:38,680
of exciting you some, some things you maybe are your, your projects that really kind of

264
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,680
get you inspired?

265
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:45,280
Well, I think that the current project, which is really inspiring me is the pine phone.

266
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:51,900
So we have now the opportunity to have a hardware which is open and everybody can hack on it.

267
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:57,840
It's not restricted like you have an Android base and then you have to put your stuff on

268
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:05,680
top of it. You can really use the hardware as is and use it like a normal PC and just

269
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:12,920
plug stuff in, get it started and work with it. And just the first thing I think will

270
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:18,160
help the whole open source community to get things also in small form factors.

271
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:23,920
I can remember myself five years ago, imagining that this should be possible and that we should

272
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:29,740
have this as an option. And at first I was a little disappointed that it took this long

273
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:37,760
and yet it's still so exciting and it feels like there's some real momentum and lots of

274
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:44,520
collaborations with different projects making it happen. So I could see why, you know, quite

275
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:49,520
a bit of effort is going into it because it's a game changer that we really need. At least

276
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,520
that's how I feel.

277
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:56,580
Yeah, especially because the things are now everybody is starting to track you. And if

278
00:27:56,580 --> 00:28:01,600
you have a Linux phone, this is not happening because you are the king of the software as

279
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:08,960
well and don't have to relate on big companies and you can verify everything what's happened

280
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:15,880
on the devices and having the network with all the projects. One project is better to

281
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:22,360
do applications, the other project is better to do the base UI and other projects doing

282
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:27,640
better with the base system like kernel and libraries and stuff like that. And if you

283
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:35,480
put everything together, then you have this Linux phone which is working and only small

284
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:44,080
things, the distributions change will make it attractive to the community. But overall

285
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,320
you use the same base.

286
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:52,740
You know, I'm not a developer, but I'm certainly a deep user and it excites me to no end to

287
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:56,880
know the possibilities that might come in the next five years around these kinds of

288
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,880
projects.

289
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:04,400
Yeah, but you don't have to be a developer. You can also join projects like you just translating

290
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:10,640
stuff or what you do talking about the Linux community or about the trend is coming on

291
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:15,960
or you want to translate stuff. So there is no need to be the developer itself. It's only

292
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:21,480
one part of the community and there are a lot of other things you can do to help open

293
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:27,280
source. Even if you're a singer or just an artist and provide a wallpaper, same thing.

294
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:33,200
You know, I'm so glad you said that. And it's a theme that comes up relatively often during

295
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:38,880
these conversations is that yes, yes, yes, the developers are great, but so too are the

296
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:44,040
designers and so too are the translators and so too are the community managers and so too

297
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:49,440
are all of the people who kind of collaborate to make this big open source city that we

298
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:56,040
have run as it does. So thank you for mentioning that again. I think that's super important.

299
00:29:56,040 --> 00:30:01,280
You can be the expert on everything. So you have to have experts around you to help you

300
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:09,760
to be the collective mind and then you can fight against Goliath.

301
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:16,920
You did mention a little bit of privacy stuff earlier around the phone. I'm curious about

302
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:22,640
where that sits for you. It's certainly a topic that I feel quite deeply about, but

303
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:29,860
I don't find necessarily comes up as often as it should. Can you give me a sense of sort

304
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:36,320
of what motivates you there? And also, I know it may be a little bit of a difference in

305
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:42,280
Europe versus North America, just culturally around how important privacy feels.

306
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:46,960
Well, I think the stickers on the webcam on your laptop is a common thing all over the

307
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:54,800
world. And it's good to see that open source hardware have those kill switches for the

308
00:30:54,800 --> 00:31:00,720
pine phone, you have to open up the battery pack and under there you have some switches.

309
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:10,040
And those you find also on the pine phone on Pinebook. And when we delivered the Pinebook

310
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:17,960
Pro, we forgot to deactivate the kill switch for the VLAN. So everybody has to activate

311
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:24,120
the Wi-Fi to get Wi-Fi. Right, right. No, we wanted to be secure. So that's a sort of

312
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:31,360
teaching mistake. But it forces, I guess, an education around that we've figured out

313
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:39,720
pretty well, because some users posted, Hey, there's no Wi-Fi. And we said, Yeah, we tested

314
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:46,040
it was on the Wi-Fi. Okay, you know, and then pine 64. And as opposed to Hey, you have to

315
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:50,720
do this switch and this keyboard combination, and then you have Wi-Fi.

316
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:55,040
So that's on the hardware side of things. But how does it touch you sort of on the data

317
00:31:55,040 --> 00:32:01,480
side of things? And you know, all the services that are being offered these days, and just

318
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:07,480
sort of hoovering up all of this personal stuff? How does that sit with you? And where

319
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,640
do you feel like we should be going?

320
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:15,840
And always depends how collective you are with your own daughter. Some people say, Hey,

321
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:22,040
it doesn't matter if the government or companies earn money with my daughter, others say I

322
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:28,120
know data at all, because I'm a private person, why should my daughter be free for everybody

323
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:34,160
when I browse the net. So that's why Linux creates some projects like the p Hall was

324
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:42,200
a Raspberry Pi, which will direct everything to DevNow. And then Amazon and Google can

325
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:46,640
search DevNow for all the data, which is they're not anymore.

326
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,040
They'll find quite a lot in there, I think,

327
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:55,480
if we have an open source operating system, you can decide yourself how far you want to

328
00:32:55,480 --> 00:33:00,960
give your data away or not. And this is not given with Android and Apple phones anymore.

329
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:06,980
I hope there's a day in the near future where that's the default for most people. But I'm

330
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:12,840
unfortunately a little skeptical and not convinced. But I sure am glad we're headed that way,

331
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,800
at least for some of our devices.

332
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:20,740
Well, the phone, I don't think it will be soon. The one and only phone you have to use

333
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:26,160
if you have online banking, you might need to steal an Android phone because the banks

334
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:31,040
is really complicated to get them on board on a Linux phone. So of course, you have to

335
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:39,760
have a standard. That's why Canonical is trying to get snaps out there. And Fedora over Gnome

336
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:46,240
wants to spit out the Flatpak. So we have two systems and we will see if both of them

337
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:53,120
have good, good ways. And if we see some banking applications, either on Flatpak or snaps,

338
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:58,360
then maybe, you know, that's fascinating to me. I had never realized that that was a problem

339
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:04,360
that some of these package standards could solve. But of course, it makes it easier for

340
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:10,720
the banks to sort of roll out that software in one place. And hopefully, it can be fairly

341
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:15,760
smooth and fairly quickly. But just occurred to me, like, thank you for sharing how those

342
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:21,600
are, that's just an example of some of the problems that we are trying to deal with.

343
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:26,920
And everybody, well, most of us are doing some banking, right? So these are the hurdles

344
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,920
we have to go over.

345
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:32,240
Yeah, you can create a lot of applications like video player, audio player and stuff

346
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:37,160
like that. But if you have a key application, which is banking, you have a hurdle and you

347
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:41,840
have to take that hurdle. And if you say, Okay, Linux distributions, how many are there

348
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:48,600
200? And there is no standard and the bank director says, What the heck is Linux doesn't

349
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:56,400
work. And if you say there is two versions, and there are companies behind them, and they

350
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:02,280
help you to get your application even packaged for that. And if you get involved and call

351
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:08,400
right with them, then you get the software in it. And that's how it goes. But you have

352
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:14,960
to have persons out there talking to them and say, Hey, this software would be nice

353
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:22,400
to have on Linux over and I really don't understand why people hate snaps and flat packs so much.

354
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:27,080
Because there are so many distributions and we need a standard and the standard in Linux

355
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,320
is not given yet.

356
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:34,120
It sounds a little bit like I'm hearing your your sales voice there again, you know, going

357
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:38,840
to see some of these companies and creating collaborations is a sales process. I know

358
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:43,080
it might not be a monetary one, but it's a really important one to build those relationships

359
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:51,680
and build that trust moving forward so that we can make this possible. So I really appreciate

360
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,680
that perspective.

361
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,840
Exactly. Yeah.

362
00:35:53,840 --> 00:36:02,680
One question I have for you that's come to mind for me in the last week is around development,

363
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:08,760
specifically and how open source is a combination of so many different types of development,

364
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:16,080
but I'm interested in your perspective on paid developers who work on open source versus

365
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:22,880
unpaid developers. And do you have a sense of sort of where that is, where the trouble

366
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:28,920
is with that, where you'd like it to be, how to make it sustainable, etc. It just feels

367
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:34,760
like one of those things that we need to make sure exists. And so how do we take care of

368
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,760
everyone?

369
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:44,580
Well, if you start in Linux, around this Linux open source platform, you have the problem

370
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:50,800
that operating systems and stuff you cannot sell. So you have to have something around

371
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:55,840
it or you have some supporters which say, hey, I support you, what are you doing? If

372
00:36:55,840 --> 00:37:01,920
you concentrate on the operating system because I'm using it, then I pay you the money for

373
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:10,960
that. And based on that, we can go on and make this company and employ people. So that's

374
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:18,080
how we do it on our end. And sure, community developers are given and they do it in the

375
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:24,800
spare time. And some of them do that for fun, because that's a hobby, and it will still

376
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:31,520
be the hobby. And others say, Okay, if there's opportunity to make the hobby a real job,

377
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,520
then why not?

378
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:40,040
Mm hmm. Yeah, I hope we can all sort of support those who do such good work. I think that's

379
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:47,000
really important. Philip, if there was something that you'd like to ask of the community, something

380
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:52,500
you'd like them to go see experience, and maybe something you'd like them to think about,

381
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,760
what would you put out there?

382
00:37:53,760 --> 00:38:00,880
Well, if you're interested in open source, then look not at the big projects like KDE

383
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:06,680
and Nome and all the out there. And there are little projects as well, which might help

384
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:15,120
you to understand how open source works cause less people less problems. And if you see

385
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:21,880
a bug tracker in GitHub, and you have a solution for it, simply start provide a patch and merge

386
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:29,320
request. And with that, you can get you started as a open source developer. And if you have

387
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:36,720
the opportunity to join a company out of that, then you will be paid developer doing open

388
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:45,160
source. So many ways and little projects like if XFC and others which are in need of developers,

389
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,560
might will thank you to join them.

390
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:54,200
Start small and grow. Sounds like a nice trajectory. If people wanted to get in contact with you,

391
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,200
where would they reach you?

392
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:01,680
They can write me an email, go to the forums, ping me there, write me a PM. Look at me at

393
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:05,560
telegram. I have many ways to contact me.

394
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:11,080
Great. And we'll certainly link to those. Philip, thank you so much for joining me today.

395
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:15,440
I really appreciate your time. And I definitely learned a lot. So thank you.

396
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:28,080
You're welcome. No problem.
