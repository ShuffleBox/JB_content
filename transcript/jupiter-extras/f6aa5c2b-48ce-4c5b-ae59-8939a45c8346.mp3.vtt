WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:11.460
Well, hello, everyone.

00:11.460 --> 00:14.660
I'm delighted to say that joining me today

00:14.660 --> 00:16.340
is Quentin Stafford-Frasier.

00:16.340 --> 00:17.820
Quentin, how are you?

00:17.820 --> 00:19.540
I am well, thank you.

00:19.540 --> 00:22.280
I'm smiling already because we had such a good time last week

00:22.280 --> 00:24.500
when we connected just to kind of get to know each other

00:24.500 --> 00:26.940
and spend quite a lot of time having a great conversation.

00:26.940 --> 00:28.820
So today we get to record it.

00:28.820 --> 00:31.720
Quentin is a lot of things.

00:31.720 --> 00:34.640
I was very impressed by, you have

00:34.640 --> 00:36.580
a little description of the things

00:36.580 --> 00:38.200
you've done in the past on your website.

00:38.200 --> 00:40.880
And it goes on and on and on and on.

00:40.880 --> 00:44.480
And I thought as a nice bit of context,

00:44.480 --> 00:47.180
it would be great to read a little bit of that.

00:47.180 --> 00:49.920
I did cut it up a little bit just for brevity.

00:49.920 --> 00:52.840
I thought that might be an interesting way to just give

00:52.840 --> 00:56.800
a broad sense of where you've been and where you're going.

00:56.800 --> 00:58.720
Yeah, I'm sure you shouldn't believe everything

00:58.720 --> 01:00.220
you read on the web, but yeah.

01:00.220 --> 01:00.880
No, no, no.

01:00.880 --> 01:02.920
That's why I'm going to ask you specifically about them.

01:02.920 --> 01:04.960
But I thought that might be a fun way to do it.

01:04.960 --> 01:06.040
So here we go.

01:06.040 --> 01:08.800
So from your website, here's what I read.

01:08.800 --> 01:11.840
It says, I'm a computer scientist, entrepreneur,

01:11.840 --> 01:15.160
part-time academic, full-time gadget enthusiast

01:15.160 --> 01:18.600
based in Cambridge, CEO of a small company called Telemark,

01:18.600 --> 01:21.340
which does a mix of software development, tech consultancy,

01:21.340 --> 01:24.940
photography, video production, teaching, and writing.

01:24.940 --> 01:27.960
That alone has a lot to it, right, Quentin?

01:27.960 --> 01:30.760
Well, I will come back to some of that.

01:30.760 --> 01:31.840
Oh, I will, certainly.

01:31.840 --> 01:32.640
However, it goes on.

01:32.640 --> 01:33.320
And here we go.

01:33.320 --> 01:34.680
For the past few years, I've also

01:34.680 --> 01:37.440
held a part-time research post at Cambridge University's

01:37.440 --> 01:40.460
computer lab, currently helping to organize the lab's

01:40.460 --> 01:43.440
interactions with industry and with its alumni

01:43.440 --> 01:45.880
and its audio-video output.

01:45.880 --> 01:48.480
Previously, I was working on the Endeavor project,

01:48.480 --> 01:50.740
exploring how computer vision and machine learning

01:50.740 --> 01:53.600
can improve the experiences of car drivers.

01:53.600 --> 01:57.120
I recently served as the interim director of engineering

01:57.120 --> 01:59.280
at the Digital Catapult while they

01:59.280 --> 02:01.680
searched for a permanent full-time appointee.

02:01.680 --> 02:03.440
I have often been credited in the media

02:03.440 --> 02:05.520
with inventing the webcam.

02:05.520 --> 02:08.200
This I will certainly ask you about,

02:08.200 --> 02:10.440
because you say, this is not entirely justified,

02:10.440 --> 02:12.800
though I certainly did have something to do with it.

02:12.800 --> 02:14.840
And so I'll touch on that in a sec.

02:14.840 --> 02:17.640
I've also become rather fond of home automation,

02:17.640 --> 02:19.680
connecting almost everything in my home

02:19.680 --> 02:22.320
up through the amazing Home Assistant.

02:22.320 --> 02:24.480
My previous startup before Telemark

02:24.480 --> 02:27.640
was CamVine, Cambridge Visual Networks,

02:27.640 --> 02:29.680
a company developing the new applications based

02:29.680 --> 02:33.900
around network displays, which I started in 2007.

02:33.900 --> 02:37.880
I was also a founder and managing director of the,

02:37.880 --> 02:41.420
hmm, I don't know how to pronounce this, Medio project?

02:41.420 --> 02:42.800
It's Indio.

02:42.800 --> 02:44.120
Indio, love it.

02:44.120 --> 02:45.880
I'll explain the name if you like later.

02:45.880 --> 02:48.360
Oh, I will, yeah, we'll dive into a few of these things.

02:48.360 --> 02:50.200
I don't know if we can touch on them all,

02:50.200 --> 02:53.120
but the breadth here is what's impressive to me.

02:53.120 --> 02:56.600
So Indio attempted to find new, more affordable network

02:56.600 --> 02:58.880
computing architecture for the billions of people

02:58.880 --> 03:03.080
who will never be able to afford one PC each.

03:03.080 --> 03:05.480
That sounds well worth doing.

03:05.480 --> 03:07.160
And just for a few more, before that I

03:07.160 --> 03:11.280
was working at Exiblio, which I co-founded in 2004

03:11.280 --> 03:14.080
with the aim of endowing paper documents with some

03:14.080 --> 03:15.800
of the power of digital ones.

03:15.800 --> 03:17.200
That sounds fascinating.

03:17.200 --> 03:20.140
I also co-founded Noom Research, now DisplayLink,

03:20.140 --> 03:23.880
in 2003 and was the CEO for its first couple of years.

03:23.880 --> 03:26.680
I've authored and been listed as an inventor

03:26.680 --> 03:28.600
on dozens of patents.

03:28.600 --> 03:30.720
None of these has yet made me any money,

03:30.720 --> 03:32.960
but they've done OK for other people.

03:32.960 --> 03:34.800
Most are now owned by Google.

03:34.800 --> 03:37.800
For several years I was a research scientist

03:37.800 --> 03:43.400
at AT&T Labs in Cambridge, the lab which was formerly ORL.

03:43.400 --> 03:44.400
I did a PhD.

03:44.400 --> 03:46.800
Oh, Dr. Quentin.

03:46.800 --> 03:49.560
I did a PhD on augmented reality in the Rainbow

03:49.560 --> 03:52.560
Group at the University of Cambridge Computer Lab.

03:52.560 --> 03:53.360
And it goes on.

03:53.360 --> 03:56.240
I was, I think, the first full-time computer officer

03:56.240 --> 03:58.220
at Cambridge College during this time.

03:58.220 --> 04:01.780
I believe I may have created the world's first 10-set Venn

04:01.780 --> 04:05.840
diagram, which is no small thing if you care about these things.

04:05.840 --> 04:07.560
And then the last thing, I think I

04:07.560 --> 04:09.680
ran the first web server in Cambridge.

04:09.680 --> 04:12.720
I certainly ran the first one in the university, which then

04:12.720 --> 04:15.640
became the platform for computer science students who

04:15.640 --> 04:18.280
wanted to do projects around this new fangled,

04:18.280 --> 04:20.840
worldwide web thing.

04:20.840 --> 04:24.200
How is it hearing all of that from someone else reading it

04:24.200 --> 04:24.720
for you?

04:24.720 --> 04:28.800
I think I should have a much briefer website, really.

04:28.800 --> 04:31.000
I do point out, I actually have quite

04:31.000 --> 04:33.200
a substantial personal website.

04:33.200 --> 04:35.880
And it's not that I think I'm deserving

04:35.880 --> 04:37.460
of this great monument to myself.

04:37.460 --> 04:38.800
It's just that I keep adding bits,

04:38.800 --> 04:41.520
and I never get around to deleting stuff.

04:41.520 --> 04:44.040
And that's what I gathered, was that this was,

04:44.040 --> 04:46.720
because some of the things, which I didn't read,

04:46.720 --> 04:49.520
mentioned like, you can hear me say hello here.

04:49.520 --> 04:54.120
And in parentheses, you state, at the time that I wrote this,

04:54.120 --> 04:57.280
that wasn't possible for all computers and all browsers.

04:57.280 --> 05:00.460
So it's neat how you've just sort of added things as you go.

05:00.460 --> 05:02.080
And I think that's actually really nice.

05:02.080 --> 05:04.920
Well, I think that that recording of me saying hello,

05:04.920 --> 05:07.080
which just says something like, hello, I'm Quentin,

05:07.080 --> 05:11.200
pleased to meet you, is probably in an audio format

05:11.200 --> 05:13.520
that it's remarkable still plays on most browsers.

05:13.520 --> 05:16.000
Because I think I recorded it on my Spark station

05:16.000 --> 05:19.240
back in about, you know, certainly not

05:19.240 --> 05:21.640
this millennium anyway.

05:21.640 --> 05:24.320
Back when not all browsers could play audio.

05:24.320 --> 05:26.440
And if you actually had one that could,

05:26.440 --> 05:28.400
then you could hear me say hello.

05:28.400 --> 05:29.800
Pretty exciting.

05:29.800 --> 05:32.720
That, I think, gives a sense that you've,

05:32.720 --> 05:34.520
let's just say, you've been around.

05:34.520 --> 05:37.000
You've seen some history that's pretty interesting.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.240
I'm really old, so that's a nice way of saying yes.

05:39.240 --> 05:41.520
Seasoned, perhaps, is a nice way to put it.

05:41.520 --> 05:42.000
That's it.

05:42.000 --> 05:42.400
That's good.

05:42.400 --> 05:42.920
I like that.

05:42.920 --> 05:47.040
But the early web, for me, I'm slightly younger than you.

05:47.040 --> 05:49.340
For me, the early web, in my perspective,

05:49.340 --> 05:55.000
was dial-up internet and the pains and beauties of that.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.760
You know, having a home PC was a big thing.

05:58.760 --> 06:00.280
Actually, the first computer I used

06:00.280 --> 06:03.520
was a Commodore 64 that my father purchased

06:03.520 --> 06:04.840
that was quite old at the time.

06:04.840 --> 06:07.960
But you know, he forced us to use the spreadsheet there

06:07.960 --> 06:09.960
for he would give us an allowance

06:09.960 --> 06:11.000
and we would tabulate.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.080
A man with foresight, clearly, yeah.

06:13.080 --> 06:14.440
Yeah, yeah.

06:14.440 --> 06:17.400
So that's my early history of five and a half inch

06:17.400 --> 06:18.040
floppy disks.

06:18.040 --> 06:20.920
But you've seen a little bit before that,

06:20.920 --> 06:22.520
which really fascinates me.

06:22.520 --> 06:24.800
Well, yeah, a little bit.

06:24.800 --> 06:28.180
I mean, I do think that you and I

06:28.180 --> 06:31.480
have been very fortunate to grow up when we did, right?

06:31.480 --> 06:35.000
I think and be interested in technology.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.680
It's like growing up and being interested in cars

06:38.680 --> 06:41.160
at around the time of Henry Ford or whatever.

06:41.160 --> 06:42.960
But computing has happened so fast.

06:42.960 --> 06:46.320
And there's been all of these changes within a lifetime.

06:46.320 --> 06:49.720
I really did have to sort of solder my first computer

06:49.720 --> 06:50.320
together.

06:50.320 --> 06:54.320
And I've gone from that in a very short period of time

06:54.320 --> 06:57.960
to something like the iPhones and iPads sitting on my desk,

06:57.960 --> 06:59.680
just so far away from that.

06:59.680 --> 07:02.000
And you know, there aren't many fields,

07:02.000 --> 07:04.560
I think, in which you could have that exciting a change

07:04.560 --> 07:06.560
during your professional life.

07:06.560 --> 07:09.800
And so that being said, I'm curious,

07:09.800 --> 07:11.080
what was it about the computers?

07:11.080 --> 07:14.200
You know, you mentioned you soldered your own, maybe

07:14.200 --> 07:15.480
some pieces together.

07:15.480 --> 07:18.280
And some of us still do that these days, just for fun.

07:18.280 --> 07:22.720
Yeah, but you do it for fun, not because of necessity.

07:22.720 --> 07:25.080
Right, not true necessity, exactly.

07:25.080 --> 07:28.480
But I'm curious, what was it, as a young Quentin,

07:28.480 --> 07:31.280
was it that really grabbed you about this relatively

07:31.280 --> 07:32.200
new world?

07:32.200 --> 07:35.440
Oh, that's a really interesting question.

07:35.440 --> 07:38.760
I think, I mean, computers weren't

07:38.760 --> 07:41.640
new when I was young in the sense

07:41.640 --> 07:45.640
that you saw them on television programs and things.

07:45.640 --> 07:51.000
You may see them on the deck of the Starship Enterprise, but.

07:51.000 --> 07:51.960
As you should.

07:51.960 --> 07:52.600
That's right.

07:52.600 --> 07:54.820
But you know, I grew up just at the point

07:54.820 --> 07:56.480
where suddenly this was something

07:56.480 --> 07:57.520
my parents could afford.

07:57.520 --> 07:59.880
They had to save up, but they could afford to give me one.

07:59.880 --> 08:03.960
And only a few years before that, I had used a computer,

08:03.960 --> 08:06.360
but it had been in a museum in London, the Science

08:06.360 --> 08:07.280
Museum in London.

08:07.280 --> 08:09.120
Not because it was an old thing, but the Science Museum

08:09.120 --> 08:11.880
in London has a lot of new stuff as well as old stuff.

08:11.880 --> 08:14.200
And I remember when I first got my hands,

08:14.200 --> 08:15.760
actually I was able to type at a keyboard

08:15.760 --> 08:18.560
and give an instruction to a computer, which

08:18.560 --> 08:21.360
was one of these things you'd only seen in sort of Hollywood

08:21.360 --> 08:22.760
movies up till then.

08:22.760 --> 08:24.680
And so that sudden shift to being something

08:24.680 --> 08:30.160
that you could sit in front of on the floor of your sitting

08:30.160 --> 08:30.880
room at home.

08:30.880 --> 08:33.100
And the only display we had was the television.

08:33.100 --> 08:34.680
We only had one television in the house,

08:34.680 --> 08:36.960
so nobody could watch TV while I was using my computer,

08:36.960 --> 08:38.640
kind of thing.

08:38.640 --> 08:42.680
Again, it was all of a sudden this unknown world.

08:42.680 --> 08:45.480
I don't want to wax lyrical too early in this conversation,

08:45.480 --> 08:47.280
but I think that I've often thought

08:47.280 --> 08:49.880
that computer science, in some senses,

08:49.880 --> 08:54.560
is almost the most creative subject, the most

08:54.560 --> 08:56.400
creative, almost, art form.

08:56.400 --> 08:58.760
I'd say maybe pushing it a bit.

08:58.760 --> 09:02.280
But you start, when you're trying to solve something

09:02.280 --> 09:06.880
using computers, you start often just with a thought.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.600
You have a problem you want to solve,

09:08.600 --> 09:10.680
you have thoughts about how to do it,

09:10.680 --> 09:16.040
and you turn those thoughts into a solution to a problem,

09:16.040 --> 09:18.480
or maybe a game, or maybe something beautiful,

09:18.480 --> 09:19.400
or maybe something.

09:19.400 --> 09:21.720
But in general, it's thought matter

09:21.720 --> 09:26.600
translated into something tangible with possibly less

09:26.600 --> 09:32.080
sort of intervening stuff than almost any other activity,

09:32.080 --> 09:32.800
I think.

09:32.800 --> 09:35.400
It really is capturing thoughts.

09:35.400 --> 09:40.280
And anyway, that's what it felt like to me at the start.

09:40.280 --> 09:42.560
Just simple things like, I don't know,

09:42.560 --> 09:44.720
you want to make a picture of a cube

09:44.720 --> 09:47.680
rotate on the screen in front of you, you had to think about,

09:47.680 --> 09:49.760
oh, OK, so hang on, what's the coordinates of that

09:49.760 --> 09:50.360
going to be?

09:50.360 --> 09:52.800
Well, you want it rotated by this angle,

09:52.800 --> 09:55.320
so you have to work out the cosine of this angle,

09:55.320 --> 09:59.400
and work out where the appropriate coordinates

09:59.400 --> 10:00.720
of this cube are going to be.

10:00.720 --> 10:02.480
And then it looks a bit funny, and you realize that's

10:02.480 --> 10:03.800
because you didn't include perspective.

10:03.800 --> 10:05.960
So you say, oh, hang on, how does perspective work?

10:05.960 --> 10:09.320
And it really was, you built everything from scratch there,

10:09.320 --> 10:11.480
because when you turned your computer on,

10:11.480 --> 10:13.240
all you got was a flashing prompt at which

10:13.240 --> 10:14.840
you would have to type code.

10:14.840 --> 10:17.240
And so if you wanted this thing to do anything,

10:17.240 --> 10:20.000
you had to start being creative from the word go.

10:20.000 --> 10:24.400
And that's something that we've largely lost in computers.

10:24.400 --> 10:27.480
We turn them on as a tool to do something,

10:27.480 --> 10:31.200
but you weren't forced to be creative the moment you turned

10:31.200 --> 10:32.800
it on, as you were in the past.

10:32.800 --> 10:34.800
And that's partly what the Raspberry Pi and things

10:34.800 --> 10:38.200
like that have tried to recapture, of course.

10:38.200 --> 10:42.800
Yeah, that conversion from imagination into reality,

10:42.800 --> 10:44.960
and then just kind of exploring from there,

10:44.960 --> 10:46.800
and seeing what's possible, right?

10:46.800 --> 10:50.480
Yes, and in the past, if you wanted your computer

10:50.480 --> 10:52.600
to be able to interact with the real world,

10:52.600 --> 10:54.600
you did often have to plug things into the back,

10:54.600 --> 10:57.040
and solder things together, and make up the circuit boards

10:57.040 --> 10:58.200
yourself, and so on.

10:58.200 --> 11:02.040
And the Raspberry Pi was started by friends of mine

11:02.040 --> 11:05.760
who felt that the computer science students that we were

11:05.760 --> 11:07.520
getting in the University at Cambridge,

11:07.520 --> 11:09.760
they were coming in with actually much less experience

11:09.760 --> 11:11.840
now than they had had in the past.

11:11.840 --> 11:14.880
Because in the past, to use computers,

11:14.880 --> 11:17.280
you sort of had to be an enthusiast.

11:17.280 --> 11:19.600
Whereas now, people were coming in just thinking,

11:19.600 --> 11:21.880
oh, computers might be interesting to learn about.

11:21.880 --> 11:23.600
But they hadn't gone through that process

11:23.600 --> 11:26.280
of having to understand it so much

11:26.280 --> 11:27.920
before you could even use it.

11:27.920 --> 11:29.600
And so the idea of the Raspberry Pi

11:29.600 --> 11:33.560
was actually to give you a much more basic computer that

11:33.560 --> 11:37.040
really didn't do very much for you out of the, you know,

11:37.040 --> 11:38.840
when you plugged it in and turned it on.

11:38.840 --> 11:40.720
And you had to understand a bit more about it

11:40.720 --> 11:41.760
to accomplish anything.

11:41.760 --> 11:43.560
And that was quite deliberate.

11:43.560 --> 11:46.720
The hardware is quite capable of running all sorts of stuff.

11:46.720 --> 11:48.240
I mean, it could have provided you

11:48.240 --> 11:50.100
with a very slick experience out of the box.

11:50.100 --> 11:52.320
But part of the idea was, no, actually, you

11:52.320 --> 11:55.680
need to understand how power supplies work,

11:55.680 --> 11:57.160
and how to write code, and so on,

11:57.160 --> 11:59.480
and how operating systems boot up, and so on,

11:59.480 --> 12:01.800
to a much greater degree to be able to use one of them.

12:01.800 --> 12:04.160
And I think that's part of why it's been such a success.

12:04.160 --> 12:06.720
You know, you mentioned you had to be an enthusiast

12:06.720 --> 12:09.040
previously to really get into computers.

12:09.040 --> 12:10.760
It seems almost the opposite these days,

12:10.760 --> 12:13.680
in that we all use computers in our everyday lives,

12:13.680 --> 12:18.080
from phones to everything else, really, to your car, even.

12:18.080 --> 12:20.740
And yet, the enthusiasts are the one

12:20.740 --> 12:24.040
going to these simpler machines like Raspberry

12:24.040 --> 12:26.280
Pi's, and the single board computers, and such.

12:26.280 --> 12:28.320
And so it almost feels like a reversal to me,

12:28.320 --> 12:29.480
which is really fascinating.

12:29.480 --> 12:31.040
Yes, I think that's probably right.

12:31.040 --> 12:33.440
It's almost more like, you know, everybody drives a car.

12:33.440 --> 12:35.480
So if you're an enthusiast, you get a classic car,

12:35.480 --> 12:39.160
or you build a car yourself, or you put bins in your car,

12:39.160 --> 12:42.000
and you have a camper van, or whatever it may be.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.820
When something becomes a commodity,

12:43.820 --> 12:45.600
then you need to find a new spin on it.

12:45.600 --> 12:49.560
And that may be using computers to automate your home,

12:49.560 --> 12:52.800
or it may be just actually turning on a computer

12:52.800 --> 12:58.440
and sending an email with it is not something that, well,

12:58.440 --> 13:00.720
it's less of an adventure now than it used to be.

13:00.720 --> 13:02.600
So we find other things to do, right?

13:02.600 --> 13:03.400
For sure, right.

13:03.400 --> 13:05.000
And because everybody does it, right?

13:05.000 --> 13:07.840
You want to find your own niche, or you want to,

13:07.840 --> 13:10.840
if you want to make a difference to the world,

13:10.840 --> 13:13.360
or even just a difference to your local bit of the world,

13:13.360 --> 13:15.120
you have to do something different from what

13:15.120 --> 13:16.240
everybody else is doing.

13:16.240 --> 13:19.400
So I think that's part of the appeal.

13:19.400 --> 13:21.800
You know, part of what has worried me in the past

13:21.800 --> 13:25.420
has been exploring the idea that maybe we've

13:25.420 --> 13:26.920
gotten to the point where computers

13:26.920 --> 13:30.720
have done all of the things that humanity needs them to do.

13:30.720 --> 13:33.520
And yet, when I reflect on that just slightly more,

13:33.520 --> 13:36.920
especially in the context of you mentioning it as quite an art

13:36.920 --> 13:41.160
form, I think, well, no, we're really just started, aren't we?

13:41.160 --> 13:43.620
Like, certainly computers have taken us to the moon,

13:43.620 --> 13:47.120
and there's all sorts of things on other planets now.

13:47.120 --> 13:50.000
And yet, I think in some ways we're just started.

13:50.000 --> 13:53.520
Like, do you feel like there's a lot more possibility there

13:53.520 --> 13:55.000
in this realm?

13:55.000 --> 13:58.200
Yes, I think there is a great deal more.

13:58.200 --> 14:01.680
But I think the rapid acceleration

14:01.680 --> 14:06.240
at the start of computing has sort of tails off for a while.

14:06.240 --> 14:08.520
I think, actually, the analogy with cars

14:08.520 --> 14:09.840
is kind of interesting here.

14:09.840 --> 14:12.760
Because between school and college,

14:12.760 --> 14:15.840
I worked for a car firm, you know, just for a year

14:15.840 --> 14:19.920
and a half, for Austin Rover cars, as they were then.

14:19.920 --> 14:23.480
And it was a useful experience of industry,

14:23.480 --> 14:25.680
but it wasn't at all sexy.

14:25.680 --> 14:27.960
There was nothing about it that made

14:27.960 --> 14:30.160
me want to carry on doing this after I finished

14:30.160 --> 14:31.240
as a student and so on.

14:31.240 --> 14:34.680
I thought that, essentially, cars had become dull,

14:34.680 --> 14:38.080
and nothing really new was happening with them,

14:38.080 --> 14:42.160
and hadn't really happened for 50 or 100 years.

14:42.160 --> 14:44.880
And then all of a sudden, a few years ago,

14:44.880 --> 14:48.280
I got into doing stuff related to cars again.

14:48.280 --> 14:52.360
Because you had this combination of electric vehicles,

14:52.360 --> 14:55.440
which were completely changing how cars were and could

14:55.440 --> 14:58.440
be built, and what they were like to drive, and so on.

14:58.440 --> 15:01.480
And you had this whole idea of autonomous vehicles,

15:01.480 --> 15:05.800
self-driving cars, which, again, was very interesting

15:05.800 --> 15:07.120
technologically.

15:07.120 --> 15:12.160
Car companies were having to become software companies.

15:12.160 --> 15:16.040
But also, the whole shape of a vehicle.

15:16.040 --> 15:17.760
What does a car look like?

15:17.760 --> 15:20.640
Does it have to be, do you have to have everybody

15:20.640 --> 15:23.320
facing forwards if the car can drive itself?

15:23.320 --> 15:26.600
And all of these sort of things are thrown open

15:26.600 --> 15:28.080
for innovation again.

15:28.080 --> 15:29.880
We have vehicles that are bigger, and smaller,

15:29.880 --> 15:33.280
and quieter, and different shapes, and so on,

15:33.280 --> 15:36.280
in a way that so much has been defined in the past

15:36.280 --> 15:39.960
by the basic shape of an internal combustion

15:39.960 --> 15:43.640
engine, and four wheels, and a gearbox, and so on.

15:43.640 --> 15:46.280
And I think we're at a very exciting time now

15:46.280 --> 15:49.760
to be in the automobile industry, which, again, we

15:49.760 --> 15:51.440
haven't really had, I don't think.

15:51.440 --> 15:54.440
I mean, what's changed before this advent

15:54.440 --> 15:55.320
of electric vehicles?

15:55.320 --> 15:58.280
What's changed in the last five decades?

15:58.280 --> 15:59.640
Very, very little.

15:59.640 --> 16:02.440
Yeah, I think four-wheel drive, or all-wheel drive,

16:02.440 --> 16:05.120
in rally racing was really a huge innovation.

16:05.120 --> 16:08.560
But even that's quite mechanical, right?

16:08.560 --> 16:11.800
But it didn't fundamentally change the shape of cars.

16:11.800 --> 16:14.560
I mean, I guess you could say automatic gearboxes.

16:14.560 --> 16:15.680
Sure, sure.

16:15.680 --> 16:19.880
Which some people still aren't keen on.

16:19.880 --> 16:22.200
So there have been various small innovations.

16:22.200 --> 16:24.120
But I still don't know how much I'd

16:24.120 --> 16:27.720
buy the dream of fully self-driving vehicles.

16:27.720 --> 16:31.680
But it seems to me that if we even get close to that,

16:31.680 --> 16:34.480
then the way we think of and use cars

16:34.480 --> 16:36.840
could be completely different.

16:36.840 --> 16:38.840
And I have some examples I like giving of this.

16:38.840 --> 16:41.040
I mean, the thing I'm almost most exciting,

16:41.040 --> 16:44.760
I know you've done a lot of stuff with RVs in Jupiter.

16:44.760 --> 16:47.000
And, or campervans.

16:47.000 --> 16:50.200
And I've always thought that what I really want

16:50.200 --> 16:54.080
is a self-driving campervan, or motorhome, or RV.

16:54.080 --> 16:57.120
One where in the evening I could, you know,

16:57.120 --> 16:59.800
I don't have enough space to park it here.

16:59.800 --> 17:03.120
But I could summon it from its out-of-town parking area.

17:03.120 --> 17:05.040
And it would turn up at the doorstep.

17:05.040 --> 17:06.960
And I would get in with my dog, and my wife,

17:06.960 --> 17:09.440
and a nice bottle of wine, and a good movie.

17:09.440 --> 17:12.440
And I would say, ooh, Chamonix, please.

17:12.440 --> 17:14.640
Chamonix being in the French Alps.

17:14.640 --> 17:16.960
And we'd wake up in the morning, you know,

17:16.960 --> 17:18.320
hundreds of miles away.

17:18.320 --> 17:20.560
You might not want to drive a big RV around

17:20.560 --> 17:22.200
when you got there, but that's all right.

17:22.200 --> 17:25.480
Because you could just tell your car to follow you.

17:25.480 --> 17:28.120
And so you could wake up the following morning

17:28.120 --> 17:30.120
and take your dog for a walk in a different country,

17:30.120 --> 17:33.400
having slept through the travel process.

17:33.400 --> 17:36.960
Or another example I like to give

17:36.960 --> 17:39.640
is I'd really like a self-driving car

17:39.640 --> 17:41.320
for when I'm walking.

17:41.320 --> 17:43.200
Tell me more.

17:43.200 --> 17:44.360
So I like hiking, right?

17:44.360 --> 17:47.360
And so much of, certainly here,

17:47.360 --> 17:49.720
so much of going for a walk

17:49.720 --> 17:52.680
involves finding a nice place to park

17:52.680 --> 17:54.400
and doing a circular route

17:54.400 --> 17:57.000
which brings you back to your car again.

17:57.000 --> 18:00.920
And what about if you're driving along a road

18:00.920 --> 18:02.320
and you see a beautiful view,

18:02.320 --> 18:05.040
and you say, hey car, stop here, let me out.

18:05.880 --> 18:08.200
And you just get out and the car carries on

18:08.200 --> 18:09.880
and you walk over the fields,

18:09.880 --> 18:12.640
and you walk over the hills, and you cross the rivers.

18:12.640 --> 18:15.800
And at some point, which you don't have to decide in advance

18:15.800 --> 18:18.760
when you get tired, you meet up with your car again

18:18.760 --> 18:20.520
and you have a comfy chair to take you home.

18:20.520 --> 18:24.760
But the fact that you leave your car in one place

18:24.760 --> 18:26.600
and have to return to it in the same place,

18:26.600 --> 18:29.760
again, is something that is perhaps an artifact of the past.

18:29.760 --> 18:32.360
And maybe in the future people will say, what?

18:32.360 --> 18:34.280
You always had to do sort of circular walks

18:34.280 --> 18:35.560
to get back to your transport?

18:35.560 --> 18:36.400
That's crazy.

18:37.800 --> 18:40.720
And so, yeah, it'll be really interesting to see.

18:40.720 --> 18:43.760
In, I think in five decades time,

18:43.760 --> 18:46.920
people may have a very different view of transport

18:46.920 --> 18:50.880
from what we have compared to the five decades ago, right?

18:50.880 --> 18:52.120
What was happening in the 60s?

18:52.120 --> 18:56.520
Well, the cars weren't really fundamentally that,

18:56.520 --> 18:58.960
not in that kind of way, that different from-

18:58.960 --> 18:59.960
Much the same, right?

18:59.960 --> 19:01.400
Yeah, yeah.

19:01.400 --> 19:03.800
Even just in those ideas that you just mentioned there

19:03.800 --> 19:06.840
about your car picking you up later,

19:06.840 --> 19:11.840
has me pausing because I think that it's very important

19:12.440 --> 19:14.320
to challenge our assumptions

19:14.320 --> 19:17.440
about the technologies that we're currently using.

19:17.440 --> 19:20.200
And I would imagine that's kind of

19:20.200 --> 19:22.880
one of your defining characteristics

19:22.880 --> 19:24.880
in much of the research and the projects

19:24.880 --> 19:27.120
that you've worked on in the past and currently,

19:27.120 --> 19:28.120
and certainly in the future.

19:28.120 --> 19:33.120
And that always gets me sort of excited, I think,

19:33.240 --> 19:36.200
is we need to test those assumptions.

19:36.200 --> 19:37.640
I have a keyboard in front of me.

19:37.640 --> 19:39.520
Well, why should I be typing on a keyboard?

19:39.520 --> 19:41.440
The thing's ancient, if you really think about it

19:41.440 --> 19:42.960
in the same context, right?

19:42.960 --> 19:43.800
Isn't that bizarre?

19:43.800 --> 19:47.200
How have we stuck with the QWERTY keyboard for this long?

19:47.200 --> 19:49.040
That is really strange

19:49.040 --> 19:51.120
because everybody knows it's inefficient

19:51.120 --> 19:53.400
and there've been so many attempts to replace it

19:53.400 --> 19:55.400
with other keyboards in the past,

19:55.400 --> 19:57.840
with other layouts like the Vorjak keyboard,

19:57.840 --> 20:02.200
which is much better in terms of efficiency of typing

20:02.200 --> 20:04.780
or with completely different keyboards.

20:04.780 --> 20:08.460
But it has stuck with us for a very long time.

20:08.460 --> 20:09.460
But even there, you see,

20:09.460 --> 20:12.940
I think that people as old as me are just not,

20:12.940 --> 20:15.700
most of us, we're just not good at typing at speed

20:15.700 --> 20:19.700
on small phone soft keyboards or iPad keyboards.

20:19.700 --> 20:20.540
Certainly.

20:20.540 --> 20:23.540
I love my iPad and I love my iPhone,

20:23.540 --> 20:25.140
but if I actually want to type something

20:25.140 --> 20:26.940
that's more than about two sentences long,

20:26.940 --> 20:27.940
I go and find a laptop

20:27.940 --> 20:29.660
or at least go and find a Bluetooth keyboard

20:29.660 --> 20:32.500
so I can use a keyboard to type it.

20:32.500 --> 20:35.740
Whereas, you know, I think the kids today,

20:35.740 --> 20:38.340
you know, they have very, very versatile thumbs.

20:38.340 --> 20:42.340
You know, they can type with two thumbs

20:42.340 --> 20:45.260
what it used to take me an hour to type

20:45.260 --> 20:46.660
on my QWERTY keyboard.

20:46.660 --> 20:48.700
And I wonder when that'll change.

20:48.700 --> 20:50.460
What I do find though,

20:50.460 --> 20:53.100
which is another thing that's happened in the last few years

20:53.100 --> 20:55.980
is that speech recognition has got very good.

20:55.980 --> 20:57.220
I always had a problem with it,

20:57.220 --> 21:00.420
even though, you know, I don't have that strange a voice.

21:00.420 --> 21:02.860
Maybe it's, you know, a transatlantic voice

21:02.860 --> 21:06.380
from the point of view of many people writing software.

21:06.380 --> 21:07.540
But I always had real trouble

21:07.540 --> 21:11.420
with those, you know, telephone voice response systems

21:11.420 --> 21:13.620
where they would say, you know,

21:13.620 --> 21:15.780
they would ask you a question and say,

21:15.780 --> 21:18.220
please say yes or no.

21:18.220 --> 21:21.300
I'd say, yes, I'm sorry, I didn't understand that.

21:21.300 --> 21:23.140
Please say yes or no.

21:23.140 --> 21:26.100
And you think, you know, how hard can this be?

21:26.100 --> 21:28.300
And until eventually after about the third try,

21:28.300 --> 21:31.980
they'd say, please say yes or press one or no,

21:31.980 --> 21:36.140
or press, thank God, and I would hit the key.

21:36.140 --> 21:38.860
Whereas now, because I'm not very good

21:38.860 --> 21:40.180
at typing fast on my phone,

21:40.180 --> 21:41.860
I dictate a lot of stuff to it.

21:41.860 --> 21:44.300
And I find the Siri dictation works really, really well.

21:44.300 --> 21:47.340
And I suspect Android is much the same.

21:47.340 --> 21:51.300
So the whole idea of talking to your computer,

21:51.300 --> 21:52.940
not just as dictation,

21:52.940 --> 21:55.740
I find actually is something I'm doing more and more,

21:55.740 --> 21:58.380
which again, you know, in theory,

21:58.380 --> 21:59.940
you've always been able to do in the past.

21:59.940 --> 22:02.060
But I think that's really come on

22:02.060 --> 22:04.660
in the last 10 years or so.

22:04.660 --> 22:06.180
Partly just because of the amount of data

22:06.180 --> 22:07.660
people can gather.

22:07.660 --> 22:09.700
Do you find that what you,

22:09.700 --> 22:10.700
and you may not know this answer,

22:10.700 --> 22:12.220
I want you to reflect on it.

22:12.220 --> 22:14.660
Do you find that what you dictate to your,

22:14.660 --> 22:15.900
you know, I'll just call them computers,

22:15.900 --> 22:17.420
but it could be your phone or whatever,

22:17.420 --> 22:20.780
that what you dictate ends up being in almost

22:20.780 --> 22:22.980
a little bit of a different parlance

22:22.980 --> 22:24.940
than what you would traditionally type?

22:24.940 --> 22:27.860
Oh, yes, probably.

22:27.860 --> 22:29.220
I think there are people,

22:29.220 --> 22:30.620
or there certainly used to be people,

22:30.620 --> 22:32.820
people who have had secretaries and so on

22:32.820 --> 22:34.300
more than I have, who are,

22:34.300 --> 22:36.060
who, you know, at least traditionally

22:36.060 --> 22:37.780
were very good often at dictation,

22:37.780 --> 22:39.420
or their secretaries were very good at,

22:39.420 --> 22:40.740
you know, turning what they said

22:40.740 --> 22:43.700
into readable and sensible prose.

22:43.700 --> 22:46.660
But I have got quite used to saying,

22:46.660 --> 22:48.660
hello, mum, comma, new line.

22:51.260 --> 22:54.380
Hope you're having a great day, exclamation mark, smiley.

22:54.380 --> 22:56.580
And I am a bit of a stickler for punctuation and things,

22:56.580 --> 22:59.380
so I do get used to saying that and putting that in.

22:59.380 --> 23:03.060
And so whether that affects the flow,

23:03.060 --> 23:04.860
I don't know, no, I haven't thought about this.

23:04.860 --> 23:07.140
I mean, I haven't sat down and dictated

23:07.140 --> 23:09.300
very large passages of text.

23:09.300 --> 23:12.220
It's just that if I'm walking the dog,

23:12.220 --> 23:14.020
you'll, as you know,

23:14.020 --> 23:16.860
a lot of my life revolves around walking the dog.

23:16.860 --> 23:18.900
And I get an urgent message coming in,

23:18.900 --> 23:21.300
it's likely that I will dictate a response to it

23:21.300 --> 23:23.140
rather than typing a response to it,

23:23.140 --> 23:25.060
partly because it's hard to type in while walking.

23:25.060 --> 23:27.100
But it is, to me, you know,

23:27.100 --> 23:29.820
if you had suggested that would be the case 15, 20 years ago,

23:29.820 --> 23:31.540
I would have been very surprised.

23:31.540 --> 23:33.100
And this is the power,

23:33.100 --> 23:34.980
I think most of this is the power of being able

23:34.980 --> 23:36.860
to just gather huge amounts of data,

23:36.860 --> 23:40.940
because if you can get enough voice samples from people,

23:40.940 --> 23:44.260
you can train networks or algorithms,

23:44.260 --> 23:48.380
not necessarily a machine learning type algorithm,

23:48.380 --> 23:51.180
in a way that you just can't do by,

23:51.180 --> 23:53.940
you know, from the days when we, you know,

23:53.940 --> 23:55.580
you had to record 50 people

23:55.580 --> 23:58.900
to test out your voice recognition engine.

23:58.900 --> 24:01.980
Now you can, you know, put it on a website

24:01.980 --> 24:06.180
where 50,000 or 50 million people will end up using it.

24:06.180 --> 24:10.140
And that just completely changes how easy it is to do this.

24:10.140 --> 24:14.100
And so I think the internet is responsible

24:14.100 --> 24:17.500
for many more things like this working simply

24:17.500 --> 24:19.660
because of the amount of data you can gather so easily.

24:19.660 --> 24:24.180
What's fascinating to me is that community efforts

24:24.180 --> 24:26.060
around making some of these things possible,

24:26.060 --> 24:28.180
you know, we see the open street maps

24:28.180 --> 24:30.660
of the world and such projects,

24:30.660 --> 24:34.140
but a lot of this sort of like democratic data

24:34.140 --> 24:36.420
that is so useful to humanity,

24:36.420 --> 24:38.620
like the power to dictate accurately,

24:38.620 --> 24:43.620
it feels these days like that power is actually controlled

24:44.300 --> 24:46.500
from, you know, a few corporations

24:46.500 --> 24:50.540
who are doing some amazing things in allowing us to,

24:50.540 --> 24:52.900
you know, dictate into your phone and such.

24:52.900 --> 24:56.700
How do you feel about that being sort of centralized

24:56.700 --> 24:58.700
in a way and do you think there's a future

24:58.700 --> 25:00.340
when these companies don't exist?

25:00.340 --> 25:02.220
That is a very interesting question.

25:02.220 --> 25:04.700
I mean, you could do this on a big scale

25:04.700 --> 25:07.180
if you could get people to volunteer their data,

25:07.180 --> 25:09.460
but it's very hard to explain to users

25:09.460 --> 25:10.740
what it could be used for,

25:10.740 --> 25:13.060
what privacy issues you're actually giving up,

25:13.060 --> 25:14.940
you know, and to get people to tick a box saying,

25:14.940 --> 25:17.180
yes, you can do this is quite hard

25:17.180 --> 25:19.940
unless they're getting something very tangible in return,

25:19.940 --> 25:23.340
like, you know, the ability to search the web

25:23.340 --> 25:24.300
or something like that.

25:24.300 --> 25:27.620
And it is amazing what at the moment we are willing

25:27.620 --> 25:29.260
to give up in terms of being able

25:29.260 --> 25:31.220
to type into a Google prompt,

25:31.220 --> 25:33.780
but it is also amazing the power that that gives you.

25:33.780 --> 25:36.220
And so we think for most people think

25:36.220 --> 25:38.020
that that trade-off is worthwhile.

25:38.020 --> 25:42.140
And of course, you know, things like Facebook, Twitter

25:42.140 --> 25:45.580
are, you know, on a whole different scale of data gathering.

25:45.580 --> 25:49.300
And this whole idea that you are the product,

25:49.300 --> 25:50.460
if you can't tell what the product is,

25:50.460 --> 25:53.260
you are the product is really, really true here.

25:54.380 --> 25:59.380
But the question is, do we believe that overall,

25:59.860 --> 26:02.180
this is a trade worth making, right?

26:02.180 --> 26:05.220
How much privacy are we willing to give up

26:05.220 --> 26:09.580
in exchange for me being able to dictate to my phone

26:09.580 --> 26:12.620
or me being able to ask my Amazon Echo to do,

26:12.620 --> 26:14.780
you know, something for me like turn the lights off.

26:14.780 --> 26:18.260
And everyone's different about this.

26:18.260 --> 26:20.820
A lot of people are conspiracy theorists, right?

26:20.820 --> 26:22.500
A lot of people have a great distrust

26:22.500 --> 26:24.820
of large organizations and so on.

26:24.820 --> 26:28.540
I don't in general, you know, I tend in that direction,

26:28.540 --> 26:30.860
but it's a sliding scale.

26:30.860 --> 26:33.780
And I think it's very hard for people to understand

26:33.780 --> 26:37.020
the implications of the data they are giving away.

26:37.020 --> 26:38.700
And it's very hard to predict,

26:38.700 --> 26:40.100
even if you do understand this stuff,

26:40.100 --> 26:42.860
it's very hard to predict what they may be useful for.

26:42.860 --> 26:46.180
So I suspect over the coming decades,

26:46.180 --> 26:51.180
we will get better at assessing what privacy we're giving up

26:52.860 --> 26:55.540
either for other people's corporate gain

26:55.540 --> 26:56.740
and often for our benefits.

26:56.740 --> 26:59.100
And it's just really hard to describe.

26:59.100 --> 27:01.500
But I think a lot of this is an education thing.

27:01.500 --> 27:02.900
It is amazing to me.

27:02.900 --> 27:06.380
So my wife also works at Cambridge University.

27:06.380 --> 27:09.060
She's interviewing students very shortly

27:09.060 --> 27:10.380
or has just been interviewing students

27:10.380 --> 27:12.820
for the next academic year.

27:12.820 --> 27:17.580
And I realized that most of them learned to read

27:17.580 --> 27:19.500
after Twitter was founded.

27:19.500 --> 27:20.540
So they haven't, right,

27:20.540 --> 27:22.980
they have never known a world without Twitter.

27:22.980 --> 27:26.460
And, you know, and that makes me feel old.

27:26.460 --> 27:28.300
I remember when I realized-

27:28.300 --> 27:29.380
That makes me feel old.

27:29.380 --> 27:31.380
Right, I remember when I realized

27:31.380 --> 27:32.620
that the students she was interviewing

27:32.620 --> 27:34.540
had been born after Star Trek.

27:34.540 --> 27:37.020
You know, I mean, after Star Wars,

27:37.020 --> 27:39.900
the original Star Wars, that made me feel old.

27:39.900 --> 27:42.620
And that's like in the 70s or something.

27:42.620 --> 27:45.940
People growing up today, people coming to college today,

27:45.940 --> 27:48.460
people going out and getting jobs and getting married today

27:48.460 --> 27:51.420
have never known a world without Twitter, many of them.

27:51.420 --> 27:53.220
And it's interesting.

27:53.220 --> 27:56.660
And Facebook, and that's part of their lives.

27:56.660 --> 27:58.900
Now, does that mean that they're better able

27:58.900 --> 28:00.860
to assess the impact this has on their lives

28:00.860 --> 28:03.780
or, you know, whether they just take it as normal?

28:03.780 --> 28:06.460
Douglas Adams, you know, had a wonderful phrase,

28:06.460 --> 28:08.140
which I'm going to get wrong,

28:08.140 --> 28:10.060
but he said it was something like,

28:10.060 --> 28:14.180
anything that was invented and existed in the world

28:14.180 --> 28:16.580
when you were born is perfectly normal and natural

28:16.580 --> 28:18.460
and part of everyday life.

28:18.460 --> 28:21.420
Anything that's invented between, you know,

28:21.420 --> 28:25.340
when you're 18 and 30, or maybe between when you're born

28:25.340 --> 28:26.940
and when you're 30 is new and exciting

28:26.940 --> 28:28.660
and you'll probably get a career in it.

28:28.660 --> 28:30.740
And anything invented after you're 30

28:30.740 --> 28:32.580
is against the natural order of things.

28:32.580 --> 28:38.220
And so, yeah, it's hard.

28:38.220 --> 28:43.140
I really don't know what impact this will have,

28:43.140 --> 28:45.460
you know, in the longer term on our society and so on,

28:45.460 --> 28:46.660
that people have grown up with this.

28:46.660 --> 28:50.100
But it's so easy to be focused on the present

28:50.100 --> 28:51.860
and you think, well, it's not that long ago

28:51.860 --> 28:53.940
that people were saying, you know,

28:53.940 --> 28:55.740
kids today, they're growing up,

28:55.740 --> 28:57.660
they've never known a world without the telephone

28:57.660 --> 29:00.180
or they've never known a world without the printing press

29:00.180 --> 29:03.180
or they've never, so whenever we get concerned

29:03.180 --> 29:05.700
about new technologies, you have to think,

29:05.700 --> 29:09.260
well, this has happened before and humanity is still here.

29:09.260 --> 29:11.740
This comes up when you talk about electric cars, right?

29:11.740 --> 29:13.540
You know, which need much less maintenance

29:13.540 --> 29:15.780
than traditional cars.

29:15.780 --> 29:18.820
And what's going to happen to all of those people

29:18.820 --> 29:21.940
involved in the automobile industry,

29:21.940 --> 29:23.860
involved in servicing these cars,

29:23.860 --> 29:26.340
who at the very least are going to have to learn new skills

29:26.340 --> 29:29.340
and probably are going to have much less to do and so on.

29:29.340 --> 29:32.220
And particularly my wife's from the Detroit area.

29:32.220 --> 29:35.260
So this is the car related stuff,

29:35.260 --> 29:36.740
it's very much in her mind.

29:36.740 --> 29:38.540
And then you think, well, hang on,

29:38.540 --> 29:40.540
the same thing happened to blacksmiths,

29:40.540 --> 29:42.300
you know, not that long ago

29:42.300 --> 29:46.020
when people stopped needing horseshoes and all of that.

29:46.020 --> 29:50.900
And that whole industry, that whole profession

29:50.900 --> 29:54.260
vanished in a very short space of time.

29:54.260 --> 29:58.020
But often, you know, long enough that the people

29:58.020 --> 30:00.020
who were doing it, you know, gradually retired

30:00.020 --> 30:03.380
or died or whatever, and just nobody knew took it up.

30:03.380 --> 30:04.540
But it is interesting, I think,

30:04.540 --> 30:08.060
that often we have these doom and gloom predictions

30:08.060 --> 30:08.900
about technology.

30:08.900 --> 30:09.900
And I certainly do this too.

30:09.900 --> 30:11.180
And you think, well, yes,

30:11.180 --> 30:12.700
and what happened when the printing press

30:12.700 --> 30:14.700
came along, similar things.

30:14.700 --> 30:16.980
And so I wonder for you, you know,

30:16.980 --> 30:19.620
since maybe in this conversation,

30:19.620 --> 30:20.940
you and I are both dinosaurs,

30:20.940 --> 30:25.100
but how is it for you that you've kept that

30:25.100 --> 30:28.580
forward looking perspective in both your personal life

30:28.580 --> 30:30.100
and your work life to, you know,

30:30.100 --> 30:32.060
because I read earlier,

30:32.060 --> 30:34.660
many of the sort of companies and ventures

30:34.660 --> 30:36.780
that you've founded or been a part of,

30:36.780 --> 30:39.860
that have sort of always kind of pushed your envelope,

30:39.860 --> 30:41.100
your personal envelope forward.

30:41.100 --> 30:45.260
So how have you been able to keep that interest

30:45.260 --> 30:46.940
in new technologies fresh for you

30:46.940 --> 30:49.460
and that you've been able to always be excited

30:49.460 --> 30:50.540
about the next thing?

30:50.540 --> 30:53.340
Well, part of this is just I love gadgets, right?

30:53.340 --> 30:56.460
So I like playing with this stuff.

30:56.460 --> 30:59.540
And I often thought that what I really needed

30:59.540 --> 31:00.580
when I was starting a business,

31:00.580 --> 31:02.180
I used to tell this to my investors,

31:02.180 --> 31:03.340
you need to find me someone

31:03.340 --> 31:04.660
who's really interested in business.

31:04.660 --> 31:05.900
I'm not a good business person

31:05.900 --> 31:08.380
because I'm not that interested in money.

31:08.380 --> 31:11.180
If I were, I would have more of it by now.

31:11.180 --> 31:14.500
I like money because it lets me play with technology.

31:14.500 --> 31:17.340
And what you need to find as my business partner,

31:17.340 --> 31:19.460
Mr. Investor, is you need to find someone

31:19.460 --> 31:22.260
who likes technology because it enables them to make money.

31:22.260 --> 31:26.420
And then we would, that would be a good partnership.

31:26.420 --> 31:28.660
And so, yes, for whatever reason,

31:28.660 --> 31:31.300
I'm just a geek and I like toys.

31:31.300 --> 31:33.460
But I think there are some useful things.

31:33.460 --> 31:36.860
One of my favorite, I'm very fond of quotations,

31:36.860 --> 31:38.900
but I don't know who first said this,

31:38.900 --> 31:40.860
but I've always liked the saying

31:40.860 --> 31:43.980
that if you're the smartest person in the room,

31:43.980 --> 31:45.780
you're in the wrong room.

31:45.780 --> 31:46.980
I certainly agree with that.

31:46.980 --> 31:51.980
Right, so I have deliberately gone out of my way

31:51.980 --> 31:54.580
to hire people who are smarter than me

31:54.580 --> 31:56.140
or to work in universities

31:56.140 --> 31:58.180
with people who are smarter than me or whatever,

31:58.180 --> 32:00.020
because otherwise, how are you gonna learn, right?

32:00.020 --> 32:01.900
If you know more than everybody else around you,

32:01.900 --> 32:03.500
you may feel good for a brief period,

32:03.500 --> 32:06.820
but you'll be the same dull person 10 years from now.

32:06.820 --> 32:11.820
And if you can always be looking for people

32:12.020 --> 32:12.940
who are gonna challenge you,

32:12.940 --> 32:15.140
people who know more than you,

32:15.140 --> 32:18.140
people who program in different languages from you,

32:18.140 --> 32:19.580
in my particular case,

32:19.580 --> 32:22.540
or understand this new machine learning stuff

32:22.540 --> 32:24.900
in a way that you don't or whatever it may be,

32:24.900 --> 32:28.740
then you have to be more humble,

32:28.740 --> 32:30.660
but you also learn a great deal more.

32:30.660 --> 32:31.780
And I think that's part of it.

32:31.780 --> 32:34.380
And that works for anything, right?

32:34.380 --> 32:35.660
In my case, it's technology,

32:35.660 --> 32:39.020
but frankly, if you're the best artist in your art group,

32:39.020 --> 32:40.620
then you're probably not gonna learn much

32:40.620 --> 32:42.020
from the other artists around you.

32:42.020 --> 32:43.260
Or if you're the best musician,

32:43.260 --> 32:46.580
then it seems to me that this is a good rule

32:46.580 --> 32:48.540
to apply to life anyway.

32:48.540 --> 32:50.100
If you're better than everyone else around you,

32:50.100 --> 32:51.060
go somewhere else.

32:51.060 --> 32:52.460
Well, and yet there's something to be said

32:52.460 --> 32:54.300
for mentorship as well,

32:54.300 --> 32:56.860
because necessarily there's someone in that room

32:56.860 --> 33:01.100
who's subjectively the best at whatever it is.

33:01.100 --> 33:02.100
Yes, that's right.

33:02.100 --> 33:04.860
So I guess somebody always has to be best.

33:04.860 --> 33:06.020
One person has to be best.

33:06.020 --> 33:08.260
And yes, it's quite correct.

33:08.260 --> 33:10.780
You should always try and help those

33:10.780 --> 33:13.740
who have less experience or less expertise

33:13.740 --> 33:15.540
or less skill than you do.

33:15.540 --> 33:17.500
But if you're always top of the pile,

33:17.500 --> 33:19.780
I think then that's a bad place to be.

33:19.780 --> 33:21.260
If you're doing that, if you're mentoring,

33:21.260 --> 33:22.500
if you're helping, if you're teaching,

33:22.500 --> 33:23.340
then that's wonderful.

33:23.340 --> 33:24.540
And you should do that.

33:24.540 --> 33:26.180
And you should probably also make sure

33:26.180 --> 33:28.020
that you don't spend all your time doing that,

33:28.020 --> 33:29.580
but you go somewhere where you're learning

33:29.580 --> 33:32.260
and you're expanding yourself.

33:32.260 --> 33:33.100
I think you just nailed it.

33:33.100 --> 33:35.740
That's the key is don't keep your environment stagnant,

33:35.740 --> 33:36.700
change your environment

33:36.700 --> 33:39.220
so that you change your challenges, right?

33:39.220 --> 33:40.140
I think that's right.

33:40.140 --> 33:40.980
I think that's right.

33:40.980 --> 33:43.060
As someone said, you should,

33:43.060 --> 33:44.820
the key to a happy and successful life

33:44.820 --> 33:48.180
is to, you know, step outside your comfort zone

33:48.180 --> 33:50.100
at least once a day, kind of thing.

33:51.060 --> 33:53.260
And I've heard versions of that,

33:53.260 --> 33:55.140
that say once a week or once a year or whatever,

33:55.140 --> 33:58.540
but nonetheless, if your life becomes very comfortable,

33:58.540 --> 34:00.180
then that may be what you want,

34:00.180 --> 34:02.820
but you can keep learning until you die

34:02.820 --> 34:04.620
or you can become very comfortable,

34:04.620 --> 34:06.180
you know, 50 years before you die

34:06.180 --> 34:08.340
and not learn anything ever after.

34:08.340 --> 34:11.220
So that just depends on your personality, I think.

34:11.220 --> 34:14.500
But anyway, that's part of my rule is yes,

34:14.500 --> 34:18.140
always to try and mix with people who are smarter than me,

34:18.140 --> 34:19.300
which is not difficult.

34:21.740 --> 34:22.900
Which projects are taking you

34:22.900 --> 34:24.300
outside of your comfort zone these days?

34:24.300 --> 34:27.980
Like which, where are you pushing yourself in some ways?

34:27.980 --> 34:30.940
Ah, that's a really good question.

34:30.940 --> 34:33.340
Actually more, well, at the moment

34:33.340 --> 34:34.540
it's more related to hobbies.

34:34.540 --> 34:39.540
I do like, I used to say, I still do say,

34:40.100 --> 34:43.180
I'm a jack of all trades and master of, well, very few.

34:43.180 --> 34:47.380
And I think different people can find satisfaction

34:47.380 --> 34:48.420
in different ways.

34:48.420 --> 34:53.420
For me, I love knowing a little bit about lots of things.

34:54.620 --> 34:57.820
And some people like becoming really, really expert

34:57.820 --> 34:59.180
on one or two things.

34:59.180 --> 35:04.180
And that's a really interesting difference in personality.

35:04.380 --> 35:08.060
So I have a lot of hobbies, right,

35:08.060 --> 35:11.140
about which most of them I am far from expert in,

35:11.140 --> 35:13.860
but I like playing with photography,

35:13.860 --> 35:16.260
I like riding horses, I like paddling a kayak,

35:16.260 --> 35:19.220
I like sailing a boat, I like scuba diving,

35:19.220 --> 35:21.620
I like hang gliding, you know, all of these things.

35:21.620 --> 35:25.140
And a lot of them I've done a very small number of times,

35:25.140 --> 35:26.980
but you've had that experience, right?

35:26.980 --> 35:30.740
And it's almost like a sort of bucket list mentality,

35:30.740 --> 35:32.220
which I think is probably a terrible thing,

35:32.220 --> 35:35.340
but I think it would be sad to go all the way

35:35.340 --> 35:39.220
through your life and never have done scuba diving.

35:39.220 --> 35:40.860
Have you dived, Brent?

35:40.860 --> 35:43.580
You know, travel is certainly a thing I chase.

35:43.580 --> 35:46.340
So I've not done scuba diving yet,

35:46.340 --> 35:48.020
but I have done paragliding.

35:48.020 --> 35:49.540
Oh, excellent, excellent.

35:49.540 --> 35:50.540
You mentioned hang gliding.

35:50.540 --> 35:52.180
I've certainly done some paragliding.

35:52.180 --> 35:54.780
So adventure is certainly on my side.

35:54.780 --> 35:55.620
And this is great, right?

35:55.620 --> 35:56.460
You get to see the world

35:56.460 --> 35:58.740
from a completely different angle.

35:58.740 --> 36:02.860
And I love diving, but I haven't done it

36:02.860 --> 36:04.620
for 10 years or something.

36:04.620 --> 36:08.420
But you can look at a stretch of water

36:08.420 --> 36:11.380
and you can say, I have some image of what it's like

36:11.380 --> 36:12.620
being underneath that.

36:12.620 --> 36:14.100
I mean, diving is great fun,

36:14.100 --> 36:15.180
because it's just like flying.

36:15.180 --> 36:20.180
You balance, you find your level and you maintain a level

36:21.060 --> 36:23.500
and you float over the little fish or corals

36:23.500 --> 36:24.940
or whatever is underneath you.

36:24.940 --> 36:25.780
So that's part of it.

36:25.780 --> 36:28.060
But you also have a view of a whole world

36:28.060 --> 36:30.780
that somebody who stays above the surface

36:30.780 --> 36:32.540
all their life never has.

36:32.540 --> 36:35.620
And I think flying is just the same

36:35.620 --> 36:37.540
and all of these things.

36:37.540 --> 36:41.900
But so I like trying to have the experience of doing this,

36:41.900 --> 36:46.900
not just a one-off tandem parachute jumps, for example.

36:48.220 --> 36:49.460
That's not quite enough for me.

36:49.460 --> 36:51.980
It's better to do a tandem parachute jump

36:51.980 --> 36:54.660
than never to, it is better to jump in tandem

36:54.660 --> 36:56.140
than never to jump at all.

36:56.140 --> 37:01.140
But it's, but really part of the experience

37:01.180 --> 37:04.180
is actually voluntarily getting up the guts

37:04.180 --> 37:06.460
to throw yourself out of an aeroplane,

37:06.460 --> 37:08.300
which is something no sane person would normally do

37:08.300 --> 37:10.300
when you realize what a wonderful experience it is.

37:10.300 --> 37:13.860
And so I like collecting these sort of experiences

37:13.860 --> 37:15.620
and going just a little bit further

37:15.620 --> 37:20.620
than knowing the bucket list I have jumped out

37:20.620 --> 37:24.580
of an aeroplane, but I'm not really an expert in anything.

37:25.700 --> 37:29.420
And for me, that's a fun way to spend life, right?

37:29.420 --> 37:31.220
You've done enough of these things

37:31.220 --> 37:34.340
that you can, when, if you read a book or watch a movie

37:34.340 --> 37:36.260
or hear someone talking about it,

37:36.260 --> 37:39.060
you'd say, yeah, I can empathize with that.

37:39.060 --> 37:42.060
I've been there, I know roughly what it's like

37:42.060 --> 37:45.740
in a way that you can't do

37:45.740 --> 37:47.860
if you haven't had that experience of it.

37:47.860 --> 37:48.980
Well, and I've been reflecting

37:48.980 --> 37:50.820
as you've been sharing these experiences

37:50.820 --> 37:55.820
on how I wonder if these sort of short-term dives

37:55.900 --> 37:58.780
into an experience, an adventure, let's call it,

37:58.780 --> 38:02.260
I wonder if they inform imagination for you

38:02.260 --> 38:05.300
because you mentioned seeing below the sea

38:05.300 --> 38:08.500
and the depths of the sea and how, if you've never done it,

38:08.500 --> 38:11.500
you don't even know what that reference point is like.

38:11.500 --> 38:14.220
And so I wonder if chasing adventure,

38:14.220 --> 38:17.540
both in these kinds of like paragliding

38:17.540 --> 38:19.620
and those kinds of physical activities,

38:19.620 --> 38:22.860
but also in exploring new technologies

38:22.860 --> 38:27.860
might inform our imagination as to pushing the boundaries

38:27.860 --> 38:29.780
of what's even possible.

38:29.780 --> 38:33.340
I think that's right because I think that

38:34.340 --> 38:36.140
innovation is a very strange thing.

38:36.140 --> 38:38.340
If we go back to technology for a moment,

38:38.340 --> 38:41.420
almost any invention is invented in dozens of places

38:41.420 --> 38:43.420
at the same time, particularly now, all right,

38:43.420 --> 38:45.900
because everybody has access to the same information.

38:45.900 --> 38:48.300
There are millions and millions of people out there.

38:48.300 --> 38:49.660
A lot of them are smart.

38:49.660 --> 38:51.460
They can all read the same papers

38:51.460 --> 38:54.660
or see the same websites or get access

38:54.660 --> 38:55.900
to the same technologies.

38:55.900 --> 39:00.900
And so this is, things get invented

39:00.900 --> 39:02.900
at the same time in multiple places.

39:02.900 --> 39:06.020
And this has always been the case.

39:06.020 --> 39:09.140
It's the story of Alexander Graham Bell

39:09.140 --> 39:11.060
and his patents for the telephone and so on

39:11.060 --> 39:12.180
is a really interesting one.

39:12.180 --> 39:15.700
There's another chap whose name I'm not gonna remember now.

39:15.700 --> 39:20.700
I want to say Edward, no, Thomas Gray, something like that.

39:20.700 --> 39:21.940
But it's interesting, isn't it,

39:21.940 --> 39:23.620
that I can't remember his name, right?

39:23.620 --> 39:25.980
And yet he actually has a much better claim

39:25.980 --> 39:27.300
to be the inventor of the telephone

39:27.300 --> 39:28.620
than Alexander Graham Bell does.

39:28.620 --> 39:32.380
And he, you know, the story goes that Bell

39:32.380 --> 39:34.460
just happened to have more friends in the patent office.

39:34.460 --> 39:41.460
And so, it's a nice joke, did you know that Leonardo da Vinci

39:41.460 --> 39:44.340
invented the first telephone, but it wasn't any use

39:44.340 --> 39:46.420
until Alexander Graham Bell invented the second one.

39:46.420 --> 39:47.940
And when he tried to call up Leonardo,

39:47.940 --> 39:50.340
he'd discovered he'd been dead for 400 years.

39:50.340 --> 40:03.580
But I think that most things are invented

40:03.580 --> 40:05.020
in many places at once.

40:05.020 --> 40:10.100
And so, often the way we take leaps forward in innovation

40:10.100 --> 40:12.460
is by cross fertilization.

40:12.460 --> 40:13.740
It's like genetics.

40:13.740 --> 40:16.820
It's when, you know, two species do manage to interbreed

40:16.820 --> 40:20.180
that you get something, you know, really new.

40:20.180 --> 40:25.940
When the genetic pool is made more diverse.

40:25.940 --> 40:28.740
And so, yeah, I think if you can mix with people

40:28.740 --> 40:32.980
from widely different disciplines and, you know,

40:32.980 --> 40:35.460
whether that's through your social circles or your church

40:35.460 --> 40:39.780
or your university or whatever it may be,

40:39.780 --> 40:41.820
if you can put yourself in a room where you discover

40:41.820 --> 40:43.900
that actually the thing you've been doing

40:43.900 --> 40:46.380
as a medical technology is actually very useful

40:46.380 --> 40:48.660
for scuba divers or the other way round,

40:48.660 --> 40:51.380
which might never occur to you if you haven't at least

40:51.380 --> 40:52.980
spent time with people who scuba dive

40:52.980 --> 40:54.220
or actually done it yourself.

40:54.220 --> 40:58.060
So, yes, perhaps there is something.

40:58.060 --> 41:00.220
I wouldn't want to read too much into that.

41:00.220 --> 41:06.060
But I do think that in the same way as, you know,

41:06.060 --> 41:09.140
human reproduction works by mixing gene pools, right?

41:09.140 --> 41:14.140
And that's a very effective way of coming up

41:14.140 --> 41:15.540
with new human beings.

41:15.540 --> 41:19.060
I think it can be a very effective way of coming up

41:19.060 --> 41:21.460
with new ideas.

41:21.460 --> 41:25.660
And if you have too limited a gene pool from which to draw,

41:25.660 --> 41:28.380
we know about the problems that that can cause with genetics

41:28.380 --> 41:30.900
in very small populations.

41:30.900 --> 41:37.220
And so I suspect the same is true of innovation and ideas.

41:37.220 --> 41:39.540
Richard Dawkins was right when he talked about memes

41:39.540 --> 41:40.260
in the early days.

41:40.260 --> 41:43.060
You know, he talked about memes long before memes became

41:43.060 --> 41:45.100
something that we talk about on the internet.

41:45.100 --> 41:49.860
And it was this idea of ideas that can reproduce themselves,

41:49.860 --> 41:53.060
be spread, and what causes an idea to be successful.

41:53.060 --> 41:55.940
And he was comparing that to natural selection

41:55.940 --> 41:57.140
and evolution.

41:57.140 --> 41:59.900
And, yes, I think you have to mix some ideas.

41:59.900 --> 42:03.420
So I don't know whether really my jumping out

42:03.420 --> 42:09.020
of planes on parachutes has had any real impact on my ability

42:09.020 --> 42:10.380
to come up with new technologies.

42:10.380 --> 42:11.940
But, you know, at least if you're

42:11.940 --> 42:14.260
interested in a wide range of different technologies,

42:14.260 --> 42:19.020
then perhaps you are more able to see opportunities

42:19.020 --> 42:20.300
when something new comes along.

42:20.300 --> 42:22.140
But I wouldn't really claim that for myself.

42:22.140 --> 42:24.260
But I think people are really good at this.

42:24.260 --> 42:26.420
Often it's because they read very widely,

42:26.420 --> 42:30.300
or they have a widely varied background.

42:30.300 --> 42:34.060
I'm curious, in the same vein as this discussion,

42:34.060 --> 42:36.420
I know you have a little bit of experience with the patent

42:36.420 --> 42:37.060
system.

42:37.060 --> 42:40.420
And I'm curious to hear from your perspective

42:40.420 --> 42:44.180
if you think the patent system is good,

42:44.180 --> 42:48.500
or if it's maybe a challenge for innovation in sharing ideas.

42:48.500 --> 42:51.860
Because it has this sort of maybe combative feel

42:51.860 --> 42:53.060
to it, from my perspective.

42:53.060 --> 42:54.100
It's really hard.

42:54.100 --> 42:56.580
I don't have a better answer to this, I think,

42:56.580 --> 43:00.060
than anyone else does.

43:00.060 --> 43:05.300
On the one hand, I think that patents are very, very often

43:05.300 --> 43:09.940
misapplied, or at least acquired for the wrong purposes.

43:09.940 --> 43:13.020
They are acquired often far too easily.

43:13.020 --> 43:15.180
Though I have to say, I haven't done this for a while.

43:15.180 --> 43:16.700
I did a lot of patent stuff in the past.

43:16.700 --> 43:17.900
I haven't done it for a while.

43:17.900 --> 43:19.460
It's a sort of an arms race.

43:19.460 --> 43:21.340
I mean, I don't know if it's still the case.

43:21.340 --> 43:25.180
IBM used to be the largest holder of patents,

43:25.180 --> 43:27.180
and certainly the most frequently acquiring.

43:27.180 --> 43:28.980
And I've worked out at one point that they,

43:28.980 --> 43:30.480
I can't remember the number, but they

43:30.480 --> 43:35.980
were gaining huge numbers of patents per day,

43:35.980 --> 43:37.420
certainly per week.

43:37.420 --> 43:39.340
And you think, where do these go?

43:39.340 --> 43:42.500
They aren't making use of all of these innovations.

43:42.500 --> 43:44.580
This is not to criticize IBM, by the way.

43:44.580 --> 43:46.900
Everybody does this, or lots of people do this.

43:46.900 --> 43:50.300
These are ideas that they've managed

43:50.300 --> 43:52.180
to get through the patent system,

43:52.180 --> 43:54.220
get some sort of stamp on them, and they

43:54.220 --> 43:55.700
go in a filing cabinet somewhere,

43:55.700 --> 43:57.780
or now in a database somewhere, just

43:57.780 --> 44:01.100
in case they ever need to be used against somebody else who's

44:01.100 --> 44:02.600
making patent claims against them.

44:02.600 --> 44:07.340
And you say, oh, well, we'll give you 50 of our patents

44:07.340 --> 44:10.340
in exchange for being able to make use of this one of yours

44:10.340 --> 44:10.860
and so on.

44:10.860 --> 44:14.660
And that just doesn't seem to me what the system was designed

44:14.660 --> 44:16.500
to do or is good at.

44:16.500 --> 44:19.060
There's also the problem with patents, certainly

44:19.060 --> 44:22.820
in the dot-com era and software in general,

44:22.820 --> 44:26.380
that software moves much faster than the patent office does.

44:26.380 --> 44:29.500
And technology often moves much faster than the patent office

44:29.500 --> 44:30.900
does.

44:30.900 --> 44:35.540
We would apply for intellectual property in some of my startups.

44:35.540 --> 44:38.260
And by the time it was granted, the company no longer

44:38.260 --> 44:41.540
existed, often, or had moved on to doing something

44:41.540 --> 44:43.700
completely different and so on.

44:43.700 --> 44:47.240
Having said all of that, I have been a great beneficiary

44:47.240 --> 44:49.900
of patents in the past, not my own.

44:49.900 --> 44:51.960
A good friend of mine, Martin King,

44:51.960 --> 44:54.140
who sadly is no longer with us, came up

44:54.140 --> 44:57.340
with the T9 predictive text system.

44:57.340 --> 44:58.380
Do you remember this?

44:58.380 --> 44:59.700
Yeah, of course, I do.

44:59.700 --> 45:02.240
And it was a real change in the way

45:02.240 --> 45:06.380
that your thumbs worked on early cell phones, for sure.

45:06.380 --> 45:11.380
For those younger than us, basically,

45:11.380 --> 45:14.580
on the old-style phone keyboard, you

45:14.580 --> 45:16.940
would have two or three letters assigned to each key.

45:16.940 --> 45:20.060
And if you wanted to send someone a text message

45:20.060 --> 45:21.540
and you wanted to type the letter O,

45:21.540 --> 45:25.320
you would have to press whatever it would be, a 6, three times.

45:25.320 --> 45:29.040
Because 6 meant M, N, and O, or whatever.

45:29.040 --> 45:31.380
And so you'd have to press it three times to get an O.

45:31.380 --> 45:36.300
And basically, what T9 did was use a dictionary lookup

45:36.300 --> 45:40.020
so that you would type the sequence of keys

45:40.020 --> 45:41.500
that you wanted, one per letter.

45:41.500 --> 45:43.580
And it would work out the very small number of words

45:43.580 --> 45:45.800
that could actually match that sequence of keys.

45:45.800 --> 45:47.760
And then you just had to pick between one or two of them

45:47.760 --> 45:48.800
if there was more than one.

45:48.800 --> 45:52.700
And so generally, you only had to press one key at a time.

45:52.700 --> 45:54.260
Now, actually, what's interesting here

45:54.260 --> 45:57.860
is that people often don't know where this came from.

45:57.860 --> 46:02.900
Martin was originally working on eye-tracking technologies

46:02.900 --> 46:06.060
for people with severe disabilities.

46:06.060 --> 46:08.180
So in the early days, this was, oh, gosh,

46:08.180 --> 46:10.740
this must be in the 80s or something.

46:10.740 --> 46:13.180
And he was looking at eye-trackers,

46:13.180 --> 46:16.180
which were big and bulky and very expensive

46:16.180 --> 46:18.980
and only worked if you held your head very, very still

46:18.980 --> 46:19.780
and so on.

46:19.780 --> 46:22.440
And he came up with a really low-cost, very simple way

46:22.440 --> 46:24.580
of doing basic eye-tracking, which

46:24.580 --> 46:28.580
was he had some glasses, which he wore, and little ring

46:28.580 --> 46:32.580
of LEDs around the rim of the eyes,

46:32.580 --> 46:34.740
and little optical sensors.

46:34.740 --> 46:36.140
So what would happen is basically,

46:36.140 --> 46:37.700
if you imagine each of these LEDs

46:37.700 --> 46:39.920
lights up in turn in a sort of clock pattern,

46:39.920 --> 46:43.020
I think there were 10 or 12 around your eye.

46:43.020 --> 46:46.700
And as it lit up, another 10 or 12

46:46.700 --> 46:49.500
optical sensors would pick up how much reflection

46:49.500 --> 46:51.420
there was from your eye.

46:51.420 --> 46:55.020
And so very simple, no vision, no cameras, no anything here.

46:55.020 --> 46:56.380
We're talking about the 80s.

46:56.380 --> 47:00.060
But because your eyeball is not spherical,

47:00.060 --> 47:03.020
the different readings that you got from this,

47:03.020 --> 47:04.780
from this one LED and the 10 sensors,

47:04.780 --> 47:05.980
would read different amounts.

47:05.980 --> 47:07.620
And so they could work out roughly which direction

47:07.620 --> 47:08.620
you were looking.

47:08.620 --> 47:12.920
And you then move on to the next LED and light it up again

47:12.920 --> 47:14.660
and pick it up with the 10 sensors.

47:14.660 --> 47:16.260
And you basically do that very fast.

47:16.260 --> 47:18.740
So what you got when you're wearing these glasses

47:18.740 --> 47:20.820
was, in the periphery of your vision,

47:20.820 --> 47:23.900
you would see these glowing red spots.

47:23.900 --> 47:25.900
And you could look in their direction.

47:25.900 --> 47:27.900
And the system could tell that your eyes were

47:27.900 --> 47:29.340
moving in this direction.

47:29.340 --> 47:33.300
And so for people suffering from paraplegia or other problems,

47:33.300 --> 47:36.900
you could start picking up signals, serious signals,

47:36.900 --> 47:38.700
just from eye movements.

47:38.700 --> 47:41.460
And so the next question he had was,

47:41.460 --> 47:45.240
can you actually type on a 10-key keyboard

47:45.240 --> 47:47.540
if you've only essentially got 10 different positions

47:47.540 --> 47:48.020
you can look at?

47:48.020 --> 47:49.820
And he did a lot of work on this and then

47:49.820 --> 47:51.340
and how you would disambiguate.

47:51.340 --> 47:52.300
And then he realized that there were

47:52.300 --> 47:57.300
other things around which had sort of 10, 12-key keyboards.

47:57.300 --> 47:59.980
And so this technology got used in mobile phones.

47:59.980 --> 48:02.720
And it was interesting for a whole variety of reasons.

48:02.720 --> 48:05.620
Because now we live in a world with app stores and so on.

48:05.620 --> 48:09.180
This was just about the first third-party technology

48:09.180 --> 48:13.020
that was really sold to Motorola and Ericsson and Nokia

48:13.020 --> 48:16.220
and so on and embedded in all of those phones.

48:16.220 --> 48:18.940
Back then, it changed the way people typed.

48:18.940 --> 48:21.660
We were talking about keyboards, right?

48:21.660 --> 48:22.980
Yeah, certainly a full circle.

48:22.980 --> 48:23.820
Yeah, that's right.

48:23.820 --> 48:28.180
And so Martin and the company he started,

48:28.180 --> 48:31.300
TJ, which was based in Seattle, got some good patents on this.

48:31.300 --> 48:36.700
And they were sold to AOL at just the right time.

48:36.700 --> 48:39.060
And Martin, therefore, had reasonable resources

48:39.060 --> 48:41.060
just at the time that I became friends with him.

48:41.060 --> 48:43.260
And we went off and did various projects together.

48:43.260 --> 48:46.280
And so I have to say that a small number of good patents

48:46.280 --> 48:48.660
indirectly funded my salary for many years.

48:48.660 --> 48:51.260
And several startups I was involved in.

48:51.260 --> 48:53.820
And I think they were valid patents.

48:53.820 --> 48:58.220
And I have come across many valid patents which

48:58.220 --> 49:00.500
have done what the patent system is meant to do.

49:00.500 --> 49:03.220
And I think they do this in a lot of fields.

49:03.220 --> 49:06.900
But whether they really do it in my own field of software

49:06.900 --> 49:09.100
and computing, very often, I'm not at all sure.

49:09.100 --> 49:13.500
So I have very mixed feelings about the patent system.

49:13.500 --> 49:15.420
I think it's widely abused.

49:15.420 --> 49:18.380
Do I think the world would be better without it at all?

49:18.380 --> 49:19.300
I'm not sure.

49:19.300 --> 49:20.340
I'm not sure.

49:20.340 --> 49:23.820
I think 50 years ago, they were very valuable.

49:23.820 --> 49:26.660
And now, if you got rid of the patent system,

49:26.660 --> 49:28.540
I wonder what would happen.

49:28.540 --> 49:31.260
The argument in favor of it is usually

49:31.260 --> 49:34.340
that things like pharmaceuticals that take many, many years

49:34.340 --> 49:38.620
to produce and are terribly expensive to produce only work.

49:38.620 --> 49:41.700
You can only make that viable on a commercial basis

49:41.700 --> 49:45.340
if you can then protect the results of your work.

49:45.340 --> 49:48.180
And of course, the whole idea originally of the patent system

49:48.180 --> 49:51.660
was the alternative is to keep everything a secret.

49:51.660 --> 49:54.980
You never reveal anything about how your product works,

49:54.980 --> 49:57.020
how your drug works, how whatever.

49:57.020 --> 49:58.620
You keep it as a trade secret, which

49:58.620 --> 50:00.420
is a very nice alternative to patenting

50:00.420 --> 50:03.180
if you can keep secret how your app works

50:03.180 --> 50:06.580
or your technology works.

50:06.580 --> 50:08.340
But the problem is then that there

50:08.340 --> 50:10.820
is an incentive for people never to reveal anything

50:10.820 --> 50:11.860
about their discoveries.

50:11.860 --> 50:14.220
And so the patent system is designed

50:14.220 --> 50:16.340
to give you a monopoly for a while

50:16.340 --> 50:19.340
in exchange for sharing your knowledge with others.

50:19.340 --> 50:24.340
But when there are so many thousand new patents per day

50:24.340 --> 50:27.100
filed for tiny little things, and so many of them

50:27.100 --> 50:29.820
are invalidated, in the end, so much of the patent system

50:29.820 --> 50:31.540
and whether a patent is successful

50:31.540 --> 50:34.260
just depends on who can afford the most expensive lawyers

50:34.260 --> 50:35.700
if it's ever challenged.

50:35.700 --> 50:38.140
Then I'm not sure how much it really fulfills those roles.

50:38.140 --> 50:41.140
But the basic idea of the patent system I think is a good one.

50:41.140 --> 50:44.380
But it's undergoing many challenges at the moment.

50:44.380 --> 50:45.980
It brings me to two thoughts, and I

50:45.980 --> 50:48.380
think I'll touch on one at a time here.

50:48.380 --> 50:53.860
I see some relations to open source software in this regard

50:53.860 --> 50:56.500
because one group of people who are writing software,

50:56.500 --> 50:59.820
generally the open source stuff, is they're free to share it.

50:59.820 --> 51:02.380
They feel like sharing it is one of its best features

51:02.380 --> 51:05.940
and yet want to guarantee that it's being shared.

51:05.940 --> 51:08.100
And it feels like patents in some way,

51:08.100 --> 51:13.580
it's a way of sharing and yet giving credit where it's due.

51:13.580 --> 51:16.660
Do you feel like there are some similarities there?

51:16.660 --> 51:18.260
And do you think open source software has

51:18.260 --> 51:20.180
some of the similar challenges?

51:20.180 --> 51:21.460
I guess that's right.

51:21.460 --> 51:25.500
Open source, particularly the old GNU public license,

51:25.500 --> 51:27.700
which for those who don't know, basically

51:27.700 --> 51:32.340
said that we are sharing this technology.

51:32.340 --> 51:34.620
So for example, you write a program,

51:34.620 --> 51:36.780
so much of the modern web, so much of the internet

51:36.780 --> 51:38.940
runs on open source software, which was often

51:38.940 --> 51:41.980
shared with this basic license, which says it's here,

51:41.980 --> 51:44.780
it's freely available, you can use it, you can modify it,

51:44.780 --> 51:46.700
you can redistribute it.

51:46.700 --> 51:49.340
But if you redistribute it, you have to redistribute it

51:49.340 --> 51:50.620
on these same terms.

51:50.620 --> 51:53.820
So if you come and you make an enhanced version,

51:53.820 --> 51:56.100
you can use it in your product, but you also

51:56.100 --> 51:59.500
have to give away the source code for the software

51:59.500 --> 52:02.620
in the same way as you got it for free in the first place.

52:02.620 --> 52:06.100
And I'm simplifying here.

52:06.100 --> 52:08.340
There are many other different open source licenses

52:08.340 --> 52:10.780
which don't say that, but that was

52:10.780 --> 52:14.580
one of the key ones that drove a lot of the original open source

52:14.580 --> 52:15.460
movement.

52:15.460 --> 52:19.700
And I think it has, in general, worked very well.

52:19.700 --> 52:24.140
And so much of the modern world runs on open source software.

52:24.140 --> 52:28.460
It is phenomenal, actually, that that has basically won.

52:28.460 --> 52:32.820
It hasn't necessarily won on the desktop for most people,

52:32.820 --> 52:39.180
but so much of Amazon and Google and the internet

52:39.180 --> 52:41.340
infrastructure as a whole just wouldn't

52:41.340 --> 52:44.860
exist in their current form without open source software.

52:44.860 --> 52:48.340
It has ended up being the model that has worked there.

52:48.340 --> 52:51.500
And in the past, there have been various attempts

52:51.500 --> 52:54.820
by companies like Microsoft to capture

52:54.820 --> 52:56.780
a segment of the internet and control it,

52:56.780 --> 52:59.300
or often the whole internet.

52:59.300 --> 53:01.860
And they haven't been able to because the open source,

53:01.860 --> 53:05.300
firstly, the open source product has been better.

53:05.300 --> 53:07.500
And secondly, the people who are actually

53:07.500 --> 53:09.900
going and implementing, the people who are going and creating

53:09.900 --> 53:11.580
their new products based on the internet

53:11.580 --> 53:13.540
some want to use the open source one

53:13.540 --> 53:15.460
because they can see its advantages.

53:15.460 --> 53:17.220
And that's not always the case, of course.

53:17.220 --> 53:20.260
But as a general rule, there is certainly

53:20.260 --> 53:23.540
a very big part of our modern world

53:23.540 --> 53:25.660
that is driven by open source.

53:25.660 --> 53:28.300
And not everybody recognizes that, I think,

53:28.300 --> 53:31.660
that this model has worked amazingly well.

53:31.660 --> 53:35.060
There are now a variety of open source licenses.

53:35.060 --> 53:38.100
And you can pick if you want to give your stuff away

53:38.100 --> 53:39.420
to the world.

53:39.420 --> 53:42.500
Often, this is driven by, I'm happy for anybody in the world

53:42.500 --> 53:43.860
to use this.

53:43.860 --> 53:46.620
But if anybody starts making money out of it,

53:46.620 --> 53:48.580
I think I should have some share.

53:48.580 --> 53:51.580
Or different people have different motivations, right?

53:51.580 --> 53:53.980
If I give this away, is it really

53:53.980 --> 53:56.700
right that somebody else takes this and then goes and makes

53:56.700 --> 54:00.980
lots of money from it, directly taking my product?

54:00.980 --> 54:04.540
And so the degree to which you allow

54:04.540 --> 54:06.460
the stuff that you've given away to become

54:06.460 --> 54:08.100
part of a commercial product is often

54:08.100 --> 54:10.580
the basis of various different open source licenses.

54:10.580 --> 54:12.180
So I'm a huge fan of open source.

54:12.180 --> 54:13.380
I use it all the time.

54:13.380 --> 54:14.780
I make my living from it.

54:14.780 --> 54:17.620
I have written various open source projects.

54:17.620 --> 54:20.180
The discussion about open source versus copyright

54:20.180 --> 54:20.860
is a common one.

54:20.860 --> 54:23.940
The discussion about open source versus the patent system

54:23.940 --> 54:27.500
and how those are related isn't considered very carefully.

54:27.500 --> 54:29.500
The original GNU public license did

54:29.500 --> 54:33.180
allow people to release software without losing

54:33.180 --> 54:35.460
complete control of it.

54:35.460 --> 54:37.620
And so probably encouraged an awful lot

54:37.620 --> 54:40.300
of idea sharing in a way that might not

54:40.300 --> 54:42.460
have happened if it was a case of either give it away

54:42.460 --> 54:44.180
or keep it completely secret.

54:44.180 --> 54:46.420
And so I guess the patent system is a bit like that.

54:46.420 --> 54:49.260
Yes, it encourages people to share things

54:49.260 --> 54:52.460
and, in exchange, gives them some rights.

54:52.460 --> 54:55.660
But how well the patent system works, I think,

54:55.660 --> 54:57.460
is questionable.

54:57.460 --> 54:59.820
Open source, I think, has often proven to be rather better,

54:59.820 --> 55:01.980
though it wouldn't be applicable to all the cases

55:01.980 --> 55:04.140
that the patent system applies to.

55:04.140 --> 55:06.420
One of the very large innovations in software,

55:06.420 --> 55:11.260
as you mentioned, is permissive open source kind of licensing,

55:11.260 --> 55:13.700
which has enabled innovation between groups

55:13.700 --> 55:17.260
and often between people who don't even know each other

55:17.260 --> 55:20.940
and do get connected because they have shared ideas.

55:20.940 --> 55:24.220
And yet I wonder, maybe the patent system is,

55:24.220 --> 55:26.380
I was going to go somewhere, but now I'm reconsidering.

55:26.380 --> 55:29.620
I was going to say, maybe the patent system is licensing

55:29.620 --> 55:31.660
for physical products, but these days it's not.

55:31.660 --> 55:33.540
It's just for intellectual property, isn't it?

55:33.540 --> 55:35.900
Well, the patent system, exactly what you can do

55:35.900 --> 55:37.860
varies a bit around the world as well.

55:37.860 --> 55:40.980
So I'm rusty on this, but it certainly

55:40.980 --> 55:43.900
used to be the case that business process patents,

55:43.900 --> 55:46.940
for example, were things that you could file in the States,

55:46.940 --> 55:50.500
but certainly not in general here and in Europe, I think.

55:50.500 --> 55:55.060
So a method of doing business wasn't

55:55.060 --> 55:56.700
the same around the world in terms

55:56.700 --> 55:59.220
of what you could patent, the degree to which you could

55:59.220 --> 56:03.020
patent a software algorithm has also

56:03.020 --> 56:05.100
varied in different parts of the world.

56:05.100 --> 56:08.900
So what works in one place doesn't work in others.

56:08.900 --> 56:11.260
I mean, I think there is a problem with patents

56:11.260 --> 56:14.860
that they're very cheap to apply for,

56:14.860 --> 56:17.580
and they are very expensive to maintain.

56:17.580 --> 56:22.500
If you actually want to get one and look after it and keep

56:22.500 --> 56:25.740
it valid and extend it to cover the whole world and so on,

56:25.740 --> 56:28.140
that starts to become a fairly expensive process.

56:28.140 --> 56:30.180
Just getting a patent in the first place,

56:30.180 --> 56:32.020
particularly if you write it yourself

56:32.020 --> 56:34.860
and don't use a lawyer and file it in,

56:34.860 --> 56:37.140
it's much cheaper here, I think, than in the States,

56:37.140 --> 56:37.660
for example.

56:37.660 --> 56:39.420
You can get a patent for a couple of hundred dollars

56:39.420 --> 56:41.660
kind of thing if you're willing to do the work yourself

56:41.660 --> 56:42.860
and you're good at it.

56:42.860 --> 56:48.700
But as soon as that passes certain deadlines,

56:48.700 --> 56:50.140
starts to become international, and so it

56:50.140 --> 56:51.860
starts to become very expensive, which

56:51.860 --> 56:56.940
is good because it means that you don't get patents kept

56:56.940 --> 56:58.660
around for frivolous reasons.

56:58.660 --> 57:01.260
Often, they do become too expensive to maintain,

57:01.260 --> 57:04.700
and so the ideas behind them are kind of released

57:04.700 --> 57:06.020
into the public domain.

57:06.020 --> 57:09.420
But the downside is that big corporations

57:09.420 --> 57:12.700
can afford to keep maintaining them and expanding them

57:12.700 --> 57:16.180
and extending them, whereas small individual inventors

57:16.180 --> 57:19.700
often can't or small startup companies often can't.

57:19.700 --> 57:23.420
And that means that it's often those big companies that

57:23.420 --> 57:26.180
have fewer incentives actually to release this stuff

57:26.180 --> 57:28.020
into the world, which is why I talked about this idea

57:28.020 --> 57:28.860
of an arms race.

57:28.860 --> 57:30.620
You know, you sort of keep a filing cabinet

57:30.620 --> 57:34.220
full of patents almost as a currency

57:34.220 --> 57:37.140
so that you can exchange, you know, if you're Nokia,

57:37.140 --> 57:40.740
you can exchange them with whoever your competition might

57:40.740 --> 57:43.020
be when you find that they have a patent that you want

57:43.020 --> 57:43.900
to license.

57:43.900 --> 57:45.900
And it seems to me that it's used a lot for that

57:45.900 --> 57:48.340
and that they are harder.

57:48.340 --> 57:50.340
They're nice and easy to get, but they're much harder

57:50.340 --> 57:53.700
to actually make use of if you are a smaller company.

57:53.700 --> 57:56.140
So I think that's a challenge.

57:56.140 --> 57:59.700
You know, you did talk about how computers and software

57:59.700 --> 58:04.300
and the ideas around that world are some of the most creative.

58:04.300 --> 58:06.540
And one question that has just stuck with me

58:06.540 --> 58:08.940
since you mentioned that, that I hadn't got a chance to ask,

58:08.940 --> 58:13.260
was I wondered what issues or problems in the world

58:13.260 --> 58:18.100
you were hoping that computers and technology might solve

58:18.100 --> 58:20.460
that you're not seeing currently solved?

58:20.460 --> 58:24.100
Is there anything that really, like, gets to your heart

58:24.100 --> 58:27.900
and you think, oh, I would really love that to be

58:27.900 --> 58:31.100
innovated on or solved for a small group of people

58:31.100 --> 58:32.460
or a large group of people?

58:32.460 --> 58:35.020
There are lots of little issues it would be nice to solve,

58:35.020 --> 58:36.900
and they are very much first world problems.

58:36.900 --> 58:41.380
And I am conscious that I do live very much now.

58:41.380 --> 58:43.100
I was born in Africa, actually.

58:43.100 --> 58:46.660
I was born in a very poor area of Africa.

58:46.660 --> 58:48.580
But I only lived there for my first three years.

58:48.580 --> 58:51.300
But that's always been part of my sort of upbringing.

58:51.300 --> 58:54.460
My parents were very much involved in dealing

58:54.460 --> 58:56.940
with people at the opposite end of the economic spectrum.

58:56.940 --> 59:00.420
And so this is sort of in my bloodstream a bit.

59:00.420 --> 59:03.820
I've always been conscious about how fortunate we are

59:03.820 --> 59:08.100
and how far most of the world is from this.

59:08.100 --> 59:12.900
But it is the case that technology has

59:12.900 --> 59:15.060
made this huge difference.

59:15.060 --> 59:19.460
So I was involved, we mentioned earlier, in Dio.

59:19.460 --> 59:22.940
So this was a not-for-profit organization

59:22.940 --> 59:24.340
that Martin and I set up.

59:24.340 --> 59:27.420
And Dio is the Swahili word for yes.

59:27.420 --> 59:28.940
Lovely.

59:28.940 --> 59:32.260
So it's a terrible name for an organization

59:32.260 --> 59:34.060
because nobody knows how to pronounce it.

59:34.060 --> 59:37.300
Or indeed, if you hear it, nobody knows how to spell it.

59:37.300 --> 59:40.020
We were looking for an idea for this startup

59:40.020 --> 59:42.780
that we thought would have some benefits for the developing

59:42.780 --> 59:44.740
world, and we wanted something that

59:44.740 --> 59:48.260
was positive and affirmative.

59:48.260 --> 59:51.420
But we used to tell people that that's

59:51.420 --> 59:53.500
what we were looking for in our brand, something

59:53.500 --> 59:54.860
that was international and affirmative,

59:54.860 --> 59:55.660
and that was all rubbish.

59:55.660 --> 59:58.060
What we were actually looking for was a domain name.

59:58.060 --> 01:00:01.900
And I looked for all of the names

01:00:01.900 --> 01:00:04.940
I could think of in English and French and German and so on.

01:00:04.940 --> 01:00:09.820
And I thought, well, let's try Swahili.

01:00:09.820 --> 01:00:13.860
Because I knew a little Swahili, not very much now.

01:00:13.860 --> 01:00:17.340
But sure enough, the first word I typed in was yes.

01:00:17.340 --> 01:00:20.940
And I could get ndio.com, ndio.org, ndio.basically

01:00:20.940 --> 01:00:22.060
anything I wanted.

01:00:22.060 --> 01:00:22.940
And so I grabbed it.

01:00:22.940 --> 01:00:25.380
And we used to claim that this was the reason we

01:00:25.380 --> 01:00:28.460
had named this organization the positive yes

01:00:28.460 --> 01:00:29.980
as an African world.

01:00:29.980 --> 01:00:32.780
Swahili is a fairly major language.

01:00:32.780 --> 01:00:37.420
It's I think the first language of about 50 million people

01:00:37.420 --> 01:00:40.220
or something, and the second language of quite a few more.

01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:42.900
And yet, I realized after a while

01:00:42.900 --> 01:00:47.660
that the fact that I was so easily able to get

01:00:47.660 --> 01:00:51.300
the word yes in this major language

01:00:51.300 --> 01:00:53.460
was actually quite significant.

01:00:53.460 --> 01:00:56.380
It was indicative of the problem we were trying to solve.

01:00:56.380 --> 01:01:02.220
Why was it that after the DNS system had become crowded,

01:01:02.220 --> 01:01:05.180
every word in English had been snapped up pretty much,

01:01:05.180 --> 01:01:07.700
and we were trying to come up with a word for an organization

01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:11.500
that I could still get the word yes in Swahili?

01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:14.220
And it showed just how little internet coverage

01:01:14.220 --> 01:01:16.700
there was in East Africa.

01:01:16.700 --> 01:01:19.420
And so after a while, I actually started

01:01:19.420 --> 01:01:24.380
to tell this story because what we were trying to do

01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:28.980
was bring computational power to large numbers of people

01:01:28.980 --> 01:01:31.140
who couldn't otherwise afford it.

01:01:31.140 --> 01:01:34.220
And the way we were doing this was at the time,

01:01:34.220 --> 01:01:35.940
the thing that was really expensive,

01:01:35.940 --> 01:01:38.420
and as it happened also very environmentally unfriendly,

01:01:38.420 --> 01:01:40.140
was building a PC.

01:01:40.140 --> 01:01:42.780
And the screens were less expensive then.

01:01:42.780 --> 01:01:44.500
The keyboards and mice were less expensive.

01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:45.980
The PC was the expensive bit.

01:01:45.980 --> 01:01:49.900
And so we thought, could we use open source software

01:01:49.900 --> 01:01:53.540
to share a PC effectively between several people

01:01:53.540 --> 01:01:55.660
rather than, say, in an internet cafe

01:01:55.660 --> 01:01:58.300
having one PC at each desk?

01:01:58.300 --> 01:02:01.780
PCs were, thanks to Moore's law, were eight times faster

01:02:01.780 --> 01:02:02.980
than they were three years ago.

01:02:02.980 --> 01:02:04.860
But people weren't typing eight times as fast,

01:02:04.860 --> 01:02:07.100
and they weren't reading web pages eight times as fast.

01:02:07.100 --> 01:02:10.020
So we should be able to share a PC between eight people

01:02:10.020 --> 01:02:12.340
and they would have, okay, they would have the experience

01:02:12.340 --> 01:02:13.900
that you might have had two or three years ago,

01:02:13.900 --> 01:02:15.540
but that was just fine.

01:02:15.540 --> 01:02:18.660
And if you could share the cost of a PC,

01:02:18.660 --> 01:02:21.620
just halve it or even more than that,

01:02:21.620 --> 01:02:24.300
then you massively increase the number of people

01:02:24.300 --> 01:02:27.060
who could have access to that kind of technology.

01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:28.420
And this was at about the time

01:02:28.420 --> 01:02:30.540
where everything was starting to be digitized.

01:02:30.540 --> 01:02:33.020
If you don't have access to a PC back then,

01:02:33.020 --> 01:02:35.860
it was like, well, why would these people want spreadsheets?

01:02:35.860 --> 01:02:38.260
Well, the answer is that we could see

01:02:38.260 --> 01:02:40.260
that the world was moving towards digital music

01:02:40.260 --> 01:02:42.620
and digital photography and digital dictionaries

01:02:42.620 --> 01:02:46.220
and digital Wikipedias and all of this stuff.

01:02:46.220 --> 01:02:50.500
And the more of the world you could give access to that way,

01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:51.340
the better.

01:02:51.340 --> 01:02:54.100
So we had a technology that we thought would enable that,

01:02:54.100 --> 01:02:55.860
and it was a fun project.

01:02:55.860 --> 01:02:58.180
And when you work on a project like this,

01:02:58.180 --> 01:03:01.460
which is basically for whatever reason you hope

01:03:01.460 --> 01:03:03.340
for the good of humanity,

01:03:03.340 --> 01:03:05.260
by the way, you can get really good publicity.

01:03:05.260 --> 01:03:07.060
Journalists love to talk to you.

01:03:07.060 --> 01:03:10.860
People like a good news story for their news articles.

01:03:10.860 --> 01:03:13.540
It's much more interesting than the latest product

01:03:13.540 --> 01:03:15.380
from some big corporate manufacturer.

01:03:15.380 --> 01:03:17.340
If you can say this idea that might change

01:03:17.340 --> 01:03:20.820
the way internet cafes are built in Tanzania

01:03:20.820 --> 01:03:23.820
is a much more interesting story for many people.

01:03:23.820 --> 01:03:25.420
So it's a really fun thing to work on.

01:03:25.420 --> 01:03:27.540
If you get the chance to work on technology

01:03:27.540 --> 01:03:30.340
for the poorer sections of society,

01:03:30.340 --> 01:03:32.420
I would really recommend it

01:03:32.420 --> 01:03:33.940
because it can be very satisfying

01:03:33.940 --> 01:03:35.380
and can make quite a difference.

01:03:35.380 --> 01:03:36.700
Now, in our particular case,

01:03:36.700 --> 01:03:39.620
the technology we developed didn't take off so much

01:03:39.620 --> 01:03:43.140
for that particular use because what we failed to predict

01:03:43.140 --> 01:03:47.700
was the sudden and massive spread of smartphones,

01:03:47.700 --> 01:03:49.580
which were completely unknown pretty much

01:03:49.580 --> 01:03:50.860
when we started the project

01:03:50.860 --> 01:03:52.220
and of course took over the world.

01:03:52.220 --> 01:03:54.100
And this is often the case.

01:03:54.100 --> 01:03:57.300
And we were doing this just about the same time

01:03:57.300 --> 01:04:00.740
as the one laptop per child project,

01:04:00.740 --> 01:04:01.860
Nicholas Negroponte's thing,

01:04:01.860 --> 01:04:05.900
which is often now derided as a failure.

01:04:05.900 --> 01:04:08.380
But I think it was incredibly important

01:04:08.380 --> 01:04:12.220
because for those who don't know the story,

01:04:12.220 --> 01:04:15.020
this was a team based at MIT originally

01:04:15.020 --> 01:04:18.820
who said we're gonna produce a $100 laptop,

01:04:18.820 --> 01:04:20.660
which was completely unthinkable at the time.

01:04:20.660 --> 01:04:24.780
You know, laptops cost $1,000, not $100.

01:04:24.780 --> 01:04:27.020
And this one laptop per child idea

01:04:27.020 --> 01:04:28.900
that could you give everybody in the world

01:04:28.900 --> 01:04:30.940
or at least a much larger number of people in the world

01:04:30.940 --> 01:04:34.260
a laptop was so outrageous

01:04:34.260 --> 01:04:38.220
that it got lots of attention and in the end failed,

01:04:38.220 --> 01:04:39.780
they didn't actually manage to do this.

01:04:39.780 --> 01:04:43.540
But what they did do was dramatically cut the cost

01:04:43.540 --> 01:04:46.300
of a large number of technologies.

01:04:46.300 --> 01:04:50.020
You know, you can now buy extremely cheap laptops,

01:04:50.020 --> 01:04:51.660
not necessarily very good ones,

01:04:51.660 --> 01:04:53.660
but you may not be in a financial position

01:04:53.660 --> 01:04:56.220
to have that choice in a way that you really couldn't,

01:04:56.220 --> 01:04:58.220
I think before the one laptop per child

01:04:58.220 --> 01:05:00.100
just really got people saying,

01:05:00.100 --> 01:05:02.700
how cheap could you make this technology?

01:05:02.700 --> 01:05:05.140
And showing that it was possible

01:05:05.140 --> 01:05:07.060
to get at least close to that number,

01:05:07.060 --> 01:05:08.980
which was a completely unthinkable number beforehand.

01:05:08.980 --> 01:05:10.820
So I always see that as a success.

01:05:10.820 --> 01:05:13.500
I do think that it was just after that

01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:16.540
that people started producing these very cheap netbooks

01:05:16.540 --> 01:05:17.900
and other machines,

01:05:17.900 --> 01:05:20.140
which did actually make quite a difference

01:05:20.140 --> 01:05:21.500
in large parts of the world.

01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:23.380
It's just that the mobile phone came along

01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:25.500
as it happened and became the dominant way

01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:27.220
that people access the internet.

01:05:27.220 --> 01:05:30.140
Well, and also the mobile phone is wonderful

01:05:30.140 --> 01:05:33.300
in that there are flagship versions

01:05:33.300 --> 01:05:36.100
that are a thousand plus dollars

01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:38.820
for some of the most advanced people who are doing,

01:05:38.820 --> 01:05:40.740
well, hopefully they're using their cell phone

01:05:40.740 --> 01:05:41.980
to its max potential.

01:05:41.980 --> 01:05:44.260
I don't think that's actually true most of the time,

01:05:44.260 --> 01:05:46.460
but you also see cell phones these days

01:05:46.460 --> 01:05:49.500
that are sub $100 that are somewhat reasonable

01:05:49.500 --> 01:05:52.700
or the used market because of the nature of mobile phones

01:05:52.700 --> 01:05:56.700
is filled with three-year-old flagships

01:05:56.700 --> 01:06:00.220
that are the price of a few cups of coffee.

01:06:00.220 --> 01:06:02.940
So there's something to be said for that, too.

01:06:02.940 --> 01:06:04.260
Yes, and it's great fun watching

01:06:04.260 --> 01:06:07.420
how other parts of the world leapfrog bits of technology.

01:06:07.420 --> 01:06:10.900
So in many parts of Africa,

01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:13.860
they didn't really ever have credit cards.

01:06:13.860 --> 01:06:15.700
They went straight from cash payments

01:06:15.700 --> 01:06:17.740
to mobile phone-based payments

01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:19.540
without that intervening technology,

01:06:19.540 --> 01:06:21.260
whereas- Probably a good thing.

01:06:21.260 --> 01:06:23.660
Probably a good thing, right, yes.

01:06:23.660 --> 01:06:27.100
And they often went from never having a phone line

01:06:27.100 --> 01:06:29.700
to having a mobile phone without landlines in between

01:06:29.700 --> 01:06:33.940
and so on, and it's fun to see what works

01:06:33.940 --> 01:06:37.340
in different places for a whole variety of reasons.

01:06:37.340 --> 01:06:41.100
It sometimes places leapfrog technologies.

01:06:41.100 --> 01:06:44.980
So even in the sort of first world,

01:06:44.980 --> 01:06:49.020
we, for a while, we had, in general,

01:06:49.020 --> 01:06:51.900
much better mobile phones here in Europe

01:06:51.900 --> 01:06:54.100
than in North America,

01:06:54.100 --> 01:06:56.940
and that was because you got them earlier in North America,

01:06:56.940 --> 01:07:01.180
and so they were analog-based.

01:07:01.180 --> 01:07:05.340
And so there was much more inertia there.

01:07:05.340 --> 01:07:06.940
We kind of started, I mean,

01:07:06.940 --> 01:07:08.460
we did have analog mobile phones here,

01:07:08.460 --> 01:07:10.540
but essentially the mass deployment of mobile phones

01:07:10.540 --> 01:07:13.660
was a bit later here and was based on digital standards,

01:07:13.660 --> 01:07:15.380
whereas it started in the States on analog

01:07:15.380 --> 01:07:17.780
and therefore was much harder to shift over.

01:07:17.780 --> 01:07:21.180
And so often places that get technologies later

01:07:21.180 --> 01:07:24.220
get a chance to take advantage of the developments

01:07:24.220 --> 01:07:26.500
that have been done elsewhere, and that can be quite fun.

01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:28.140
Yeah, huge advantage for sure.

01:07:28.140 --> 01:07:31.940
Quentin, I'm realizing we've had a lovely conversation

01:07:31.940 --> 01:07:34.540
and time has totally just passed so quickly.

01:07:34.540 --> 01:07:37.620
We've been talking for a long time, haven't we?

01:07:37.620 --> 01:07:38.940
I didn't know we were going anywhere

01:07:38.940 --> 01:07:42.140
in this sort of direction, but...

01:07:42.140 --> 01:07:43.940
I think it's been lovely.

01:07:43.940 --> 01:07:47.980
I typically, you know, I read a rather long description

01:07:47.980 --> 01:07:49.540
of some of the things that you've done in the past,

01:07:49.540 --> 01:07:51.780
and I only think we've touched on two or three of them.

01:07:51.780 --> 01:07:56.780
So I think I would love to have you back for another chat.

01:07:57.220 --> 01:07:58.340
That would be delightful.

01:07:58.340 --> 01:07:59.460
Well, thank you.

01:07:59.460 --> 01:08:01.940
But I do have a question for you.

01:08:01.940 --> 01:08:04.100
It's a little bit related to what we just touched on,

01:08:04.100 --> 01:08:06.620
and maybe it's a nice segue.

01:08:06.620 --> 01:08:09.780
I was curious if there is something

01:08:09.780 --> 01:08:13.180
that you would like to share with listeners.

01:08:13.180 --> 01:08:15.860
Maybe you want to nudge them to think about

01:08:15.860 --> 01:08:20.340
a certain problem or there's some great book

01:08:20.340 --> 01:08:21.980
you've read recently or something like that.

01:08:21.980 --> 01:08:23.220
Is there anything you'd like to share?

01:08:23.220 --> 01:08:24.060
Okay, yes.

01:08:24.060 --> 01:08:26.260
Well, I have a couple, okay, I've got a couple of ideas.

01:08:26.260 --> 01:08:27.420
One is a book.

01:08:27.420 --> 01:08:28.260
One is a book.

01:08:28.260 --> 01:08:31.140
So yes, I would like to recommend

01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:34.140
Charles Arthur's book called Social Warming.

01:08:34.140 --> 01:08:36.660
Now, due disclosure, Charles is a friend of mine,

01:08:36.660 --> 01:08:40.940
but he's a very respected tech journalist and writer

01:08:40.940 --> 01:08:44.380
who has written for many publications here in the UK

01:08:44.380 --> 01:08:45.980
and internationally.

01:08:45.980 --> 01:08:49.100
And he's written a book called Social Warming,

01:08:49.100 --> 01:08:50.660
which I think is a very good book.

01:08:50.660 --> 01:08:54.780
In fact, I hesitate to use the phrase required reading,

01:08:54.780 --> 01:08:57.140
but I do think actually it is very important

01:08:57.140 --> 01:08:58.260
for people to read.

01:08:58.260 --> 01:09:00.980
And the basic idea of social warming,

01:09:00.980 --> 01:09:05.020
the reason he uses that title is that he's comparing it,

01:09:05.020 --> 01:09:06.580
obviously, to global warming,

01:09:06.580 --> 01:09:08.100
the effect of social networks

01:09:08.100 --> 01:09:11.740
and the effect of the lifestyles we have

01:09:11.740 --> 01:09:13.420
that have contributed to global warming.

01:09:13.420 --> 01:09:16.300
And he's saying that global warming didn't come about

01:09:16.300 --> 01:09:20.300
because of some big single environmental catastrophe, right?

01:09:20.300 --> 01:09:23.140
We suddenly found ourselves in a very different world

01:09:23.140 --> 01:09:23.980
with a very different,

01:09:23.980 --> 01:09:25.860
we suddenly recognized we're in a very different world

01:09:25.860 --> 01:09:27.300
with a set of very different problems

01:09:27.300 --> 01:09:29.180
because of lots of small decisions

01:09:29.180 --> 01:09:31.820
that have been made over the past decades.

01:09:31.820 --> 01:09:34.580
And he's then looking at social networks

01:09:34.580 --> 01:09:36.340
and saying, what are the, you know,

01:09:36.340 --> 01:09:40.060
there's very few big major disasters come about

01:09:40.060 --> 01:09:41.140
because of social networks.

01:09:41.140 --> 01:09:43.940
So he does look at some very dramatic world events

01:09:43.940 --> 01:09:46.660
and talk about what led to those.

01:09:46.660 --> 01:09:50.300
But he's saying, if you take a world

01:09:50.300 --> 01:09:53.180
where so many people get their information,

01:09:53.180 --> 01:09:55.820
get their social interactions, get their news,

01:09:55.820 --> 01:09:57.940
get their belief systems,

01:09:57.940 --> 01:10:02.020
get their understanding of medicine and pandemics

01:10:02.020 --> 01:10:04.580
and so on from social networks,

01:10:04.580 --> 01:10:08.380
where they are essentially getting them from algorithms

01:10:08.380 --> 01:10:11.340
that are tuned for very specific things,

01:10:11.340 --> 01:10:13.540
if you take that over an extended period,

01:10:13.540 --> 01:10:15.260
what will that do?

01:10:15.260 --> 01:10:19.140
And how will we view the world

01:10:19.140 --> 01:10:20.780
if we don't appreciate this,

01:10:20.780 --> 01:10:23.780
if we don't appreciate that our information is,

01:10:23.780 --> 01:10:25.940
everything we're reading and viewing and so on

01:10:25.940 --> 01:10:27.500
is being fed to us by algorithms

01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:29.380
that are designed to keep us engaged,

01:10:29.380 --> 01:10:33.300
that are designed to shock us or make us,

01:10:33.300 --> 01:10:38.300
you know, amused or insulted or enhance our prejudices

01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:42.140
or whatever it may be that keeps us engaged,

01:10:42.140 --> 01:10:44.780
then that's a different world

01:10:44.780 --> 01:10:47.500
from a world we've been in the past,

01:10:47.500 --> 01:10:51.700
where, you know, some obviously news and things

01:10:51.700 --> 01:10:53.220
has been worked on that basis,

01:10:53.220 --> 01:10:56.180
but it's never been fine-tuned to this degree.

01:10:56.180 --> 01:11:00.060
And so I do recommend Social Warming, very good book.

01:11:00.060 --> 01:11:03.860
Will make you think about the world where so much

01:11:03.860 --> 01:11:08.860
of our background information comes from social networks

01:11:10.460 --> 01:11:11.300
and their algorithms.

01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:13.820
And a friend of mine to whom we recommended this,

01:11:13.820 --> 01:11:16.300
after she'd read it, she immediately went and bought copies

01:11:16.300 --> 01:11:19.140
for all the teachers in all of her children's schools

01:11:19.140 --> 01:11:21.900
and said, you must read this, probably hated her.

01:11:21.900 --> 01:11:25.540
But nonetheless, that was how valuable she thought it was.

01:11:25.540 --> 01:11:28.220
And it is, Charles is a very thoughtful,

01:11:28.220 --> 01:11:32.220
very considered person, and this is not scaremongering.

01:11:32.220 --> 01:11:35.020
This is very sensibly thought through and argued,

01:11:35.020 --> 01:11:36.380
and it's enjoyable reading.

01:11:36.380 --> 01:11:38.660
So I recommend Social Warming by Charles Arthur.

01:11:38.660 --> 01:11:41.540
The other thing, as you gathered from talking,

01:11:41.540 --> 01:11:43.700
I do like gathering quotations.

01:11:43.700 --> 01:11:48.100
And so I leave you with one of my favorite quotations.

01:11:48.100 --> 01:11:50.540
Now, the problem with quotations is that

01:11:51.420 --> 01:11:54.380
as soon as you hear one that's supposedly said by Einstein

01:11:54.380 --> 01:11:56.820
or supposedly said by JFK or something like this,

01:11:56.820 --> 01:12:00.500
you realize that, or Mark Twain or whoever, yes,

01:12:00.500 --> 01:12:02.460
you would discover that actually it was never really said

01:12:02.460 --> 01:12:03.300
by those people.

01:12:03.300 --> 01:12:06.140
But so this is one that is often attributed

01:12:06.140 --> 01:12:09.500
to Eleanor Roosevelt, but I think also

01:12:09.500 --> 01:12:12.420
to David Foster Wallace, the writer,

01:12:12.420 --> 01:12:14.180
and probably was actually said by somebody else.

01:12:14.180 --> 01:12:15.140
But I've always liked this.

01:12:15.140 --> 01:12:19.860
It goes, you would worry less what people thought about you

01:12:19.860 --> 01:12:22.340
if you knew how infrequently they do.

01:12:22.340 --> 01:12:24.100
Powerful words, for sure.

01:12:24.100 --> 01:12:28.180
And those certainly, they hit me personally, I would say.

01:12:28.180 --> 01:12:29.020
I think that's great.

01:12:29.020 --> 01:12:30.940
You're worry less what people thought about you

01:12:30.940 --> 01:12:33.060
if you knew how infrequently they do so.

01:12:33.060 --> 01:12:35.420
And so whoever said it, I think that's a great phrase

01:12:35.420 --> 01:12:38.260
that I think it's well worth remembering.

01:12:38.260 --> 01:12:41.660
But is that not such a perfect follow-up

01:12:41.660 --> 01:12:42.940
to exactly what you were saying

01:12:42.940 --> 01:12:45.220
about Charles's Social Warming?

01:12:45.220 --> 01:12:48.260
I see those two as very, very related

01:12:48.260 --> 01:12:52.940
in that so often we're worried about what others think of us

01:12:52.940 --> 01:12:54.980
when we share some of our accomplishments,

01:12:54.980 --> 01:12:56.660
especially online.

01:12:56.660 --> 01:12:58.500
I think that is correct.

01:12:58.500 --> 01:13:01.180
But I think also often the problems

01:13:01.180 --> 01:13:02.660
we have with social networks because we

01:13:02.660 --> 01:13:05.500
don't worry enough about what people think about us.

01:13:05.500 --> 01:13:07.460
Or maybe we're more isolated, perhaps,

01:13:07.460 --> 01:13:08.660
from the normal social cues.

01:13:08.660 --> 01:13:11.540
And this may be something that just humankind

01:13:11.540 --> 01:13:13.940
has to take some time to get used to,

01:13:13.940 --> 01:13:18.260
that trolls online are there because they haven't yet

01:13:18.260 --> 01:13:21.100
developed the sensitivities that we've developed as a society

01:13:21.100 --> 01:13:22.820
over many years.

01:13:22.820 --> 01:13:25.540
But one of the things Charles talks about

01:13:25.540 --> 01:13:30.980
is the reasons that things like outrage.

01:13:30.980 --> 01:13:32.860
People have talked about social networks

01:13:32.860 --> 01:13:36.540
as a sort of engine for outrage.

01:13:36.540 --> 01:13:37.620
And why is this?

01:13:37.620 --> 01:13:40.460
Well, it's because we find things

01:13:40.460 --> 01:13:43.660
that we think outrageous very compelling.

01:13:43.660 --> 01:13:48.860
Or we find people who disagree with the ideas of our tribe

01:13:48.860 --> 01:13:51.300
to be something we care a lot about.

01:13:51.300 --> 01:13:53.580
I use tribe in a general sense here.

01:13:53.580 --> 01:13:55.300
Because that was valuable in the past.

01:13:55.300 --> 01:13:57.180
It was what bound the tribe together.

01:13:57.180 --> 01:14:00.580
And that was an important social construct.

01:14:00.580 --> 01:14:03.740
And so outrage had its purpose in the past.

01:14:03.740 --> 01:14:07.100
It's a bit like overeating, right?

01:14:07.100 --> 01:14:09.820
Being able to eat large amounts of food when it became

01:14:09.820 --> 01:14:11.780
available was a valuable thing in the past.

01:14:11.780 --> 01:14:12.980
And now it's always available.

01:14:12.980 --> 01:14:13.900
It becomes a problem.

01:14:13.900 --> 01:14:16.660
And being able to respond appropriately,

01:14:16.660 --> 01:14:19.860
the emotion of outrage is not necessarily a bad thing.

01:14:19.860 --> 01:14:23.540
But as soon as social networks cotton onto the fact

01:14:23.540 --> 01:14:25.540
that this is very, very engaging,

01:14:25.540 --> 01:14:29.860
this is built into our social architecture

01:14:29.860 --> 01:14:31.660
at a very low level, they realize,

01:14:31.660 --> 01:14:35.100
aha, our algorithms, it's not necessarily

01:14:35.100 --> 01:14:36.540
a human intervention.

01:14:36.540 --> 01:14:39.980
But the algorithms will discover that things that are outrageous

01:14:39.980 --> 01:14:41.860
do keep us engaged.

01:14:41.860 --> 01:14:44.300
And therefore, we see and see more and more outrageous stuff

01:14:44.300 --> 01:14:47.700
or things that make us angry or things that also make us laugh.

01:14:47.700 --> 01:14:51.220
But some of the more gentle, more positive, more cultured,

01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:54.980
whatever it may be, sadly, parts of life

01:14:54.980 --> 01:14:56.580
are sadly not as engaging.

01:14:56.580 --> 01:14:59.180
And it's that instant engagement,

01:14:59.180 --> 01:15:02.820
which is sort of like sugar, that's bad for us

01:15:02.820 --> 01:15:05.340
if we have too much of it.

01:15:05.340 --> 01:15:07.660
I'm not sure whether that ties back into that quote.

01:15:07.660 --> 01:15:09.020
I think it may be not.

01:15:09.020 --> 01:15:13.380
But I do think perhaps it ties in perhaps more

01:15:13.380 --> 01:15:15.340
in terms of the sort of, yes, the image

01:15:15.340 --> 01:15:18.980
that you portray through TikTok or through your YouTube

01:15:18.980 --> 01:15:20.460
channel or whatever.

01:15:20.460 --> 01:15:21.860
How much is that the real you?

01:15:21.860 --> 01:15:23.660
And how much is that something you

01:15:23.660 --> 01:15:26.140
are carefully constructing and portraying because of what

01:15:26.140 --> 01:15:27.580
people will think about you?

01:15:27.580 --> 01:15:30.140
I guess that is a very important part of this.

01:15:30.140 --> 01:15:33.740
And the question becomes, which part of ourselves

01:15:33.740 --> 01:15:36.020
do we want to show and should we show?

01:15:36.020 --> 01:15:40.500
And I think there's something to be

01:15:40.500 --> 01:15:42.100
said about meeting someone in person

01:15:42.100 --> 01:15:48.900
because on various levels, both consciously and subconsciously,

01:15:48.900 --> 01:15:50.340
you get a sense of a person.

01:15:50.340 --> 01:15:53.740
And I feel like with all of the powers and gifts and beauty

01:15:53.740 --> 01:15:57.540
of the internet, that's not a thing that's easy to reproduce.

01:15:57.540 --> 01:15:58.940
That is interesting, isn't it?

01:15:58.940 --> 01:15:59.540
Yes.

01:15:59.540 --> 01:16:03.060
And I mean, here I am supposedly having brunch with you.

01:16:03.060 --> 01:16:05.620
So this whole idea of brunch with Brent

01:16:05.620 --> 01:16:08.060
doesn't work across time zones, right?

01:16:08.060 --> 01:16:10.020
It's true.

01:16:10.020 --> 01:16:12.500
It's a long time since my breakfast here.

01:16:12.500 --> 01:16:15.180
It works for you.

01:16:15.180 --> 01:16:18.100
But can you imagine what COVID would

01:16:18.100 --> 01:16:21.580
have been like if we hadn't had all of the communications

01:16:21.580 --> 01:16:27.060
technologies that we've been party to in just

01:16:27.060 --> 01:16:28.540
the last few years?

01:16:28.540 --> 01:16:30.900
Most laptops come with a camera built in.

01:16:30.900 --> 01:16:35.540
And all of a sudden, that's become so much more important

01:16:35.540 --> 01:16:37.020
than it ever was.

01:16:37.020 --> 01:16:39.700
We could never have imagined three, four years ago

01:16:39.700 --> 01:16:44.980
how important this would be, and it has turned out to be.

01:16:44.980 --> 01:16:51.860
So I think you can understand a lot in face-to-face

01:16:51.860 --> 01:16:53.380
conversations.

01:16:53.380 --> 01:16:55.420
And we're just doing audio here, but I

01:16:55.420 --> 01:16:59.380
think the value of video conversations is significant.

01:16:59.380 --> 01:17:03.980
And being able to see somebody, it is funny now

01:17:03.980 --> 01:17:07.580
how I've come to assume that calls in general are video

01:17:07.580 --> 01:17:08.740
calls.

01:17:08.740 --> 01:17:09.780
Of course.

01:17:09.780 --> 01:17:12.700
This is what happened on Star Trek in the past.

01:17:12.700 --> 01:17:15.740
You could actually have a video call with Captain Kirk,

01:17:15.740 --> 01:17:16.980
who was three rooms away.

01:17:16.980 --> 01:17:20.460
I mean, that was an amazing idea back then.

01:17:20.460 --> 01:17:22.980
And now, I take for granted that I

01:17:22.980 --> 01:17:24.980
can have a video call with someone

01:17:24.980 --> 01:17:26.020
while I'm walking my dog.

01:17:26.020 --> 01:17:28.300
You see, it all comes back to walking my dog in the end.

01:17:28.300 --> 01:17:29.860
I think that's such a lovely place

01:17:29.860 --> 01:17:32.460
to pause our discussion for now.

01:17:32.460 --> 01:17:37.380
I think we will certainly get recording together again soon.

01:17:37.380 --> 01:17:39.380
But I've just got to say, you're leaving me

01:17:39.380 --> 01:17:42.660
with this huge and satisfied smile

01:17:42.660 --> 01:17:44.540
from just thinking of all the lovely topics

01:17:44.540 --> 01:17:46.220
we've been able to explore together.

01:17:46.220 --> 01:17:47.380
Well, thank you, Brett.

01:17:47.380 --> 01:17:50.100
You've been very patient with me rambling on,

01:17:50.100 --> 01:17:52.940
and I hope it will be well-edited afterwards

01:17:52.940 --> 01:17:55.260
to take out some of my less coherent bits.

01:17:55.260 --> 01:17:58.020
And please, everybody, remember that it is evening,

01:17:58.020 --> 01:17:59.820
getting on into the evening here for me.

01:17:59.820 --> 01:18:02.260
So I'm not as, I like to think that I

01:18:02.260 --> 01:18:06.140
would be more coherent at brunch if it were brunch for me.

01:18:06.140 --> 01:18:08.620
Well, next time, maybe we'll do that, and I'll stay up late.

01:18:08.620 --> 01:18:09.140
We'll do that.

01:18:09.140 --> 01:18:09.820
What time?

01:18:09.820 --> 01:18:11.500
Yeah, you'd have to stay up very late.

01:18:11.500 --> 01:18:13.780
No, no, this is just fine.

01:18:13.780 --> 01:18:14.940
This is just fine.

01:18:14.940 --> 01:18:17.740
OK, thank you so much, and we'll chat soon.

01:18:17.740 --> 01:18:18.460
Thanks, Brent.

01:18:18.460 --> 01:18:19.300
It's been great fun.

01:18:19.300 --> 01:18:21.380
And thanks for you and all the guys at Jupiter.

01:18:21.380 --> 01:18:22.580
I think you do a great job.

01:18:22.580 --> 01:18:25.180
And I really enjoy many, many of your podcasts.

01:18:25.180 --> 01:18:29.900
And so it's a great honor to be a small part of it.

01:18:29.900 --> 01:18:33.700
And I hope you give some people enjoyment in the way

01:18:33.700 --> 01:18:35.620
that you've done for so many other people.

01:18:35.620 --> 01:18:36.700
Thank you for that.

01:18:36.700 --> 01:18:38.740
Oh, yeah, thank you so much.

01:18:38.740 --> 01:18:40.100
That's a huge compliment.

01:18:40.100 --> 01:19:06.780
So much appreciated, and I will share.
