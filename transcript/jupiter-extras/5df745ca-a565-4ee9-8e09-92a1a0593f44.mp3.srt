00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,120
Hello, everyone. Welcome to Brunch with Brent. Joining me today is Elish Poli-Gonzalez. Elish,

2
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,120
how are you doing?

3
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,400
Good, good. Very good. How are you?

4
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:23,880
I'm doing great. Yeah, it's good to be connected with you. You've got a pretty neat spot. Some

5
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:29,500
people might know you as the president of the board of directors at KDE, which is kind

6
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:35,360
of neat. How does it feel to have had that position for, what, since September, right?

7
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:43,480
Yeah, since September. Well, it's good. I've been in this board of directors for five years

8
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:50,880
and a half now, five years when I became a president. Well, I was vice president before.

9
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:57,280
In actual terms of the things I do, it hasn't really changed that much. Some people do see

10
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:04,760
me differently, which feels a bit weird, but life goes on and we keep going.

11
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:10,840
It's sort of interesting how titles can sometimes change the way we see people even though they're

12
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:16,920
necessarily the same person they were even a few months ago. You are clearly not new

13
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,440
to the board of directors. For those of us who aren't that familiar with how KDE and

14
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:27,040
the board of directors interfaces, what kind of things do you do there? How do you collaborate

15
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,160
with other people? How is that important to the KDE projects, for instance?

16
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:36,800
All right. I know it's not exactly what you asked, but let me give you the distance kind

17
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,800
of answer.

18
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,800
Great.

19
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:44,680
What is KDE? KDE started a long time ago as a desktop. It's not anymore. Nowadays, KDE

20
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:51,920
is a community with tons of people that develop a bunch of free software projects, right?

21
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:58,040
As such, KDE is a community and a community cannot do certain things like having money

22
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:05,160
or just charge for doing anything, right? At some point, somebody created a foundation

23
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:13,600
called the KDEV, which is the thing I am president of, right? I am not president of KDE in paper

24
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:19,180
and in practice, but I am the president of the KDEV, which is this legal organization

25
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:29,200
that is based in Germany around the KDE project. This organization deals with money and certain

26
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:37,120
resources that the association have. We try to do the best to support the project and

27
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,880
make sure that the free software gets developed as it should.

28
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:48,920
How do we work? Well, internally, the board, it's five people. We change every three years.

29
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:55,800
And some people will have some kind of preferences and they will take these tasks more seriously.

30
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:03,120
But in general, we try to spread the tasks internally. We try not to have a big hierarchy

31
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,040
inside of our small team anyways.

32
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:10,760
That's great. Yeah, it sounds like you really end up just playing on your strengths in that

33
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:17,800
collaboration. And thank you for the background there. I think when it comes to foundations,

34
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:23,120
at least I speak for myself, it's kind of new to me, learning how it all works and what

35
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:30,560
pieces are necessary and how they're organized. So that transparency is really fascinating

36
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:38,040
to me, really, I would say. You also have done a lot of development for KDE. You started

37
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:43,560
quite a while ago. When did you start developing for KDE? And I imagine that has clearly led

38
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,560
to where you are now.

39
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:50,000
Actually, I started in KDE before I started in KDE, because I started developing an application.

40
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:59,600
Well, I don't know, it was 2004 or five, which was or is still K algebra, which is math application

41
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:07,800
and calculator. I started developing it on my own. And at some point, I was reached out

42
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:14,600
by KDEedu, the education program within KDE. And they said, have you considered putting

43
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:20,160
the application in here? And I put it in, right? Like my first commit was the whole

44
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,720
application at once.

45
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:29,440
Can I just ask, what was it about KDE back then that was curious to you? Because you

46
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:34,480
were developing this application for yourself, as far as I understand. So how did they sort

47
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:40,640
of come across it? And how did that come about? I just wonder if that might be a helpful story

48
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:46,000
or anecdote for someone who might have a good idea and might want to share it with the project.

49
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:55,280
Well, back then, I was getting interested in computer science. I was just starting university.

50
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:01,120
And I wanted to play around with certain technologies. So I knew I wanted to do this project. Actually,

51
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:07,360
I had started to think about it a little bit in the past. In the first versions, it even

52
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:16,240
resembled a lot another application I had been using when I was in high school. And

53
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:22,560
there's a lot of topics that are interesting when developing such an application like a

54
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:28,040
calculator that were interesting to me, like how to write a parser and how to do the plotting

55
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:34,600
properly and the 3D bits. It was more of a, I know that this was something useful to me

56
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:42,360
at some point. And then it allowed me to test myself a little bit because, well, I was learning

57
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:48,280
a lot of things because, well, that's what you do. And I needed to put my learnings into

58
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:56,640
something. And actually, it shaped a lot how I learned and actually how I ended up deriving

59
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,680
professionally over time.

60
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:06,200
Do you find then that for you, learning has to be tied to a project? Applying that knowledge

61
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:11,240
is the way that it integrates for you with the most depth?

62
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:17,680
There's definitely a component. I'm not going to say it's the only way I can learn, but

63
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:25,000
Right, of course. But if you had a preference, maybe. The reason I ask is what fascinates

64
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:31,720
me is sort of how we all get to the places where we are. And I feel like if we discover

65
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:37,680
or chase the means by which we learn best, you know, sometimes that's collaboratively,

66
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:44,720
sometimes that's independently, then sometimes we can get to places that are actually really

67
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,560
great in making our strengths possible. So it sounds like in many ways you found that.

68
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:57,120
Yeah, for sure. Also, a big interesting part about software development is that you can

69
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:03,000
do badly and the computer is going to tell you. So you don't have to disappoint anyone.

70
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,680
You can see you did wrong and then do it differently. And in the end, if you get the right result,

71
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:16,240
it might not be through the correct set of steps, but it's still progress to some extent.

72
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,480
And you get to be loved on that.

73
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:22,600
So there's this feedback loop, this quick feedback loop that you get to sort of iterate

74
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:29,040
on your ideas and your projects in a way maybe that isn't available to other professions.

75
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:36,640
Yeah, definitely. It's something that was crucial to me in this approach. And even now

76
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:42,880
I look at the code that I started to produce back then and I'm not going to say I'm ashamed

77
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,040
of it, but it wasn't good.

78
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:50,440
It was of a past Elish, right? This is present Elish.

79
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,520
Yeah. Everything I do is from a past Elish.

80
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,160
Right. Fair enough.

81
00:07:55,160 --> 00:08:02,080
But this specific past Elish wasn't that good. But that's fine, right? And I don't know.

82
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,560
Didn't hurt anyone.

83
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:09,600
No. And that can still be valuable work, even though it may not be at the same caliber that

84
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,040
you're at now.

85
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:20,200
It has been. I've been having users since the very beginnings. And it's been always

86
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:26,280
people who have been using the project for some things or others. And they have been

87
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:31,040
reasonably happy. So, well, there's that, right?

88
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:38,880
That's important. How have you seen those users change in the last 10 years or so? Does

89
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,480
it feel like the community has shifted or changed or grown in some ways?

90
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:48,120
Well, in the end, when you get users, you get users for the things you have, right?

91
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:53,800
They might ask you, I would like to have this thing or this other thing. But in the end,

92
00:08:53,800 --> 00:09:01,080
what they reach out to you about is about the present. So they don't really change that

93
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:07,520
much. In general, when a user reaches out to you, the process is, hey, I've been using

94
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:15,800
this project. It's kind of nice, I guess. But, and then they explain you the problem.

95
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:20,120
That's by email. That's when they reach you out by email. When they reach you out by backtracking

96
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:26,920
system or chat, they remove the pleasantries and they go directly to the problem.

97
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:33,040
But yeah, it's hard to tell if people change. I mean, people have definitely changed, right?

98
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:42,200
Also the competing alternatives to what I've been doing have also exploded in several ways.

99
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,840
So that also has an impact.

100
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:51,360
Do you find that user feedback to be exhausting in some ways? Because it sounds like a never-ending

101
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:57,520
flow of people suggesting things are wrong. I mean, they often have the right intentions

102
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:02,080
in mind of trying to improve and to help find bugs and things like that.

103
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:07,800
Actually it's one of the hot topics in free software, and it has been for years.

104
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,080
And essential, really.

105
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:14,080
In free software, we're very open and we're very exposed as developers to what people

106
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:19,800
want and to their demands. And actually, I would say it's one of the selling points of

107
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:25,680
free software, right? You can talk to people or you can get someone and convince them to

108
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:34,480
fix something and they do it, right? So there's no barrier between user and the creation.

109
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:41,000
But on the other hand, you need to find ways to shield yourself sometimes because, well,

110
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:48,440
some people have fun being hurtful. I mean, I've been around for a long time, so it means

111
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:53,440
that it hasn't broken me, but I know many people who have gotten broken by that. And

112
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,800
it's really such part of the whole process, right?

113
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,720
Because it potentially means that we lose good people.

114
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:06,160
Well, not potentially. Like, literally, it means.

115
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:12,120
Right. Do you have any advice either for the person on the development side, you know,

116
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:16,800
the receiving side, or for the people on the giving side, you know, that are reaching out

117
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,440
with some of these bugs and things?

118
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:26,140
Be nice would be definitely a number one thing, right? Or be empathetic at least. Remember

119
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:33,720
that you're talking to people. I guess that in the, I would say normal world, we're used

120
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:41,080
to like, so many layers of communication that you have to try to make an impact so that

121
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:49,400
your demands go through hierarchy or several steps. And in free software, that is not the

122
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:57,560
case, right? And you like see people reporting bugs or on mailing lists, demanding people

123
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:06,200
to work for them because, and this is hurtful, not being hurtful, being positive, being engaging,

124
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:12,160
explaining why something is a problem for you, and how while it's a problem for you,

125
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:17,860
like the wall is not going to end. It's always a good way to contextualize this, this kind

126
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,480
of problematic, I would say.

127
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:25,680
Yeah, I think two things that stood out there for me in that advice you just gave was empathy

128
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:30,240
was the first one, because I've encountered very few situations where empathy is not a

129
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:37,880
helpful trait. And also just being collaborative, you know, if you discover a problem, or you

130
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:44,520
would like something fixed or integrated, I think it sounds like the collaborative approach,

131
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:49,360
if the software developer is open to that, sounds really beneficial for everyone. As

132
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,060
the person who found the bug, you might get some insight into what the project is dealing

133
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:59,640
with or where that sits as a priority. And as the developer, you might get someone who

134
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:03,380
can really make a difference and perhaps a future contributor to.

135
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:10,480
Every project I've worked on, I've had a couple of, well, I would say, maybe power users or

136
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:20,120
well, people who will go all the way to help you solve the bugs. And like when a bug report

137
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:27,740
is properly reported, it's so much easier and faster to solve, right? And this is something

138
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:35,080
we need to remind ourselves. It's not about like being the loudest, but also as a developer,

139
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:39,840
be it free software or not, that doesn't matter. You have an amount of time that you're going

140
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:47,280
to have to spend into solving a problem. If this is less, it's more likely that you will

141
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:50,240
be able to do it, right?

142
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:55,400
So there's a big difference between a bug report that says, my application exploded

143
00:13:55,400 --> 00:14:01,240
and a bug report that says, when I do exactly these steps, my application explodes, or I

144
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:08,600
get this error message, or here's a bug trace with proper debug symbols or not. And obviously,

145
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:14,400
there's a learning curve for the reporter, and we cannot expect everyone to go all the

146
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:21,360
way there, because we all have other things to do than reporting bugs. But if you really

147
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:28,480
care about something and can spend some time into solving it, I think that it's a nice

148
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:34,280
idea to do so. Because you're not like solving it only for yourself, which you are, but you're

149
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:39,160
solving it for everyone. And actually, the whole solving it for everyone is one of the

150
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,120
nice things about life, right?

151
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:46,040
Yeah, one of the strengths of open source, I think, and maybe the reason that many of

152
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:51,640
us are part of it is that it feels like a collective good that we're doing for the world.

153
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,800
Well, it doesn't feel it. It actually is, right?

154
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,000
There, you catch me again.

155
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:06,160
Part of the problem that a big part of the world doesn't want to make use of it. But

156
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,840
when they do, they're going to love it.

157
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:14,320
Yeah, I came across some stats. And of course, there are many sources of these kind of things.

158
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:21,360
But KD itself, which that includes a lot of different pieces of software. But I think

159
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:29,480
they're suggesting plasma in this case, like as far as I read, being used heavily in Turkey

160
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:34,720
and the Turkish government, everywhere from their armed forces, Ministry of Foreign Affairs

161
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:41,600
and National Defense, the police, it has been used at CERN quite a bit. In Germany, I believe

162
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:49,620
they have something like 11,000 systems running it used in a NASA Mars mission, etc, etc.

163
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:54,000
And that doesn't mention the desktop users either. But how does it feel for you to be

164
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:01,440
kind of have your thumb on or be touching so many users with the work that you're doing?

165
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,440
Well, one of the complex things about how we've been conducting free software, and actually,

166
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:10,720
it's been one of the turning points of KD is actually the whole defining a vision and

167
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:17,200
like who are you making your your software for? In general, I haven't been thinking about

168
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:26,720
like, what will happen when this change happens in NASA, or I don't know, CERN, etc, right?

169
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:33,440
Like, do you think how do I fix this problem? And then when you talk to the different organizations,

170
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:38,680
as a president or a representative of the community, well, then you realize that that

171
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:45,280
this, this software is actually being used in all of these places. I mean, actually,

172
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:48,720
most of the time, we don't even know that that this is happening.

173
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,360
Of course, one of the challenges really.

174
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:59,960
Yeah, we only learn through chance, right? Like these announcements that like, they show

175
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:05,880
a screenshot of somebody working and like, you see, oh, they're using plasma, or they're

176
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:13,280
using Linux, or they're using Krita, right? It's more anecdotal in practice than actually

177
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:18,400
it should be, right? I would like to be talking more to these organizations and learning more

178
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:27,440
about the problems they had. But communication is something that, well, is expensive to humanity,

179
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:36,360
I guess. And it shows. I remember having long conversations about that with somebody from

180
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:45,040
Brazil. Like, I think it was around 2010, there was a big deployment of KD software

181
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:52,400
in Brazil. Well, I was the maintainer, actually, still am, of KD Edu. And I was telling her,

182
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:58,240
well, how is it that you have so many millions of people running our software, running our

183
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:05,120
applications, but then we don't get back reports for this software, right? Like, is everything

184
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:13,320
we make perfect? And she didn't say yes. She said, well, teachers will probably not know

185
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:20,360
how to report properly, or their English might not be great. I mean, there were reasons why

186
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:27,600
this didn't happen, right? But in practice, we had, well, millions of users over there.

187
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:34,600
I don't know, we still have. But the conclusions that they created didn't really reach out

188
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:42,400
to humanity, which is a bit sad in this regard. But then you realize how it makes a huge difference

189
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:49,120
when the involved people understand free software properly. We hear very often about how organizations

190
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:57,520
might be adopting free software or open source solutions. But when there's randomly people

191
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:04,640
who have been involved in the movement, in the communities, and have the know-how, the

192
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:10,440
experience will flow much more, well, beautifully for both parts. And I think that this is really

193
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,440
nice when it happens.

194
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:17,040
Yeah, the big question, I suppose, is how do you encourage it to happen more? I don't

195
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,040
know what that answer is.

196
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:23,000
I mean, I know that KD has a problem, and probably the Linux desktop does. But how do

197
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:29,080
you make sure that people can stay around it and be professional about it? The money

198
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:39,640
flow is a bit spotty and not very clear. We don't have very clear business models either.

199
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:47,200
And it does have its advantages. We're not really governed by evil corporations or, well,

200
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:53,560
good corporations. We're not just led by corporations. But on the other hand, there's

201
00:19:53,560 --> 00:20:02,240
people who, well, to live, they have to work on something else. And, well, that's not ideal,

202
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,240
right?

203
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:08,920
Yeah, I mean, that is the challenge, isn't it? How do you keep the good people around

204
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:14,800
or allow them to work on the things that they actually feel really empowered to be working

205
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:22,960
on, like free software? For many of us, we have done a lot just through our hearts, right?

206
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,720
So how do you keep those people around when they need to feed their families and pay the

207
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,360
rent and all of that?

208
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:32,920
Some of us are lucky enough to be able to do it. Like this is my case. So I feel a bit

209
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:37,960
bad talking about this problematic when I don't have this problem. While this is a problem,

210
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:43,560
it also has the advantage that you have when all these big super corporations, because

211
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:52,400
there's super good free software developers around, right? Like a lot of the best developers

212
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:57,640
that you will find in the market, well, did open source at some point because it's a great

213
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:04,920
way to become a good professional. So you will have really senior people in the biggest

214
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:13,120
corporations that have an open source background and they know how it works. And, well, this

215
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,440
links back a bit with what we were discussing before.

216
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:20,880
You know, those end up being proponents of free software in some of those larger corporations

217
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,320
around the world. So it sounds like a benefit as well in some ways.

218
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:30,960
Yeah, it's a matter of people wanting to keeping the flame alive, right?

219
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:37,280
Yeah, right. It's always a balance. You did mention that you're lucky enough to be sponsored

220
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:41,680
to be working on KDE full time. Can you talk about that a little bit?

221
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:47,120
I had been working when I was at university doing free software stuff. I did some contracting,

222
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:54,160
I did Google Summer of Code, which was nice. But when I was finishing university and I

223
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:59,320
was doing my master's thesis, I kind of wanted to continue doing it, but I didn't really

224
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:06,160
know where to look at. And what happened back then was that I saw a tweet, someone saying,

225
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:15,720
I am looking for KDE developers, contact me. And I did. It was by who nowadays is my boss.

226
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:21,220
But well, nobody really knew them back then. I actually was the first employee in Blue

227
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:28,000
Systems and it was all very weird and spotty. But I came through with it because I had to

228
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,600
look for a job anyway. I actually was looking already. I was, I had to like start, I was

229
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:38,640
finishing university in a month. So I didn't really have that much margin or I didn't want

230
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:49,440
to give me that much margin anyway. So I said, hi, we had a conversation on an IRC channel.

231
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:54,720
It seemed to work. I did the first project and then we started creating more things and

232
00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:01,520
the team started growing and it was less weird and spotty and it was more like, OK, we're

233
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:09,720
doing KDE now, which was a very good thing because we hadn't had that many businesses

234
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:18,000
back then caring about certain parts of our code base. And we definitely had the opportunity

235
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,600
of doing a lot of really cool stuff and we still do.

236
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:27,760
That's great. And so originally for Blue Systems that you're talking about, what was their

237
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:34,840
incentive to increase or at least sponsor someone to work on KDE software? Because that

238
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:40,440
doesn't seem necessarily like the standard approach. So why was that important to them

239
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,600
and why is it still important?

240
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:52,640
My boss had, has a distribution called Netrunner Linux and he wanted to improve the GTK application

241
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:58,120
integration. That was my first assignment, actually. He knew he would want more over

242
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:05,600
time, but that was the first thing we discussed at least. And he had the money to hire me.

243
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:14,000
So I guess that all of us, if we had like half a million budget every year to get people

244
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,480
to do stuff for us, we would get to be creative in our own ways.

245
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:25,620
Yeah, you get all your bugs solved pretty quickly if you had that kind of incentive,

246
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:30,860
let's call it. But that is a really nice way for people to encourage some creativity in

247
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:37,020
work and to encourage some work on open source software. If they have a need is to sponsor

248
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:40,400
that work instead of just, for instance, like we were talking about earlier, just sending

249
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:47,080
a bug tracker out there and hoping for the best. It sounds like sponsoring a specific

250
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:53,200
project to do a specific something that would help everybody seems like quite the gift really.

251
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:59,200
I myself feel very lucky that we, that I had or, and we had these, this opportunity and

252
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:06,960
still do. It's a touchy topic. It's, it's complex because there's a lot of, well, discussions

253
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:13,280
that come to the table. And I think that one of the best things that BlueSystem has, BlueSystems

254
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:19,920
has been able to, to push for is that we have been doing a lot of work to just improve Plasma,

255
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:28,000
improve KD in many ways, but like with, not with a very hands-on kind of way, but just

256
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,960
actually making it better, right. And making it better for everyone. And actually like

257
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:39,280
a lot of these developments that we did, for example, to improve that runner Linux or some

258
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:46,400
issues that have been arranged in the past, they have had an impact on, well, on certain

259
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:52,600
developers, right. Or, or on developments or in, in, in NASA or wherever, right.

260
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:57,280
A little bit everywhere, but you don't always know where. Can I talk to you a little bit

261
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:03,520
about conferences? I know maybe that's a touchy subject these days too, but you've been involved

262
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:10,720
in a few conferences, clearly as an attendee, but also a little bit on the back end. One

263
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:16,360
of those I believe is the Linux App Summit. You've had your, your thumb in there. You've

264
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:20,960
been collaborating with some neat people over the years there. Can you tell us a bit about

265
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,960
that?

266
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:30,320
Yeah, for sure. I was to the Libre App Summit that Nomorganized in Denver a couple of years

267
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:37,120
ago. Actually, I had started talking to Sri about it for the year earlier where they had

268
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,640
the first one.

269
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,440
Just to mention quickly, that Sri Ramakrishna of Gnome fame. Go on.

270
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:52,240
It didn't happen in the end because logistics more than better reasons. But the year after

271
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:59,240
I went there, I talked a lot with him, with Noritzi. I believe, and I am not the only

272
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:09,720
one to believe that Linux has a lot of value in the end user space to strengthen this value.

273
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:17,080
You need to make sure that people can join in and collaborate and do it in a platform

274
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:23,400
level. They don't need to respond to anyone. We can tell everyone, just join KDE and do

275
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:29,200
your thing. But I don't know, Spotify is not going to do that or Firefox, right? They want

276
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:36,160
to do their thing and we need to actually be able to work together to offer something

277
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,040
the ones who we are doing it.

278
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:44,680
So we decided to work more closely and last year we did it together with Gnome. We actually

279
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:49,920
changed from Libre App Summit to Linux App Summit, which I think it's an interesting

280
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:58,760
development. In the end, it was a lot about working together. In this case, I also ended

281
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:07,520
up being the organizer because I've been also doing Barcelona for software, which is the

282
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:14,000
organization that ended up organizing the event locally, so to speak. So that was my

283
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:20,200
involvement over there as well, besides doing a bunch of stuff in the organization team.

284
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:26,560
So it sounds like your previous connections with the group in Barcelona helped with making

285
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:33,720
this possible and is continuing to help with collaborations throughout, which sounds really

286
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:38,520
positive, really exciting, and really quite important too.

287
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:44,200
We're looking into doing 2020 right now. Like you said, it's a bit delicate.

288
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,680
A bit delicate. That's a nice way to put it.

289
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:54,920
Yeah. But I think that there's a nice chance of doing it properly. Yeah, I'm excited.

290
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:59,240
Do you feel like, and I know it's early days and you may not know, but I would imagine

291
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:03,720
that means looking at how to do the conference a little bit differently, maybe with some

292
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:08,440
different technologies and reaching some different people to make it possible?

293
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:13,880
We're going to definitely look into the different alternatives. I can say we have a plan A and

294
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:22,120
a plan B. So we will do our best. I think that there's a lot of value in putting people

295
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:29,880
together physically. I mean, yeah, they can share viruses then. We don't want to put people

296
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:36,600
at risk. If we feel that this is the case, then we won't.

297
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:42,920
And actually, if you think about it a little bit, it's kind of what separates some projects

298
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:49,360
from others, right? When you get to talk to people, when you get to discuss things over

299
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:56,600
a meal or a drink, the connection, the interaction that you have is at a different level. And

300
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:01,560
I think that it's essential to be able to enforce it. We've been doing it at SKD through

301
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:07,320
our conference, which is called Academy. And every community is doing that and have been

302
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:14,480
doing it for decades, right? And NumHas, Guadaic, Linux Foundation has a ton of events, Firefox,

303
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:23,040
Docker, everyone. And it's about bringing people together and making sure that they

304
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:29,280
humanize their teammates when they do so, which is related to what we were discussing

305
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:38,240
earlier about empathizing with who you report your problems to. And when working in a community,

306
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:44,240
well, you have this kind of problem, but 10 times bigger because it's not about somebody

307
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:50,360
who just had the idea that the problem is solving, but like you're working with somebody

308
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:57,720
and you need to know what he feels, where he stands in life. And doing it in person

309
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:00,120
is a whole different deal.

310
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:05,880
You mentioned Naritzi, who I had a conversation with here on Brunch with Brent, I guess a

311
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:13,480
few weeks ago. And she mentioned the same thing of how the face-to-face is essential

312
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:19,240
in the open source communities and anywhere really. And I think you said it really well

313
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:25,960
when you mentioned humanizing people. I think often maybe that's one side effect of the

314
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:31,360
beauty that is the internet, which is that sometimes we forget there's a person on the

315
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:37,280
other side of any message. And so bringing empathy to that and remembering that sounds

316
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:41,600
really important, but it never really gets communicated in the same way as when you meet

317
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:47,600
someone in person. So I imagine that will be a continuous challenge for all of us this

318
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:52,360
year. But hopefully it doesn't impact too much and we can get back to it somehow.

319
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:58,880
We will have to find alternatives. Ask AD, we have, for example, already canceled a number

320
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:06,920
of sprints. One of the big things that Ask AD we do is sponsor meeting of the different

321
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:11,840
teams so that they can discuss, like we said in person, different, more specific topics

322
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:17,080
that while Academy, they will probably not have the time or even the attention to be

323
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:22,720
able to look into them, but they're still important, right? And we need to find ways

324
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:30,280
so that these teams can work together and do things together that they couldn't because,

325
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:37,960
well, the current state of things because coronavirus. So it's not to disregard the

326
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:43,640
alternatives and we will have to invest in them. And actually there's a lot to win, like

327
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:48,880
not only because of infections, but well, for example, for climate, right? Like it's

328
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:56,880
not very healthy to be flying people all around the world, well, yearly or monthly, right?

329
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,280
Maybe we can do better there. I don't know.

330
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:04,780
Hmm. So it allows us in a way to pause and look at what we were doing and see the benefits

331
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:09,840
of it, but also the challenges sounds like there's an opportunity here.

332
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:16,760
Telecommunication is inherently rather cold. Like if we were having this conversation we're

333
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:22,800
having right now in texts, it would be probably, well, more boring.

334
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,920
Very different.

335
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:30,400
And it's still telematic, right? But for example, I have this friend, like he has been doing

336
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:36,440
KD since long time and everybody, when he meets him for the first time, they say, you're

337
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:45,120
much nicer than I expected you to be, right? And he's a super nice person. Well, emails,

338
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:51,600
chats can be cold over time. And especially when people are trying to like do good and

339
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:56,040
sometimes you have to say no to people, right? And to tell them this thing you really wanted

340
00:33:56,040 --> 00:34:01,720
to do and you were excited about and you even spend some hours this, this, no, right?

341
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:10,200
Yeah, I find, you know, one thing that's been suggested is to increase the number of, and

342
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:16,080
Heather, who I had a chat with as well, who's a friend of yours, Heather Ellsworth, she

343
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:21,080
mentioned increasing the number of coffee chats that she does. And those are kind of

344
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:26,640
the at a distance voice or video chats you can do with people around the world that you

345
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:35,000
know. And I know that that seems inefficient, you know, voice and chatting in real time

346
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:40,800
is sort of inefficient. If you look at the flow of information compared to text, for

347
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:46,840
instance, because you both have to be in the same place at the same time. And some people,

348
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:52,500
you know, maybe conversations just, just take a little longer, but I really feel, and that's

349
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:57,880
sort of the crux of these conversations that we're recording right now, but they're so

350
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:05,520
valuable and, and we're not looking for purely just information transfer. There's connection,

351
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:12,160
there is empathy that gets improved. There's like, you end up diving into topics that you

352
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:17,880
otherwise never would have imagined you'd connect on. So I would encourage everyone

353
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:24,040
to see if you can do that, reach out to some people and connect via voice, you know, where

354
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:28,520
there's so much software to do it. So that, that seems like we could all benefit from

355
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,520
that.

356
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,120
I agree. I completely agree.

357
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:37,920
Can I ask you a question if you have anything that you would like to send out to the community?

358
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,800
Maybe an ask of the community, something you'd like them to try or go see something to think

359
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,800
about?

360
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:49,280
In general, I would recommend everyone to think about, especially when thinking about

361
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:57,280
free software, where they fit and try to see if they are doing what they wanted to do,

362
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:05,280
right? Like if what you want to do is for example, be a user, are you treating the like

363
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:11,920
the developers in the bug reports, like, like you expected? What do you think that the others

364
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:18,160
will be getting from your interaction from them? Or should they? Something that happens

365
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:24,240
often is users knowing that their problems are important, they assume that everybody

366
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:31,160
knows that the problem is happening, right? But that's always not the case. So if you

367
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:36,000
want this problem solved, well, don't get the anger bottled up inside of yourself and

368
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:45,480
well, get it out with control and a smile on your face or fingertips. If your position

369
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:52,880
in the community, for example, is to do outreach, for example, well, be mindful of what your

370
00:36:52,880 --> 00:37:00,560
reach actually is. Something I found very interesting from my involvement, for example,

371
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:08,520
in personal software is that we have been doing a lot of vertical, so to speak, outreach,

372
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:15,320
like in KDE, we do a lot of stuff like worldwide, right? And Nome does and Linux Foundation

373
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:22,400
does and LibreOffice. But at the local level, it's like a whole different dimension and

374
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:28,720
a lot of the things we do, while it might be reaching, well, thousands of people, it

375
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:36,240
doesn't reach the people locally because, well, thousands actually in the world scale

376
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:47,780
is tiny. So I think that thinking in terms of what is the local impact of free software,

377
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:53,920
it's interesting and it's something that all of us, we can do a little bit more of. I have

378
00:37:53,920 --> 00:38:00,440
personally looked at this as a two-dimension kind of thing. It's important to be able to

379
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:06,260
create great products that are free software, but then you also need to go locally to people

380
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:11,000
and see what they need and offer it to them. And actually, that's why we ended up creating

381
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,600
a personal office software. And I believe that every city should have their own city

382
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:23,040
free software, right? Because each city council, how are you going to reach each, well, company

383
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,040
doing software?

384
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:29,080
Yeah. Tell me a little bit more about Barcelona Free Software. We didn't quite touch on it

385
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:36,040
earlier, but it sounds like it's a nice local community that is really beneficial for you.

386
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:42,120
A few years ago, we started with actually KDE Spain. I started in KDE Spain when I was

387
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:47,200
just starting in KDE because somebody said, we're creating this thing. Are you in? And

388
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:52,800
I said, sure. I actually was not really sure what I was getting into.

389
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,200
Those are the best things.

390
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:04,240
It was quite interesting to think of the organizational problems that free software has, but at a

391
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:13,040
different scale. I was there on the board for eight years. I was the president for four.

392
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:20,280
And then I went to the KDEV, which I had the impression that it would feel more like I'm

393
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:27,880
doing the same, but at a higher level, if you wish. And then we had quite a bit of people

394
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:33,840
from KDE Spain doing things in Barcelona. So we said, how about we do something like

395
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:41,960
KDE Barcelona, which felt a bit wrong and oddly specific. So yeah, we said, let's do

396
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:47,640
Barcelona Free Software. Let's talk to the people. We knew that people had been doing

397
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:55,960
free software in my country, in Catalonia at large, if you want, for more since forever.

398
00:39:55,960 --> 00:40:02,200
But we didn't have these personal humanized interaction with them. We knew where to find

399
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:07,440
them, that there are different organizations. But it doesn't make a lot of sense that I

400
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:12,820
had been doing free software for 10 years and people around us didn't know me, didn't

401
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:20,920
know us, or that it was happening. So we started doing a monthly meetup, which we've been doing

402
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:26,720
since with different projects. Actually, one would think, well, projects are going to finish

403
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:32,860
one day or another, but they really don't. They have a to-do list of 20 possible talks

404
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:39,200
that we could be doing, and it doesn't really seem to end. And it does give me some very

405
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:49,400
interesting other perspective of free software. How do all these really supposedly great advantages

406
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:57,680
that we're putting on the table affect the people? We did have very open source prone

407
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:03,960
government in Barcelona, specifically in the city council. And we did get to talk to quite

408
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:11,360
a bit of politicians. And we got to hear the things that we wanted to hear, and then we

409
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:17,240
got to not hear the things we wanted to hear, which was a bit disappointing in the end.

410
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:21,000
But yeah, we were there, and we did our best.

411
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:28,120
But it sounds like those are the efforts to try to share free and open source software

412
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:33,940
that you can only do on the ground talking to people. If you're trying to reach counselors

413
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:40,600
and things via the internet, it's definitely not as powerful. And you don't get that feedback

414
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:43,560
as well. So yeah, that sounds really important.

415
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:49,800
The interesting thing is to actually end up talking to the engineer in the different organizations,

416
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:55,640
right? You can talk to the politician, and he will talk to you about commitments and

417
00:41:55,640 --> 00:42:01,720
about how it's impossible to do or not, or even they want to do it. For example, in the

418
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:07,920
city council case, what I got in the end was the engineers telling me, oh, the politicians,

419
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:13,800
they are keeping us from doing this whole Linux thing, but it's awesome. And on the

420
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,240
other hand, I was talking to politicians.

421
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:20,000
So I was talking to the engineers at SKD because they were using Plasma on their systems. And

422
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:26,600
I found one of the engineers that reported about report, and I sent him an email, and

423
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:33,400
I went all the way as, well, the vice president back then. But I was also the coordinator

424
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:37,600
of personal office software, and I was in touch with the politicians. And the politicians

425
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:41,640
were telling me, oh, yeah, the engineers, I mean, we tell them to go Linux, but they

426
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:49,440
give us all of these problems that it was frustrating because they were blaming each

427
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,440
other.

428
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:56,400
And the only conclusion was that, well, nobody did anything. Or I mean, they did something

429
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,360
things, just not the things I hoped for.

430
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:02,280
That sounds like a communication problem, right?

431
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:05,440
Communication is expensive, like you said.

432
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:11,080
Well, Aleš, thank you so much for joining me. If people wanted to get in contact with

433
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:12,080
you, where would they reach you?

434
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:17,280
You can reach me in my email, for example. It's Aleš Paul. I would say you write it

435
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:21,880
as you hear it, but if you're an English speaker, that doesn't apply.

436
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:22,880
Yes.

437
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:26,160
I guess you can put it in the description or something.

438
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:30,320
Yeah, it's definitely in the show notes, for sure. We'll share it there.

439
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:39,240
My name and my family name, at kd.org. It's the same on Twitter, on, I don't know, Facebook,

440
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:44,000
LinkedIn. I don't really use these that much anymore, but they're there.

441
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,080
Well, thank you so much for joining me. I really appreciated this conversation.

442
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:53,160
Yeah, thank you for having me and for the talk. It was really nice.

443
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:56,680
Yeah, let's chat again soon.
