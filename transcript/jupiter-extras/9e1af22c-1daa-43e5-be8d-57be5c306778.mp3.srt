00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,680
Well, hi, everyone. Welcome to Brunch with Brent. I'm so pleased to be joined today by

2
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,280
Nuritzi Sanchez. Nuritzi, how you doing?

3
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:24,320
Hello. I am doing really well because I am in sunny California and it is a beautiful

4
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,880
day here today.

5
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:33,040
Nice. I will admit that I'm in Northern Ontario and we're supposed to get a lot of snow. So

6
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,200
a little bit of maybe the opposite, but I'll be thinking of you.

7
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,200
That sounds nice too.

8
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:43,520
Well, that's the thing though, right? Is I think it's all about attitude and I've kind

9
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:51,160
of taken that approach to weather in the last several years and it changes everything. So

10
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:58,560
glad to hear you mention that. Nuritzi, you are now kind of a new thing for you, but a

11
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,160
senior open source program manager at GitLab. Is that right?

12
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:08,000
Yeah. I just joined at the beginning of this month and I'm really excited to be part of

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:16,600
this team helping to really get more open source projects to join GitLab by helping

14
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:23,000
them solve any issues that they have, helping them with the migration process, all of that.

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,400
So I love GitLab and I love open source and so it's the perfect thing for me.

16
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:34,800
What a nice match when you can combine a lot of things that you love and we will get into

17
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:42,060
that when we dive a little bit into your history. But I would imagine being a month into GitLab,

18
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,480
you're still kind of learning the ropes and getting to meet people and all of that stuff.

19
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:49,280
Has that been sort of nice getting to meet the people behind it?

20
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:55,000
Yeah. It's the first time that I've been part also of an all remote company and I think

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,780
that I was a little hesitant about it at first because I love meeting people and having those

22
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:09,960
hallway conversations, coffee breaks out. But GitLab has an amazing all remote culture

23
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:14,000
and so I've just been scheduling lots and lots of coffee chats with people, getting

24
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,160
to know as many as possible and yeah, it has been great so far.

25
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:27,360
Good for you. I actually love that term of remote culture. I admit that I haven't heard

26
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:34,080
it before and that seems kind of silly considering I have my own remote culture considering I'm

27
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,000
self-employed and all that stuff. But it seems to me like maybe that's what makes remote

28
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,200
work successful or not, is having the tools and having the people. But also, you mentioned

29
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:51,600
just scheduling coffee chats and that sounds like, even though maybe on the outside it

30
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:58,480
seems not relevant to getting work done, I would imagine it's actually extremely important.

31
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:04,760
Yeah, it is. One of the things that GitLab does that's very different from other companies

32
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:12,720
that I've been a part of is that mindset of being handbook first and so they have very

33
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:19,100
detailed documentation of everything, which is really good for that asynchronous sharing

34
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:25,240
of knowledge. But it's one thing to look at a page and another thing to really meet the

35
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:32,120
people behind it and so as you said, it's really important to have those relationships

36
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:39,260
with the people behind it and really knowing who to go to and learning all of the little

37
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:47,200
tips and tricks that you just can't find on a sheet of paper. So yeah, big fan of coffee

38
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,180
chats. Yeah.

39
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:53,440
You mentioned documentation in there and I just want to quickly say that it's actually

40
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:59,040
been a theme that has happened throughout the conversations I've had here on brunch

41
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:05,040
and I didn't expect that at first. Like for instance, the conversation I had recently

42
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:12,360
with Heather Elsworth, she's a huge fan of documentation and how useful that is but you're

43
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:17,800
describing it sort of useful internally as well, which I love, but you're absolutely

44
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:22,880
right like maybe that's the first step but having that human connection is almost the

45
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:30,680
necessary second step and the deeper dive into understanding anything. So I really,

46
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:36,840
I love that idea of those scheduled coffee chats. I mean, I know you're kind of new with

47
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:42,160
the one month thing but could you give us a little bit more of an understanding of what

48
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:48,000
a senior open source program manager does on a daily basis? Have you figured that out

49
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
yet?

50
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:57,280
Right. I'm in the process. But the first thing is that the program was set up because GitLab

51
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:05,760
is an open core organization and a big part of just the culture there is to give back

52
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:11,200
to the open source community. And so they've tried to foster this in different ways and

53
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:21,080
one way was by providing open source projects with access to their premium levels for free.

54
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:26,720
And then also that's the enterprise edition. And then they have a community edition that

55
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:33,120
is fully free software. The enterprise edition you can do either like GitLab.com or your

56
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:42,600
self-hosted instance and it has some proprietary software there too. But the community edition

57
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:48,120
is completely open source so it's great for projects that are very concerned about the

58
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:58,040
free software side of things or just follow further along that spectrum. And so what I

59
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:05,520
am supposed to be doing is helping to really grow that program because so far it's been

60
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:12,280
very reactive and we have our internal processes set up to handle these requests and to start

61
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:19,040
to assist large organizations like GNOME and KDE and Debian has also been one. There's

62
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:25,700
still a lot of room for improvement and it's my job to really go in and analyze the current

63
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:33,000
program and start to fix little bits and pieces that could be fixed and really to start doing

64
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:40,100
more of that outreach and letting people know that the program even exists. And that is

65
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:46,960
my bread and butter. I love doing that stuff. I love going in and finding challenges that

66
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,720
need to be solved and then talking to lots of different people to figure out who I need

67
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:59,040
to go to. Also, the other thing that was really interesting about this is that everybody at

68
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:05,560
GitLab seems to be new because they've just experienced so much growth in the last two

69
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:12,640
years. A few people have said they were there about a year and a half ago when it was about

70
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:20,680
250 people and it's now 1,200. And so there's this joke that you're there in the room or

71
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:27,480
like, you know, the video chat room with people that are new to GitLab, newer to GitLab and

72
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:35,760
newest to GitLab. So it is fun. It's awesome. But yeah, I never feel like out of place is

73
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,280
the new person because everybody is like that.

74
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:45,760
Well, that's actually really nice. I would imagine too that there's quite a bit of like

75
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:51,840
great energy considering that people are new. I know oftentimes that newness is actually

76
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,520
a really great feature.

77
00:07:53,520 --> 00:08:01,840
Yes, exactly. It's really, really awesome to be at a company with people from all sorts

78
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,320
of different backgrounds. Some people haven't really been part of the open source world

79
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:11,120
or haven't been part of the dev ops tools world. And, you know, they bring in their

80
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:21,080
own expertise. I love thinking about diversity in all its forms and you do see lots of different

81
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:27,760
types of thought diversity. And again, it's my first one there and I've already heard

82
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:34,920
that there are ways that GitLab are trying to continue to constantly like build out other

83
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:40,160
types of diversity or just in general like be a more diverse organization. But my experience

84
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:45,200
so far has been really awesome with that. And it comes from, as you say, like a bunch

85
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:52,080
of new people coming in from different areas and, you know, working on this common product.

86
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:57,480
That sounds really amazing as an environment to try to do some of your best work. I heard

87
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:01,840
you there earlier get a little bit excited about the people aspect of things when you

88
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:05,440
were describing it. I would imagine that's actually a lot of fun too because it sounds

89
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,280
like you're kind of reaching into a whole bunch of different communities. How's that

90
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,280
been?

91
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:16,760
I haven't done as much community work at GitLab yet because I'm first focusing on kind of

92
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:22,320
like the infrastructure part. So right now, when I was talking about, you know, talking

93
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:28,640
to lots of different people, it was all internally. And this comes along with trying to streamline

94
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:34,280
the processes better. I have to, you know, better understand the different teams that

95
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:40,520
will touch my project or that would be interested in my project and find ways for us to better

96
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:47,180
collaborate. And an example, like a tangible example of this is that the way like we really

97
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:53,200
dog food our project. And so all of my organization for my program, which is I love dog fooding

98
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:59,840
things. I do it. It's great to like, I actually don't know. I don't know what that means.

99
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:07,200
But dog fooding is basically other people also refer to it as like we drink our own

100
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:16,520
wine. So it's basically eating your own. I can't explain it. Okay. I know the term.

101
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:22,880
It means you use your own products, but why is it dog fooding? Maybe a follow-up question

102
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,980
for me the next time.

103
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:27,560
We can go with it. I still really like it.

104
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:34,280
Yeah. So anyway, the point is that I use GitLab for my daily work and this is great because

105
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:41,920
I'm not an engineer. And so it's a tool that can really be used by lots of different people.

106
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,140
And that was actually part of the reason why I was so excited about it in the first place

107
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:50,600
is that I've tried all sorts of different tools and this is the one where I could see

108
00:10:50,600 --> 00:11:00,320
lots of different teams actually using. And so back to my tangible example, I have a label

109
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:07,560
called open source that I work with, but it was only part of the community relations project.

110
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:12,240
And so I'm now promoting it to like the top level so that everybody can use it within

111
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:20,080
the organization. And this is my way to start to really be able to promote the work that

112
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:26,160
I'm doing internally so that people know to come to me when they need help or just in

113
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,160
general to get more awareness about the program that I'm building.

114
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:38,200
Keep the dog food flowing. Now, when you describe that you have a chance to use GitLab for yourself,

115
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:43,000
what for you are sort of the features that really stand out in your current workflow?

116
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,640
Because I would imagine, you know, some of us listening don't necessarily have experience

117
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:53,600
with GitLab yet, especially in a non sort of developer capacity. So what is it about

118
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,560
you that really grabs you about it using it on a daily basis?

119
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:02,000
I think that in the roles that I've been, I have had to work with engineers, sometimes

120
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:08,360
very heavily, sometimes not as heavily at Endless, which I'm sure I'll talk about later.

121
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,080
Yes, please.

122
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:18,920
A lot of it was working with engineers to develop like applications or to create like

123
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:25,600
a beta testing program or, you know, various initiatives that required a lot of direct

124
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:31,640
work with engineers. And I worked very cross functionally. So at Endless, we decided to

125
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:38,280
actually go with Fabricator, which is another project management tool. And we tried to show

126
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:46,020
it to the design team. They like ran away crying. And that's not to say that Fabricator

127
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:53,640
isn't a lovely tool. It's just that the interface of it is not as easy to use, or it's not as

128
00:12:53,640 --> 00:13:01,420
intuitive and it's not as beautiful as some of the other tools that we were evaluating.

129
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:09,040
And so when we went with Fabricator for like utility at Endless, our design team was just,

130
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:16,360
you know, not super pleased. You know, eventually they were able to adopt it and everything.

131
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:24,120
But I think that at GitLab, Gnome was one of the first like big projects to migrate

132
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:30,840
over to using GitLab. And that was partly just to consolidate their tools and use a

133
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:36,140
single platform as part of the newcomer story so that people didn't have to start signing

134
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:41,600
up for all sorts of different tools. And again, part of it was like that ease of use and being

135
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:47,280
able to attract a lot of newcomers. And I just, I fell in love with the product because

136
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:53,940
it was usable and it had all the same functionality. When you asked about like specific features,

137
00:13:53,940 --> 00:14:01,280
the Kanban boards and labels, milestones, or like being able to set dates and assign

138
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:10,200
tasks to people, all of the same things that I had liked about things like Trello or Basecamp

139
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:17,640
or Asana. In my mind, those are some of the more like user-friendly project management

140
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:24,840
ones that aren't as commonly used for engineering teams. And so I just really saw GitLab as

141
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:31,720
something that provided a little bit of something for everybody. At Gnome, my focus was on that

142
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:38,620
engagement team and helping to grow the community and to also evangelize for other skill sets

143
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:43,040
and you know, like just in general diversity. I kind of mentioned that as a theme that I'm

144
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:48,480
really interested in. And I saw it as, you know, a tool that people could start using

145
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:55,720
even if they weren't very familiar with engineering tools and practices. And even if somebody

146
00:14:55,720 --> 00:15:01,160
joined the engagement team just to do marketing type work, they could start to get familiar

147
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:07,440
with the tool and then build that confidence so that if they then wanted to start dabbling

148
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:15,400
in some of the more like, you know, either documentation or some more like code contribution

149
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:20,400
type work, then they were at least familiar with the tool and could, you know, transition

150
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:28,120
more easily to that. So those are, I guess, the reasons why I get excited about it.

151
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:34,560
A great many good reasons. Thank you for sharing that. It sounds super powerful. I admit I

152
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:41,760
don't have experience with it, but now I'm itching to get some. So that's a good side.

153
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:48,760
Yeah, it's really pretty. You mentioned in there some of your experience working with

154
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:56,320
the Gnome team. And I know you've been quite involved there. Can you walk us through that?

155
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:03,840
Sure. So I first got involved through my work at Endless. And just kind of quick background

156
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:09,960
on that Endless is a company that was started back in 2012. I was one of the people who

157
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:18,000
helped start it. And we at Endless, we were building a Linux based desktop. We first launched

158
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:26,320
on our own hardware. But Endless was designed to reach people who didn't have great internet

159
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:32,080
connection, perhaps no internet connection, or were new to computers. And so we're really

160
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:41,400
all about simplifying the Linux desktop experience to make it easy for your grandmother to use,

161
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:50,760
you know, or anybody like your two year old daughter, anybody. And so we started to, you

162
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:56,480
know, really contribute upstream. We were a Gnome based desktop. And so we were contributing

163
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:05,440
very heavily upstream to Gnome. And I was invited to one of the initial, one of the

164
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:11,320
annual conferences. It was in Sweden. I was super excited to go to Sweden.

165
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,320
Lucky you.

166
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:22,880
Yes. And I got to speak about, you know, some of the ways that we had changed the designer

167
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:30,560
when designing for our audience considerations that you had to have. And so, you know, I

168
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:37,400
first of all loved the atmosphere of the community. They were all very welcoming, very, you know,

169
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,720
I didn't feel like an outsider.

170
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:45,140
That is so important too, right? Because if you're trying to make any change or recommendations

171
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:51,340
or trying to collaborate with anyone, that is a necessity to be sort of welcomed with

172
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:56,680
open arms and to be, yeah, collaborative. So that is very good to hear.

173
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:01,880
Yeah. I think especially, I had never been to an open source conference before. As I

174
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:09,120
said, I'm not an engineer. And so I had a lot of, not hesitation, but I just wasn't

175
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:15,520
sure how I would be received as a non-engineer at this conference. Most of my colleagues

176
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:20,560
going were all engineers and had been part of the open source world. So here I was like,

177
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:27,400
I'm a non-engineer, new to open source, let's do this. And it was great. Like people were

178
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:32,120
so nice and they were, you know, willing to explain things to me. And I just, I got really

179
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:37,160
excited about it. And you know, the whole thing is that when I first started learning

180
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:42,360
about open source software and really helping to figure out which applications to pre-install

181
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:49,400
on EndlessOS, I was one amazed by how many awesome applications there were available.

182
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:55,240
I had no idea coming from like a Windows and Mac background that the Linux application

183
00:18:55,240 --> 00:19:00,200
ecosystem even existed. So I was like, wow, I don't have to pay for Photoshop. This is

184
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,480
great. Like let's do GIMP and Inkscape.

185
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:10,320
It's an enabler, isn't it? Right. And for Endless, that's the whole idea is to enable

186
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,880
creativity and access and all of that stuff. So what a beautiful thing.

187
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:20,520
Exactly. And while I was so excited about like the practicality of all these applications,

188
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:26,920
I was a little less excited about how they looked and they felt. And you've already kind

189
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:31,560
of heard me get excited about how pretty GitLab is. Like this is a reoccurring theme in my

190
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:38,400
life is that I like beautiful things. And I, you know, I'm all about experiences too.

191
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:44,080
Like when I really value experiences. And so it's like, at Endless, I think they said

192
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:48,880
like pixels don't cost anything. So like, let's make this really luxurious and let's

193
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:56,040
make it feel super high quality so that our users, even if they can't afford, you know,

194
00:19:56,040 --> 00:20:02,560
luxury items, you know, they feel like this is a luxury item. And that's really what I

195
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:08,600
wanted. You know, like I care a lot about the usability and the experience. And I felt

196
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:18,080
so hopeful for how the Linux application ecosystem could keep evolving to have that in mind.

197
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,840
And for that, that's why I got really excited about the diversity, diversity of thought,

198
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:28,280
diversity of like lots of different aspects. So that, you know, you could really create

199
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:35,360
software that was not only functional, but a delight to use. And so that's how I sort

200
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:41,520
of got plugged into the GNOME community. At the time, the engagement team was just a few

201
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:49,380
people. And so really was excited about joining that and helping to grow the team and start

202
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:56,920
advocating for like hearing more about our brand and marketing and outreach and building

203
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:06,400
a community, all of that stuff. And I guess they found it valuable. I was asked to run

204
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,000
for the board of directors.

205
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Wow.

206
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:16,200
Yeah. And I ended up serving three terms. And during that time, when I first joined,

207
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:21,040
we didn't have an executive director. So I helped with that hiring process. And a lot

208
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:25,800
of my strength is in project management and really driving things forward. So I was able

209
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:31,560
to bring that in. And then, you know, we went through the whole restructuring of our organization,

210
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:36,040
because as we started to care more about the newcomers experience and about, you know,

211
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:40,900
like really caring about our community. And actually for us, the move to GitLab was a

212
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:46,120
huge part of that because it was, you know, completely changing our tools to be more modern

213
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:52,560
and, you know, easy for newcomers to join. That's when we started getting more donations

214
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:57,720
and more, like, publicity. And there were a lot of, like, little things and big things

215
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:07,680
that happened. Ubuntu changed to, came back to us as having GNOME as the default. And

216
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:16,120
we ended up having, you know, more newcomers join. And it was just a very, like, momentous

217
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:22,560
period for us. And during all that time, we had to change a lot of the way that the foundation

218
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:28,240
was running, because we went from having one employee to having seven employees. And for

219
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:34,160
us, that was a historical record. We'd never hired anyone outside of our director of operations

220
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:42,360
and executive director full time. And so now we're able to, you know, help not only keep

221
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:46,840
the GNOME community healthy, but start dreaming even bigger than we ever have before. And

222
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,440
yeah, it's been an exciting time.

223
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:55,960
It sounds exciting. You must feel, you know, I'm going back to your describing sort of

224
00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:01,280
that, that feeling of showing up at that very first conference and not really knowing if

225
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:07,480
you're going to sort of fit in. And then, you know, fast forward to that moment you

226
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:15,640
just described as as being, you know, helping to form what is really an exciting time for

227
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:23,160
the GNOME community and the foundation. And it sounds like those have really been catalysts

228
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:29,880
to a lot of positive change in many communities around. So that must be must feel really good

229
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,520
for you to be a part of that.

230
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:38,120
Yeah, definitely. And I'm always amazed at, you know, again, going back to kind of experience

231
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:45,640
it at events. I see events as like the lifeblood of a lot of open source communities because

232
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:51,640
it's the time when, you know, you get your core members together to work on things or

233
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:58,960
it's a place to draw in newcomers and to really have that in person touch point that will

234
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:08,160
carry on throughout the year when you're all remote. And, and yeah, I just think that it's

235
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:16,120
something that sometimes people don't value as much, but there's so much value in creating

236
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:21,840
awesome events and experiences for people. And it's something that, you know, in addition

237
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,800
to all my other interests, I feel really excited about.

238
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:29,600
You're a multifaceted human being. That's a good thing.

239
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,000
Yeah. I get pulled into lots of projects.

240
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:41,120
Well, you probably allow yourself to, it sounds like you, you, you jump in full swing. And

241
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:49,820
so maybe that's a really nice segue then into your efforts with the Libre application summit.

242
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:55,040
It sounds like that brings together a lot of your efforts all into one place. And I'm

243
00:24:55,040 --> 00:25:00,680
actually admit to not being that familiar with what happens on the ground at the Libre

244
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:05,960
application summit. So what's it like there? How are you involved? What are the people

245
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,520
like? I'm sure they're amazing, but give us a sense of it.

246
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:14,960
We started the, we used to call it loss gnome. And that was when it was Libre application

247
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:26,280
summit as a way to really move forward the experience behind Linux applications. And

248
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:32,640
we had a couple of iterations of that, and then KDE expressed an interest in also participating

249
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:38,240
in the organization of it. And, you know, it was something that to me was made a lot

250
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:43,960
of sense where, you know, we're only going to be able to move the dial on this if we're

251
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:53,520
working together strategically and, you know, able to provide big organizations with sort

252
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:59,800
of a united front where we say like, these are the options. And we were really seen as

253
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:05,040
a collaborative community as opposed to, you know, like each doing their own thing and

254
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,320
having a lot of segmentation.

255
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:12,520
Yeah, it sounds like breaking down some of those perceived sort of rivalries is really

256
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:18,480
beneficial, even if, you know, that's not the reality. But there's been a lot of sense

257
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:23,880
that, oh, these two camps can't collaborate. But that, I think, has been, at least from

258
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:29,840
my perspective, one of the greatest gifts that has come out of Libre application summit.

259
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,240
And you've described that as really meaningful, too.

260
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:38,560
Yes, exactly. I, you know, before really getting involved in the Libre application summit,

261
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:44,400
I, well, now, what I was going to say is that we rebranded to, instead of last GNOME, Libre

262
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:51,480
application summit hosted by GNOME, we rebranded to Linux app summit. And that's the more like

263
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:58,040
neutral version so that, you know, we can have both GNOME and KDE be the hosts and also,

264
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:03,080
you know, continue to evolve it. We're still not sure how far the evolution will go if

265
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:07,560
it'll become its own organization at some point or if it will continue to be co-hosted

266
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:15,000
by KDE and GNOME. There's still, you know, lots of room for growth and discussion. But

267
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:21,560
yeah, before my involvement with that, I didn't really know many KDE people. I think I knew

268
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:27,760
one from a conference, two from a conference in Brazil. And they were great, but they expressed

269
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:33,620
too that they were really interested in doing more with GNOME. And that sort of planted

270
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:38,360
the seed in my mind of, you know, I have to get to know more KDE people. I'd really like

271
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:45,760
to understand areas where we can collaborate. And this just naturally made sense. They were

272
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:53,040
incredible to work with. I worked very closely with Alish Pol, the current president, and

273
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:58,720
they were just so supportive and collaborative. And yeah, I think that because of them, we

274
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:07,400
were able to double attendance and to have much more of an outreach than we had in previous

275
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,400
years. So lots of great things.

276
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:14,600
That must feel amazing to be part of all of that. I'm sitting here just like jaw dropped

277
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:22,200
at how important that stuff is and bringing people together and just seeing what comes

278
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:26,520
out the other end when you combine some, you know, really some people doing some great

279
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:33,920
work all in the same room. What a gift. Can I ask you how it is that you ever came to

280
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:38,080
the tech world in the first place? Because it sounds to me like you have a big heart

281
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:46,020
for the sort of human aspect of it and organizing people and organizing projects. But how did

282
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:48,880
you come to tech in the beginning?

283
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:55,560
Yeah, that's a great question. Let's see, when I was younger, I thought I'd be a doctor,

284
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,560
obviously.

285
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,560
It's a good choice.

286
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:03,440
Yeah. Well, that was the thing is it was through a lot of exploration. Actually, in high school,

287
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:09,400
I interned at a hospital. Don't ask me why they let me in as a high schooler, but they

288
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:15,560
did. And it was at a children's hospital, at the Stanford Children's Hospital. And

289
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:19,520
my heart broke because I didn't like seeing children when they were sick. I wanted to

290
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:25,000
do something to prevent that. And that was sort of the reoccurring theme also within

291
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:32,800
the different internships or programs that I tried out where I also thought that I might

292
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:41,640
become a lawyer. And I interned at an immigration law clinic, and I just had so many stories

293
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:49,800
of heartbreaking stories of people battling through immigration stories. And it was something

294
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:54,520
where I didn't want to fight at that level. I wanted to fight at the higher level of like,

295
00:29:54,520 --> 00:30:02,320
how can I prevent this from happening? Or how can I do a deeper level? I just felt kind

296
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,200
of helpless in that situation.

297
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:11,280
So anyway, I graduated with an international relations major and a minor in psychology.

298
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:18,600
And that still goes along with my interest in people all around the world. And growing

299
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:24,760
up in Silicon Valley, you're just surrounded by tech. And what I really love about it is

300
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:30,120
how it's almost like a superpower, where just a few people can create something that

301
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:37,700
can enormously impact other people's lives. And this is kind of an extreme and not the

302
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:44,160
best example, but the person who created Flappy Birds was used by so many people. And it's

303
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:52,040
just still like the core concept is that a person can create something that can touch

304
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:58,040
so many lives. And so that was really where I saw, okay, well, if I want to make a huge

305
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:04,480
impact on this world, I really do see tech as that tool of reaching people.

306
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,980
And I know there are social ramifications of technology. That was something that I was

307
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:14,680
really aware of also. But that was even more reason to join because I care about these

308
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:19,320
things. I care about cultural sensitivity and about making sure that you're not forcing

309
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:26,020
technology to people who are saying that it's better than their way of life. And so those

310
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:33,280
are the human aspects that I think should be infused in technology. Because after all,

311
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:39,480
technology is just a tool to help you improve your life. So I really see it in that lens.

312
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,000
It's a means for us to express ourselves, right?

313
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Yeah.

314
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Yeah.

315
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:49,700
That is actually, you know, the reason that I came to open source in the first place was

316
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:57,240
hitting pause on sort of my interest in the technical aspects, because that's easy for

317
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:03,920
me to get into the way my mind works. But then hitting pause and using my heart to say,

318
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:10,480
well, how does this change people's lives? And it sounds like you spent a lot of time

319
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:16,060
and effort and energy thinking about that throughout your years as well. And what amazing

320
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:23,560
things we can do when we use that as a guiding light, especially in the world of technology.

321
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:30,040
Yes. And what you say, how it draws you towards open source, I think that's been the biggest

322
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:38,080
kind of twist in my journey. I didn't know what open source was. And then now I find

323
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:44,160
myself really interested in it and having it be something that is really guiding my

324
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:48,880
path forward. And it has to do with what you said of really, you know, like the people

325
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:53,880
aspect of things. And something I didn't share about my background earlier is that

326
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:58,280
both of my parents are from Mexico. And I had grown up, you know, really like going

327
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:05,800
back and just seeing so many things that I wanted to fix there or help, you know, challenges

328
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:11,680
that I wanted to help solve. And it was as simple back then as my dad wanted to go visit

329
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:16,800
his mom and, you know, wanted to find the cheapest way to get there. And we knew that

330
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:21,520
there were buses, but there was no information online about bus schedules or train schedules

331
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:27,120
or anything. And so, you know, like having a simple website would have helped my dad,

332
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:34,360
but also probably lots of other people. And, you know, the cost of setting up a website

333
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:41,320
could be difficult or, you know, prohibitive for some people. And so now there are tools

334
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:48,160
to allow that. And there's obviously a difference between free software, free of cost software,

335
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:55,320
and free software in the philosophical sense of free to reuse, modify, do whatever you'd

336
00:33:55,320 --> 00:34:00,960
like with it. You know, I think that the being able to do whatever you want with it is so

337
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:05,760
powerful because it really allows somebody to not have to do something from scratch,

338
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:13,280
but really build upon somebody else's work and to continue to focus on the problem as

339
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:20,300
opposed to have to deal with some of the more logistical effort in solving that challenge.

340
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:28,960
So anyway, I really have been drawn to the open source movement as a result of my family

341
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:34,880
background even, and just kind of the hopes and dreams that I have for making a difference

342
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,880
in the world.

343
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:40,240
Yeah, it sounds like it necessarily touches a deep place in you. And yet that's also the

344
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:46,280
place where you get a lot of your courage and a lot of your motivation to make those

345
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:56,040
differences. Do you feel like with your experience working in Endless and helping create what

346
00:34:56,040 --> 00:35:01,840
Endless has become, do you feel like you've achieved that in some ways? Or do you feel

347
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:07,120
like you got to see that firsthand in some instances?

348
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:14,160
Yeah, you know, I was really involved in all steps of that. And so, you know, one of the

349
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:20,240
coolest things was going out into the field. We had this policy where they wanted everybody

350
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:26,680
in the company to go to our target markets and meet our users and really hear from them.

351
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:31,920
And that was so rewarding because you could see how people who normally shied away from

352
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:39,320
technology or didn't see how it could really benefit them, really see how it could be a

353
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:47,640
huge enabler. And, you know, for example, there was in Guatemala, one of the things

354
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:55,720
that is difficult is that children are being required to do homework and research things

355
00:35:55,720 --> 00:36:05,320
on the internet. And because a lot of children in rural areas don't have internet connections

356
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:13,160
at home, they have to go to a computer lab or internet cafe and pay for that. But because

357
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:20,400
their parents aren't able to support the cost of sending five children to do reports at

358
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:25,320
internet cafes, sometimes they're unable to complete their homework. And then, you know,

359
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:31,560
they end up having to drop out of school. And so, having a computer that has a lot of

360
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:38,720
preloaded information and just had like the 80% of the most searched for articles for

361
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:44,960
that particular country preloaded and it had a lot of other resources, again, completely

362
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:50,680
available offline. And something as simple as that could really be a game changer and

363
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:59,880
help people, you know, be able to continue to go to school. So, I saw lots of these different

364
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:08,120
stories and, you know, ways that our technology was really impacting people's lives. And when

365
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:14,120
you ask me, you know, did we accomplish everything? I think I always in all that I do, I really

366
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:23,600
try to have both a micro and macro level of impact where I really try to do things immediately

367
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:28,060
for my family, for my friends. But then I also like to dream big and think about the

368
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:33,760
billions of people, how can I serve there? And, you know, so for those instances, like

369
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:40,840
I saw some real impact even there. However, we really hit some challenges when we were

370
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:47,920
trying to expand. I think that our business model didn't completely work and we had to

371
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:56,440
shift to try to, you know, find ways to gain traction in different countries. And we just

372
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:01,880
were hit again and again with how, you know, especially Microsoft is really good at business

373
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:07,200
development. And we often found that if we had started up, you know, to talk to a government

374
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:12,080
or something like that, then, oh, actually our project got canceled and oh, something

375
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:18,320
with Microsoft happened. And not to say that, you know, there was any shady business or

376
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:22,680
anything, but it just shows that they are a huge player and they're doing something

377
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:30,120
right where they're really going out and spending, like they have the network there to really

378
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:36,760
continue to grow. And for a small company that was, you know, trying to also get more

379
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:42,320
people to see the value in LibreOffice as opposed to Microsoft Office, it was tough.

380
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:50,280
And it just, unfortunately, we weren't able to do as much globally as we wanted to. So

381
00:38:50,280 --> 00:39:00,400
the company shifted to focus on the hack computer, which is to, it's still endless OS, but it's

382
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:06,640
now more designed to help children learn more about open source software and to start programming.

383
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:14,200
It's like a really cool game where they can start to, it's a game, but it ends up helping

384
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:20,240
them modify applications within their own computer. And it's just, it's really cool.

385
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:28,140
And so, you know, shifted strategy to really help the next generation see the benefits

386
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:33,400
of open source software, which I think is still a really awesome thing to do. But yeah,

387
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:38,640
so when you ask again about, like, did I reach the goals that I wanted to with Endless, I

388
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:46,520
would say my goal in touching people's lives, definitely. And I would have, you know, I

389
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:51,600
wish that it had been wildly successful in the global outreach part. So.

390
00:39:51,600 --> 00:40:00,760
Well, and that's the thing, like that is a massive hope to reach, you know, very large

391
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:07,040
groups of people and make a difference in the world. Just that word, you know, that's

392
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:14,120
trying to reach more than just your neighbors, right? And so to have that sort of as your

393
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:21,440
horizon allows you to accomplish some really amazing things while you're doing the work.

394
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:27,020
But so I don't think you should necessarily be too hard on yourself because it sounds

395
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:33,040
like you made some really profound impacts on even a few individuals that you had experience

396
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:38,640
with. But it seems to me like, you know, I heard years ago about Endless OS. And so even

397
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:44,720
someone like me who was reading about it because I cared about some of these same topics, just

398
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:52,120
knowing that Endless was out there doing some of that important work feels like a real success

399
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:54,320
overall.

400
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:59,320
And I think that the lasting impact, too, is our contributions upstream to GNOME and

401
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:06,480
just in the various technologies that we touched, really advocating for making it really user-friendly

402
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:13,600
for reaching an audience beyond just, you know, engineers or technical users and really

403
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:22,640
pushing that upstream in a, you know, community that I think had predominantly technical users

404
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:26,440
or basically faced that type of an audience.

405
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:36,760
So I'm really happy to see some of those changes. I think one big thing was Flatpak and FlatHub

406
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:42,000
really having like a store, a place where people could go to find applications in one

407
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:48,720
single area. We were, of course, not the only ones that contributed to that. In fact, it

408
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:54,480
was led by others, but we contributed heavily towards that and shared our knowledge of,

409
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:58,960
you know, usability testing and all that kind of stuff to help improve it and make it really

410
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:06,240
usable. So, yeah, lasting contributions.

411
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:11,240
They sound quite lasting. And those are the kind of things that just kind of inform the

412
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:17,680
future. I know you're using Endless OS for some of your daily work as well. Is that right?

413
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:25,640
Yeah, I still use it as my personal computer. I just I love how simple it is to use. It's

414
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:29,280
something that I can, you know, show any of my friends and family and have them instantly

415
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:33,400
be like, oh, cool, like that makes sense. So, yeah.

416
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:40,280
And so would you say, you know, for those listening, is it approachable by anyone, even

417
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:45,480
if it was designed maybe for a specific purpose? But it sounds like the design energy that

418
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:50,440
went into it was to try to just make it friendly for humans, period. Do you feel like that's

419
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:51,440
true?

420
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:58,440
Yes, definitely. And I think that one of the big things is that it uses OSTree, which basically

421
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:05,000
makes the updating process really easy. Again, I can't delve into the technical details behind

422
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:11,560
all of this. But one of the things that initially kind of scared me from Linux in general was

423
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:17,880
having to deal with command line to do anything.

424
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:22,120
Yeah, that's a fairly common fear, right?

425
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:32,620
Yes. So, you know, even just that was a huge one for us. And it's something that, you know,

426
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:39,900
in certain cases, like we've seen a lot of people who want to bring open source software

427
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:48,440
to schools or to communities that would benefit from the technology. And it's just something

428
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:54,220
that they can leave there and not worry about people like breaking or, you know, like not

429
00:43:54,220 --> 00:44:00,580
being able to update. And it's just super easy. And this makes me think about like the

430
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:09,200
adoption process. And we're often compared to one laptop per child. And one of the things

431
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:15,640
that we learned from that project is that if you bring technology to a new area and

432
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:25,240
you don't teach the teachers to use it, oftentimes the technology will fail because the teachers

433
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:29,200
don't know how to use it. And so they don't necessarily encourage the students to use

434
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:33,880
them or, you know, they might even not use the technology because it's embarrassing or

435
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:41,560
any other reason. And so one of the things that we tried to do when we were trying to

436
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:47,640
get more people to use it was to also invest in the training programs. But we found that

437
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:53,520
it was already really easy for people to use, but it was more so about like helping people

438
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:59,640
understand the utility of using a computer because sometimes they didn't even like think

439
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:05,280
that it was relevant to them. So that was really fascinating for me.

440
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:11,260
Nouritze, is there a question that you would put to our audience? Or it doesn't even need

441
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:15,360
to be a question. It could be something you'd like them to go see or something you want

442
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:19,320
them to experience or think about even.

443
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:24,360
I would just say that, you know, there's so much buzz around diversity and inclusion.

444
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:28,760
And I know that people have different thoughts and feelings about this. Overall, people seem

445
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:40,040
to agree that diversity is important. However, you know, there are people who are not as

446
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:47,800
enthusiastic about the methods to reach this. What I would like to stress is that it's about

447
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:53,480
experiences and how you make people feel and about really trying to connect with others

448
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:59,240
and understand other people's perspectives. And I think that if we keep that in mind,

449
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:04,240
that's really what's going to help us create better products. And that will sort of naturally

450
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:10,920
lead to diversity and inclusion. That's not to say that we shouldn't put an effort into

451
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:16,360
programs that will help foster that. But just as we're creating these programs to really

452
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:23,680
think about that experience that people are having. And so, you know, we all care about

453
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:29,240
technology. And I think that if we keep in mind that human-centered focus, that that's

454
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:33,000
really where we're going to create magic.

455
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
I like magic.

456
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,520
I do, too. I'm a huge fan.

457
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:40,640
If people wanted to connect with you, then where would they reach you?

458
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:46,340
I have lots of different ways to be contacted. But my personal email is probably the best

459
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:53,120
way to go because the Magnum one's having a little bit of problems these days. I can't

460
00:46:53,120 --> 00:47:01,760
send mail from it. So, yeah, it's nuritsi s at gmail.com. My name is really difficult.

461
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:13,080
So N as in Nancy, U, R, I, T as in Tom, Z as in Zebra, I, S as in Sam at gmail.com.

462
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:17,760
And I'm also on Telegram as Nuritsi, my first name.

463
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:23,920
That's great. I'm sure that'll be plenty for ways for people to connect. So thank you.

464
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:29,260
Yeah, I want to also say thanks for connecting with me. We've had a lot of fun during this

465
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:33,760
chat. And I hope we can get connected in the future, too.

466
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:38,480
Thank you so much for having me. It's always a pleasure speaking with you, Brent. So thank

467
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:39,480
you.

468
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:45,120
Thank you for your time and for giggling with me and all of those great things. So we'll

469
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:46,120
chat again soon.

470
00:47:46,120 --> 00:48:09,720
Sounds great.
