All electronic devices generate a little bit of heat, so this fact is unavoidable. The small size of the H&amp;T intensifies this challenge. The part of the H&amp;T that takes temperature measurements is close by and confined within the same case that houses the heat-generating components like the CPU. Shelly engineers devised a way to get around the problem by having the device sleep, then quickly take a measurement before the locally-produced heat can skew the measurement.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.aqara.com/us/temperature_humidity_sensor.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Aqara Wireless Smart Temperature Humidity Sensor\">Aqara Wireless Smart Temperature Humidity Sensor</a> &mdash; Monitors temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure in real time.\n\n</li><li><a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/jupiterbroadcasting/events\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Upcoming Jupiter Broadcasting West Coast Meetups\">Upcoming Jupiter Broadcasting West Coast Meetups</a> &mdash; The west coast road tour is coming.
