If the guessed port is correct, it causes some global resource in the Linux kernel to change, which can be indirectly observed. This is how the attacker can infer which ephemeral port is used.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Better-Ubuntu-Docs-2021\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Ubuntu Maker Canonical Planning To Vastly Improve Its Documentation\">Ubuntu Maker Canonical Planning To Vastly Improve Its Documentation</a> &mdash; This is a permanent, on-going commitment.
