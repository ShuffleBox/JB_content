This is in line with the way most operating systems work nowadays, and, while it may cause a few issues where software (and documentation) assumes the existence of the “pi” user, it feels like a sensible change to make at this point.</li><li><a href=\"https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pipewire/pipewire/-/releases/0.3.50\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"PipeWire 0.3.50\">PipeWire 0.3.50</a> &mdash; WINE applications using the JACK backend should no longer crash.</li><li><a href=\"https://lwn.net/Articles/890734/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"OpenSSH 9.0 released\">OpenSSH 9.0 released</a> &mdash; It is claimed to be primarily a bug-fix release, but it also switches to a new, quantum-computer-proof key-exchange protocol by default and includes a number of sftp changes, some of which may create some compatibility issues with scp.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Reiser5-April-2022\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Reiser5 Issues New Development Release, Performance Numbers For Scaling Out\">Reiser5 Issues New Development Release, Performance Numbers For Scaling Out</a> &mdash; Shishkin published an new Reiser5 unstable snapshot today that targets Linux 5.16 kernel compatibility.
