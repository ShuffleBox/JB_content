This release more than doubles the number of supported devices and contains a few important fixes and improvements.</li><li><a href=\"https://ubports.com/blog/ubports-blog-1/post/ubuntu-touch-ota-2-release-78\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"UBports release OTA 2\">UBports release OTA 2</a> &mdash; The UBports project is excited to announce the immediate availability of Ubuntu Touch 15.04 OTA-2.\n\nThis is a huge release for the Ubuntu Touch platform, bringing new supported devices, new features, and many bug fixes.</li><li><a href=\"https://blogs.gnome.org/uraeus/2017/09/19/launching-pipewire/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Launching Pipewire!\">Launching Pipewire!</a> &mdash; Pipewire is the latest creation of GStreamer co-creator Wim Taymans. The original reason it was created was that we realized that as desktop applications would be moving towards primarly being shipped as containerized Flatpaks we would need something for video similar to what PulseAudio was doing for Audio.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/09/open-letter-w3c-director-ceo-team-and-membership\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"EFF quits W3C over Encrypted Media Extensions\">EFF quits W3C over Encrypted Media Extensions</a> &mdash; In 2013, EFF was disappointed to learn that the W3C had taken on the project of standardizing “Encrypted Media Extensions,” an API whose sole function was to provide a first-class role for DRM within the Web browser ecosystem. By doing so, the organization offered the use of its patent pool, its staff support, and its moral authority to the idea that browsers can and should be designed to cede control over key aspects from users to remote parties.</li><li><a href=\"https://code.facebook.com/posts/300798627056246\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Facebook finally caves on react.js license\">Facebook finally caves on react.js license</a> &mdash; Next week, we are going to relicense our open source projects React, Jest, Flow, and Immutable.js under the MIT license. We're relicensing these projects because React is the foundation of a broad ecosystem of open source software for the web, and we don't want to hold back forward progress for nontechnical reasons.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/red-hat-announces-broad-expansion-open-source-patent-promise\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Red Hat Announces Broad Expansion to Open Source Patent Promise\">Red Hat Announces Broad Expansion to Open Source Patent Promise</a> &mdash; The expanded Patent Promise, while consistent with Red Hat’s prior positions, breaks new ground in expanding the amount of software covered and otherwise clarifying the scope of the promise. Red Hat believes its updated Patent Promise represents the broadest commitment to protecting the open source software community to date.</li></ul>", "published": "Sun, 24 Sep 2017 15:00:00 -0700", "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://linuxactionnews.com/20"}, {"length": "18169688", "type": "audio/mpeg", "href": "https://aphid.fireside.fm/d/1437767933/dec90738-e640-45e5-b375-4573052f4bf4/63c7ec23-c8bf-460c-a5eb-aa23e33887d7.mp3", "rel": "enclosure"}], "episode": "20"}
