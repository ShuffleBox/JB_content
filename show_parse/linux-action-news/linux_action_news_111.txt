Consequently, i386 will not be included as an architecture for the 19.10 release, and we will shortly begin the process of disabling it for the eoan series across Ubuntu infrastructure.</li><li><a href=\"https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2018-May/040310.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Proposal: Let's drop i386 May 9th 2018\">Proposal: Let's drop i386 May 9th 2018</a></li><li><a href=\"https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2018-May/040348.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Proposal: Let's drop i386 May 14th 2018\">Proposal: Let's drop i386 May 14th 2018</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Wine-Unsure-Ubuntu-32-Bit\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Wine devs worried\">Wine devs worried</a> &mdash;  \"I think not building packages for Ubuntu 19.10 would be the only practical option. It would probably be good to have a small explanation on the download page though. As I understand it, it would still be possible to run 32-bit executables on the Ubuntu 19.10 kernel, but we'd have to build and ship all our dependencies ourselves.
