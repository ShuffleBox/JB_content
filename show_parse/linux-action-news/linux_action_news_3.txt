So finally Devuan Jessie Stable is ready for release! </li><li><a href=\"https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2017/05/msg00002.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Debian Stretch is just weeks away.\">Debian Stretch is just weeks away.</a> &mdash; We plan to release on 2017-06-17.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=SteamVR-Home-Linux\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"SteamVR Home Now Works Under Linux\">SteamVR Home Now Works Under Linux</a> &mdash; SteamVR Home is a beta feature from Valve for making a social, interactive launcher experience in virtual reality.
