The main reason for this change was that GNOME dropped support for their legacy desktop, which retained the GNOME 2.x user experience and didn't require 3D composition -- a feature that in many computers would still need non-free software to run at full speed. MATE provides a perfect drop-in replacement, it is very light and stable and it retains all the user experience design that we are used to from previous Trisquel releases.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.reactos.org/project-news/reactos-048-released\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"ReactOS 0.4.8 released\">ReactOS 0.4.8 released</a> &mdash; The ReactOS Project is pleased to announce the release of version 0.4.8 as we continue to work on releasing every three months.\n\n</li><li><a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/german-government-goes-open-source-with-open-source-cloud-firm-nextcloud\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"German government goes open source with cloud firm Nextcloud\">German government goes open source with cloud firm Nextcloud</a> &mdash; Seeks \"construction of a private cloud for the federal government\"</li><li><a href=\"https://www.thurrott.com/internet-of-things-iot/156628/microsofts-next-os-based-linux-not-windows\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Microsoft's Next OS is Based on Linux, Not Windows\">Microsoft's Next OS is Based on Linux, Not Windows</a> &mdash; Microsoft announced a new operating system for IoT called Azure Sphere OS.
