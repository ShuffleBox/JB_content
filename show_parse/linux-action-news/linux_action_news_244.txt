To speak, press the ‚Äòpush-to-talk‚Äô (PTT) button, either by pressing it on the screen or by holding the spacebar. The catch is that, just like a walkie-talkie or two-way radio, only one person can speak at a time. When someone else is speaking, your PTT button will be disabled, and if you try to push it you‚Äôll hear a warning beep.\n\n</li><li><a href=\"https://lwn.net/Articles/896804/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Fedora and Ubuntu EOL announcements\">Fedora and Ubuntu EOL announcements</a> &mdash; If you are running Fedora 34, the time has come to move on; that distribution will reach the end of its support life on June 7.

Rosetta 2 needs a quite recent CPU (post v8.2) to work because of the instructions used. Does it work on non-Apple arm64 CPUs? ü§î Yes. (allows to settle the argument once and for all that this needs anything Apple specific outside of TSO support*. Answer is a no.)</li></ul>", "published": "Thu, 09 Jun 2022 06:00:00 -0700", "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://linuxactionnews.com/244"}, {"length": "12505830", "type": "audio/mp3", "href": "https://aphid.fireside.fm/d/1437767933/dec90738-e640-45e5-b375-4573052f4bf4/170fdea9-6453-4f92-85b7-339b800fc506.mp3", "rel": "enclosure"}], "episode": "244"}
