We have reduced the amount of engineering time and energy required for releases to one on-duty release engineer that rotates among team members. We no longer have a big push to upgrade our entire fleet. No more need for multi stage alpha, betas and GAs for new LTS releases while simultaneously chasing down older machines that still were running Ubuntu Precise or Lucid.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/red-hat-names-new-ceo/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Red Hat names new CEO\">Red Hat names new CEO</a> &mdash; In a move many will find surprising, Red Hat announced that Paul Cormier, the company's CEO and president since 2020, is stepping over to become chairman of the board. Matt Hicks, a Red Hat veteran and the company's head of products and technologies, will replace Cormier as president and CEO.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.makeuseof.com/kde-slimbook4-laptop-released/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"KDE Announces Powerful Slimbook 4 Linux Laptop\">KDE Announces Powerful Slimbook 4 Linux Laptop</a> &mdash; The laptops are powered by AMD Ryzen 7 5700U processor with eight cores.
