It's not just that Chrome is cross-platform and open-source, and (with Chrome Web Apps well behind us) sticks to the standards in a way that IE did not. Practically speaking, we must keep in mind that the browser is locked down on iOS in a way that didn't exist (and wouldn't have been tolerated) back then. This means that no matter how popular Chrome becomes, an importnat portion of mobile users must use Apple's browser (engine). But also, now matter how much effort, money Google puts into their web initiatives and in spite of their browser share dominance, they can lose big as they did with web components and webasm. That's the beauty of a standards based platform.</li><li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/2019/03/06/ios-publishing-with-gitlab-and-fastlane/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"How to publish iOS apps to the App Store with GitLab and fastlane\">How to publish iOS apps to the App Store with GitLab and fastlane</a> &mdash; See how GitLab, together with fastlane, can build, sign, and publish apps for iOS to the App Store.</li><li><a href=\"http://insideclojure.org/2019/03/08/journal/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Inside Clojure: Journal 2019.10 \">Inside Clojure: Journal 2019.10 </a> &mdash; Some tests I wrote were posted on Reddit this week, which was unexpected.
