It is obviously pragmatic in the range of possible support, but it shouldn’t have the technical stigma that it does. There really isn’t much of anything special that a native port does – we still make OpenGL calls, winsock is just BSD sockets, windows threads become pthreads, and the translation of input and audio interfaces don’t make much difference (XInput and Xaudio2 are good APIs!). A good shim layer should have far less impact on performance than the variability in driver quality.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/jupiterbroadcasting/events/284291401/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Jupiter Broadcasting East Coast Meetup\">Jupiter Broadcasting East Coast Meetup</a> &mdash; Let's hang out at the park across the street from Prime BBQ.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.toolbox.com/it-security/data-breaches/news/samsung-data-leak-lapsus/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"After NVIDIA, Hacker Group Lapsus$ Targets Samsung\">After NVIDIA, Hacker Group Lapsus$ Targets Samsung</a> &mdash; Global tech and electronics major Samsung became the latest target of the South America-based cyber extortion group Lapsus$.

Such a step could temporarily soften the exit from Russia of Microsoft, IBM, Oracle, and others, say experts. But, they warn, a large part of significant software from those companies is sold on subscription, which means access to them will be blocked in any event.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.gamedeveloper.com/the-cloud/-i-microsoft-flight-simulator-s-i-cloud-debut-comes-with-upsides-for-devs\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Microsoft Flight Simulator's cloud debut comes with upsides for devs\">Microsoft Flight Simulator's cloud debut comes with upsides for devs</a> &mdash; Microsoft is releasing an API for developers interested in building cloud-native games with Xbox Cloud Gaming capabilities in mind.</li></ul>", "published": "Wed, 09 Mar 2022 05:30:00 -0800", "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://coder.show/456"}, {"length": "42208258", "type": "audio/mp3", "href": "https://aphid.fireside.fm/d/1437767933/b44de5fa-47c1-4e94-bf9e-c72f8d1c8f5d/6348b8e5-c893-41e4-ad52-a213960614df.mp3", "rel": "enclosure"}], "episode": "456"}
