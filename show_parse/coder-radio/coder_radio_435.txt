While Apple largely won that case (the company went so far as to call the ruling a “resounding victory”) with Judge Gonzalez Rogers ruling in favor of Apple in nine of the ten claims Epic brought against the company, it did lose in one important way: the judge found that Apple violated California’s anti-steering rules, and demanded that Apple let developers link to outside payment systems. That policy would have taken over in December, but it may be pushed out beyond that — and it seems that’s the point.\n\n</li><li><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-makes-quiet-push-on-antitrust-enforcement-11633800598\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Justice Department Makes Quiet Push on Antitrust Enforcement\">Justice Department Makes Quiet Push on Antitrust Enforcement</a></li><li><a href=\"https://sadh.life/post/builtins/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Understanding all of Python, through its builtins\">Understanding all of Python, through its builtins</a> &mdash; Python as a language is comparatively simple.
