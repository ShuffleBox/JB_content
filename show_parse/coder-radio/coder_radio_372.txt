Businesses Love to Exploit It | WIRED</a> &mdash; The original well-meaning, geeky architects of the web believed that there was an abundance of altruism in human nature—and they were more correct on this count, it turns out, than many esteemed social philosophers were. But they were too optimistic in overlooking the possibility that corporations would exploit and colonize this new realm.

Moreover, and to keep the language clean, Crystal has built-in type inference, so most type annotations are unneeded.\n</li><li><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31572054-the-imposter-s-handbook\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"The Imposter's Handbook by Rob Conery\">The Imposter's Handbook by Rob Conery</a> &mdash; You've had to learn on the job.
