In fact, it is even possible to use both technologies in one project by choosing which of them works best for each individual feature. For example, you can implement chats with Elixir Phoenix, and the rest of the code can be written in Ruby on Rails.\n\n</li><li><a href=\"https://www.typescriptlang.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"TypeScript - JavaScript that scales.\">TypeScript - JavaScript that scales.</a> &mdash; TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.\n</li><li><a href=\"https://basarat.gitbooks.io/typescript/docs/why-typescript.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Why TypeScript · TypeScript Deep Dive\">Why TypeScript · TypeScript Deep Dive</a> &mdash; Types have proven ability to enhance code quality and understandability.

It is said that Clojure is a \"functional\" programming language; there's also talk of \"data-driven\" programming. What are these things? Are they any good? Why are they good? In this talk, Rafal attempts to distill the particular blend of functional and data-driven programming that makes up \"idiomatic Clojure\", clarify what it looks like in practise (with real-world examples), and reflect on how Clojure's conventions came to be and how they continue to evolve.</li></ul>", "published": "Mon, 03 Jun 2019 19:15:00 -0700", "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://coder.show/360"}, {"length": "33257766", "type": "audio/mp3", "href": "https://aphid.fireside.fm/d/1437767933/b44de5fa-47c1-4e94-bf9e-c72f8d1c8f5d/d84621fe-f527-4c65-9c14-ed6ac602e4a4.mp3", "rel": "enclosure"}], "episode": "360"}
