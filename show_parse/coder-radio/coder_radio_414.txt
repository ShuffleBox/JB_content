Running apps and performing other user tasks is the other way around, with the brunt borne on the Performance rather than Efficiency cores. This is because those user tasks are more likely to run with QoS of at least 17, and in many cases 25 and 33.</li><li><a for=\"for\" href=\"https://github.com/AkihiroSuda/lima/tree/master\" title=\"Lima: Linux-on-Mac: \">Lima: Linux-on-Mac: \"macOS subsystem for Linux\"</a> &mdash; Lima can be considered as a some sort of unofficial \"macOS subsystem for Linux\", or \"containerd for Mac\".</li></ul>", "published": "Wed, 19 May 2021 13:00:00 -0700", "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://coder.show/414"}, {"length": "34931493", "type": "audio/mpeg", "href": "https://aphid.fireside.fm/d/1437767933/b44de5fa-47c1-4e94-bf9e-c72f8d1c8f5d/9b7dfb9f-16b5-4062-8342-545818c2cc0b.mp3", "rel": "enclosure"}], "episode": "414"}
