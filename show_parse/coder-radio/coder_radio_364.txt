Goroutines can be thought of as light weight threads. The cost of creating a Goroutine is tiny when compared to a thread. </li><li><a href=\"https://golang.org/doc/faq#csp\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Why build concurrency on the ideas of CSP?\">Why build concurrency on the ideas of CSP?</a> &mdash; One of the most successful models for providing high-level linguistic support for concurrency comes from Hoare's Communicating Sequential Processes, or CSP. Occam and Erlang are two well known languages that stem from CSP. Go's concurrency primitives derive from a different part of the family tree whose main contribution is the powerful notion of channels as first class objects.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/1/20676755/jony-ive-exit-tim-cook-disinterest-in-product\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Jony Ive ‘dispirited’ by Tim Cook’s lack of interest in product design\">Jony Ive ‘dispirited’ by Tim Cook’s lack of interest in product design</a> &mdash; To many, Jony Ive’s announced departure from Apple last week felt very sudden.
