I understand that many people, particularly those already enamored with Rust, won’t agree with much of this article. But now you know why we are still writing C, and hopefully you’ll stop bloody bothering us about it.</li><li><a href=\"https://linuxacademy.com/devops/training/course/name/intro-to-python-development?utm_source=social&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=2019_aprilcourselaunch\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Introduction to Python Development at Linux Academy\">Introduction to Python Development at Linux Academy</a> &mdash; This course is designed to teach you how to program using Python.
