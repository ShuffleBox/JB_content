The catalyst was a specific meeting last summer: after being insulted and yelled at over WebEx (not for the first time, and not just one core team member), I decided to take a break. I was able to get leadership to eventually discuss the situation with me last Fall, but after avoiding dealing with it, they made excuses, and made it clear they weren't planning to do anything about it. As such, I decided not to return. They reassure me they \"want to make sure things are better for others in the future based on what we talked about\" though.</li><li><a href=\"https://forums.swift.org/t/core-team-to-form-language-workgroup/55455\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Core team to form language workgroup\">Core team to form language workgroup</a> &mdash; The core team is currently looking at restructuring the project's leadership to provide more pathways for community members to become actively involved in the project's stewardship.</li><li><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/02/new-preview-build-adds-microsoft-account-requirement-to-windows-11-pro/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"You’ll need a Microsoft account to set up future versions of Windows 11 Pro | Ars Technica\">You’ll need a Microsoft account to set up future versions of Windows 11 Pro | Ars Technica</a> &mdash; Like the Home edition of Windows 11, the Pro version will now require an Internet connection and a Microsoft account during setup.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22939290/web3-coinbase-apple-moderation-nfts\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Why Coinbase admitted Apple calls the shots\">Why Coinbase admitted Apple calls the shots</a> &mdash; As Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong wrote on February 4th, “For any app to be listed in the Apple and Google App Stores, it needs to play by the rules of those two companies.” That means that whatever Apple and Google decide as their content policy, Coinbase will follow, Armstrong says. “Our approach is to be free speech supporters, but not free speech martyrs.”</li><li><a href=\"https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/2849273531812512/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Immersed on Oculus Quest 2 | Oculus\">Immersed on Oculus Quest 2 | Oculus</a> &mdash; VR Offices!
