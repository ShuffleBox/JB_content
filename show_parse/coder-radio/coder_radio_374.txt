For example, improvements to the standard library are expected and welcomed by us, even though they may mean removing similar but incompatible definitions from our own code base. However, TypeScript 3.5 was a lot more work for us than other recent TypeScript upgrades.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/09/05/how-apple-uses-its-app-store-copy-best-ideas/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Apple has copied some of the most popular apps in the App Store for its iPhone, iPad and other software updates - The Washington Post\">Apple has copied some of the most popular apps in the App Store for its iPhone, iPad and other software updates - The Washington Post</a> &mdash; Apple plans this month to incorporate some of Clue’s core functionality such as fertility and period prediction into its own Health app that comes pre-installed in every iPhone and is free — unlike Clue, which is free to download but earns money by selling subscriptions and services within its app. Apple’s past incorporation of functionality included in other third-party apps has often led to their demise.\n\n</li><li><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/09/technology/apple-app-store-competition.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"How Apple’s Apps Topped Rivals in the App Store It Controls - The New York Times\">How Apple’s Apps Topped Rivals in the App Store It Controls - The New York Times</a> &mdash; But as Apple has become one of the largest competitors on a platform that it controls, suspicions that the company has been tipping the scales in its own favor are at the heart of antitrust complaints in the United States, Europe and Russia.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Sunsetting Python 2 | Python.org\">Sunsetting Python 2 | Python.org</a> &mdash; We have decided that January 1, 2020, will be the day that we sunset Python 2.

It’s our most widely used language both for backend services and the desktop client app (we are also heavy users of Go, TypeScript, and Rust). At our scale—millions of lines of Python—the dynamic typing in Python made code needlessly hard to understand and started to seriously impact productivity.
