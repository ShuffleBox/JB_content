That includes a smaller Mac Pro with up to 40 CPU cores and 128 graphics cores, a new Mac mini and a large-screened iMac Pro. I’d expect Apple to finish announcing its transition to its own silicon from Intel chips as early as June at WWDC 2022. </li></ul>", "published": "Wed, 05 Jan 2022 13:00:00 -0800", "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://coder.show/447"}, {"length": "27709985", "type": "audio/mp3", "href": "https://aphid.fireside.fm/d/1437767933/b44de5fa-47c1-4e94-bf9e-c72f8d1c8f5d/5d05a9f4-9dbe-4b0d-a774-256d558f1fac.mp3", "rel": "enclosure"}], "episode": "447"}
