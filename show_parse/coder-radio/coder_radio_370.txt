Wes mentioned Emacs because of the packages supporting Clojure development when he started with that. Elisp seems to be fairly intuitive and well documented, as a little functional language its own right (correct me if I'm wrong)--this makes for a soft intro to FP. Most of my coding has been in the space of embedded systems and low-level languages--not much functional programming to be had. This show has gotten me curious about FP, which is quite old in concept, and getting implemented nicely in modern languages. For me, I still rely heavily on special Vim keys that are not mapped in evil-mode, which causes some paper cuts. However, elisp makes it easy to customize the desired UI functionality with very short programs/elisp statements in a config file. It's quite a refreshing exercise for someone like me.\n</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/artichoke/artichoke\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"artichoke/artichoke: Artichoke is a Ruby made with Rust\">artichoke/artichoke: Artichoke is a Ruby made with Rust</a> &mdash; Artichoke is a platform for building MRI-compatible Ruby implementations.

They did not count on two developments: an extraordinarily aggressive public relations and lobbying campaign by Oracle, one of Amazon’s competitors, and the hostility of Mr. Trump to Amazon and its founder, Jeff Bezos.\n\n</li><li><a href=\"https://fsharp.org/history/hopl-draft-1.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"The Early History of F# (pdf)\">The Early History of F# (pdf)</a></li><li><a href=\"https://fsharp.org/use/linux/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Use F# on Linux | The F# Software Foundation\">Use F# on Linux | The F# Software Foundation</a></li><li><a href=\"http://ionide.io/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Ionide - Crossplatform F# Editor Tools\">Ionide - Crossplatform F# Editor Tools</a> &mdash; A Visual Studio Code package suite for cross platform F# development.\n\n</li><li><a href=\"https://thomasbandt.com/the-problem-with-fsharp-evangelism\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"The Problem With F# Evangelism\">The Problem With F# Evangelism</a> &mdash; There seems to be a constant struggle to convince seasoned C# developers to give F# a try.
