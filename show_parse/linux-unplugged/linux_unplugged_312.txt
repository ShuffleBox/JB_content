This summer it's been moving along and seeing some new developer contributions. </li><li><a href=\"http://blog.darlinghq.org/2019/07/darling-progress-report-q2-2019.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Darling Progress Report Q2 2019\">Darling Progress Report Q2 2019</a> &mdash; We are very excited to say that in Q2 2019 (April 1 to June 30) we saw more community involvement than ever before. Many pull requests were submitted that spanned from bug fixes for our low level assembly to higher level modules such as the AppKit framework. Thanks to everyone for your contributions and we hope for this level of engagement to continue.\n</li><li><a href=\"https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-desktop-kit/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Raspberry Pi 4 Desktop Kit\">Raspberry Pi 4 Desktop Kit</a> &mdash; Full desktop computer kit - just connect to HDMI display(s)\n\n</li><li><a href=\"https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspberry-pi-4-on-sale-now-from-35/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Raspberry Pi 4 on sale now from $35\">Raspberry Pi 4 on sale now from $35</a> &mdash; A 1.5GHz quad-core 64-bit ARM Cortex-A72 CPU (~3× performance)\n</li><li><a href=\"https://jamesachambers.com/raspberry-pi-ubuntu-server-18-04-2-installation-guide/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Raspberry Pi 4 Ubuntu Server 18.04.2 Install / Config Guide\">Raspberry Pi 4 Ubuntu Server 18.04.2 Install / Config Guide</a> &mdash; Right now there is a memory limitation of 1 GB in 64 bit mode on the Raspberry Pi 4. This is apparently due to the SD card driver breaking when more than 1 GB of RAM is present. This will all be solved eventually but until then I recommend using the 32 bit version of Ubuntu or waiting until the Raspberry Pi 4 support catches up. If you want to run the 64 bit one now anyway it works fine other than the memory limitation.\n</li><li><a href=\"https://archlinuxarm.org/platforms/armv8/broadcom/raspberry-pi-4\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Raspberry Pi 4 on Arch Linux ARM\">Raspberry Pi 4 on Arch Linux ARM</a></li><li><a href=\"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/arm@lists.fedoraproject.org/thread/OFIGDPUDFOA3BB33GVCDHTSGZ2Q77APK/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Fedora 30 - Rasbberry Pi 4 support - arm - Fedora Mailing-Lists\">Fedora 30 - Rasbberry Pi 4 support - arm - Fedora Mailing-Lists</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/cjrkfs/manjaro_announces_partnership_will_start_shipping/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Manjaro announces partnership, will start shipping closed source FreeOffice suite by default\">Manjaro announces partnership, will start shipping closed source FreeOffice suite by default</a> &mdash; Additionally we ship FreeOffice 491 by default.

Every Fedora CoreOS system begins with a generic, unconfigured disk image. On first boot Ignition will read the supplied config and configure the system. Ignition configs are usually supplied via the cloud’s userdata mechanism, or, in the case of bare metal, injected at install time. This guide will show you how to launch Fedora CoreOS on AWS, QEMU, and bare metal as well as how to create Ignition configs.\n\n</li><li><a href=\"https://podman.io/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Podman\">Podman</a> &mdash; What is Podman?
