Each dataset is treated like its own filesystem, with its own rules and settings, which means with regards to sharing over NFS, that you can share more securely as client's will not be able to reach out of the bounds of that dataset/filesystem that you decided to share.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.stavros.io/posts/how-to-configure-wireguard/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"How to easily configure WireGuard - Stavros' Stuff\">How to easily configure WireGuard - Stavros' Stuff</a> &mdash; At its core, all WireGuard does is create an interface from one computer to another.
