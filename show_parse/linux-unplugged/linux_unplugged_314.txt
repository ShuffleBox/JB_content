To eliminate them, you must first find the bugs that cause them, which can be like finding a needle in the proverbial haystack. This is what makes the 0-Day Continuous Integration (CI) Test Service so important. 0-Day delivers comprehensive, automated and continuous integration testing that monitors the Linux mainline and 800+ developer trees for regressions, helping find bugs before they reach the Linux kernel so problems can be fixed before they impact users. Simply put, 0-Day helps ensure Linux kernel quality in a highly complex development environment.</li><li><a href=\"https://lwn.net/Articles/777421/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Snowpatch: continuous-integration testing for the kernel\">Snowpatch: continuous-integration testing for the kernel</a> &mdash; The Linux kernel project lags many others in its use of CI testing for a number of reasons, including a fundamental mismatch with how kernel developers tend to manage their workflows. At linux.conf.au 2019, Russell Currey described a CI system called Snowpatch that, he hopes, will bridge the gap and bring better testing to the kernel development process.</li><li><a href=\"https://kernelci.org/faq/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Kernel CI Dashboard — FAQ\">Kernel CI Dashboard — FAQ</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/linux-test-project/ltp\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Linux Test Project\">Linux Test Project</a> &mdash; Linux Test Project is a joint project started by SGI, OSDL and Bull developed and maintained by IBM, Cisco, Fujitsu, SUSE, Red Hat, Oracle and others.

Therefore openQA was introduced and became an indispensable part of the openSUSE development and release processes. openQA is an automated test tool for operating systems. It allows to test the whole installation process of an operating system in a wide range of software and hardware configurations by leveraging qemu. This talk gives an introduction to openQA and explains how openQA works to help understand what it's output means.</li><li><a href=\"https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/OpenQA\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"OpenQA - Fedora Project Wiki\">OpenQA - Fedora Project Wiki</a> &mdash; Fedora uses the openQA automated testing system as a significant part of the release validation testing process, and for testing updates.
