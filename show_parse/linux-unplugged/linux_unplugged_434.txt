The post is really long, and it seems unlikely that I and the author will ever agree on this topic, so I’m only going to talk about a couple of paragraphs about disk usage and sharing of runtimes between apps which caught my eye.</li><li><a href=\"https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/bustle/bustle\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Bustle\">Bustle</a> &mdash; Graphical D-Bus message analyser and profiler.</li><li><a href=\"https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-initial-setup\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Gnome Initial Setup\">Gnome Initial Setup</a></li><li><a href=\"https://endlessos.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Endless OS Foundation\">Endless OS Foundation</a> &mdash; Our mission is to help all people and communities connect with technology.</li><li><a href=\"https://write.wjt.me.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Will sometimes does other stuff and writes about it\">Will sometimes does other stuff and writes about it</a></li><li><a href=\"https://ludocode.com/blog/flatpak-is-not-the-future\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Flatpak Is Not the Future - Ludocode\">Flatpak Is Not the Future - Ludocode</a> &mdash; Flatpak calls itself “the future of application distribution”. I am not a fan. I’m going to outline here some of the technical, security and usability problems with Flatpak and others. I’ll try to avoid addressing “fixable” problems (like theming) and instead focus on fundamental problems inherent in their design.
