For example, the loading of a proprietary module can make kernel debug output unreliable because kernel developers don't have access to the module's source code and therefore cannot determine what the module may have done to the kernel. Likewise, if the kernel had previously experienced an error condition or if a serious hardware error had occurred, the debug information generated by the kernel may not be reliable.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/install-fest-devil\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Install Fests - Free Software Foundation\">Install Fests - Free Software Foundation</a> &mdash; My new idea is that the install fest could allow the devil to hang around, off in a corner of the hall, or the next room.
