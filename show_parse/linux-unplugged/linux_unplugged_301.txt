If you recall, it was only towards the end of last year that they rolled out a new desktop installer and now with their latest design improvements, their latest installer looks much better off than their previous version. </li><li><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonevangelho/2019/05/13/its-time-to-pay-attention-to-intels-clear-linux-os-project/#5004b8885c49\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"It's Time To Pay Attention To Intel's Clear Linux OS Project\">It's Time To Pay Attention To Intel's Clear Linux OS Project</a> &mdash; This is neither a review nor an endorsement of Clear Linux at this stage, but it is an open invitation to be curious about it.
