Starting with QEMU 2.5.0 and libvirt 1.3.3, the vendor_id for the hypervisor can be spoofed, which is enough to fool the Nvidia drivers into loading anyway.</li><li><a href=\"https://passthroughpo.st/mac-os-adds-early-support-for-virtio-qemu/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Mac OS Adds Early Support for VirtIO, Qemu - The Passthrough POST\">Mac OS Adds Early Support for VirtIO, Qemu - The Passthrough POST</a> &mdash; In a new development uncovered by Qemu developer Gerd Hoffmann, Apple has apparently added early support for VirtIO and framebuffer graphics in a later Mac OS Mojave release.\n</li><li><a href=\"https://passthroughpo.st/new-and-improved-mac-os-tutorial-part-1-the-basics/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"New and Improved Mac OS Tutorial, Part 1 (The Basics) - The Passthrough POST\">New and Improved Mac OS Tutorial, Part 1 (The Basics) - The Passthrough POST</a> &mdash; Due to certain recent developments, It’s become clear to us that it’s necessary to update and improve our OSX VM guide.
