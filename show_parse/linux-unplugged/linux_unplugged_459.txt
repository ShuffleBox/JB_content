He intends to start the process toward mainline inclusion over the next six months or so.</li><li><a href=\"https://bcachefs.org/bcachefs-principles-of-operation.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Bcachefs Principles of Operation\">Bcachefs Principles of Operation</a></li><li><a href=\"https://tow-boot.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Tow-Boot\">Tow-Boot</a> &mdash; Tow-Boot a user-friendly, opinionated distribution of U-Boot, where there is as few differences in features possible between boards, and a \"familiar\" user interface for an early boot process tool.</li><li><a href=\"https://opensats.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"OpenSats\">OpenSats</a> &mdash; Support contributors to Bitcoin and other free and open source projects.</li><li><a href=\"https://briarproject.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Pick: Briar\">Pick: Briar</a> &mdash; Secure messaging, anywhere.</li></ul>", "published": "Sun, 22 May 2022 19:45:00 -0700", "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://linuxunplugged.com/459"}, {"length": "49163568", "type": "audio/mp3", "href": "https://aphid.fireside.fm/d/1437767933/f31a453c-fa15-491f-8618-3f71f1d565e5/4b4406a5-2759-4510-aa07-163e89e855a6.mp3", "rel": "enclosure"}], "episode": "459"}
