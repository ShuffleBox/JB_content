{"show": "Jupiter Extras", "ep_title": "A Chat with mergerfs Developer Antonio Musumeci", "summary": "<p>Alex, Drew from ChooseLinux, and Brent (of the Brunch fame) sit down with Antonio Musumeci, the developer of mergerfs during the JB sprint. It is a union filesystem geared towards simplifying storage and management of files across numerous commodity storage devices, it is similar to mhddfs, unionfs, and aufs.</p>\n\n<p>mergerfs makes JBOD (Just a Bunch Of Drives) appear like an ‘array’ of drives. mergerfs transparently translates read/write commands to the underlying drives from a single mount point, such as /mnt/storage. Point all your applications at /mnt/storage and forget about how the underlying storage is architected, mergerfs handles the rest transparently. Multiple mismatched size drives? No problem.</p><p>Special Guest: Antonio Musumeci.</p><p>Links:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://blog.linuxserver.io/2017/06/24/the-perfect-media-server-2017/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"The Perfect Media Server 2017\">The Perfect Media Server 2017</a></li><li><a href=\"https://zackreed.me/mergerfs-another-good-option-to-pool-your-snapraid-disks/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Mergerfs - another good option to pool your SnapRAID disks\">Mergerfs - another good option to pool your SnapRAID disks</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/trapexit/mergerfs\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"mergerfs: a featureful union filesystem\">mergerfs: a featureful union filesystem</a></li></ul>", "published": "Thu, 31 Oct 2019 11:00:00 -0700", "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://extras.show/28"}, {"length": "38179853", "type": "audio/mp3", "href": "https://aphid.fireside.fm/d/1437767933/56e6db0a-de62-46a7-b4db-e28d3fc3845a/41bb8124-7c56-4cd1-8b9f-8a996a5ded98.mp3", "rel": "enclosure"}], "episode": "28"}
